yogi berra , one of baseball s greatest catchers and characters , who as a player was a mainstay of 10 yankees championship teams and as a manager led both the yankees and the mets to the world series but who may be more widely known as an ungainly but lovable cultural figure , inspiring a cartoon character and issuing a seemingly limitless supply of unwittingly witty epigrams known as died on tuesday he was 90 the yankees and the yogi berra museum and learning center in little falls , nj , announced his death before moving to an assisted living facility in nearby west caldwell , in 2012 , berra had lived for many years in neighboring montclair in 1949 , early in berra s yankees career , his manager assessed him this way in an interview in the sporting news mr berra , casey stengel said , is a very strange fellow of very remarkable abilities and so he was , and so he proved to be universally known simply as yogi , probably the second most recognizable nickname in sports even yogi was not the babe berra was not exactly an unlikely hero , but he was often portrayed as one an allstar for 15 consecutive seasons whose skills were routinely underestimated a wellbuilt , appealingly openfaced man whose physical appearance was often belittled and a prolific winner , not to mention a successful leader , whose intellect was a target of humor if not outright derision that he triumphed on the diamond again and again in spite of his perceived shortcomings was certainly a source of his popularity so was the delight with which his famous , if not always documentable , pronouncements somehow both nonsensical and sagacious were received you can observe a lot just by watching , he is reputed to have declared once , describing his strategy as a manager if you ca n't imitate him , he advised a young player who was mimicking the batting stance of the great slugger frank robinson , do n't copy him when you come to a fork in the road , take it , he said , giving directions to his house either path , it turned out , got you there nobody goes there anymore , he said of a popular restaurant it s too crowded whether berra actually uttered the many things attributed to him , or was the first to say them , or phrased them precisely the way they were reported , has long been a matter of speculation berra himself published a book in 1998 called the yogi book i really did n't say everything i said ! but the yogiisms testified to a character goofy and philosophical , flighty and down to earth that came to define the man berra s yoginess was for myriad products , among them puss 'n boots cat food and miller lite beer but perhaps most famously yoohoo chocolate drink asked if yoohoo was hyphenated , he is said to have replied , no , ma'am , it is n't even carbonated if not exactly a yogiism , it was the kind of response that might have come from berra s ursine namesake , the affable animated character yogi bear , who made his debut in 1958 the character yogi berra may even have overshadowed the hall of fame ballplayer yogi berra , obscuring what a remarkable athlete he was a notorious badball hitter he swung at a lot of pitches that were not strikes but mashed them anyway he was fearsome in the clutch and the most durable and consistently productive yankee during the period of the team s most relentless success in addition , as a catcher , he played the most grueling position on the field \( for a respite from the chores and challenges of crouching behind the plate , berra , who played before the in the american league in 1973 , occasionally played the outfield \) stengel , a hall of fame manager whose shrewdness and talent were also often underestimated , recognized berra s gifts he referred to berra , even as a young player , as his assistant manager and compared him favorably to star catchers of previous eras like mickey cochrane , gabby hartnett and bill dickey you could look it up was stengel s catchphrase , and indeed the record book declares that berra was among the greatest catchers in the history of the game some say the greatest of all berra s career batting average , 285 , was not as high as that of his yankees predecessor , dickey \( 313 \) , but berra hit more home runs \( 358 in all \) and drove in more runs \( 1 , 430 \) praised by pitchers for his astute pitchcalling , berra led the american league in assists five times and from 1957 through 1959 went 148 consecutive games behind the plate without making an error , a major league record at the time he was not a defensive wizard from the start , though dickey , berra explained , learned me all his experience on defense , he certainly surpassed mike piazza , the besthitting catcher of recent vintage , and maybe ever on offense , berra and johnny bench , whose cincinnati reds teams of the 1970s were known as the big red machine , were comparable , except that bench struck out three times as often berra whiffed a mere 414 times in more than 8 , 300 plate appearances over 19 seasons an astonishingly small ratio for a power hitter others carlton fisk , gary carter and ivan rodriguez among them also deserve consideration in a discussion of great catchers , but none was clearly superior to berra on offense or defense only roy campanella , a contemporary rival who played for the brooklyn dodgers and faced berra in the world series six times before his career was ended by a car accident , equaled berra s total of three most valuable player awards and although berra did not win the award in 1950 his teammate phil rizzuto did he gave one of the greatest seasonlong performances by a catcher that year , hitting 322 , smacking 28 home runs and driving in 124 runs berra s career was punctuated by storied episodes in , against the dodgers , he hit the first pinchhit home run in series history , and in game 4 he was behind the plate for what was almost the first nohitter and was instead a stunning loss with two outs in the ninth inning and two men on base after walks , the yankees' starter , bill bevens , gave up a double to cookie lavagetto that cleared the bases and won the game in september 1951 , once again on the brink of a nohitter , this one by allie reynolds against the boston red sox , berra made one of baseball s famous errors with two outs in the ninth inning , ted williams hit a towering foul ball between home plate and the yankees' dugout it looked like the end of the game , which would seal reynolds s second nohitter of the season and make him the first american league pitcher to accomplish that feat but as the ball plummeted , it was caught in a gust of wind berra lunged backward , and it deflected off his glove as he went sprawling amazingly , on the next pitch , williams hit an almost identical popup , and this time berra caught it in the first game of the against the dodgers , the yankees were ahead , 64 , in the top of the eighth when the dodgers' the plate umpire , bill summers , called him safe , and berra went berserk , gesticulating in summers s face and creating one of the enduring images of an onthefield tantrum the yankees won the game although not the series it was the only time brooklyn got the better of berra s yankees but berra never forgot the moment more than 50 years later , he signed a photograph of the play for president obama , writing , dear mr president , he was out ! during the , again against the dodgers , berra was at the center of another indelible image , this one of sheer joy , when he leapt into the arms of don larsen , who had just struck out dale mitchell to end game 5 and complete the only perfect game \( and only nohitter \) in world series history when reporters gathered at berra s locker after the game , he greeted them mischievously so , he said , what s new \? beyond the historic moments and individual accomplishments , what most distinguished berra s career was how often he won from 1946 to 1985 , as a player , coach and manager , berra appeared in a remarkable 21 world series playing on powerful yankees teams with teammates like rizzuto and joe dimaggio early on and then whitey ford and mickey mantle , berra starred on world series winners in 1947 , '49 , '50 , '51 , '52 , '53 , '56 and '58 he was a backup catcher and parttime outfielder on the championship teams of 1961 and '62 \( he also played on world series losers in 1955 , '57 , '60 and '63 \) all told , his yankees teams won the american league pennant 14 out of 17 years he still holds series records for games played , plate appearances , hits and doubles no other player has been a champion so often lawrence peter berra was born on may 12 , 1925 , in the italian enclave of st louis known as the hill , which also fostered the baseball career of his boyhood friend joe garagiola berra was the fourth of five children his father , pietro , a construction worker and bricklayer , and his mother , paulina , were immigrants from malvaglio , a northern italian village near milan \( as an adult , on a visit to his ancestral home , berra took in a performance of tosca at la scala it was pretty good , he said even the music was nice \) as a boy , berra was known as larry , or lawdie , as his mother pronounced it as recounted in yogi berra eternal yankee , a 2009 biography by allen barra , one day in his early teens , young larry and some friends went to the movies and were watching a travelogue about india when a hindu yogi appeared on the screen sitting crosslegged his posture struck one of the friends as precisely the way berra sat on the ground as he waited his turn at bat from that day on , he was yogi berra an ardent athlete but an indifferent student , berra dropped out of school after the eighth grade he played american legion ball and worked odd jobs as teenagers , he and garagiola tried out with the st louis cardinals and were offered contracts by the cardinals' general manager , branch rickey but garagiola s came with a 500 signing bonus and berra s just 250 , so berra declined to sign \( this was a harbinger of deals to come berra , whose salary as a player reached 65 , 000 in 1961 , substantial for that era , proved to be a canny contract negotiator , almost always extracting concessions from the yankees' penurious general manager , george weiss \) in the meantime , the st louis browns they later moved to baltimore and became the orioles also wanted to sign berra but were not willing to pay any bonus at all then , the day after the , in which the cardinals beat the yankees , a yankees coach showed up at berra s parents' house and offered him a minor league contract along with the elusive 500 berra s professional baseball life began in virginia in 1943 with the norfolk tars of the class b piedmont league in 111 games he hit 253 and led the league s catchers in errors , but he reportedly once had 12 hits and drove in 23 runs over two consecutive games it was a promising start , but world war ii put his career on hold berra joined the navy he took part in the invasion of normandy and , two months later , in operation dragoon , an allied assault on marseilles in which he was bloodied by a bullet and earned a purple heart in 1946 , after his discharge , he was assigned to the newark bears , then the yankees' top farm team he played outfield and catcher and hit 314 with 15 home runs and 59 rbi in 77 games , although his fielding still lacked polish in one instance he hit an umpire with a throw from behind the plate meant for second base but the yankees still summoned him in september in his first big league game , he had two hits , including a home run as a yankee , berra became a fan favorite , partly because of his superior play he batted 305 and drove in 98 runs in 1948 , his second full season and partly because of his humility and guilelessness in 1947 , honored at sportsman s park in st louis , a nervous berra told the hometown crowd , i want to thank everyone for making this night necessary berra was a hit with sportswriters , too , although they often portrayed him as a baseball idiot savant , an apelike , barely literate devotee of comic books and movies who spoke fractured english so was born the yogi caricature , of the triumphant rube even today , life magazine wrote in july 1949 , he has only pity for people who clutter their brains with such unnecessary and frivolous matters as literature and the sciences , not to mention grammar and orthography collier s magazine declared , with a body that only an anthropologist could love , the 185pound berra could pass easily as a member of the neanderthal ac berra tended to take the gibes in stride if he was ugly , he was said to have remarked , it did not matter at the plate i never saw nobody hit one with his face , he was quoted as saying but when writers chided him about his girlfriend , carmen short , saying he was too unattractive to marry her , he responded , according to colliers , i'm human , ai n't i \? berra outlasted the ridicule he married short in 1949 , and the marriage endured until her death in 2014 he is survived by their three sons tim , who played professional football for the baltimore colts dale , a former infielder for the yankees , the pittsburgh pirates and the houston astros and lawrence jr as well as 11 grandchildren and a greatgrandson certainly , assessments of berra changed over the years he has continued to allow people to regard him as an amiable clown because it brings him quick acceptance , despite ample proof , on field and off , that he is intelligent , shrewd and opportunistic , robert lipsyte wrote in the new york times in october 1963 at the time , berra had just concluded his career as a yankees player , and the team had named him manager , a role in which he continued to find success , although not with the same regularity he enjoyed as a player and not without drama and disappointment indeed , things began badly the yankees , an aging team in 1964 , played listless ball through much of the summer , and in midaugust they lost four straight games in chicago to the firstplace white sox , leading to one of the kookier episodes of berra s career on the team bus to o'hare airport , the reserve infielder phil linz began playing mary had a little lamb on the harmonica berra , in a foul mood over the losing streak , told him to knock it off , but linz did not \( in another version of the story , linz asked mickey mantle what berra had said , and mantle responded , he said , play it louder' \) suddenly the harmonica went flying , having been either knocked out of linz s hands by berra or thrown at berra by linz \( players on the bus had different recollections \) news reports of the incident made it sound as if berra had lost control of the team , and although the yankees caught and passed the white sox in september , winning the pennant , ralph houk , the general manager , fired berra after the team lost a sevengame world series to st louis in a bizarre move , houk replaced him with the cardinals' manager , johnny keane keane s yankees finished sixth in 1965 berra , meanwhile , moved across town , taking a job as a coach for the famously awful mets under stengel , who was finishing his career in flushing the team continued its mythic floundering until 1969 , when the socalled miracle mets , with gil hodges as manager and berra coaching first base won the world series after hodges died , before the start of the 1972 season , berra replaced him that summer , berra was inducted into the hall of fame the mets team he inherited , however , faltered , finishing third , and for most of the 1973 season they were worse in midaugust , the mets were well under 500 and in sixth place when berra supposedly uttered perhaps the most famous yogiism of all it ai n't over till it s over , he said \( or words to that effect \) , and lo and behold , the mets got hot , squeaking by the cardinals to win the national league s eastern division title they then beat the reds in the league championship series before losing to the oakland athletics in the world series berra was rewarded for the resurgence with a threeyear contract , but the mets were dreadful in 1974 , finishing fifth , and the next year , on aug 6 , with the team in third place and having lost five straight games , berra was fired once again he switched leagues and city boroughs , returning to the bronx as a yankees coach , and in 1984 the owner , , named him to replace the volatile billy martin as manager the team finished third that year , but during spring training in 1985 , steinbrenner promised him that he would finish the season as yankees manager no matter what after just 16 games , however , the yankees were 610 , and the impatient and imperious steinbrenner fired berra anyway , bringing back martin perhaps worse than breaking his word , steinbrenner sent an underling to deliver the bad news the firing , which had an added sting because berra s son dale had recently joined the yankees , provoked one of baseball s legendary feuds , and for 14 years berra refused to set foot in yankee stadium , a period during which he coached four seasons for the houston astros in the meantime private donors helped establish the yogi berra museum and learning center on the new jersey campus of montclair state university , which awarded berra an honorary doctorate of humanities in 1996 a minor league ballpark , yogi berra stadium , opened there in 1998 the museum , a tribute to berra with exhibits on his career , runs programs for children dealing with baseball history in january 1999 , steinbrenner , who died in 2010 , went there to make amends i know i made a mistake by not letting you go personally , he told berra it s the worst mistake i ever made in baseball berra chose not to quibble with the semiapology to welcome him back into the yankees fold , the team held a yogi berra day on july 18 , 1999 also invited was larsen , who threw out the ceremonial first pitch , which berra caught incredibly , in the game that day , david cone of the yankees pitched a perfect game it was , as berra may or may not have said in another context , d j vu all over again , a fittingly climactic episode for a wondrous baseball life

london this week , in a tiny theater nestled above the old red lion pub here , the first play that ever wrote is having its world premiere the staging of the play , no villain , a nakedly autobiographical story that miller wrote in 1936 as a 20yearold sophomore at the university of michigan , was scheduled to open on thursday night , capping a banner year for the playwright in england in june , the director james dacre staged the hook , a 1950 miller screenplay that never made it to the screen , at the royal derngate theater in northampton a production of a view from the bridge that originated at the young vic in london swept this year s olivier awards and is running to critical acclaim on broadway in october , the bbc aired a slate of miller documentaries , radio plays and dramas based on his life to celebrate the centenary of his birth on oct 17 , 1915 that he should come in for special attention in britain is little surprise , miller scholars say his reputation here in many ways outstrips that in his home country joshua polster , a professor of theater studies at emerson college in boston , said that miller s reception in the united states suffered from his leftwing politics , as well as lingering distaste for after the fall , in which , in slightly disguised form , he dramatized his illfated marriage to marilyn monroe the uk has always been very embracing of miller , and you see that now , mr polster said , noting that there was a greater appetite for politically tinged theater in britain in the 1980s and 1990s , as miller s new work struggled to find a foothold in new york , it gained traction at london s leading , notforprofit theaters several plays , like elegy for a lady and the archbishop s ceiling , had tepid regional productions before getting robust london runs at the statesubsidized companies that embraced his work the young vic , the national theater and the royal shakespeare company in particular because of the publicity from miller s politics and personal life , mr polster said , his plays never really had the opportunity to breathe in the united states in the uk , there was a little bit more space for that sean turner , the 29yearold director staging no villain , first learned of the play about 18 months ago when he ran across a reference to it in miller s autobiography , timebends he requested the script from the university of michigan , which had given miller an award for the threeact play when it was written after reading the script , he asked the arthur miller dramatic and literary trust , which controls the rights to his works , for permission to stage the production the foundation agreed , somewhat to his surprise patrick herold , the head of the theater department at the literary agency icm partners and the agent for the miller trust , said in an email that the trust had approved staging the play because it seemed a fitting part of the centenary celebrations no villain follows the simons , a jewish family living in brooklyn during the depression it turns on the conflict between the family patriarch , abe , who owns a coat and suit factory , and his son arnold , who returns from a year at the university of michigan , inflamed by the leftist politics he has encountered there tensions erupt over abe s business , which has fallen on hard times , and a garment industry strike some experts have questioned whether miller would have wanted the play staged at all mr polster argued in his book stages of engagement us theatre and performance 18981949 , published last month , that miller reworked no villain several times and that the final product was in fact death of a salesman this is why he always turned down offers to produce no villain , ' mr polster said in a phone interview he saw it as an example of trial and error he was not necessarily against the idea of staging no villian , he said , but it was important to contextualize it properly as a student work , or it could shift how we understand miller if we had all of a sudden no villain' in an anthology of miller s collection , that does change his signification , he said i think that s why he did n't want it done in his lifetime christopher bigsby , the director of the arthur miller center for american studies at the university of east anglia who has written a biography of miller , said that he and the playwright had had a conversation in which miller said he decided not to publish no villain because he did not want people to consider the play as the beginning of his career mr bigsby , too , said he was not opposed to the staging of no villain , and on an invitation from the production team at the old red lion , he visited rehearsals this fall to offer background and context it s a kind of a curiosity , he said of the play , saying its merits were chiefly scholarly it s not going to damage miller s reputation miller s reputation is absolutely secure it s just intriguing he added it s interesting it s being put on in a tiny pub theater had it been produced at all at the time , it would have been produced in a tiny , small theater in michigan among the cast of no villain at the old red lion are nesba crenshaw , an american who plays esther , the matriarch , and kenneth jay , a canadian who plays esther s father , grandfather barnett both have lived in england for decades in a joint interview at the theater , ms crenshaw and mr jay considered miller s appeal to british actors and audiences there s none of the do n't make a scene , stiff upper lip' thing at all , ms crenshaw said of his plays mr jay added he came into a very industrialized america where it was every man for himself and you had to stand up for yourself and shout , literally americans tend to just live their hearts on their sleeves more go away , do n't bother me , ' he said , imitating an on the waterfrontstyle dockworker whereas here you might just get a sidewise look in the last decades of miller s life , his career soared in britain even as it foundered in the united states broken glass from 1994 , for example , ran for only two months on broadway after tepid reviews the london production , meanwhile , won the olivier award for best play of the year that same year his career would have been different in america if he had had a theater , mr bigsby said he had hoped lincoln center would be that , but it did n't work out the repertory theater of lincoln center produced after the fall in 1964 reviews were , by and large , disastrous but , of course , he did have a theater , mr bigsby said it was in this country , and it was the national theater , the royal shakespeare company , the young vic , the bristol old vic it was the british subsidized theater that really fell for him
philadelphia none of the traditional motivational ploys the guest speakers and the playoff beards had worked in the past , so coach bill tierney cut it out , all of it no speakers , no beards this was denver s agnostic approach to its fourth trip to the ncaa men s lacrosse final four in five seasons the focus remained on the team , the task at hand and a game plan that tierney believed could finally get him into a national title game with the pioneers , a first for a program he had essentially renovated from the studs after arriving six years ago and suddenly , it was crumbling before his eyes a fourgoal lead , with four minutes remaining , had disappeared the notre dame attack had morphed into something relentless , and now the miserable , sinking thought had begun to make its familiar way through tierney s wearied mind not again you 're kind of bewildered a little bit , tierney , 62 , said his rescue arrived in overtime , on a broken play , in which the ball was supposed to have been in zach miller s hands but wound up with wesley berg , who found a way to make it work he created an opening , whistled off a shot and flung his stick high into the sky after seeing the ball pass into the net tierney punched at the air , shaking the final four monkey off his back with denver s 1110 overtime win over topseeded notre dame at lincoln financial field on saturday afternoon , he has a chance at his first title since 2001 , when he won the last of his six championships as the coach at princeton he had reshaped the horizon of division i lacrosse with his ambitious move to denver in 2009 , transforming a program that had never won an ncaa tournament game into one of the sport s indisputable powerhouses he sent the message that it was possible to succeed in lacrosse in the west , out on the fringes , despite the game s traditionally eastern magnetism but until saturday , there was a lid on his breakthrough success at denver , and an echelon he had repeatedly missed he still sought the chance , just the chance , to play one game for the national title i think a lot was made out of this , tierney said of his three previous final four appearances , adding sardonically , we were a bad program because we did n't make it until monday but , tierney said , it s certainly a little relieving denver will face no 6seeded maryland , which outlasted johns hopkins , 1211 , in a thrilling second semifinal game hopkins scored five consecutive goals to tie the game at 1010 early in the fourth quarter then , with johns hopkins trailing by 1 , maryland s kyle bernlohr saved joel tinney s shot with the butt end of his stick , protecting the win the first game took its time developing , with both teams playing a lethargic brand of lacrosse the pioneers were leading by 54 in the waning seconds of the third quarter when denver s goalie , ryan laplante , made a high save and fired quickly to mike riis , a senior longstick midfielder who was streaking up the center of the field riis met little resistance as he carried the ball into the irish zone , flung himself forward from about 10 feet out and scored with 09 of a second remaining in the period it was an energizing play for denver , which rattled off three more scores to pull ahead by 95 with 5 minutes 29 seconds left a minute later , berg made a play that needed to be viewed in slow motion to appreciate , flinging a shot over his left shoulder , behind his back and between the goalie s legs to give denver the 106 advantage i lost my balance there , and i thought , just try to get it on net , berg said there was 4 23 left , but rather than savor a lead that would seemingly put them in their first championship game , the pioneers were desperately figuring out how to preserve it sergio perkovic a sophomore midfielder who , at 6 feet 4 inches , is hard to lose on a lacrosse field unleashed a torrent of offense , scoring five goals in six minutes , including three in a row to bring the irish to within 1 , at 109 , with two minutes remaining perkovic is an animal , tierney said after denver turned the ball over , notre dame set up a final play with 228 seconds left the defense keyed on perkovic , conor doyle and matt kavanagh , and so the ball found nick ossello , who forced a matchup with a shortstick defender , christian thomas , and beat him to the right he found space and tied the game with nine seconds remaining it s tough , letting four goals in as a defense in four minutes , goalie laplante said they had the complete momentum going into overtime but momentum , in lacrosse , is only as good as the next faceoff denver s trevor baptiste won one for the 15th time in 24 chances , and while notre dame had an opportunity after forcing a turnover , the irish wound up giving the ball right back berg and the pioneers focused on one idea not again
terrorism is increasing according to the global terrorism database at the university of maryland , groups connected with al qaeda and the islamic state committed close to 200 attacks per year between 2007 and 2010 , a number that grew by more than 200 percent , to about 600 attacks , in 2013 since 9 11 , the study of terrorism has also increased now , you might think that more study would lead to more effective antiterrorism policies and thus to less terrorism but on the face of it , this does not seem to be happening what has gone wrong \? the answer is that we have not been conducting the right kind of studies according to a 2008 review of terrorism literature in the journal , only 3 percent of articles from peerreviewed sources appeared to be rooted in empirical analysis , and in general there was an almost complete absence of evaluation research concerning antiterrorism strategies the situation cries out for the techniques of prevention science for a given problem \( like terrorism \) , prevention science identifies key risk factors \( like alienation \) , develops interventions to modify those risk factors \( like programs to promote positive relations with the dominant culture \) and tests those interventions through randomized trials using this methodology , scientists have identified interventions that effectively prevent problems as diverse as antisocial behavior , depression , schizophrenia , cigarette smoking , alcohol and drug abuse , academic failure , teenage pregnancy , marital discord and poverty jon baron , who leads the , which advocates for the use of randomized trials to evaluate government programs , reports that his organization has been able to identify only two experimental evaluations of antiterrorism strategies one of them , , randomly assigned 500 afghan villages to receive a development aid program either in 2007 or after 2011 the aid program had significant positive effects on economic outcomes , villagers' attitudes toward the government and villagers' perceptions of security the aid program also reduced the number of security incidents , though that effect was not maintained after the program ended and was observed only in villages that were relatively secure before the program began thus the study found an unequivocal but limited benefit of an aid program in reducing insurgent violence i say unequivocal because randomizing villages to receive or not receive the aid made it extremely unlikely that differences in attitudes and security resulted from anything other than the aid program itself the second study was the researchers randomly assigned neighborhoods and villages in nigeria to have , or not have , a campaign to reduce preelection violence the campaign made use of town meetings , theater and housetohouse distribution of material the study found that the campaign increased empowerment to counteract violence and voter turnout , and reduced both perceptions of violence and the intensity of violence imagine how much more we would know about the prevention of terrorism if even a small proportion of the hundreds of antiterrorism efforts implemented worldwide in the past 15 years had been properly evaluated as it is , we can say almost nothing about their efficacy do we know whether drones are increasing or decreasing the rate of terrorists' attacks \? whether our current surveillance activities are thwarting more terrorists than they are radicalizing young people \? in 2012 , the national institute of justice \( the research arm of the department of justice \) began a program to study domestic radicalization over the first three years it has funded nearly 9 million in research while the studies underway will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of the risk factors that contribute to radicalization , none of the projects funded thus far are adequately evaluating a strategy to prevent radicalization one of the projects , for example , is an effort to increase awareness of risk factors for radicalization as well as civicminded responses to them among members of the muslim community the program s impact will be assessed by comparing outcomes for those who never participate , those who participate once and those who participate multiple times if the project finds that those who participated multiple times were less radicalized than those who never participated , you might be inclined to conclude that the program is working but experience from evaluation research over many years has taught us that such a difference could just as likely be because those who were less inclined to become radical were more likely to participate the only way to really be confident that it is the program that is making the difference is to randomly assign some people to get it and others not that way any differences are very unlikely to be caused by preexisting differences between the two groups estimates of the cost of the war on terror have varied between one and five trillion dollars surely we can invest a tiny fraction of that in improving our antiterrorism strategies through rigorous experimental evaluations
when tracey durning first met her dog , fred , in an animal shelter in new york city in 1995 , he looked underfed and was shaking uncontrollably a fiveyearold terrier mix with wiry hair , fred had been given up by his previous family durning adopted him , set him up in a warm bed , smothered him with affection , and fed him well the transformation was amazing , she said a delightful personality emerged and fred soon became a wellliked figure in soho , greeted by gallery owners , waiters and doormen as he walked down the streets upon meeting fred , the stigma of damaged shelter animals which is still prevalent today , but was even worse then was totally obliterated , said durning he was everything you d want in a dog and more she added he was also a big reason that many people i knew decided to adopt instead of buy their dogs after fred died in 2010 , durning , a social entrepreneur , wanted to do something to honor his memory she started looking into the plight of shelter animals , a national problem each year , close to three million dogs and cats are killed in shelters in some cities more than 70 percent of the animals in shelters are euthanized often they are killed simply for lack of space , or because the stressful or unclean conditions inside shelters make them sick as she surveyed the animal welfare landscape , durning found something interesting some places around the country were far more humane to animals than others it wasn t because they were spending a lot more money they were doing smarter things for example , during the 1990s , new hampshire cut its shelter euthanasia rates by 75 percent statewide today , the state saves 90 percent of the animals that enter its shelters how did it happen \? durning reached out to peter marsh , a lawyer and animal advocate , who was credited with leading the key reform a publiclyfunded spay and neuter program with a focus on lowincome communities marsh then put her in touch with rick ducharme from jacksonville , fla , the founder of first coast no more homeless pets , an animal welfare organization that runs one of the country s largest spay and neuter clinics in 2008 , ducharme had teamed up with scott trebatoski , then jacksonville s chief for animal care and protective services , to institute a radical model for managing freeroaming cats at the city level the idea was counterintuitive when a freeroaming cat was brought into the shelter , if it had a decent body weight \( meaning it had a food source \) it was immediately spayed or neutered and returned to where it was found the approach flew in the face of traditional animal control practices \( most freeroaming cats in shelters are euthanized \) but it proved highly successful in five years , jacksonville s shelter went from saving less than 30 percent of its animals to saving 90 percent , including many more dogs than before \( because shelter staff now had time to focus on their care and adoption \) moreover , public complaints about cats also plummeted because it turned out most of the annoying behaviors associated with cats disappear after they are sterilized after that , the idea began to spread , but slowly the approach was adopted in san jose , calif , where , over four years , the city went from saving 30 percent of the cats in its shelter to saving 86 percent of them , said jon cicirelli , the city s director of animal care and services these successes inspired two leaders in animal shelter medicine , julie levy , at the university of florida , and kate hurley , at the university of california , davis , to start an initiative called the million cat challenge to accelerate efforts to save cats lives \( to date , some 300 public shelters have signed on and , collectively , they report that they euthanized 369 , 000 fewer cats in 2015 than in 2012 \) it s been an aha moment for our profession , said hurley , who has worked as an animal control officer and shelter veterinarian when my mind shifted around this , i had to put my head down and cry for all the cats i had euthanized with the best of intentions i thought i was doing the right thing durning had a question if these approaches were saving the lives of so many animals , why wasn t everyone using them \? the answer somebody needed to identify the best practices , assemble them in an easytounderstand program , and set out to deliver them systematically to where they were most needed so she raised funding and , in 2013 , launched an initiative called target zero to do just that marsh agreed to lend his wisdom she enlisted ducharme and sara pizano , a veterinarian with 25 years experience , to design that program the goal was to make it possible for cities to get to zero kill a shelter standard that means a live release rate of 90 percent or better \( they call it the pyramid program , because each reform serves as a foundation for others \) target zero provides free mentoring \( up to three years duration \) and currently has ten fellow cities including indianapolis , nashville , el paso , and baton rouge , la , where leaders from animal shelter and welfare agencies , as well as rescue groups and clinics , have agreed to collaborate and commit to the goal of being a zero kill city within three years one of the places that has made big gains is huntsville , ala karen sheppard , the director of animal services for huntsville , recalled that , a few years back , she would often go home after work and burst into tears a veterinarian and animal lover , sheppard oversaw the public shelter , and when it became overcrowded , it fell on her to euthanize the cats and dogs for which homes could not be found it hurt a lot , she said these days , sheppard s work rarely gives her cause to cry in fact , it s just the opposite she finds it thrilling over the past 18 months the live release rate for the huntsville shelter has climbed from 70 percent to over 90 percent to get to the place where we re saving more than 90 percent , it s like getting to the moon , sheppard said i can t believe it i m so proud of my staff i just said to one of my coworkers yesterday , you did it ! , and she said , we did it ! it s just exhilarating another fellow city is waco , tex , which is on pace to save nearly 90 percent of the animals in its public shelter this year this is a remarkable change as recently as 2012 , waco was killing almost twothirds of its shelter animals in 2012 , it euthanized close to 6 , 000 dogs and cats this year the figure will be around 900 it was deplorable , recalled malcolm duncan , jr , waco s mayor , who has led the reforms along with the assistant city manager , wiley stem people were showing up at city council meetings lining the walls just to tell us how atrocious things were when target zero s team begins working in a community , they spend time building relationships and getting people inspired by showing them what s possible they work with locals to organize a town hall meeting to build enthusiasm and agreement a lot of people say , we re doing as much as we can do we re drowning , said target zero s program manager cameron moore , who had previously worked with rick ducharme in jacksonville \( and has herself created a nonprofit , lucky cat adoptions , that has arranged 4 , 500 cat adoptions \) we come in and help them understand how they can accomplish it that s what happened in waco and huntsville duncan recalled they gave us a tremendous amount of confidence that what we were doing could work it was going to take some money and getting people to join in but it was a pretty tried and true outcome if you followed the recommendations sheppard agreed they sit down and look at your population and poverty rate , the number of animals coming into the shelter , how many people you have and how many kennels , and come out with what you have to do it s not magic it will happen target zero has found that cities typically have similar needs many have to improve their data collection processes \( the organization shelter animals count is a useful resource \) some need assistance drafting ordinances others need help improving their shelter management almost everyone can do better simply by collaborating with other organizations the keys to saving animals are reducing the intake into shelters and getting them out as quickly as possible the two biggest levers are subsidized spay and neuter programs and community cat diversion programs like the one pioneered in jacksonville \( it s crucial to sterilize pets as soon as possible many people don t realize that sterilizing a pet before it is sexually active typically before seven months of age dramatically reduces the risks for cancer in both males and females \) a range of other practices can keep animals out of shelters or move them out quickly but often it means rethinking longstanding assumptions we make it very easy for people to leave animals in shelters , said pizano but we impose all these barriers to get them out alive for instance , when an animal owner comes into a shelter to surrender a pet , it s rarely a light decision often , it s a matter of economics sometimes people can t afford veterinary care or to pay for pet food you re surrendering your pet and you re sobbing , said pizano why don t we ask how can we help you \? when shelters reach out to animal welfare organizations for assistance , they get it ! in jacksonville , after trebatoski s team began doing this , they found they were able to help a third of the people who came in to surrender pets retain them and the reason they were able to focus on this was because they weren t spending all their time euthanizing cats it s just the opposite when people want to take an animal home to adopt a pet from a shelter , you may need to furnish a letter from your landlord , have your home inspected , and pay a high fee rules exist to protect animals in practice , they end up slowing adoptions and increasing the numbers of animals euthanized we re worried about 2 percent of the population who are bad pet owners and making the other 98 percent suffer because we want to make sure none of the animals make it to the 2 percent , said trebatoski , who is now chief of the animal shelter that serves tampa , fla \( the humane society of the united states has published a manual called adopters welcome which outlines steps to simplify animal adoption \) saving animals comes down to details like these solutions exist and initiatives like target zero are demonstrating that they can be adopted in communities with widely different characteristics the challenge is to overcome inertia and change habits a lot of communities have been putting down a lot of animals for a long time , said marsh the conventional wisdom is sort of like the poor will always be with us we ll always be putting down healthy cats and dogs it s just a disposable society there are cultural and socioeconomic issues that shelters can t overcome but jacksonville went from putting down 23 , 000 animals in 2000 to less than 1 , 000 now when people hear that , they start to think , this can be done and they start to ask how did it happen \? shelter directors love animals , adds durning they don t want to kill them this problem is fixable why are we not doing it in every city \? join and follow updates on to

baltimore of boardedup rowhouses , furtive alleyway heroin deals and cutrate corner stores where cheap booze is sold from behind bulletproof glass , the jagged baltimore of hbo s the wire the unrest thrust those two baltimores together , forcing painful conversations about the city s racial divide but in a city where blacks outnumber whites two to one , it has also been a reminder that black leadership , exemplified by ms rawlingsblake , is not a guarantee that government can manage toxic collisions of race and policing any better than white leadership has in places like ferguson , mo at

distant and ineffectual so on a friday morning in early september a few days after she infuriated many here by announcing a 64 million settlement with the family of mr gray the mayor effectively became a casualty of the unrest herself with a crowded field of challengers looking to unseat her , she said she would to focus on the city s future , and not my own across baltimore , there is relief

said acidly , she just bought riot insurance everyone is hoping for a way forward , but no one seems to agree on just what that is the city is crying out , said ebony harvin , a hotel manager and assistant pastor of the new solid rock pentecostal church in pigtown , once the city s meatpacking district we are hoping for a better baltimore , but it starts with leadership if you 're trying to

percent in 2013 , the most recent year for which the justice department has statistics in response , the rawlingsblake administration has created a war room a controversial term here , given tensions

sidewalk ceremony was brief , just 10 minutes , enough time for mourners to light candles , observe a moment of silence to remember the slain man , and shout his name to the heavens mr west could not

breaking my heart on a rainy summer night , ms hawks could be found in a cavernous auditorium , filled with mostly white residents who had come to unload their grievances on ms rawlingsblake , at a community forum on crime , one of a series that the mayor has convened one woman complained about blatantly open drug deals and prostitution in her neighborhood , saying she no longer felt safe , even during the day a man said that when he walks outside at 10 30 at night , and i do n't see a single police person , it freaks me out then ms hawks stood up , and burst into tears i love this city , i love it with all my heart , but i cry every day driving to work , and i cry every day driving home , she said through sobs the lawless are becoming a protected class , and hardworking people are losing everything , she went on , pleading with ms rawlingsblake to get on the national media and turn baltimore s decimated reputation around while investment is booming in some parts of baltimore ,

remembered former mayor , who revitalized a decaying baltimore in the 1970s and 1980s , after the last riots when residents and businesses fled but most voters said they knew baltimore s most

the lush , wooded campus of johns hopkins university , which sprawls over 128 acres north of downtown , ronald j daniels , the university s president , is also struggling with what comes next on a

' said tessa hillaston , the president of the baltimore chapter of the naacp , who also attended the johns hopkins reception there s not a corporate board meeting where freddie gray s name does n't come out of everyone s mouth to mr hickman , these are hopeful signs but as he looked around mr daniels s elegantly appointed living room that evening just hours after a judge had set nov 30 as the date for the first of the six trials in mr gray s death he also felt a sense of unease as he contemplated the murky path forward the city is definitely on hold , the pastor said we 're on pause , ' waiting to press play'
sometimes you almost have to feel sorry for mitt romney he has one great achievement in life the massachusetts health reform , which acted as a template for the affordable care act if he were a member of a sane political party , he d be boasting about that record but he wanted to be president , which meant having to accommodate himself to his party and in iowa , 81 percent of republicans say that ben carson s statement that obamacare is the worst thing since slavery makes him more attractive as a candidate so he has to trash the best thing he s done sometimes , it turns out , he can t maintain the facade the other day he took credit for setting the stage for obamacare then he tried desperately to walk it back , claiming that obamacare has failed which is literally and figuratively the party line which raises the question , if this is a failure , what would policy success look like \? obamacare has led to a rapid drop in the number of uninsured , especially in states that have fully implemented its provisions it hasn t covered everyone , but it wasn t expected to it doesn t cover undocumented immigrants , and the relative complexity of the program always meant that some eligible people would fall through the cracks the original cbo estimates were that eventually 92 percent of nonelderly residents would have coverage , and in medicaid expansion states we re getting there meanwhile , the whole thing has come in well below projected costs insurance premiums will rise for 2016 , but after two years of remarkably small rises that still leaves things cheaper than expected and overall health care spending has come in far below expectations none of the other terrible things that were supposed to happen job loss , destruction of fulltime employment , a surge in the budget deficit have happened either but to be a good republican you have to insist that it has been a disaster and mitt romney is therefore in the position of trashing his own life s work sad but he has nobody but himself to blame
washington anyone who has tried to pry information from the federal government may have been surprised on tuesday by s assertion that in all her emails in four years as secretary of state , she never strayed into the classified realm after all , a consensus among republicans and democrats for many years has been that the government routinely overclassifies information , reflexively stamping secret on mountains of documents with marginally sensitive content the government classified more than 80 million documents in 2013 , according to the , which publishes an annual count i did not email any classified material to anyone on my email , mrs clinton said at a at the united nations i'm certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material but some secrecy experts and former government officials on tuesday were skeptical , noting the interesting turnabout that had a former top official insisting , for once , that none of her exchanges were secret as a longtime critic of the government s massive overclassification , i thought it was a refreshing touch that the secretary of state conducted all her email in unclassified form , said thomas s blanton , the director of the national security archive at george washington university he spoke with a hint of sarcasm his nonprofit organization has battled the government for decades to overcome classification claims and try to make important official documents public mrs clinton insisted that she kept classified information out of her email , as the law required storing classified information in a personal , nongovernment email account on a private computer server , like the one at mrs clinton s home , would be a violation of secrecy laws and relations with other countries are particularly subject to secrecy claims foreign government information information received from another government with the expectation that it will be held in confidence is an official category of classified information in secrecy regulations a former senior state department official who served before the obama administration said that although it was hard to be certain , it seemed unlikely that classified information could be kept out of the more than 30 , 000 emails that mrs clinton s staff identified as involving government business i would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified , said the former official , who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to seem ungracious to mrs clinton was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified \? maybe , but it s hard to imagine steven aftergood , who directs the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists , said he suspected that if there had been no fuss and a researcher or journalist had sought all of mrs clinton s emails under the freedom of information act , the answer might have been different it would have been a real surprise if none of it was withheld on the grounds of classification , mr aftergood said to start with , he said , they 'd have to say there s no foreign government information' in the chief diplomat s email but mr aftergood also noted that as secretary of state , mrs clinton was the top classification authority for the entire state department , with broad discretion to determine which department documents were classified and which were not there s zero chance that she 'll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information , because she decides what s classified , he said clinton aides pointed out other factors that reduced the need to use the personal email account for sensitive matters as secretary of state , mrs clinton was almost always accompanied by one or more aides with secure government blackberrys , laptops or other devices that could be used to send classified material at her direction classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office , according to a statement from her office tuesday while on travel , the department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types her office said that while serving as secretary , ms clinton communicated with foreign officials in person , through correspondence and by telephone her staff s review of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign official , one from the united kingdom , the statement said it is rare but not unheardof for a government official to be punished for storing classified information on a personal device john m deutch , a former cia director , was pardoned by president bill clinton in 2001 , sparing him a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge for keeping classified information on personal , nongovernment computers mr deutch had already been stripped of his security clearance more recently , a marine corps board of inquiry recommended that a reservist , maj jason brezler , be dismissed from the corps with an honorable separation for mishandling classified information kevin carroll , his lawyer , said that major brezler , 35 , a new york city firefighter and a combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan , accidentally took home 14 documents on his personal computer , some of which were classified he was in a graduate school class when he received an urgent email from military officials in afghanistan and sent a specific document in response , using his personal email account , mr carroll said the document was classified , and that led to an internal review , the lawyer said major brezler has sued to challenge the separation recommendation , which goes to the marine corps commandant and then to the secretary of the navy the case is pending in federal court in brooklyn
washington and prime minister of offered radically divergent approaches to the perils of a nucleararmed on monday even as they tried to cool down the personal nature of a longdistance dispute that has inflamed relations between the united states and israel for more than a month on the eve of mr netanyahu s hotly debated address to congress , the two leaders separately disclaimed personal animosity while laying out what amounts to the biggest policy schism between the two countries in years mr obama defended his diplomatic efforts to negotiate a deal with iran while mr netanyahu presented them as dangerously na ve i have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there is still time to avert them , mr netanyahu told thousands of israel supporters in washington for 2 , 000 years , my people , the jewish people , were stateless , defenseless , voiceless he added today , we are no longer silent today , we have a voice and tomorrow , as prime minister of the one and only jewish state , i plan to use that voice a few hours later , mr obama said that he and mr netanyahu had a substantial disagreement over how to prevent iran from obtaining but he suggested that mr netanyahu was an alarmist , saying that the israeli leader had been unduly skeptical of a preliminary accord intended to slow the iranian during negotiations aimed at a longerterm resolution netanyahu made all sorts of claims this was going to be a terrible deal , this was going to result in iran getting 50 billion worth of relief , iran would not abide by the agreement , mr obama told the reuters news agency none of that has come true mr obama said that any deal would have to ensure that iran was not capable of building a nuclear weapon in less than a year , and that the agreement must stand for at least 10 years if they do agree to it , he said , it would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take , any military action israel could take , and far more effective than sanctions will be mr netanyahu s trip to washington , coming just two weeks before israeli elections and three weeks before a deadline in the iran talks , has polarized politicians in both countries the prime minister s speech to a joint meeting of congress on tuesday arranged by speaker without consulting the white house immediately took on a partisan flavor , and mr obama refused to meet with mr netanyahu because his visit comes so close to the israeli elections vice president joseph r biden jr and more than 50 democratic lawmakers plan to skip mr netanyahu s speech while the white house has not publicly encouraged a boycott , it sent an email late monday inviting house democratic aides to a trade meeting at the white house on tuesday at a time that would make it hard for them to attend the speech advocates on both sides have published incendiary newspaper ads in recent days , including one attacking , the president s national security adviser the president expressed grievance about the speaking invitation , which the white house has interpreted as a way of bashing mr obama and undercutting the iran talks in the reuters interview , mr obama said it would be as if democrats in congress invited the french president to speak after opposing president george w bush s invasion of iraq i guarantee you that some of the same commentators who are cheerleading now would have suggested that it was the wrong thing to do , he said but the president and his team also seemed intent on tamping down the intensity of the dispute secretary of state , in geneva for more talks with iran , made a point of defending israel before the united nations human rights council on monday and mr obama sent ms rice and , his ambassador to the united nations , to address the conference in washington this is not a personal issue , mr obama said i think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the united states to recognize that the us has a process of making policy even though ms rice said last week that the issue could be destructive to bipartisan support of israel , mr obama said monday that it was a distraction and would not be permanently destructive mr netanyahu , appearing before an estimated 16 , 000 supporters of israel at the aipac conference , characterized the disagreement over iran as a family fight that would ultimately be overcome , and he expressed gratitude to mr obama for his support of israel over the years my speech is not intended to show any disrespect to president obama or the esteemed office that he holds , mr netanyahu told the crowd , which greeted him with standing ovations i have great respect for both he said he was sorry if anyone interpreted his visit as a political shot at mr obama the last thing anyone who cares about israel , the last thing that i would want , is for israel to become a partisan issue , he said , and i regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that israel has always been a bipartisan issue israel should always remain a bipartisan issue but he emphasized that the threat of a nucleararmed iran looked different from jerusalem than it does from washington american leaders worry about the security of their country , mr netanyahu said israeli leaders worry about the survival of their country some supporters said they hoped mr netanyahu s measured language might defuse some of the anger of recent weeks i think he did well and lowered the temperature , said abraham h foxman , the national director of the antidefamation league , who had called on mr netanyahu to cancel the speech because of the fallout he could have pepped them up he did not it was an important message opponents of mr netanyahu said he had done lasting harm i'm here to do damage control , said erel margalit , a labor member of parliament who attended the aipac conference i'm here to say we , too , are very concerned about iran

beirut , lebanon the syrian army has suffered a string of defeats from reenergized insurgents and is struggling to replenish its ranks as even progovernment families increasingly refuse to send sons to poorly defended units on the front lines these developments raise newly urgent questions about the durability of president bashar alassad s rule the trend lines for assad are bad and getting worse , said a senior united states official in washington , who , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments , nevertheless cautioned that things had not yet reached a boiling point the erosion of the army is forcing the government to rely ever more heavily on syrian and foreign militias , especially hezbollah , the lebanese shiite group allied with iran hezbollah now leads or even directs the fight in many places , angering some syrian officers , said several syrian soldiers , as well as the senior united states official and a syrian with close ties to the security establishment most syrians interviewed asked that their names be fully or partially withheld to avoid reprisals this month , government forces have crumbled or fled in areas long cited by officials as markers of enduring state control insurgents seized idlib , a northern provincial capital , and the lone working border crossing with jordan in the south counteroffensives failed , and advances this week have brought a newly cohesive insurgent coalition closer than ever to mr assad s coastal strongholds the coalition consists mainly of islamist groups that include qaeda s syrian affiliate , the nusra front , but oppose the islamic state throughout the country , there are signs of strain that contrast with mr assad s public confidence the government recently dismissed the heads of two of its four main intelligence agencies after they quarreled one later died , reportedly after being beaten by the other s guards officials in provincial capitals like aleppo and dara'a are making contingency plans to preserve cash and antiquities and evacuate civilians foreign exchange reserves , 30 billion at the start of the war , have dwindled to 1 billion the alreadycrowded coastal provinces are straining with new arrivals from idlib , with some saying officials have turned them away in central damascus , checkpoints are fewer and more sparsely staffed , as militiamen are sent to fight on the outskirts , and young men increasingly evade army service even in areas populated by minority sects that fear hardline islamist groups like nusra and the islamic state such as druse in the south , assyrian christians in the north , and ismailis in hama numerous residents say they are sending their sons abroad to avoid the draft , or keeping them home to protect villages that has accelerated the transformation of syria s oncecentralized armed forces into something beginning to resemble that of the insurgents a patchwork of local and foreign fighters whose interests and priorities do not always align four years ago , syria s army had 250 , 000 soldiers now , because of casualties and desertions , it has 125 , 000 regulars , alongside 125 , 000 progovernment militia members , including iraniantrained iraqis , pakistanis and afghan hazaras , according to the senior american official in washington and syrians are not always in charge , especially where hezbollah , the best trained and equipped of the foreign militias , is involved every area where there is hezbollah , the command is in their hands , said the syrian with security connections you do something , you have to ask their permission that , he said , rankled senior security officials who recalled the rule of mr assad s father , hafez , in the 1980s , when hezbollah s patron iran was the junior partner in the alliance with syria american officials are exploring how to exploit resulting tensions between syrian and hezbollah commanders , said the senior american official an official in the region sympathetic to hezbollah said that enemies were trying to exploit natural tensions that happen between allies , and between brothers and sisters in the same house , but would not succeed even if hezbollah does battle alone , it is with syrian approval , said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations hezbollah is only a stone that helps the builder but others see a loss of syrian sovereignty to iran , which needs syria as a conduit to arm hezbollah charles lister , a syria expert at the brookings doha center in doha , qatar , said iran with the help of hezbollah and other militias is building a state within a state in syria an insurance policy to protect itself against any future assad demise ali , 23 , a soldier on leave in damascus from the southern front , said one of his officers , a major , had complained that any hezbollah fighter was more important than a syrian general then there is simple jealousy hezbollah fighters are paid in dollars , while syrian soldiers get depreciating syrian pounds hezbollah fighters get new black cars and meat with rice , ali said , while syrian soldiers make do with dented russian trucks and stale bread a student who recently fled damascus after being constantly stopped at checkpoints to prove he is not a deserter said that hezbollah now runs his neighborhood in the old city and once helped him solve a problem between his brother and security forces \( syrian police , he said , are so little seen that people now smoke hashish openly \) if you have hezbollah wasta , or connections , he said , your problems will be solved the student identified himself only as hamed al adem , a name he uses as a performance artist , to protect family members still in damascus even so , hezbollah is not in a position to bail out mr assad the way it did in 2013 , when it sent hundreds of fighters to crush the insurgent hub of qusayr , near the lebanese border hezbollah now has more fighters and advisers in syria than ever , about 5 , 000 , american intelligence officials said but , said the syrian with security connections , they only interfere in areas that are in their own interests the official sympathetic to hezbollah said it has maybe thousands of fighters along the lebanese border , hundreds in the south , bordering israel , and only dozens around divided aleppo , syria s largest city it had none in idlib city , which he said may have fallen because some syrian officers failed to correctly assess threats the syrian with security ties said the leadership had not made a priority of defending idlib many government troops , he said , fled after insurgents knocked out their communications network and called god is great from the mosques damascus and the syrian coast , other than this nothing is important nothing , he said , adding of mr assad he does n't give a damn if syria is destroyed one longserving soldier said his cousin called from a hastily dug foxhole near idlib to send shaky goodbyes to his mother the soldier , who serves on another front and has lost an uncle and a cousin in battle , was enraged to hear that the 10 men pinned down there lacked even a vehicle to flee if i have a kid , i wo n't send him to the army , he declared , complaining that his monthly pay covers just 10 days' worth of expenses why be killed or slaughtered \? in sweida , the mostly progovernment , mostly druse southern province , in every single house there is one man at least wanted for the army service , said abu tayem , a druse activist there last week , he said , after a friend of his was arrested for evading the army , residents attacked security officers , captured one and traded him for the prisoner recently , the government tried to recruit druse forces to be trained by hezbollah , but few signed up after hearing they would be asked to fight sunnis in neighboring dara'a to enlist at this point would be foolish , not to speak of dangerous , said majed , 19 , a druse whose father helped him evade the draft when the regime is gone , then our neighbors will be our enemies , he said fayez korko , 48 , said he helped organize an assyrian militia in northeastern syria after villagers concluded that the government s promises of protection were empty words he called the government the best of the worst better than extremist islamists but said that assyrians would rather die defending their villages than on faraway fronts events like the fall of idlib , said the syrian with security ties , are frustrating even a core government constituency minority alawites , who belong to mr assad s sect and disproportionately serve in the military they are beginning to doubt that the president can protect them , as they gambled in sticking with him for an existential fight , said the syrian , who is alawite syria is not you , he said , addressing mr assad , and you are not syria
re , by serge schmemann \( editorial notebook , may 28 \) , about a group of 30 women who went to north korea on a peace mission last month though i enjoy being patted on the head and told i'm adorable as much as the next gal , i do strongly take exception to the characterization of our crossing the demilitarized zone from north korea into south korea as the watereddown , na ve enterprise that mr schmemann makes it out to be none of our number ever believed that this simple gesture was anything more than a beginning , and a small one at that no one had any illusions of changing north korea s human rights behavior overnight , or of toppling a dictatorship the regime of kim jongun is despotic , brutally repressive and kleptocratic , that is true but our history of saberrattling , sanctions and isolation has not brought the peninsula any closer to peace in fact , it was the bush regime s lurch toward the axis of evil approach that added a dose of amphetamine to the precise behaviors that we are looking to punish while south korea s government may be somewhat more open than the north s , our party was searched just as thoroughly for media and printed material upon crossing into the south as we had been when we landed in pyongyang what is more , five members of our group were given letters threatening them with deportation should their behavior fail to be sufficiently docile if , as mr schmemann suggests , unification will probably come only with the collapse of the dictatorship in the north , i'm not sure by what mechanism he sees that happening other than a change in the compliant nature of the north korean people and that change will come when they are sufficiently dissatisfied with their own regime and profoundly less frightened that the rest of the world is looking to destroy them we 've seen time and again that peace cannot be achieved without the will of the people so to dismiss our group as well intended and na ve suggests that change comes only from above , which is an idea whose time has surely come and gone abigail e disney new york

london european club rugby s new ruling class will be on parade as the european champions cup reaches its semifinal stage this weekend the first decade of this century was dominated by the tournament s holy trinity of toulouse , leicester and m nster at least one of the trio was in every final between 2000 and 2010 , and they claimed the trophy seven times in those 11 seasons but none has made the final since toulouse s fourth and last win in 2010 their place has been taken over by the quartet that is contesting this weekend s semifinals clermont auvergne , playing in its fourth consecutive semifinal , will face saracens , which is playing in its third toulon , also in the final four for the third year running and winner the past two seasons takes on leinster , also a winner in 2011 and 2012 each of the matches repeats a playoff contest from last season , when saracens beat clermont in the semifinal and toulon eliminated leinster a round earlier there is , though , a big difference between the two contests clermont versus saracens is a battle of contenders , neither of which has yet lifted the ultimate prize that s because each has lost a final to toulon , whose match with leinster is the clash of champions , winners between them of the last four tournaments both semifinals will be played in france , but any home advantage is negligible the home team gets to play in its own country , but not on its own field so clermont auvergne , scarily good on its own ground , will entertain saracens on saturday in saint tienne , about 90 miles from home and in a stadium more often used for soccer if anyone has local knowledge , it is saracens' versatile back chris wyles , who played in saint tienne for the united states national team in a match against samoa in the 2007 rugby union world cup toulon , which is chasing the competition s first hat trick , or third straight title , will play leinster on sunday at the famed stade v lodrome in marseilles , 40 miles away for all four teams , familiarity has bred respect each team has offered compliments on the quality of its opponent as bernard laporte , toulon s director of rugby , said last week these games are all 5050 calls saracens beat clermont , 466 , at this stage a year ago , but the two teams split their home and away meetings in this season s pool stage as a club , we admire clermont as much as anybody because they keep coming back for more , mark mccall , the saracens head coach , said this week we always say we want to give ourselves a chance in every competition , and they do that year in year out and respond to setbacks extremely well saracens lost both a european and a domestic final last year , losing the english premiership after dominating the regular season that experience has made them even more hungry we have a mantra to galvanize us it is a matter of pounding the rock , ' said center brad barritt , citing the mantra used by the san antonio spurs after winning the nba crown in 2014 , following saracens' victory over leicester last week barritt s return after a long injury absence is a boost for saracens our experience says that in games as big as this , you need your warrior , mccall said nobody epitomizes that more than brad his presence generates great confidence in other players clermont , by contrast , relies on the fitness of its highclass halfbacks , morgan parra and camille lopez but one of its players , veteran back rower julien bonnaire , has extra motivation to be a winner it s now or never i would like the colors of clermont to hang from the trophy this season and win it with my friends , said bonnaire , who will retire at the end of the season this will definitely be my last semi i want to give everything to have no regrets in the end clermont is favored it has won 10 of its last 12 meetings with english teams but is also aware that the two defeats were against saracens , which put its resilience and ability to win in france on display with its lastkick , quarterfinal victory over paris club racing metro last weekend toulon will also be favored leinster does not appear as strong as it was three years ago , and its coach , matt o'connor , is aware of the challenge his team faces the fact is , we have got to go there and perform very close to our potential to beat toulon the lads understand that , he said this week it is a huge challenge for us , they have worldclass blokes in every position toulon s laporte is similarly respectful leinster are the team which , aside from toulouse , has been european champions the most , he said they are a semifinal machine they are present at this stage every year and they are a very good team , but they would have to say the same about us that could be said of all four semifinalists like its predecessor , this ruling class could be with us for a while

department business was revealed in march , she has repeatedly said that she had no classified information on the account the initial revelation has been an issue in the early stages of her presidential campaign the justice department has not decided if it will open an investigation , senior officials said a spokesman for mrs clinton s campaign released a statement on twitter on friday morning any released emails deemed classified by the administration have been done so after the fact , and not at the time they were transmitted , it read at issue are thousands of pages of state department emails from mrs clinton s private account mrs clinton has said she used the account because it was more convenient , but it also shielded her correspondence from congressional and freedom of information act requests she faced sharp criticism after her use of the account became public , and subsequently said she would ask the state department to release her emails the department is now reviewing some 55 , 000 pages of emails a first batch of 3 , 000 pages was made public on june 30 in the course of the email review , state department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified in the 3 , 000 pages that were released , for example , portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to classified status but none of those were marked as classified at the time mrs clinton handled them in a second memo to mr kennedy , sent on july 17 , the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the state department contained classified information the inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance the memos were provided to the new york times by a senior government official the inspectors general also criticized the state department for its handling of sensitive information , particularly its reliance on retired senior foreign service officers to decide if information should be classified , and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations in march , mrs clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account i did not email any classified material to anyone on my email , she said there is no classified material so i'm certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material in may , the fbi asked the state department to classify a section of mrs clinton s emails that related to suspects who may have been arrested in connection with the 2012 attacks in benghazi , libya the information was not classified at the time mrs clinton received it the revelations about how mrs clinton handled her email have been an embarrassment for the state department , which has been repeatedly criticized over its handling of documents related to mrs clinton and her advisers on monday , a federal judge sharply questioned state department lawyers at a hearing in washington about why they had not responded to freedom of information act requests from the associated press , some of which were four years old i want to find out what s been going on over there i should say , what s not been going on over there , said judge richard j leon of united states district court , according to a transcript obtained by politico the judge said that for reasons known only to itself , the state department has been , to say the least , recalcitrant in responding two days later , lawmakers on the republicanled house committee investigating the benghazi attacks said they planned to summon secretary of state john kerry s chief of staff to capitol hill to answer questions about why the department has not produced documents that the panel subpoenaed that hearing is set for next wednesday the state department has used every excuse to avoid complying with fundamental requests for documents , said the chairman of the house committee , representative trey gowdy , republican of south carolina mr gowdy said that while the committee has used an array of measures to try to get the state department to hand over documents , the results have been the same our committee is not in possession of all documents needed to do the work assigned to us , he said the state department has sought to delay the hearing , citing continuing efforts to brief members of congress on the details of the nuclear accord with iran it is not clear why the state department has struggled with the classification issues and document production republicans have said the department is trying to use those processes to protect mrs clinton state department officials say they simply do not have the resources or infrastructure to properly comply with all the requests since march , requests for documents have significantly increased some state department officials said they believe that many senior officials did not initially take the house committee seriously , which slowed document production and created an appearance of stonewalling state department officials also said that mr kerry is concerned about the toll the criticism has had on the department and has urged his deputies to comply with the requests quickly

divided into alternating hisandhers rooms and zigzagging across the western hemisphere , it s hard to tell at first if from bauhaus to buenos aires grete stern and horacio coppola at is about an artistic couple , 20thcentury migration or european modernism and its diaspora in many ways , it s about all of these but despite more than 300 somber , highcontrast vintage blackandwhite photographs , films and display cases of ephemera organized in neat rows , the exhibition is a bit of a hot mess it starts with photographs of buenos aires by the argentine artist and filmmaker horacio coppola \( 19062012 \) and then turns to advertising work and portraits made in germany by grete stern \( 190499 \) , a photographer who became coppola s wife but wait does n't the show s title suggest a trajectory moving from the bauhaus to buenos aires \? what becomes clear as much as possible , since the information is buried deep in a handful of wall labels and mostly in the catalog is that these were fellow travelers and photographers , rarely collaborators stern was clearly more of a visual arts innovator , but coppola provided the connections and the place to land during the turbulent '30s and '40s the catalog provides enough evidence to draw your own conclusions stern is featured in an essay and reproductions up front coppola , in a separate essay at the back of the book stern was born in 1904 in elberfeld , germany , and studied drawing and graphic design in stuttgart before moving in 1927 to berlin , which was undergoing a photographic revolution under the advice of her brother , stern took private photography lessons with , who later became the director of photography at the bauhaus her most significant output in germany was with ringl pit , the advertising agency she founded with ellen auerbach in 1930 the ringl pit work here combines art and advertising in the best bauhaus tradition innovative typography and layouts and photographs of products that look like modernist still lifes after the rise of the nazis , however , stern and auerbach were forced to sell their business , three years after its opening in buenos aires , coppola started taking photographs around 1927 and going for long walks \( starting in 1929 \) with none other than jorge luis borges , later argentina s bestknown writer , who included two of coppola s photographs in a 1930 book much of coppola s work in this show consists of cityscapes and street views , either of buenos aires or european cities , which resemble at different moments the work of eug ne atget or american modernists like walker evans or paul strand coppola went to europe for the first time in 1930 in 1932 , he returned and studied at the bauhaus in berlin and met stern his photographs changed he became more technically proficient and started incorporating oblique angles and aerial views , like the russian constructivists or laszlo moholynagy his bauhaus studies depicting eggs , feathers or twine are interesting , if not revolutionary in 1935 , the couple married and moved to buenos aires , where they entered \( or for coppola , reentered \) a world of artists and intelligentsia stern made portraits of their friends and acquaintances , including borges and the poet pablo neruda , when he visited town in 1945 very little information about stern s sitters is included in the exhibition , which is disappointing since some of them were involved in the international antifascist movement or early versions of feminism , like the playwright amparo alvajar and the abstract painter manuel ngeles ortiz , whom stern photographed in 1943 after his internment in a concentration camp during the spanish civil war she also photographed members of mad \( from the first two letters of the words materialismo dial ctico \) , who were committed to abstraction as an antidote to the propaganda disseminated by juan per n one of ms stern s bestknown works , on view here , is the photomontage for mad , ramos mejia , argentina \( 194647 \) , which she made for the second issue of their journal for the images , she used the m from a neon sign advertising movado watches and superimposed mad over the obelisk designed by alberto prebisch to celebrate the 400th anniversary of buenos aires the obelisk symbolized , for her milieu , abstract geometry stern and coppola divorced in 1943 , and the exhibition ends with work from the late '40s and early '50s one of the best rooms in the show features dreams \( sue os \) , the surrealist photomontages that stern published in a women s magazine from 1948 to 1951 to illustrate a column on psychoanalysis campy , vivid and weird , the montaged images often featured the couple s daughter , silvia coppola , and demonstrated the popular fascination with psychoanalysis in argentina during that period , but also the fears surrounding repression by the per n dictatorship others are vaguely feminist , like dream no 1 electrical appliances for the home \( 1949 \) , in which a woman serves as the base of a lamp , with a man s hand reaching around to switch her on or off the catalog contends that grete stern and horacio coppola created a stunning body of work , but the show argues , in many ways , for two discrete bodies of work what might have been accomplished instead of trying to insert two lesser known figures into the canon is to highlight what s really interesting about their lives and careers that they and particularly stern were migratory and interdisciplinary , harbingers of the kinds of artistic practice we see today in which commerce , parenthood and politics can no longer be elided , and so they become part of the work the museum could have showcased their work along with that of their friends and compatriots , from bauhaus to buenos aires , from the literary world to the poets , writers , activists and psychoanalysts with whom they interacted and not just as mute players in this narrative now that would have been an extraordinary show

padua , italy highend printing is an artisans' job in for those books , the gluing and the binding of the pages is predominantly done by hand but at editoriale zanardi , a prestige book printer in northeast , even the management fell into its workers' hands last year , when they bought out the company that had employed them for years zanardi is one of the dozens of small and mediumsize enterprises in italy that were brought to their knees by the economic crisis , but whose employees trusted in their companies enough to invest their unemployment and severance payments to create cooperatives and start producing again this kind of bonding together to weather europe s tough economic times has grown more common , not only in italy but also in spain and france , all countries that take pride in maintaining small , often familyrun businesses but zanardi s story , equal parts tragedy and resilience , also in many ways reflects the character of padua itself through its long history , it has been conquered and ruled by many , among them huns , byzantines , lombards , venetians and austrians but it has produced masterworks , like giotto s scrovegni chapel , and created one of italy s oldest universities , where galileo once taught at the onset of europe s , in 2008 , zanardi , which started in the 1960s as an artisanal rebinding shop in padua , provided about 180 jobs by 2012 that had shrunk to 105 , after a series of bad management decisions and the effects of the downturn left the company accumulating debt deeply distressed by the situation , one of the two owners committed suicide in the factory i thought , i am not going to give up , and i poured all of my soul here , said solimano dal corso , the 42yearold production manager of what is now the coop we became very flexible , took a pay cut , and became entrepreneurs , he said we are giving up a little bit now , and investing in the future this is how we do things here the odds of such a turnabout remain long italian banks are extremely reluctant to provide cash to businesses , especially to those in trouble international investors are not interested in small or mediumsize enterprises , but rather in big brands of global reputation , experts said but in italy , in particular , many workers nonetheless hold out faith that their specialized artisanal work can give them a unique niche , even in a globalized marketplace mr dal corso has worked in the printing business for his entire career , and when zanardi went bankrupt , he found himself unemployed and worked for other , similar businesses in the area he wanted to figure out whether the coop idea was feasible , and whether their possible competitors were way ahead of them it turned out they were not , he said , his hands on his hips as the printing machine rolled out fresh book pages on a recent crisp morning last may , mr dal corso , 20 colleagues and the company s former business consultant drafted a business plan and took it for evaluation to the ministry for economic development in rome more than five months later , the new coop was granted a license from the commercial court completing the bankruptcy procedure , and a lease on the machines and the facilities the company was open for business again five months with no salary were bad , obviously , but five months of absence on the global market are very long , said mario grillo , the business consultant who decided to invest in the coop because he fell in love with the books that zanardi produced every competitor wanted the brand and the clients , he added none wanted the employees , but i always believed that these people were essential to produce these books zanardi used to have a global market share of about 30 percent of prestige and arts books over the years , the company invented the patented octavius binding that allows tailormade editions , such as the 20 , 000 copies of the collected james bond books and the limited edition of goldfinger 300 books all covered in leather and real gold powder zanardi also printed many gallimard tour guides , children s books and the memorial edition of the german newspaper bild , a thick collection of front pages according to the cecopcicopa europe , the european confederation of industrial and service cooperatives , about 120 businesses became cooperatives in france in 2011 and 2012 , and 75 in spain in 2012 these enterprises cannot seek international investors , said valter conca , professor of management and technology at the milanbased bocconi university they have to look elsewhere , and those who do make it are a drop in the sea , a rather limited phenomenon zanardi workers sought help from coopfond , an institution that has funded over 40 such coops since 2008 , and saved more than 1 , 200 jobs all over italy coopfond provided economic resources and expertise to work through the transition it is usually an uphill journey , as these companies often come from a bankruptcy or a very serious economic crisis , said aldo soldi , general director of the fund now the coop aims to conquer a third of the previous market share , with a fourth of the social capital and the employees they have made partnership agreements with other local rebinding businesses to get help they work in special shifts , with their schedules adjusting last minute to the company s needs this is italy s richness , its working culture that should be promoted and preserved , mr grillo said , watching his coop colleagues working the machines when people are fully engaged , china is not a real competitor italian artisans can still make a difference
arlington , tex a week or so after it ended , after a popup landed in the paws of a panda , lorenzo cain came out of hibernation he wanted to see the postseason again , to relive the joy ride of the in a way , he still is i always think about it maybe i could have gotten an extra hit or made an extra catch or something , said cain , the ' center fielder you always play it in your mind until january , cain said , he never went a week without rewatching a game , still amazed that the royals sprinted all the way to game 7 of the world series , tying run at third base , two outs in the bottom of the ninth it gave cain chills , he said , but it always ended the same way , with pablo sandoval squeezing salvador perez s foul ball and  it hurts a lot when you come that close , manager ned yost said i just kept thinking , well , in a week or 10 days i 'll realize what we accomplished and it 'll feel better then a week or 10 days came and it did n't feel better , and i thought , well , maybe it 'll take a month and it did n't feel better after a month and finally after two months i figured , ok , it s never going to feel better but yost , whose royals host the yankees at kauffman stadium for a threegame series starting friday , did not even have to discuss the world series when he gathered his team in spring training in february he could tell right away that the players shared his feelings pride in competing so well under pressure , and hunger for another chance the royals seemed poised to try again they are 2213 , one game ahead of detroit for first place in the american league central and far ahead of cleveland and the chicago white sox , who were trendy choices for playoff spots in a preseason poll of 88 espn contributors , only three picked the royals to win the division fox sports assembled 12 experts , and none forecast a postseason berth \( neither , for that matter , did the new york times , which picked the royals for third place , out of the playoffs \) it s understandable , third baseman mike moustakas said a lot of teams made some sexy pickups , got some guys that are unbelievable players , and we pretty much kept it the same i think it s been working out to our benefit because we trust each other so much the royals lost a few players , notably starter james shields and designated hitter billy butler but edinson volquez and kendrys morales have capably replaced them , and the team s cohesion has been obvious benchclearing episodes in april , with oakland and the white sox , cost four royals players a combined 20 games in suspensions cain said the players showed they would support one another even if a royals player was in the wrong and perez called the royals a family the royals' hitters still led the majors in times hit by pitch , with 27 but yost said the team had made its point the best way to stop somebody from bullying you is to punch 'em square in the nose , yost said that 'll stop it that s what happened , and , of course , we 're playing quieter games quieter , but no less exciting the royals' hitters have the fewest strikeouts in the majors , just as they did last season , and the secondfewest walks , ahead of only colorado in an era of high strikeouts , they are experts at putting the ball in play and being rewarded for it the royals' 287 batting average easily led the majors the improvements are everywhere eric hosmer , who hit 351 in the postseason , said the detailed scouting reports then have made him better at applying a game plan now he is concentrating more on pitches to drive , and taking more walks moustakas , who was sent to the minors with a 152 average last may , ripped five homers in october and is now among the team s best hitters he said the pure emphasis on winning last fall and the way the scoreboard wiped out his ugly regularseason statistics had changed his approach moose has completely turned his game around , said alex gordon , the gold glove left fielder one of the coolest things we 've seen this year is how good of a hitter he is he s big for us right now gordon , who can choose free agency after this season if he declines a player option , has the longest royals tenure on the roster now in his ninth season with the team , gordon , 31 , said the younger players had thrived by carrying the mindset of october into the regular season yet while trust , camaraderie and focus are important , the biggest reason the royals win is a talented core squarely in its prime the royals had extraordinary patience in building their roster with lowcost players whose skills speed , defense , contact hitting match up with their spacious ballpark and modest payroll it is an exciting style of play , and the fans have responded to the encore edition of a team that snapped a 29year postseason drought the royals have averaged 30 , 827 fans per game , which would be a franchise record for a full season it s a baseball city again , cain said a lot of packed crowds early in the season you see it in the city signs up , people wearing the kc gear all over the place they 're embracing everything the shakiest part of the roster has been the rotation , made up largely of journeymen whose main job is to keep things close until the bullpen takes over kelvin herrera , wade davis and greg holland have been as stingy as ever , with help from ryan madson , whose elbow is sturdy again after three seasons away through wednesday , the royals had the majors' best bullpen earned run average , at 163 you think they 're going to just be human , but every night , seventh , eighth , ninth inning , if we 've got a lead , it s done , hosmer said on offense , even when the game s tied in those innings , you realize it s just a matter of time before we score and we 're going to win because these guys in the bullpen , they just do n't give up runs it s unbelievable hours after hosmer spoke on tuesday , holland blew a save opportunity against the texas rangers after converting his previous 33 chances , including october gordon responded with a leadoff homer in the top of the 10th inning the royals' third homer of the night and holland then closed out the win the royals hit the fewest home runs in the majors last season , with 95 they still rank among the lower half of teams in homers , but are on a pace for 130 , led by hosmer s seven when perez came to bat against madison bumgarner in the bottom of the ninth last oct 29 , a home run would have won the championship perez had homered in game 1 , the only run bumgarner had ever allowed in five world series outings bumgarner tempted him with fastballs just above the strike zone , and perez took the bait i got too excited , perez said that s why i swung at a lot of pitches up but now i got experience i know what happened maybe next time i 'll be more patient the royals believe there will be a next time they spare the clich s about taking things one game at a time , and play down the motivation they get from any remaining doubters the chance at another game 7 is enough for me , i do n't really care what anybody says , you know \? yost said i just want to go out and win a world

doubleday told george vecsey , a columnist for the new york times each owner would also have to share the responsibility for the mets' dispiriting downward spiral in the 1990s , with the misanthropic antics of bret saberhagen and vince coleman garrulous as doubleday could be , he did not covet the role of the owner as a public personality , as the yankees' george steinbrenner did doubleday was charming and fun to be with but as he told me in 1983 i 'd prefer that nobody know who i am sure i like to yell and scream and have fun , but i 'd rather do it with my friends and family and not to the newspapers i hate being photographed , but i do it i hate being interviewed you just do n't realize how much i hate the whole damn thing i hate it , but if i have to do it , i do it i suspect that doubleday did not mind that wilpon played mr outside , a role similar to the one he plays in his real estate business they were very different men one the scion of a family publishing house , the other the son of a brooklyn funeral home manager one from old money , the other from new they were brought together in the mets' ownership group by john pickett , then the islanders' owner , to respond to the team s auction by the family of joan payson fred said , i 'd like one percent and saul will take one percent , ' pickett recalled in a 2011 interview , referring to saul katz , wilpon s brotherinlaw and business partner and nelson agreed , with fred , probably reluctantly , to be president they were not buddies they were less symbiotic 5050 owners than the tisch and mara families of the football giants and it is possible that they would not have become 5050 partners in 1986 if doubleday had been aware of a clause in their original agreement that gave wilpon the right of first refusal on any sale of the team still , they had enough of a bond forged as partners , not intimates for wilpon to defend doubleday when doubleday was quoted making an antisemitic remark in lords of the realm , a 1995 baseball history book by john helyar people that know nelson , wilpon said , know that s not the way nelson feels but they agreed on little , according to various reports over the years wilpon wanted a new ballpark doubleday wanted to renovate shea stadium they took sides internally , with doubleday said to be a backer of general manager steve phillips and wilpon a supporter of manager bobby valentine they disagreed over a proposed sale of the team to charles f dolan , the head of cablevision , which did not come fruition , doubleday said , because of wilpon s insistence on disproportionate control of the team after a sale finally , in 2001 , doubleday asked to be bought out but their split would not be easy doubleday initiated it , and an option in their contract allowed wilpon to buy his half of the team but after failing to agree on a price , they hired an appraiser whose valuation was to be binding but doubleday thought that the 391 million valuation was too low \( after subtracting liabilities , doubleday s take was going to be 1379 million \) doubleday believed the team was worth closer to 500 million wilpon sued doubleday to force him to accept the appraiser s price instead , doubleday said that he was the victim of a sham process and that major league baseball was in cahoots with wilpon , a friend of commissioner bud selig , to let him pay less than market value doubleday accused the major leagues of undervaluing franchises , in part by manufacturing phantom losses , to fit their laborrelations strategy in august 2002 , doubleday agreed to a settlement a 135 million buyout with the promise of up to 40 million more when the mets moved into a new stadium a sweetener he would not fully collect until citi field opened in 2009 in 2004 , wilpon and katz used their accounts with bernard l madoff s investment firm to persuade lenders to refinance certain loans that let them buy out doubleday , according to a lawsuit filed against the mets' owners by the trustee for the victims of madoff s fraud the suit was eventually settled doubleday s days as an owner of the mets had their troughs , but none like the ones wilpon and katz have endured since the collapse of madoff s operation devastated their finances nearly seven years ago they have slashed payroll taken loans from mlb and bank of america to fund their operations and refinance other debt and sold limited shares to raise working capital they appear to have climbed out of the morass , largely with pitching , but wilpon and katz still seem to lack the financial wherewithal to spend like largemarket owners
florence arthaud , the french sailor who died at 57 in a argentina on monday along with nine others , including two french olympians , was celebrated by the french yachting world as the only woman to have won the route du rhum , a grueling solo transatlantic race that victory , in 1990 , was the apex of her career aboard the 60foot trimaran groupe pierre , she outdueled the world s top solo ocean racers in a 3 , 500mile sprint that took her from brittany , , to the caribbean island of guadeloupe no woman has won the event since in france her photograph graced the cover of national magazines , and her striking looks typically tanned , with piercing eyes framed by thick , wavy auburn hair only enhanced the celebrity image officials in la rioja province in northwestern argentina said ms arthaud had been aboard one of two helicopters carrying 10 people to a remote gorge to film a television reality show , dropped , when the aircraft collided the participants were to be left to find their way back to civilization among the dead were camille muffat , 25 , who won three swimming medals at the 2012 london olympics , and alexis vastine , 28 , who won a bronze medal in boxing at the 2008 beijing games arthaud had been a familiar competitor in sailing circles throughout the 1980s and 1990s , famed for her solo exploits but none was as storied as her victory in the route du rhum the race is considered second in prestige only to the vend e globe , a solo nonstop aroundtheworld race and her win helped pave the way for some renowned female solo sailors of today , including the britons sam davies and dame ellen macarthur when she won , she was an inspiration to most girls in france and in europe , isabelle autissier , the first woman to complete a circumnavigation in competition , said in a phone interview from france on tuesday she demonstrated that it was n't just the muscle of man needed to win solo competitions it was the brain , accuracy in meteorology and working with yacht design she added , she was the most popular sailor in france for sure davies , considered the world s top female solo sailor , recalled arthaud from an early age i remember as a little girl cutting out this amazing picture of florence and putting it on my bedroom wall , she said it was this amazing picture of her on this silver trimaran groupe pierre looking so feminine it inspired me that you could be a girl and sail these amazing boats davies is currently leading an allwomen s team in the volvo ocean race though arthaud and autissier shared the mantle as france s top female sailors , it was arthaud who had the fastest start in the sport she was born on october 28 , 1957 , in her parents ran a publishing house in paris , and she grew up sailing with notable french yachtsmen , including the father of french offshore sailing , eric tabarly at 17 she was in a serious car accident that left her in a coma it took her two years to recover sailing solo is inherently treacherous , but arthaud was masterly in avoiding disaster her most recent close call came in 2011 , when she was washed overboard while sailing solo off the coast of corsica she was able to retrieve her cellphone it was in a waterproof case and phoned her mother in paris she was rescued after several hours alone in the seadespite setting several transoceanic records , including one in the 1997 transpac race with the french yachtsman bruno peyron , arthaud wanted more from her career , but she had trouble finding sponsors in later years it was painful for her , autissier said arthaud was divorced her survivors include her daughter , marie
almaty , kazakhstan the last time this happened that is , the last time a former soviet republic from central asia bid to host an olympics the entire thing was a joke a lark a laugh this was in 1992 , when tashkent , the capital of uzbekistan , bid for the 2000 summer games at the time , tashkent s committee leaders readily admitted that , should they win , they would need to build 24 venues , including a regulationsize swimming pool as well as a few other nagging items , like hotels , an airport and a hospital just one year after the fall of the soviet union , the people of tashkent were fully aware that they were dreaming more than two decades later , however , the executives in charge of bringing the 2022 winter olympics here , to kazakhstan s former capital and current commercial hub , are far more serious they do not care that many fans \( and perhaps even some members \) may struggle to find their country the ninth largest in the world on a map they do not care that many experts believe the oftcited notion of using an olympics as a means of transforming a country with any number of problems including a troubling human rights record is pure myth and they certainly do not care that some observers have labeled this the worst bidding race in olympic history after , leaving behind a particularly bizarre pair the candidates \? almaty , a city you may or may not have heard of \( it is pronounced almahtee \) , and beijing , a city you surely have heard of but perhaps not for its winter sports history none of this concerns us , akhmetzhan yessimov , the mayor of almaty , said through an interpreter in a recent interview at his office we want to win he shrugged once you say you are a mushroom , you might as well get into the soup and yet , still this soup is tricky yes , almaty has put together a bid that is comprehensive and original , and it has become a legitimate contender as one bidder after another has dropped out citing either costs or a lack of public support but winning july s vote , which will be held in kuala lumpur , is another matter and there is no question that almaty is the underdog much of that has to do with its competition beijing , despite political and environmental concerns , put on a remarkable olympics in 2008 but those were the summer games , almaty advocates are quick to point out , and so beijing would be essentially setup with buckets of cash , a farflung layout and a culture for winter sports that might generously be described as developing unfortunately for almaty , ioc rules resulting from a scandal related to the awarding of the 2002 salt lake city games prohibit any of the 101 members who will vote on the bid from visiting either bid city beforehand in beijing s case , that is probably a good thing most people affiliated with the olympic movement still have positive feelings from 2008 for almaty , though , the rules clearly hurt the country gained its independence in 1991 and has gone through a whirlwind development process covering everything from its oilbased economy to its nascent government structure to its presence in global sports as andrey kryukov , the vice chairman of almaty s bid , said there are a lot of former soviet states a lot of stans' but we are the most advanced we are the strongest we want to be able to show that to the voters , and we are not allowed mr kryukov acknowledged that this reality is almaty s biggest obstacle old perceptions about what life is like in kazakhstan are difficult to erase , he said , especially without the opportunity to display , say , the city s compact downtown and the charming pedestrian shopping zone and leafy park near the area known as the arbat image , as in any political process , is critical it is impossible to know how many people , for example , might have preconceived notions about kazakhstan based on sacha baron cohen s wildly offensive \( and wildly popular \) character and movie borat denis ten , who won the country s first figure skating medal when he claimed bronze at the 2014 sochi games , said he continued to hear the occasional borat comment from fans and spectators it still happens , he said people do n't even realize that movie was filmed in romania the strength of almaty s bid , its organizers say , lies in its compressed nature and its authenticity \( the bid s slogan , in a notsoveiled jab at beijing , is keeping it real \) while some might reflexively link almaty , as a former soviet city , to sochi , there are almost no similarities in their bids the sochi games cost upward of 50 billion , and when construction was finished \( \) , those olympics had the vague feel of being held on a hollywood movie set in almaty , every venue is within a radius of about 18 miles one hockey arena has been built and another will be completed with or without the olympics for the university games , which are set for 2017 the speedskating events would be held at medeu , an outdoor oval perched on the shelf of a mountain more than a mile above sea level , and the ski jump venue will be visible from office windows in the city s metropolitan center when inspectors from the ioc visited almaty a few months ago in a particularly convoluted process , these officials do not vote on the bids but instead report to executives who do mr kryukov claimed that the feedback was virtually all positive last week , when almaty and beijing gave presentations to about 85 of the ioc members , almaty s , which featured numerous photographs of deep snow another apparent dig at beijing s bid seemed well received i think they attracted the attention of people who may not have been convinced before , the canadian ioc member dick pound told reporters afterward it looks to me like they figured out all of the weaknesses of the competitors and they just nailed the differences snow , water , air , experience much of the optimism from almaty s organizers stems from the positive response to how it has hewed to the ideals laid out by thomas bach , the president of the ioc , whose olympic agenda 2020 initiative seeks to reform a bidding process that had become particularly onerous and unappealing to potential olympic hosts high costs and waning public support were a significant part of the reason other potential bidders for the 2022 games including munich , stockholm , a combined bid from the tyrol region in austria and italy , and , very late in the process , oslo fell over one another while backing out concerns about useless infrastructure , overcrowded streets and whiteelephant venues have made winter olympics bidding a hard sell to voters the trend that ought to be worrying lovers of sport , said minky worden , director of global initiatives at human rights watch , is that it is increasingly autocrats who are n't going to face any domestic criticism that are the only ones who want to pay for these mega sporting events that is one of the larger criticisms of almaty kazakhstan s president , nursultan nazarbayev , has been leading the country since 1989 , and while public elections are now held mr nazarbayev won another term in april by gaining roughly 98 percent of the votes the idea that kazakhstan is anything close to a full , free democracy is a long way off , experts said in terms of human rights , it s not as bad as in china , it s not as bad as in russia , dina baidildayeva , who works as an activist in almaty , said in an interview but that does n't mean it is good here and the no 1 issue is freedom of speech she added i know two opposition writers who were jailed for trying to attend an event that was for progovernment bloggers two of my friends who were opposition bloggers fled to ukraine after being arrested twice and harassed i have protested recently , holding a poster asking for the resignation of the almaty mayor and i was arrested mihra rittmann , who covers kazakhstan for human rights watch , said her organization had seen a sharp decline in basic freedoms there since 2011 , when a prolonged strike by oil workers ended in governmentsanctioned violence and reports of torture since then , ms rittmann said , there have been tighter restrictions on religion and freedom of assembly , as well as an even greater obscuring of governmental accountability in some ways , it is what we call a quiet repression in kazakhstan , but the crackdown that took place after the 2011 episode was a very , very low point , ms rittmann said people were killed other groups are concerned with the ecological situation in almaty beijing s choking pollution is well documented , but almaty s is not much better , according to abay yerekenov , an environmental activist in the city , who called the air quality appalling there is also significant concern about a law , passed by the country s senate this year , that is believed to have language similar to russia s sexual propaganda statute , according to amnesty international the law , which has not entirely been made available for review by outside organizations , is said to be under consideration by mr nazarbayev in its call for opposition to the law , amnesty international said that the potent combination of legal discrimination and street homophobia seen over the past few years in kazakhstan s northern neighbor is now brewing as well in the central asian giant ms worden , of human rights watch , said her organization generally stayed away from ranking or directly comparing the situations in different countries , but she sighed when asked about the reality of the 2022 vote come july , someone will win either almaty , whose human rights record is lesser known but still poor or beijing , which is enduring china s worst crackdown in the post1989 period across the board , ms worden said this is n't a situation where it s one country that s ok against another that s not , she said this is something that ought to be keeping the ioc up at night on a brisk april morning , askar valiyev , a highranking executive with the almaty bid , stood near the top of the ski jump complex and looked down on the city below he pointed to the gleaming ritzcarlton hotel tower and its neighboring shopping mall , then waved his hand toward the grittier areas at the edges of the city everything is already changing in almaty , he said , but if we win these games \? it will change faster and better his was a common refrain among any smaller city or country bidding for an olympics or a world cup and there are , to be sure , examples of cities or countries hosting big sporting events being pushed forward in terms of development the most notable instance is seoul , south korea , which was awarded the 1988 summer games when it was still a military dictatorship , ms worden said the ioc communicated that they would not be able to host the olympics if it was a blood bath , elections were held six months before and it s been an enduring democracy ever since such a transformation , though , is hardly the rule certainly china and russia were not converted in any sort of similar way by the beijing games and the sochi games , and activists question just how proactive the ioc will be with either 2022 bid city in terms of enforcing the human rights requirements that are in mr bach s agenda 2020 plan at this point , it seems difficult to imagine any substantive pushes being made before the bid is awarded next month and so when the voters , including the underfire president of fifa , sepp blatter , consider their ballots , they will be faced with what some might consider an impossible dilemma beijing has environmental problems , political problems , civil liberties problems and an image problem almaty has money problems , experience problems , civil liberties problems and \( different \) image problems it s too early to say , gianfranco kasper , a swiss ioc member and the head of international skiing s governing body , told reporters recently but it s going to be close at the very least , this much is sure 23 years after tashkent joked about bringing the olympics to central asia , there is nothing funny about the possibility any longer
here be spoilers and more high septon than you wanted to see season 5 , episode 3 , high sparrow let s set aside , for a moment , the fact that sansa stark is more unlucky in love than anyone else has ever been unlucky in anything and we ll also leave tyrion dangling from jorah s shoulder for a few minutes more interview sophie turner on sansa s new beau  because while sunday s busy episode saw many fortunes take surprising or terrible or surprisingly terrible turns later , janos it was a quieter exchange back in king s landing that offered a key to understanding the contemplative tone that has defined the current season of game of thrones thus far it came between cersei , the season 5 mvp so far , and the socalled high sparrow , the leader of the emerging religious sect that earlier sent the high septon on his fleshy walk of shame mr sparrow \( played by the great british actor jonathan pryce \) wonders whether the gods sent cersei to tempt him or to arrest him nah , we re good , cersei says , surprising him we tossed that old creep in the dungeon because men like that make people question their faith the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world , cersei said one collapses , so does the other the faith and the crown or rather \( if you look at them through the prism of what each represents \) hope and power one senses that cersei sees each as a means of keeping the rabble in line without the structure and authority that the crown provides , people would be too concerned with the basics of survival to worry about their souls without hope , a kingdom s subjects would have nothing to lose and would become harder to control we must do everything necessary to protect one another , she tells the high sparrow but viewed another way , the two pillars represent the two halves of the human coin the side dedicated to something bigger than oneself versus the part that wonders what s in it for me before this season , game of thrones had been concerned primarily with the crown half , as members of the great houses and their cohorts butchered one another to enhance their designs or claims on the iron throne lust for power remains at the heart of the story , of course , as stannis plans his campaign in the north and daenerys targaryen aims to reclaim the throne for her family , if she can ever get out of her own way in essos margaery , meanwhile , finally makes herself into a queen and young tommen into a man in an uncharacteristically bloodless wedding and an apparently vigorous postgame celebration the first three episodes of season 5 , however , have been lousy with the trappings of religious faith , whether it s the sparrows flocking in king s landing , the lord of light s vampy priestesses proselytizing from castle black to volantis , or the faceless men embracing a deathcult melding of murder for hire and mortuary service devotion is also trending among the major characters in essos , tyrion and varys are pledging allegiance to the dragon queen , ostensibly for the good of the kingdom at the wall , jon snow is doubling down on his night s watch commitment in braavos , arya stark is learning , karate kid style , that household chores and abandonment of the self form the path to enlightenment and formidableness the point seems to be to start evening the scales between greed and service \( valar dohaeris , we keep hearing all men must serve \) the show feels as if it s shifting away from the craven selfinterest represented by the late tywin lannister toward characters who idealize the sort of dedication to a larger cause that , presumably , the known world will have to recognize in order to survive the white walker winter to come this shift is being represented most explicitly by arya , who opened sunday s episode with broom in hand , sweeping floors in the house of black and white , surrounded by the iconography of various deities there s the stranger , the drowned god \( here s a brief primer on the religions of the thronesiverse , if you re curious \) arya is moved by none of it i didn t come here to sweep floors , she complains to jaqen h ghar teach me how to be a faceless man all men must serve , faceless men most of all , he says i want to serve , she says a girl wants to serve herself , he replies \( evolve , arya here s some stickbeating and corpse cleaning to help you on your way \) jaqen goes on to claim that , whatever the pantheistic wall art there is only one god a girl knows his name and all men know his gift i have to admit that i was a bit fuzzy on both of those things i assume the name is the manyfaced god , like he said so maybe the gift is death \? people seemed to be dropping left and right in that place , and happily a world away , arya s sister sansa learns that actually , there is no god how else to explain the latest pairing for the lana turner of westeros \? bet you didn t think it got worse than joffrey , did you sansa \? he did taunt you with your dad s severed head after ordering his death , after all that s a weekend in dorne compared to sansa s new man , but she doesn t know that yet littlefinger doesn t seem to realize it either , for what it s worth but we sure do and if you managed to forget ramsay s torturing of reek and his hunting of humans , here s a whole family of people with their skin removed as a reminder ! ah , ramsay , don t ever change ramsay was on his best behavior , although that doesn t figure to last the good news for those of us in the antiflaying camp is that the north seems plenty hostile to its new overlords roose bolton may think starkwashing his house will smooth things over , but it seems equally likely that stannis will find eager help for his march on winterfell \( the north remembers , a servant tells sansa in this episode \) so perhaps sansa , who chose to go along with littlefinger s plan , remember , will have her revenge after all speaking of rehabilitating one s reputation , is that jorah mormont i see feeling sorry for himself in that volantis brothel \? well buck up , my brokenhearted friend , your imp has come in as with varys , we figured tyrion s recklessness would catch up to him , but i was surprised by the way it all went down you ll recall that jorah , dany s former adviser and lovesick worshiper , was exiled from meereen when she learned he had originally joined her in order to spy on her but do you remember whom he was spying for \? varys so while jorah presumably sees tyrion as a gift to get back in dany s good graces \( although he didn t strictly specify which queen he was taking him to , i guess \) , i suspect varys has one or two things up his bountiful sleeve that could complicate jorah s reception at the pyramid as for tyrion \? eh , he was heading to meereen anyway crate , wheelhouse , jilted knight s shoulder just keep the wine flowing , and the mode of transport probably doesn t matter a few thoughts while we open the morning wine cersei and margaery s ongoing catfight of manners deserves its own downtonesque spinoff should i call you queen mother or dowager queen \? margaery says brightly \( translation you re old and irrelevant \) there s no need for such formalities , cersei replies \( translation don t talk to me at all , you dollfaced idiot \) wouldn t you be happier in casterly rock \? tommen asks cersei \( translation advantage margaery , for now \) for the record , i m sure cersei has some sort of personal agenda in regard to the sparrows i m just not sure what it is yet what do we think tyrion was reacting to when he changed course on that prostitute \? i assumed that her arm cuff , which seemed to spark some alarm , reminded him of shae , who wore a similar piece at times anyone have other theories \? brienne s continuing pity party was actually pretty heartbreaking this week , as she remembered the nasty little twits who once made her feel like the ugliest girl alive , a great lumbering beast it also presaged another potential clash for the ages brienne versus stannis at winterfell , where both are headed for different reasons speaking of lumbering beasts , i m enjoying the gothic edge added by dr qyburnstein and his friend under the sheet , who i assume is some version of the mountain we touched on this last week , but you ll recall from last season s finale that cersei hopes to save the giant poisoned warrior and his fearsome strength for her own purposes goodbye , janos slynt it couldn t have happened to a more weasely guy last week he was the righthand man for the presumed new lord commander of the night s watch in quick order he was outed as a coward , marginalized by the election , ordered to greyguard and then beheaded in another puddle of his own making \( tears this time \) he s had it coming for a while remember that he led the baratheon bastard massacre in king s landing for joffrey back in season 2 but still , quite a fall for that guy will you mourn janos \? where do we think the sansaramsay nuptials will rank on the list of the worst weddings in westeros \? and what seems to be an appropriate present \? candlesticks always make a nice gift , but what do you get the man who flays everything \? please fire away in the comments
the premise of sex box is twofold troubled couples receive valuable advice from a panel of leading sex and relationship experts they also have sex in a box , onstage , before a live audience this is why groups like the parents television council are giving the show free publicity by  having watched the first episode \( scheduled for friday night on \) , i can say that the only demonstrably true thing about the premise is that there s a box onstage it s about the size of a backyard utility shed , and its outside is veined with blue light that turns to flashing red when a couple enters what do the couples actually do while they 're inside \? it s anyone s guess , but i 'd like to think they spend the time talking about how no one with any selfrespect or basic notion of hygiene would have sex in a box , onstage , before a live audience based on a shortlived , sex box is tamer than an average episode of the view and considerably more boring married couples briefly describe their unfulfilling sex lives , then are sent to the box , on the theory that the release of endorphins following sex will put them in the mood for a frank postcoital discussion of their problems in the premiere , none of the men fall asleep after leaving the box , though this is a distinct possibility for viewers of any gender the panelists all dr s are chris donaghue , a cuttingedge sex therapist fran walfish , a relationship psychotherapist to the rich and famous and yvonne capehart , a renowned pastor and spiritual adviser the inclusion of the minister is an american innovation also american in spirit are the panel s retrograde reactions to the hoary joy of sex scenarios when there s blame to be distributed , it s more likely to go to the wives brandon may be lazy , but it s elle s job to tell him that she , too , wants an orgasm christopher and alexia s formerly sizzling sex life is fizzling , postchildbirth , because there s a large piece of this puzzle that s missing in alexia when the seemingly rational and openminded rebecca says she s ok with her husband s desire to bring another woman into the relationship , the two female panelists berate her , refusing to believe that she knows her own mind you are trying to convince yourself when deep down in your heart you want your man and you want your man only , the pastor tells her , based on no evidence that we can see one authentic thing about sex box watching it is kind of like bad sex the clock watching , the profound embarrassment , the desire to check your email engage in too much of it , and you 'll have to repair your relationship with your tv
it was one thing for ashley nicolette frangipane , a kid from new jersey , to have 14 , 000 friends on myspace at age 14 and 16 , 000 subscribers on youtube at 18 but it s quite another for halsey , ms frangipane s popstar alter ego , to have taken that innate 21stcentury talent for selfpresentation not to mention songwriting from her bedroom to arena stages in a mere year since signing with a record label instead of a viral flash of internet lightning , halsey , unfiltered and fasttalking , has been nurtured as an artist who could harness lasting loyalty online , not just oneoff clicks now , with her nearly half a million followers on and more on contributing to the heavy lifting , the singer and her label astralwerks , an electronic imprint under capitol music have set the stage for a potential mainstream breakthrough with the release of her first album , badlands , on aug 28 , halsey will attempt to translate the secret language she shares with her online followers for a wider audience without losing its essential intimacy it s a rare tightrope walk pulled off by other webdriven artists like lorde and lana del rey for halsey , now 20 , the nextlevel rollout includes television performances \( starting with jimmy kimmel live on aug 25 \) a headlining fall tour that sold out almost immediately , resulting in upgraded venues and additional shows in major cities \( including new york , where halsey will play webster hall on oct 22 and 23 \) and her record company hopes at least one hit single , with bets currently placed on , a wouldbe generational anthem but with badlands , a brooding , conceptual electropop record with industrial undertones and big radioready hooks , halsey has realized not just her label s vision but also her own being a popleaning , female artist , you 'd think that i 'd have my record company breathing down my neck and trying to control everything i'm doing , halsey said while finishing badlands in the spring actually , they 've just kind of let me take the wheel the foundation , after all , was hers in march , halsey had her industry comingout party at the south by southwest music festival in austin , tex but at an event all about manufacturing the appearance of buzz , halsey s needed no fluffing amid the label types , teenage girls stood rapt at the front of a small stage , many of them holding up cellphones and beaming the performance via video chat to tearful friends at home outside the club , another cluster of young people pressed against a single window to catch a glimpse by the festival s end , twitter had named her mosttweetedabout artist , ahead of miley cyrus i remember walking into capitol records , sitting down with the executives and having them say , look at what you did while none of us were paying attention , ' halsey said over bubble tea in the east village in april that was one of the proudest moments of my entire life i put all the groundwork in myself , and they let me do my thing , because it s working  , ms frangipane s first single as halsey , was selfreleased on itunes in january 2014 , plugged to her tens of thousands of followers across social media to halsey , it was just another piece of content , she said but now people who were quiet before and would just silently like' my pictures had something to engage with the track exploded online , earning halsey interest from five notable labels within days she took some meetings but initially held out , and by late april , ghost had found its way to siriusxm s hits 1 station , which played the independent single alongside songs by lady gaga and pharrell williams glenn mendlinger , the senior vice president and general manager of astralwerks , recalled hearing ghost soon after at the label s weekly new music meeting we have to find her immediately , he said they did , and the next day , mr mendlinger pushed back a flight to have an 11 am meeting with halsey by 1 30 , i had sent an email to the entire executive team saying i just met this girl the music is phenomenal she is a star we have to get engaged immediately' i was really enthralled , he said it s what you wait for by 7 07 pm , astralwerks had offered her a record deal then it was time to slow down it was n't about going to radio immediately despite the early traction , mr mendlinger said if we had gone with ghost' without any base behind it , we had a high probability of losing instead , the plan was to record an ep halsey s fivesong room 93 was released in october get her on the road and continue building an online congregation we saw how she was already connecting , so we knew that was an avenue we needed to pursue with her , mr mendlinger said of the singer s social media army , made up more of advocates than of passive fans halsey , who is preternaturally selfpossessed and becomes gleeful in moments of defiance , slips into musicbusinessspeak with the same ease with which she curses or describes her favorite websites i cultivated this fan base that i really did n't really understand or appreciate until i put my first headlining tour up for sale , she said 500 to 1 , 000capacity rooms were n't an underplay for me at the time i 'd never done a tour before ! yet every date on that spring 2015 run sold out in less than 30 minutes , and halsey soon graduated to an arena tour , opening this summer for the millionselling rock band imagine dragons and often packing the front rows despite being first on the threeact bill i come from a generation where these huge follower counts are normal , she said but my interaction levels retweets , replies , clickthroughs are incredibly high halsey could be mistaken for a millennial built in a lab not only is she fluent in the language of modern marketing , but her openness on social media feels authentic and inextricable from her personality raised in union county , nj , by a white mother , who often accompanied her tween daughter to concerts , and a black father , who manages car dealerships , halsey identifies as what she calls tribi biracial , bisexual and bipolar and speaks with ease and confidence about social issues please do n't erase my race because i'm white passing , she on twitter recently there is literally nothing i can do about my complexion her songs , which she writes herself with an array of young producers , are similarly candid and precocious high on legal marijuana raised on biggie and nirvana we are the new americana , she sings although far from her most subtle song , new americana was first played by the tastemaking dj zane lowe on apple s beats 1 radio last month wow there s a new icon there , i think , he said after playing the track twice in a row that record is big oh my god it soon spread to influential alternative stations like live 105 in san francisco and kroq in los angeles but astralwerks may be taking a risk on rock radio , which sits outside halsey s comfort zone we know the fan base was leaning female and young , but alternative radio would introduce her to the 18to35 male demographic , mr mendlinger said of that bet halsey is typically oppositional about the single s prospects everyone thinks it s going to be a cultural revolution , but i do n't think it s that good , she said plainly as for ghost , which astralwerks may yet push to pop radio , i'm so over that song , she said , and it only made the album as one of her few concessions to the label more representative are songs like hold me down i sold my soul to a threepiece and he told me i was holy and hurricane , an early track that made the deluxe edition of badlands , on which she sings , i'm a wanderess i'm a onenight stand do n't belong to no city , do n't belong to no man loaded with the knowingness of a cool older sister who sneaks into the city from the suburbs , halsey s lyrics connected even before they were set to music a breakup poem she wrote on tumblr years ago has been liked and reblogged more than 820 , 000 times , taking on a viral life of its own \( and even resulting in online plagiarism charges when she repurposed her own words as lyrics \) at a montauk hotel performance on memorial day , the halsey faithful dyed hair , black lipstick stood out among the hamptons regulars , singing every word some lingered for hours after the 20minute show and burst into tears when halsey s mother , who is recognized at every concert , told them the singer would visit with them soon upstairs in halsey s room , a fan had sent roses i'm not going to lie it gets kind of intimidating sometimes , she said of the constant attention online and off i put so much of myself out there and make myself so accessible that sometimes i fear i make myself too accessible when halsey offered to get with fans recently as album promotion , those who were not old enough took offense i'm giving so much of myself now that there s going to be a point where there s nothing left to give , she said while chainsmoking marlboro 27s i'm on this skyrocket , with all these expectations and this fan base and this buzz i have blessed myself and cursed myself by building something that people are so attached to i get one shot a month later , at the brooklyn stop of the imagine dragons tour , halsey was visibly exhausted , having finished badlands overseeing sound mastering , album art , videos and promo while playing arenas my whole body hurts , she said backstage under the lights , though , she faced the fans' screams gamely , arching her back and spitting water onto those gathered up front for her early set my name is halsey , she told the crowd but i'm not who you guys came here to see even then , that did n't feel quite true
london this has been , by any reckoning , a momentous first half of the year for the art market in february we learned that qatar had bought a gauguin painting for an undisclosed price of as much as 300 million in may , an experimental week of impressionist , modern and contemporary art sales in new york raised more than 2 billion , including 1794 million for picasso s 1955 les femmes d'alger \( version o' \) , a high for artwork sold at auction and in june , several prominent contemporary dealers reported their bestever art basel fair , which attracted a record 98 , 000 visitors as collectors , advisers and dealers head off for the hamptons , or provence , or other favored vacation spots , this might be the moment to take stock or as two medieval peasants asked in a classic new yorker cartoon , after a minstrel sauntered past singing sumer is icumen in what was that all about \? when art prices surge , there is always talk of a bubble but for the moment , despite the uncertainty over greece and despite chinese stocks losing 3 trillion of their value in less than a month , those involved in the art market remain insouciant about prospects for the second half of 2015 on june 30 , the london analysts arttactic published a study based on the responses of 128 art collectors , advisers , auction experts , dealers and media commentators more than half of the participants think the market for postwar and contemporary art will continue to grow over the next six months and less than half think it will remain flat none expected it to contract it s not a bubble in the classical sense of the word , said tom flynn , director of art appraisal at kingston university in surrey , england the cyclical process appears to have gone from the top end of the contemporary market it s being driven by almost unprecedented levels of wealth in the world , and by an influx of people from finance who are treating art as a pure asset class in 2009 , during the depths of the financial crisis , worldwide auction sales of postwar and contemporary art contracted to 14 billion euros , about 15 billion today , less than half the 35 billion achieved in 2007 , according to a report published by the european fine art foundation in march the report said auction sales of contemporary art hit an alltime high of 59 billion in 2014 or , to put it another way , no bubble burst in 2009 the market for contemporary art simply paused there s so much wealth around , and it keeps on being created and put into tangible assets like art , said suzanne gyorgy , global head of art advisory and finance at citi private bank in new york the recession created opportunities for huge wealth creation , she added , referring to the quantitative easing policies that over the past five years have raised asset prices in the united states and europe money goes to people who are able to make more money out of it an increasing number of these people are looking to make money out of contemporary art the victoria miro gallery in london , for example , represents the veteran japanese avantgarde artist yayoi kusama a 2006 version of one of the white infinitynet paintings ms kusama has been producing for more than 50 years sold at auction in hong kong in november for 23 million , according to the auction results database artnet little wonder , then , that victoria miro had a waiting list of more than 200 clients for the four fresh infinitynets , priced at 450 , 000 each , it took to art basel these were among 15 works the gallery either sold or had firmly reserved within an hour of the fair opening to vip guests on june 16 that s never happened before , said the gallery s codirector , glenn scott wright people have been saying the contemporary market is a bubble for 20 years but it s a different beast now so many people see art as an alternative investment that said , the market for contemporary art remains a fickle beast the speculative trade in hot , young processbased abstract painters such as lucien smith , alex israel , parker ito and israel lund , whose works were routinely being flipped by multipleestimate auction prices in 2014 , has cooled bluechip names like francis bacon , and gerhard richter can also prove problematic ambitiously valued , soso examples of these highly regarded artists' work failed to achieve estimates as high as 35 million pounds , about 55 million , at christie s and sotheby s in london on june 30 and july 1 but over all , contemporary art retains its allure as a wealth preservative back in january , the hong kongbased website larry s list calculated that there were about 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 collectors worldwide who regularly buy substantially priced works from galleries and from the major art fairs such as art basel that is a tiny segment of what tefaf said was a world population of 35 million millionaires , and more than 200 , 000 ultrahighnetworth individuals with 30 million or more to spend , in 2014 but with their multiple homes , taxefficient private museums and sophisticated offshore investment plans , wealthy contemporary art collectors are people who , by and large , have managed to detach themselves from the everyday concerns of national economies unlike greek shopkeepers and chinese small investors , art magnates like dakis joannou and budi tek are in little danger of going bust in fact , the very rich do not seem to have much interest in collecting any other kind of art , other than postwar and contemporary there were clear signs of the everwidening inequality with other art markets at recent auctions in london christie s evening sale of contemporary works raised 957 million on june 30 , and the company s equivalent auction of old masters paintings raised just 19 million christie s said in an email that richard knight , cochairman of the old masters department , would be leaving the company at the end of the month despite some highvalue failures , sotheby s contemporary sale on july 1 managed to raise 1304 million , the company s highest total for the category in europe on wednesday , sotheby s auction of victorian , preraphaelite and british impressionist art took in 47 million the auction house s publicity department made the most of the 167 , 000 paid by an american collector for an 1895 pencil and white chalk study for frederic leighton s muchreproduced painting , flaming june but those results were a far cry from 2000 , when wealthy individuals were buying a broader range of statusenhancing art , and the british collector andrew lloyd webber had to pay 66 million for john william waterhouse s st cecilia at auction still , there have been other exceptions though just half of the 61 lots at christie s 18 million exceptional sale of miscellaneous historical items on july 9 found buyers , a circa 1880 wooden figural bowstand from congo s luba culture was pushed by two telephone bidders to 61 million with fees it is one of just eight works attributed to the warua master , who worked for luba royalty , and fetched more than double the high estimate and the secondhighest auction price paid for an african work of art at auction a number of wealthy collectors of modern and contemporary works also have a taste for oceanic and african art this piece did have an aesthetic that appealed to a broader spectrum of buyers , said william robinson , christie s international head of world art , who would not divulge the collecting tastes of either of the telephone bidders it was just a spectacular piece of sculpture
wilmer flores stood in the batter s box in the fourth inning as clayton kershaw began his delivery , rocking back , lifting his leg , and pausing before hurling another nasty pitch toward the plate flores stood there , his bat on his shoulder , and watched three pitches zip by him for strikes the third one , a belthigh fastball , caught the outer half of the strike zone , and flores just stood there , as if in shock kershaw strutted back to the dugout as flores dropped his bat , tossed his helmet and fiddled with his batting gloves while standing in the box , processing what had just happened the often retreated to their dugout thursday looking confused and frustrated they looked as if they were little leaguers trying to hit against an adult , as if kershaw were playing at a different speed than they were kershaw kept a perfect game going for six innings , drawing oohs and ahhs in another team s ballpark the mets eventually hit three singles off kershaw , but otherwise he was perfect he struck out 11 batters , issued no walks , and finished with a completegame shutout and a 30 win over the mets , their 11th shutout loss of the season the mets have one of the worst offenses in baseball this game only reminded them , about a week before the nonwaiver trade deadline , of how dire their situation is when manager wrote his lineup , his no 4 hitter , john mayberry jr , was batting 170 , and the no 5 hitter , eric campbell , was at 179 bartolo colon was batting 147 , a respectable number for a pitcher , but anthony recker , his catcher , was batting 137 four of the eight position players began the season on the fringe of the roster we 're not embarrassed by it , collins said of his lineup collins did not have much of a choice , considering all the players who were missing because of injuries michael cuddyer has been in and out of the lineup , dealing with a bone bruise on his left knee throughout july the medication the mets gave him monday as a last resort made him feel lightheaded cuddyer saw a doctor again thursday and was given more medication the doctor said he thinks hopefully that tomorrow his knee should start feeling a lot better , collins said if the knee does not improve , it appeared that the mets had three options to replace cuddyer they could promote the highly regarded outfield prospect michael conforto they could make a trade or they could try to get by playing campbell , mayberry and kirk nieunwenhuis , who was batting 161 , until they find a better solution general manager spoke with reporters for more than 20 minutes before the game , discussing the state of the team with the deadline looming he hinted that he could make a splashy move for a big name , or do nothing at all he touched on a number of topics he declared he would not trade any of his four young starters jacob degrom , matt harvey , noah syndergaard and steven matz he indicated that he had the authority to add salary and that he would not resort to using prospects as leverage to take on less salary in a trade he was reviewing deals involving players on shortterm and longerterm contracts , role players and those of more significance asked if he had the ability to add a major contract to the payroll , alderson seemed annoyed by the question come on , alderson said when pressed for specifics i think the answer to that is yes , ok \? he finally said none of you will believe me , so i'm not sure why you asked the question and insisted on the answer the first trades before the deadline were made thursday , when the astros dealt for scott kazmir and the pirates acquired aramis ramirez alderson acknowledged that his conversations about trades had started to pick up but when asked if he would consider himself unsuccessful if the team did not make a deal by the deadline , alderson began to temper expectations not as long as we 've worked as hard as i think we need to and have worked the process as hard as we possibly can , he said i do n't want to put us in the position where we make a bad decision on the other hand , we recognize where we are in the standings , what our team s strengths are , what our weaknesses are that s why we 're having conversations but simply adding a body to add a body is probably not going to make it a successful trade deadline , either if alderson does stand pat , he will have a readymade reason two of his better hitters , travis d'arnaud and david wright , are making progress in their rehabilitation d'arnaud is scheduled to return to the lineup sometime next week , and wright is expected to begin baseball activities under the mets' watch when he rejoins the team early next week wright will probably need at least a few weeks to regain his fitness alderson suggested that wright would return this season given the work wright still has ahead of him , alderson did not know when we 'll just have to wait and see , he said

in the nearly six years that marc maron has hosted his popular podcast , wtf with marc maron , this idiosyncratic , inquisitive and selfdeprecating comedian has interviewed hundreds of celebrated standups and entertainers , including louis ck , bob newhart , lena dunham and amy poehler but on friday , mr maron interviewed an altogether different guest who , while highly coveted , is not immediately known for his snappy observations on the absurdities of everyday life president obama mr obama visited mr maron s studio in his home garage for about an hour during a visit to los angeles , for a podcast that will be posted on monday \( an excerpt from the interview is here \) this interview is surely a highwater mark in the career of mr maron , a former air america broadcaster and star of the ifc series maron , though it is an offbeat choice for mr obama , who has previously popped up in such unexpected places as between two ferns , the talkshow parody hosted by the comic actor zach galifianakis mr maron spoke on friday afternoon about the interview , including how it was arranged and what was discussed with mr obama these are edited excerpts from that conversation you finished speaking with the president a short while ago how are you feeling \? how did it go \? i feel good we had a lot to cover i had to honor what i do , and i had to respect what he does he s the president , but i had to try to connect with him personally , in the way that i do with my interviews i think all that happened it was a very varied conversation and of course , with the events of wednesday , that had to be mentioned it was respectful and the right thing to do did you plan to approach the interview in a certain way , and then , in light of the charleston killings , think , i need to approach this differently \? yes , in a way at one point in my life , i used to be part of the political dialogue , as a radio commentator i made a very conscious choice to take myself out of that i just have not really been that attentive i focused what i do along different lines entirely i had to combat my old self , but engage in a conversation that would be worthy of the president i was going to do it my way , engage in a personal way , but he knows all the tricks he s the president i wasn t going to put anything over on him by acting more comfortable than i was but it was weird he came over , he made me very comfortable very quickly he was very engaged he was looking forward to having a nice chat , and i think steamrolled into the conversation very intensely and very quickly , like i do sometimes especially when i m a little nervous but yeah , we were very conscious of what happened in charleston , and that that would be weighing on him i wanted to respect whatever he s going through he lost someone he knew that day how did this even come together \? have you been campaigning for the president to appear on your show \? i never assumed i would talk to the president over time , conversations started happening , with my producer brendan mcdonald , from the white house , about general ideas there were people on his staff who like my show , and somebody within his staff thought it would be a fun thing for him to do but we never thought it would happen then over the last month or so , it became very clear that it might happen i m like , but where am i going to do it \? do i go to the oval office \? do i go to his hotel \? no , they wanted to come to the garage are you kidding me \? are you telling me the president s going to come to my house \? so the motorcade pulled up in front of your house earlier today and he came into the garage \? dude yes it was no simple process secret service checked the parameters yesterday , they put a tent up that ran the length of my driveway , all the way behind my house to the garage today they came and put a tent over where the car was going to pull in there were like 40 secret service people here there were snipers on my neighbor s roof a sniper on my garage roof they had lapd all around the perimeter of the house they have a protocol that occurs and it was occurring in my house now everyone in the world knows where i live , ok and apparently the streets were lined with people for the motorcade i was focusing on just dealing with the situation at hand and trying to have a personal conversation with the president in the midst of this were you given any guidelines or restrictions about what you could discuss with him \? none no guidelines , no restrictions , and we had final edit how did you prepare for the interview \? well , i freaked out like i always do and i became very selfconscious about my knowledge and nuanced sense of what is happening in the world , politically i had to put that aside and figure out what i wanted to talk to him about , personally i think it would be disrespectful if i didn t engage him about his accomplishments and his policy so i did a little homework and i got up to speed i read his first book dreams from my father to get a sense of who he was , even before he had aspirations to the presidency a lot of what drove me is this idea of this selfmade guy that s really how i approach my interviews who is this guy \? and then i had to see if that matched up with the guy in front of me what did you talk about with him \? we talked about racism we talked about gun violence we talked about the affordable care act his disappointments the obstacles of his presidency his family , a little bit how he goes on , day to day , with the same determination and optimism that he s had throughout his presidency the disappointments of the left and the right his successes people s disappointments over what he didn t accomplish \? or his own disappointments over what he didn t do \? i didn t get a sense that he experiences disappointment in that way i got a sense that he s a guy that realizes that growth and progress in a democracy are slow he looks at the big picture specifically , he knows that there s always going to be those voices why didn t you do this faster \? how come you didn t do that \? why are you doing that \? that s the nature of it he just keeps moving though because of his commitment and his vision that he made this country a better place , incrementally did you feel that you could be adversarial with him \? was there anything you challenged him on \? a bit i did refer to the president , on some level , as being middle management , between corporate interests and what can be done for the people i did make reference to that , and he reframed it i don t think i angered him i tried to be as respectful as possible there was no time to really argue policy and have a wellrounded conversation and i don t know if i was the guy to do that i had to accept that did you talk to him about comedy \? we did , towards the end he said his favorites were richard pryor and dick gregory he mentioned seinfeld and said he likes louis ck he thinks louis is a goodhearted guy , despite some of the subject matter did saturday night live come up \? no once you get in a situation like this , it would have been funny for me to honor the show , in a way where i could have brought up lorne michaels i don t know if that should have been a bigger part of the conversation but it wasn t i m in it , and i m sitting there with random scraps of paper and notes and i m sitting there with the president , watching the clock tick by i ve got an hour , and i m like , oh god moving towards that hour and letting him finish his thoughts , when necessary , my thoughts were not , i gotta get this lorne michaels thing in i barely got comedy in i was able to talk about his own sense of being a performer there s a craft to the presidency , not unlike there s a craft to comedy does it seem strange that he did this at all \? over time , we all have to adjust to a changing media landscape some of it is noise and some of it is small , but there s a lot of it out there there s a lot of surprising outlets by which people can communicate and people want to be part of i ve been doing this out of my garage for years , and i ve had plenty of people come up here , at the end of the first year , saying , so this is where you do it \? many times , i ve walked people into my garage and said , this is the future of media and as years went by , fewer people were like , i can t believe this where the hell am i \? they knew exactly where they were this is an extremely fragile moment for the country , two days after the shootings in charleston is there a part of you that thinks , maybe this isn t the time for him to be appearing on this show \? brendan and i never really believed the interview was going to happen until it happened we knew at some point that , if it didn t happen , it was going to be because there s a problem in the country or a problem in the world something horrible happened as that news broke on wednesday night , we were like , it s probably not going to happen the next day , he made his statement and it became clear he was going to move on with his plans he s the president , and he manages a lot of stuff
whatever may have happened over his 14 seasons in , the 34yearold brazilian driver felipe massa is returning to his home grand prix this weekend in possibly the best mindset of his career he is doing so in a car that , while it is a long shot , has an outside chance of taking him to his third victory in his home race , where he triumphed while driving for the ferrari team in 2006 and 2008 that made massa the first brazilian driver to win brazil s grand prix since ayrton senna , in 1993 it also made him a perennial favorite of the home crowd it s really an amazing feeling , to race at home and to use all of this energy from the people , he said it works you see it in football or whatever that playing at home is always better although he is the thirdoldest driver in the series , behind the former world champions kimi raikkonen , 36 , and jenson button , 35 , he is only a few months older than the double world champion fernando alonso , who is also 34 he started racing in formula one a year or two after those drivers , and although he was only 20 at the time , he might be defined as a late developer during his first season , at sauber in 2002 , he was wild , with frequent accidents and spins so the following season he was sent off to be the ferrari team s test driver , in order to gain experience and maturity , as he was under a longterm contract with the italian team in 2004 , he returned to sauber his results at sauber were patchy , but in 2005 he finished 2 points ahead of his teammate , jacques villeneuve , a former world champion in 2006 he joined ferrari as a fulltime driver , becoming the teammate of another world champion , michael schumacher , who had seven drivers' titles massa had two race victories that first year and he was a perfect second driver under schumacher s lead but massa was then suddenly thrown into the role of team leader when schumacher announced his retirement for the following year in 2007 , the team hired raikkonen , who promptly won the title in his first year with ferrari by a single point over lewis hamilton in the final race of the season , in brazil just when it looked as if massa was again going to have to play the second role , he had his finest year in the series in 2008 it was also the most emotional arriving at the brazilian grand prix , the last race of the season , he had a chance to win the title if he won the race and hamilton finished no better than sixth massa fulfilled his side of the contract , taking his second victory in brazil at that moment , hamilton was in sixth place but at the last corner , in wet , slippery conditions , hamilton passed the toyota of timo glock to finish fifth , winning the drivers' title by a single point over massa the brazilian had been the virtual world champion for about 17 seconds the celebration in hamilton s mclaren garage matched the previous celebration in massa s the deflation was almost too much for the emotional brazilian , who appeared crushed on the victory podium luca di montezemolo , the ferrari team director at the time , complimented massa , noting how he had come into his own as a grand prix driver , proving he is worthy indeed of the world title , but also for his maturity and sportsmanship off the track he s a great champion and a great man , he added the following season almost brought tragedy at the hungarian grand prix in august , massa was struck in the head by a spring from the car of his fellow brazilian rubens barrichello massa was lucky to have survived doctors placed a titanium plate in his skull to ensure that no future shock would lead to severe brain damage , and he sat out the rest of the season he returned in 2010 , however , to score second place at the bahrain grand prix , in the first race it looked at as if he was back to his winning ways but it was his new ferrari teammate , alonso , who won that race , and over the next three seasons , opinions began to change again massa was overshadowed by alonso , around whom ferrari decided to build its hopes for a world champion when his contract expired at the end of 2013 , it looked as if massa might be at the end of his career he signed with what was then a weak williams team , a move that did nothing to counter that view but in 2014 , with new rules for hybrid engines and with an entirely rebuilt management team , williams was suddenly a contender again , and massa found a second wind in the past two seasons , he has finished on the podium several times , and scored pole position at the austrian grand prix last year , his first since 2008 most important , massa has held his own against the young and highly rated valtteri bottas of finland , who was rumored to be moving to ferrari massa is currently sixth in the series , to bottas s fourth , but they are only 9 points apart perhaps having matured late , massa has lasted longer what is clear is that he has lost none of his love for racing the most important thing is competition , competing against the others , driving the car , adrenaline , the speed , competing against yourself , he said this is where the passion is this is why i race , this is what i love and especially when you are successful by doing that , this is your gift so i never lost that this is what makes me happy to keep racing , to keep motivated , and to keep working hard physically this is what motivates me to carry on , he added massa said he would continue racing until one of those aspects faded his contract with williams lasts for one more season , so next season will be key to determining his future i think i will stay in formula one as long as i have a team that i am really happy to work with , like williams , he said when you love to work , and you feel important , it gives me more motivation to carry on , he added he may be the thirdoldest driver in the series , but he clearly does n't sound like it the problem is that you stop in formula one very young , massa said so i do n't think really that you lose your value as a racer so maybe i will keep racing
london when owner roman abramovich dismissed jos mourinho as manager in 2007 , it was presumed that the oligarch wanted to win with more style than was being displayed under mourinho but mourinho is back , and the winning is as pragmatic as it ever was when chelsea inched toward reclaiming the english title on saturday with a snatchandgrab victory against , abramovich looked as happy as a child given his first soccer ball the russian leaped out of his seat , highfived his associates and beamed as we rarely have seen him do the impression is that mourinho has taught his boss that winning is the only thing that counts style is for the birds the game was the game that we wanted to play , mourinho said on television after it ended 10 at chelsea s stamford bridge stadium exactly the game we wanted , he repeated we decided to play strategically i know what people can think , but it is three points in the pocket , and we are waiting to be champion from mourinho s words and abramovich s highfives , we can surmise that the remarriage the word mourinho used to refer to his return to london two years ago is satisfying to both parties abramovich , though , said nothing in public when he dispensed with mourinho , nothing when he rehired him and nothing after saturday s win how some of us would enjoy it if abramovich would talk once in a while and if his manager would be the silent one let s get one thing straight the winning goal against manchester united was a thing of beauty oscar , the brazilian midfielder for chelsea , ran with the ball before backheeling it to eden hazard and hazard , who all season long has been chelsea s best player , took it in stride , drew out the goalkeeper david de gea and then sweetly shot it through the legs of the keeper as he rushed toward him quite magnificent , and quite in keeping with the way that hazard has been the creative star on a team that is otherwise built around a solid work ethic , efficiency and obediently sticking to the game plan this is a massive win , said john terry , the chelsea captain you could see the passion from the players we 've not been playing as well as we can , but we 've been grinding out results , and that s the sign of champions the grinding was planned against a united team that has gradually raised itself to third place after a poor start to the season , mourinho positioned two men nemanja matic and kurt zouma , who is normally a center back to anchor the midfield in front of the back line of four defenders their purpose was to snuff out the supply line of united s forward rhythm , to isolate radamel falcao in attack and marouane fellaini as the link player in effect , mourinho eschewed the chance to attack a manchester side weakened by injuries to four defenders it meant the home team had the ball less than 30 percent of the contest it was a waiting game , reminiscent of mourinho s highly successful team of 2007 that side allowed free expression by one decorative winger , arjen robben , who now plays for bayern munich the current team gives similar license to hazard , who most observers expect to be named the outstanding player in the premier league this season when one thinks of the other hugely creative talents in chelsea blue oscar , willian or cesc f bregas , for example it seems a pity to put them into a straitjacket and quite pitiful to see gifted men playing timewasting tactics to run down the clock in their own stadium chelsea has had the look of a champion since the start of this season and should it avoid defeat next weekend against arsenal , which is in second place and on a roll of in all competitions , chelsea will need just two more victories from five games to take the title louis van gaal , the veteran dutch coach who made his debut in english soccer at the age of 63 when he joined manchester united this season , once taught mourinho much of what he knows about management they remain friends and fierce rivals after hearing what mourinho , his former assistant coach at barcelona , said following saturday s game , van gaal retorted everybody can have his opinion , and the winner takes it all the dutchman was smiling , at least outwardly we had three chances in the first half , and chelsea none , he pointed out in the second half we had eight chances to three by chelsea in football it is always the better team that wins did you think that you saw that today \? when it comes to sarcasm , the two coaches are a match but mourinho , and his boss abramovich , are where they want to be chelsea s lead in the premiership is 10 points over arsenal and 11 points above united , with manchester city and liverpool fighting it out for the fourth spot nobody will now catch the blues of stamford bridge arsenal , which struggled to overcome secondtier reading , 21 , in overtime in the fa cup semifinal on saturday , might put off the coronation of chelsea for a week or so and it might do it with a style that is easier on the eye but there are , as every critic keeps on reminding arsenal manager ars ne wenger , no points for style only for wins , or at least for avoiding defeats mourinho is the ultimate winner , not simply in england , but also in portugal , where he is from , and italy and spain he has coached major clubs in those three countries to european or national titles , or both we cannot , and should not , detract from that but when opponents play negatively against his team , mourinho is the first to talk disparagingly about parking the bus when he does it , even on home turf in front of his club s own customers , he grins and is smug about his clever strategy but if abramovich is smiling and handing out highfives , who cares what outsiders think or say \?
chicago just before the festival , the same point in the calendar when jesus gathered his closest followers in the upper room , the rev neichelle guidry jones knelt on the floor of a hyde park apartment here in devout imitation of her savior she grasped a cloth and moved a ceramic basin into place and , in the manner that the gospel of john described , humbled herself to wash the feet of the disciples the disciples were seven young black women who had answered the call to ministry , and ms jones was preparing them to preach on good friday with its image of a crucified christ and its evocation of racial lynchings in this land , there is perhaps no more significant day for the africanamerican church as an institution ms jones lifted a pitcher and poured a thread of water onto the feet of ericka elion , a seminary student it coursed over the veins and calluses , the bony knobs and painted toenails , the imperfect tissue of fallible humanity then ms jones delicately dried ms elion s feet she repeated the ritual six more times , once for each woman as if stricken by the gesture , ms elion gazed unfocused into the middle distance the rev halana l thompson , the assistant pastor of a local church , clamped her eyes closed and gently swayed kentina washington , the chaplain at a retirement community in the suburbs , doubled over with wordless sobs it s my prayer for them and what i know about their lives , ms jones said in the hushed aftermath of the ceremony it s being present , being attentive , letting the spirit speak it s just wanting to be a blessing to my friends ms jones meant those words in concrete as well as ineffable ways as the founder of a group of young black churchwomen , which she named shepreaches , she aspires to ease the difficult path of africanamerican women into the pulpit for the past two years , her signal event has been a good friday service with sermons by seven women this year s preachers range in age from late 20s to early 40s some are ordained , others still in seminary , and their affiliations range across traditionally black denominations what they share in common is that none have served as senior pastors in a field still dominated by men a few had privately doubted their own right to the pulpit until ms jones issued her call i 'd been preaching for more than 10 years , but being part of a movement gave me confidence , said the rev dawnn m pirani brumfield , 37 , who is the director of service and mission at the urban village church in chicago it showed me that i did n't have to hide my gifts in all my other church experiences , i 'd served under men i 'd always been the assistant what i want people to know is that women can do this work in the tradition of black churches , the good friday service is called the seven last words , with seven preachers , almost invariably men , delivering a sermon apiece based on one of jesus' final statements in the gospel narrative in ms jones s version , which she titled a for colored girls gospel , the women s homilies would draw on scripture to address topics like domestic violence , sexual abuse and poverty , as well as activism , agency and joy jesus is typically embodied in an idolizing of maleness , said the rev dr eboni marshall turman , a scholar of the black church at duke divinity school in black churches , women could n't preach because they are not the representation of jesus so for black women to embody jesus is to resist the overarching narrative that women cannot preach , that women cannot embody the jesus reality , that their bodies are opposed to the divine reality , she said for these women , in the preaching moment , to embody the christ , is a bold attack on patriarchy that boldness can be quantified by courtney pace lyons of baylor university showed that even as africanamerican women form about threequarters of black congregants and half of black seminary students , they account for less than 2 percent of senior pastors in black baptist churches the situation is better in some other denominations , such as the african methodist episcopal , which has ordained several female bishops , said the rev dr jacquelyn grant of interdenominational theological seminary in atlanta but most of the women who become pastors , she said , take on smaller , less prestigious pulpits than their male peers ms jones , 30 , grew up amid the revolution of rising expectations for black churchwomen as a teenager in san antonio , she had a female minister at the nondenominational church that her family attended she had male mentors as a graduate student at yale divinity school and has served on the ministerial staff of the rev dr otis moss iii at trinity united church of christ in chicago indeed , he invited her to preach at trinity s maundy thursday service this week yet ms jones felt herself frustrated by the pace and pattern of change newly ordained black women still got shunted into the gender ghetto of the christian education or women s ministry departments of churches the pioneering generation of black female pastors had not created an equivalent to the old boys' network that mentored and groomed young men for church leadership and women s sermons , she felt , needed to receive critiques that were more than just complaints i do n't think my generation is so attracted to the idea of trauma bonding , ms jones said we 've all experienced racism and sexism but a lot of ministry to black women hinges on the assumption that black women stay in the condition of perpetual pain , perpetual brokenness , that we lack the resources and agency to get to the other side i'm determined to tell the other part of the story , about how black women of faith have survived being a millennial herself , ms jones did a millennial sort of thing and formed shepreaches in late 2012 as an online community to her surprise , the group s website received 3 , 000 pageviews on the day it became active through social media , ms jones reached her contemporaries in the chicago area but the breakthrough for shepreaches came in a brickandmortar place rather than cyberspace the group s good friday service in 2014 , its first major public event of any kind , drew a standingroom crowd to a chicago church only one of the preachers from that service , ms pirani brumfield , was on this year s program so , after the footwashing was complete , ms jones offered the newcomers a prayer and advice i just want to empower you all to proclaim , she said do n't hold back tell your story tell our story this is why jesus came and why he rose , so we can tell how we 've overcome
kansas city , mo terry collins stood there in the dugout in this 1970s throwback of a stadium and thought through his fifthinning predicament his stringbean ace , jacob degrom , was on the mound , tossing in the mid90s , with offspeed stuff that darted here and there like a drunken firefly degrom had just begun the inning by walking the leadoff man against this relentless team , that s like sticking your finger in a wood chipper still , all postseason long , this kid pitcher had pulled off houdini escape acts we 've been sitting here raving the last two series that he s gotten himself out of trouble , collins said afterward i just thought it was time we could ride jake and see if we could get him out of that inning here s what happened single , single and a tied score , 11 then degrom calmed himself and got two outs and began to tug at the escape hatch single , single , single three more hits , and it was 41 in the royals' favor the itself was about to tilt two games to none in kansas city s favor , a handsome , if not yet insurmountable , edge the royals are like that persistent dog that chews and chews and chews , and eventually your couch has no legs to stand on you get two strikes on them , and your pain has only begun they begin hacking and fouling off a halfdozen pitches and whacking seeingeye ground balls for base hits as their center fielder lorenzo cain put it , we shorten up and lock in collins , the ' fine manager , spoke after the game of perfectly placed grounders by royals hitters in a manner that suggested he expected this would even out maybe or maybe this is just the way the royals roll you walk over to cain , who stands by his locker and is quick to say that degrom is a fine pitcher but me \? personally \? i saw degrom real well , windup and stretch , cain said guys just lock in , you know \? you have to take his word because to walk across the carpeted hallway to the mets' locker room was to find a lot of guys who did n't lock in on much of anything here in kansas city having spent four games battering the chicago cubs , they could not figure out how to slap so much as a clutch single up the middle yoenis cespedes , the mets' sometimes slugging star , has swung at pitches a foot outside and at eye level , expanding his strike zone until it s the size of kips bay the rookie michael conforto is a fine powerhitting prospect who has not hit since the october moon was in a different house his batting average is 050 conforto s rival for playing time is michael cuddyer , a thoughtful man and a professional hitter unfortunately , cuddyer s bat has done gone and died he has come to the plate 11 times in the postseason , and he has a single hit it was not as if the mets faced an ace at the top of his game on wednesday night royals starter johnny cueto has long , blackandgold dreads and spins and shimmies on the mound like a latterday luis tiant but since coming over from cincinnati , he had started 16 times for the royals before wednesday and compiled an era that is , as the blog royals review , is close to death star exploding alderaan bad yet from first shimmy to last in game 2 , cueto cast a spell on mets batters he finished with a complete game , which in an age of pitch counts is akin to waking through downtown kansas city and spotting a wayward comet note this baffling evening for the mets was rendered stranger still as the republican presidential debate was going on simultaneously , not to mention the openingnight games for many nba teams at points , my twitter feed felt like a ghostbusters outtake , the streams crossing dangerously jeb flailed at a cueto fastball trump was thrown out at second by lebron james , subbing for curtis granderson a total protonic reversal seemed imminent where were we \? the royals are return invitees to this world series ball , and evidence of their intensity of purpose is clear they lost last year in the seventh game , as san francisco giants pitcher madison bumgarner gave a pitching performance for the ages the mets arrived in kansas city with a fine collection of strong young arms it s perhaps fair to wonder , though , if a prolonged season has taken a toll , as these pitchers look a bit fatigued and pumpkinlike in late october reporters put that to collins , postgame he scrunched his face that sounded too much like an excuse collins s charm , however , is that candor tends to bubble to his surface like oil from a well i'm not going to that certainly is a possibility , he said i'm not going to say it s not new yorkers being new yorkers , the quality of the royals registered as a thunderclap of revelation for them as the royals kept ratcheting open the game , eventually to a 71 lead , my fellow provincials began to type disbelieving words so it turns out the royals are good , one new yorker wrote to me knock us over with a feather this was a classic new york epiphany in which we suddenly realized that good , quality things occasionally happen outside our metropolitan region , including baseball teams that beat our own none of which is to suggest that this series is over , and not just because my younger son , aidan , who predicted the mets' precise victory total in the preseason , has taken to calling himself metsradamus and forecasts certain victory on friday evening , the mets will send noah syndergaard , their 100mileperhour lightningbolt thrower of a pitcher , to the mound he s a rookie whose learning process has taken great leaps of late as new york fans no doubt will make a rollicking madhouse of citi field , a reversal cannot be ruled out even history offers hope the 1986 mets lost their first two games at home and came back to win in seven games even if you have a short memory , we just beat an excellent cubs team four games in a row , david wright told reporters after the game so it is n't over except , well , if syndergaard gets off to anything less than a smashing start friday , it could be more over than it appears
rumors began swirling early in the week that dez bryant , the cowboys' star wide receiver , might miraculously return to the field this week after sustaining a broken foot in week 2 the source of those rumors \? none other than the cowboys' owner , jerry jones we 'll take a real good look at him tomorrow and thursday , jones said in it totally depends on how he s doing he had a good end of the week last week he got in some really good work he did n't have much negative response from that work it was strenuous work , the kind that if he can step out here and have a couple of really good days of practice then you could see him go the reality is that it is unlikely bryant will be anywhere near ready to play sunday , giving him more time to spend with he has adopted , which he named
good monday morning , a day of recovery for many of the candidates who were perhaps required by custom and duty to cheat on their diets at the iowa state fair this weekend while most of the candidates move on to a full week , others were busy outside the fair s lively lights , seeking money rather than votes on a highend and touristfilled massachusetts island to glance at the news , most readers would surely think the state fair in des moines was the center of the political universe after all , it is where jeb bush mixed a prenoon beer with a deepfried snickers , where hillary rodham clinton munched a pork chop on a stick and where donald j trump landed his helicopter but if you happened to be spending a few days this month on nantucket , and to have a few thousand dollars to spare , you could see nearly as many candidates senator marco rubio of florida was there on friday , gov chris christie of new jersey and mrs clinton were there on sunday , while mr bush is coming to the island off cape cod in massachusetts on thursday none are fishing for voters and certainly not news media attention they were lured , like many politicians , by the wealthy summer residents and visitors thronging the island s fundraisers the dueling destinations not only represent two very different slices of americana , they also illuminate what are effectively parallel presidential campaigns there

favorite of 25 percent of likely republican primary voters , virtually unchanged from just before the debate showing the biggest gains from fox s previous poll were ben carson , at 12 percent , and mr cruz , at 10 mr bush and mr rubio , who many saw as early favorites , showed signs of weakness mr bush s support dropped to 9 percent from 15 percent in early august , after what many analysts considered to be a lackluster debate performance mr rubio , who got strong marks at the debate , was in a cluster of thirdtier candidates , including gov john kasich of ohio , at 4 percent mr rubio

washington in an important separationofpowers case , the on monday struck down a law that would have allowed american parents of children born in jerusalem to obtain passports saying the children were born in israel the president , rather than congress , must determine national policy on the status of jerusalem , the majority said the decision came against the backdrop of generations of conflict in the middle east and longstanding tensions between congress and presidents on the conduct of foreign policy there the vote was 6 to 3 , with chief justice john g roberts jr and justices antonin scalia and samuel a alito jr dissenting justice anthony m kennedy , writing for five justices , said the court had approached the question cautiously jerusalem s political standing has long been , and remains , one of the most sensitive issues in american foreign policy , justice kennedy wrote , and indeed it is one of the most delicate issues in current international affairs but justice kennedy said the constitution gave the president exclusive authority to determine the nation s stance put simply , he wrote , the nation must have a single policy regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the united states and which are not the nation must speak with one voice , he said , and that voice must be the president s in dissent , chief justice roberts said the majority had taken a bold step today s decision is a first , he wrote never before has this court accepted a president s direct defiance of an act of congress in the field of foreign affairs the case concerned a 2002 law that instructed the state department to record the place of birth as israel in the passports of american children born in jerusalem if their parents requested the designation the law was meant to take a symbolic stand on the status of jerusalem , which has long divided not only israelis and arabs but also congress and presidents of both parties but the executive branch s policy since harry truman s presidency has been to recognize no state as having sovereignty over jerusalem , leaving the issue to be decided by negotiation between the parties to the arabisraeli dispute , the obama administration said in a brief in the case the case , zivotofsky v kerry , no 13628 , was brought by the parents of menachem b zivotofsky , who was born not long after congress enacted the law under the state department s policies , their son s passport says that he was born in jerusalem they sought to have the passport say israel in order to express pride in his birth there , they said president george w bush part of an appropriations bill , but said he would not follow the jerusalem provision because it impermissibly interferes with the president s constitutional authority to conduct the nation s foreign affairs justice scalia announced his dissent from the bench , a rare move indicating bitter disagreement a principle that the nation must have a single foreign policy , which elevates efficiency above the text and structure of the constitution , will systematically favor the president at the expense of congress , he said it is possible that it will make for more effective foreign policy , perhaps as effective as that of bismarck or king george but it is certain that , in the long run , it will erode the structure of equal and separated powers that the people established for the protection of their liberty reaction to the decision in the middle east focused on its bottom line and not on the supreme court s differing conceptions of the separation of powers required by the constitution saeb erekat , the chief negotiator , praised the decision and said it sends a clear message to israel that its policies of colonization are null and void the american embassy is in tel aviv , but mayor nir barkat of jerusalem called on to recognize his city as israel s capital , saying it was particularly important when antisemitism is trying to raise its head just as washington is the capital of the united states , london the capital of england and paris the capital of france , mr barkat said in a statement , so jerusalem was and always will be the capital of israel , and the heart and soul of the jewish people justice kennedy based his opinion on provisions of the constitution authorizing the president to receive foreign ambassadors , to appoint american ones and to make treaties chief justice roberts responded that receiving ambassadors is a presidential duty rather than a power the president does have power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors , the chief justice added but those authorities are with congress , so they hardly support an inference that the recognition power is chief justice roberts wrote that the majority decision would be wrong even if the president s power to recognize foreign governments were exclusive what was at issue , after all , he said , was a notation in a passport the annals of diplomatic history , he wrote , record no examples of official recognition accomplished via optional passport designation justice kennedy wrote that some observers had interpreted passport provision as altering united states policy , leading to protests across the region chief justice roberts responded that giving legal weight to such mistaken reactions is essentially to subject a duly enacted statute to an international heckler s veto justice kennedy wrote that congress was not free to contradict the president s determination about the status of jerusalem even in a notation in a passport this is not to say congress may not express its disagreement with the president in myriad ways , justice kennedy added for example , it may enact an embargo , decline to confirm an ambassador , or even declare war but none of these acts would alter the president s recognition decision justices ruth bader ginsburg , stephen g breyer , sonia sotomayor and elena kagan joined justice kennedy s majority opinion justice clarence thomas voted with the majority to strike down the passport provision , but he did not adopt its reasoning he traded jabs with justice scalia , usually an ally justice scalia wrote that justice thomas s approach would produce a presidency more reminiscent of george iii than george washington justice thomas responded that justice scalia s opinion about the constitution s resolution of conflict among the branches could itself be criticized as creating a supreme legislative body more reminiscent of the parliament in england than the congress in america
new details emerged thursday about the fatal police shooting of a man in pasco , wash , that was captured on video and has resulted in local and federal investigations a spokesman from the tricities special investigations unit , which is examining the case , said the man who was killed , antonio zambranomontes , had not been seen for two weeks by his family relatives have said that mr zambranomontes , 35 , was struggling emotionally , partly because of a split from his wife and children mr zambranomontes had been throwing rocks at cars in a busy intersection on feb 10 officers first tried to subdue him with voice commands and a , according to  a video taken by a bystander showed that mr zambranomontes ran from three officers , who chased him , shooting him from a distance as he turned to them and raised his arms the police have said he did not have a gun or a knife he pleaded guilty last june to assaulting a police officer in january 2014 on thursday , the spokesman for the investigation unit , sgt ken lattin , released a statement saying that the officers had not been wearing cameras and that none were certified spanish speakers , though it is possible that they tried to calm him using some spanish mr zambranomontes was from mexico and did not speak english , his family has said the shooting took place on a crowded street , but only a handful of witnesses have come forward , sergeant lattin said investigators are also looking for additional video of the incident pasco is a city of 68 , 000 that is 56 percent hispanic the shooting of mr zambranomontes prompted protests , and some residents said it emphasized a divide between the growing latino population and the city s largely white power structure , including the police department , which is some have compared the anger in pasco to that over the death of michael brown , an unarmed black man , in ferguson , mo sergeant lattin said the washington state crime lab had received evidence in the shooting and had given it top priority
intense lobbying and heated \( often demagogic and hateful \) rhetoric has made deciding whether to support the iran nuclear deal an excruciating process for many members of congress none have come under more pressure and scrutiny than jewishamerican lawmakers and among those , representative jerrold nadler stands out he represents a district of new york city from the liberal upper west side to ultraorthodox borough park in brooklyn that is believed to have the largest jewish population in the country so it took some courage for mr nadler to announce on friday that he would become the lone jewish democrat from new york to support the agreement , which is expected to come for a vote in congress next month in supporting the agreement negotiated by president obama , he has put himself at odds with new york s senior senator , chuck schumer , as well as prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel and the american israel public affairs committee , a lobby group supportive of mr netanyahu democrat kristen gillibrand , new york s junior senator , also showed courage in endorsing the deal what helps israel and averts another potential holocaust is whatever is most likely to prevent iran from getting a nuclear bomb , mr nadler told the times s alexander burns my conclusion is that this deal of the available alternatives to us , not what might or should have been is the best he acknowledges the deal is flawed but made the point of issuing a 5 , 000word statement to explain why the agreement , announced on july 14 between iran and the major powers , is the best course under the circumstances mr nadler , a liberal lawmaker who has held his seat since 1992 , had prior experience going against the grain of public opinion and official exhortations he voted against approving the use of force in iraq , arguing with great wisdom , as we should all now realize that it was a mistake to remove iraq as a buffer to iranian influence his reward at the time was a barrage of criticism questioning his american patriotism and commitment to israel the fact that he was proven right on that tough foreign policy issue should incline people to respect , if not be persuaded by , his sound reasoning now on the nuclear agreement he has a resolute record of support for israel so the notion that his commitment to that country now is somehow in question is absurd yet mr nadler has become a target of the same unyielding forces that denigrate the nuclear deal , but offer no credible better alternative , and disparage supporters of the agreement with misleading assertions and ugly ad hominem attacks he told the haaretz newspaper that he has been accused , including by rabbis , of betraying the jewish people though he was once considered a shooin for reelection , there is increasing talk among some of his constituents of challenging his hold on the seat he has held for decades if , as expected , congress passes a resolution to disapprove of the iran deal , president obama will veto the measure with the announcement on sunday that senator harry reid , the democratic leader , would support the nuclear agreement , democrats and the white house increasingly believe they will have enough votes to salvage the deal by blocking efforts to overturn the veto that would be a win for the deal but a very shallow one as part of a continuing push to expand the margin , mr obama plans to hold a webcast with jewish leaders this week perhaps mr nadler s act of courage will encourage them to listen to mr obama more carefully
having offered some cautions about overinterpreting the findings of the latest pew religion survey , let me throw that caution to the wind and offer a quick interpretation myself a few times in the past this old column , this recent post i ve played with the idea that we have three major worldviews sharing space in american culture , which you might label biblical , spiritual and secular respectively \( the spiritual category overlaps substantially with the nation of heretics described in my last book \) here s how i tried to sketch this division in the context of the christmas story , hence the references two years back many americans still accept the new testament as factual , believe god came in the flesh , and endorse the creeds that explain how and why that happened and then alongside traditional christians , there are observant jews and muslims who believe the same god revealed himself directly in some other historical and binding form but this biblical world picture is increasingly losing market share to what you might call the spiritual world picture , which keeps the theological outlines suggested by the manger scene the divine is active in human affairs , every person is precious in god s sight but doesn t sweat the details this is the world picture that redstaters get from joel osteen , bluestaters from oprah , and everybody gets from our god bless america civic religion it s christianish but syncretistic adaptable , easygoing and egalitarian it doesn t care whether the angel really appeared to mary the important thing is that a spiritual version of that visitation could happen to anyone including you then , finally , there s the secular world picture , relatively rare among the general public but dominant within the intelligentsia this worldview keeps the horizontal message of the christmas story but eliminates the vertical entirely the stars and angels disappear there is no god , no miracles , no incarnation but the egalitarian message the common person as the center of creation s drama remains intact , and with it the doctrines of liberty , fraternity and human rights inevitably , these labels are overbroad , they don t work for many churches , groups and individuals , and gray areas abound most americans \( of varying levels of religious devotion \) and many religious institutions \( of varying theologies \) straddle the biblical spiritual dichotomy , or would fall on one side of the other depending on who sets up the rubrics and then no matter where you draw the lines , you ll end up with groups that seem like they need to be parsed further with a biblical category that includes believers who hold the koran or the book of mormon sacred with a spiritual category that includes republicanvoting osteen readers and new agey liberals alike with a secular category that includes dawkinsreading militant atheists , jewish agnostics who send their kids to hebrew school , and working class guys who never had much interest in church and stopped going after their divorce yet i still think that at the big picture level , this division is a useful heuristic and one that can be applied to the new pew data in interesting ways basically , the biggest thing we re seeing happening , visible in those declining religious affiliation numbers and the steady rise of the nones , is that part of what i m calling the vast spiritual middle of american life is drifting in a more secular direction i say drifting because disaffiliation is not enough to define a person as secular , and indeed one of the striking things about the unaffiliated is how many of them still have religious habits prayer , belief in god or an afterlife , etc and how few explicitly selfidentify as atheists you can be a none , in other words , and belong more to the metaphysicallyminded american middle than to the postreligious end of the spectrum but the tug toward the fully secular is presumably stronger once institutional bonds are left behind , and on the evidence of the pew numbers that tug seems to be having an effect a quarter of the nones called themselves atheists or agnostics in 2007 , now \( out of a larger total population \) almost a third do , and as my colleague david leonhardt points out you can also see an increase in religious indifference , people declining to call themselves atheists but describing spiritual concerns as simply unimportant , within the nonaffiliated population so in the gray area where the spiritual meets the secularized , secularism seems to be gaining ground then what about the gray area on the other side , where the biblical end of the spectrum meets the oprahosteen middle \? here things are more complicated as i noted in my last post , you don t see a clear trend toward declining churchgoing over the last ten years , which could suggest that most of the ongoing action is among the weaklyattached , and the landscape has stabilized in the zone of stronger attachment and belief \( this is especially plausible if you suspect that the pew data showing steep catholic decline is an outlier \) but if you look at evangelical christianity , the demographic for which the biblical label fits particularly well , you do see an interesting churn the evangelical population is holding steady or increasing slightly in the pew data \( a fact that evangelicals have not been shy in pointing out \) , but evangelical denominations \( the southern baptists , most notably \) are plateauing and losing ground while nondenominational churches gain instead so in that sense evangelicalism is not a complete exception to the pattern of institutional weakening that s more visible in the mainline and somewhat visible in catholicism and for the future , a lot depends on the direction the growing nondenominational evangelicalism ends up taking are these newer independent churches indistinguishable in theology and ecclesiology from conservative denominations , as joe carter suggests , and therefore just an extension of evangelical christianity as it currently exists \? or might some of them be trending , absent denominational and confessional ties , in the direction of an osteenish prosperity theology or a rob bell oprahism or something else that starts out light on doctrine and seekersensitive and ends up doctrinefree , still biblical in name but spiritual in content \? if it s the former , then what pew is showing really is mostly just movement on the spiritualtosecular end of the religious spectrum , which might polarize the country further but which isn t reshaping the landscape of regular practice and belief but in the latter scenario , where the modest drift away from evangelical denominations is a harbinger of a drift away from evangelical theology and orthodoxy , then the shift pew is showing might be bigger more of a fullspectrum change , in which the entire country s religious norms are swinging even further away from the traditional expressions of christian faith
london as europe basks in good feelings over its generosity to thousands of migrants and asylum seekers last weekend , critical voices from the political right and far right are poised to become among the biggest beneficiaries of the continuing flow parties that have been growing in opposition to immigration , the influence of islam and the european union seized on the decision by austria and germany to welcome the migrants , pointing out the difficulty of now shutting the migrant tap and after the , the image of a european union seemingly incapable of defending its borders , while trying to impose mandatory quotas on nations for , fit euroskeptics' portrayal of brussels as a european union capital at once incompetent and domineering germany , , and austria deserve great credit for their willingness to accept refugees , but elsewhere on the continent the reaction ranges from passivity to outright hostility , said michael haltzel , a visiting senior fellow at the finnish institute of international affairs who advised joseph r biden jr , now vice president , when he served in the senate there is a considerable danger of overload and i fear that the political beneficiaries in many countries will be rightwing ultranationalists carl bildt , sweden s former foreign minister , expressed some of the anxiety felt by governing parties when he said that at the end of the day , every country is nervous about this large group of new migrants , though some pretend not to be right now there is a tendency to blame everyone else , he said , but this will be a challenge to every country the process of integration into a western society is difficult and takes time , mr bildt said it s far more than providing the first tent even in sweden , he noted , which has been the european country most open to syrian refugees and asylum seekers , the antiimmigration , antieuropean union sweden democrats are now ahead of the two largest parties in the opinion polls with about 25 percent , after having of the vote in last september s elections it s a tremendous breakthrough for us , tommy nilsson , party manager for southern sweden , told the daily telegraph there s too much immigration and too many beggars from eastern europe people are starting to realize that this is a serious problem for sweden the new rightist government in denmark has taken out advertisements in the lebanese press warning refugees not to come , that the government has toughened immigration laws and cut benefits in france , in a speech on sunday to her national front party , which warns about islam , immigration and a powerful germandominated brussels , marine le pen accused germany of opening its doors to refugees to exploit them for cheap labor , while imposing its immigration policies on its neighbors germany seeks not only to rule our economy , it wants to force us to accept hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers , she said in marseille referring to the in turkey and other asylum seekers , all at the hands of human traffickers , she accused european politicians of exploiting the death of the unfortunate in these trips organized by mafia they show pictures , they exhibit the death of a child without any dignity , just to blame the european consciences and make them accept the current situation the syrian civil war is now in its fifth year , and the more than four million syrians have fled the country and are registered as refugees , while another 65 million are internally displaced , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees there are more than 19 million syrian refugees in turkey alone , another 11 million in lebanon and more than 629 , 000 in jordan europe cannot take them all in germany , chancellor voiced something close to pride on monday that germany is now seen as a desirable and welcoming destination for refugees that is something very valuable , if you look at our history , she said but many fear a backlash there have been more than 200 attacks on asylum seekers or their shelters this year in germany in the pretty south german town of rottenburg am neckar , officials are investigating as possible arson a fire that broke out at 2 am monday , injuring six people , in a facility housing 84 a day earlier , even the partners in ms merkel s centerright bloc , the christian social union , openly criticized her for allowing in tens of thousands of migrants from hungary and austria that sends the wrong signal to individual countries , said gerda hasselfeldt , the party s leader in the federal parliament the csu welcomed a government decision late sunday to reduce cash allowances for refugees as a victory for their harder line there will be less incentive in the future for unfounded applications for asylum , said the party s general secretary , andreas scheuer sigmar gabriel , the leader of the social democrats and vice chancellor , acknowledged that beyond the cheers and handouts of chocolates and toys , there were what he called very real worries , fears and conflicts we have to be realistic about this from the start to avoid disappointments , he said we 'll manage to take in 800 , 000 this year , accommodate and integrate them , too but it is also clear for everyone that that cannot repeat every year germany so far has little trouble with farright political parties the nationalist alternative for germany has split the antiimmigrant marches have also died down but neonazis at an asylum facility at heidenau , near dresden , last month in austria , arson attacks are rare but a strong populist party , the rightwing freedom party , has made noticeable gains in the months of refugee crisis austria expects the same proportion of asylum applications , 1 percent of the population , as germany in bellwether elections in vienna in october , the freedom party now threatens to outperform the social democrats , making inroads particularly among lower classes with strident antimuslim rhetoric some observers believe the sympathy shown to refugees may have tipped the scales away from the rightists these feelings are transitory , of course , but they wo n't fade without leaving some trace , said georg hoffmannostenhof , a columnist for the centerleft weekly profil austrians have traditionally welcomed migrants and felt good doing so this weekend , particularly since almost none of the arriving thousands planned to stay , he said for us , this feeling of doing good has come almost for free at least for the time being the issue is sensitive in britain , too , which last year had net immigration of 330 , 000 people and where prime minister david cameron is under pressure from his own party and from the uk independence party to bring down the numbers or withdraw from the european union under public pressure , mr cameron has now agreed to take up to 20 , 000 syrian refugees from camps in the region over the next five years as a humanitarian gesture , and will increase to 1 billion pounds a year humanitarian aid to syria mr cameron has promised a referendum on continued british membership in the european union by the end of 2017 , but possibly to take place next autumn but what appears to be a european mess and more immigration has been a boon for those opposed to continued british membership mr bildt , of sweden , says that in the long run , the european union will come up with some better solutions but we have to find a coherent european response controlling the outer border of schengen is vital to the system , he said , referring to the passportfree zone within europe it is uncomfortable but necessary , and it needs to be done
the republican presidential candidates were full of tax talk at this week s debate but none has a tax plan coherent enough to be the basis of a substantive discussion , let alone one that could meet the nation s challenges take , for example , the issue of how much revenue any plan would raise or lose all of the republican plans focus on tax cuts , so losses are all but inevitable quickanddirty calculations of proposals from jeb bush , donald trump , marco rubio and ted cruz show red ink running into the trillions of dollars yet the candidates assert , against historical evidence , that revenue losses from tax cuts will be offset by economic growth ted cruz invoked the reaganera tax cuts as a model for success for his 10 percent flattax proposal in fact , president reagan raised taxes to close the budget deficit that opened up after he cut them in 1981 offered his muddled proposal for a tax equal to 15 percent of gross domestic product , saying it would be appealing to everyone once he put all the facts down the tax proposals from jeb bush , donald trump and marco rubio , while not as fantastical as those of mr cruz and mr carson , all make big and broad cuts , mostly to benefit the wealthiest americans , including an end to the estate tax , cuts in tax rates and enhanced tax breaks for investments the only way the republican candidates could ever pay for such large tax cuts would be by slashing big spending programs , namely , medicare and social security all of these candidates deny fiscal reality in the next 10 years , revenues will need to increase by 40 percent simply to keep federal spending even , per capita , with inflation and population growth additional revenues will be needed to pay for health care for the elderly , transportation systems and other obligations , as well as for newer challenges , including climate change and interest on the national debt will surely rise because interest rates have nowhere to go but up in light of these needs , taxes have to go up the reality is that income tax increases can be prudently imposed only on the wealthy at this point , because only they have had meaningful income gains in recent decades the democratic candidates have acknowledged this and have called for highend tax increases , while keeping proposed tax cuts targeted on low or middleincome americans they have also called for new taxes on financial transactions most important , their tax plans are part of broader economic proposals to raise wages , including support for a higher minimum wage , unions , expanded profitsharing and employee ownership responsible policy for the near term demands tax increases on individuals and sectors that can bear them there is no room or rationale for acrosstheboard tax cuts , no matter what the republican candidates say

washington the two young men who spent the night at a nearby motel with an older man and stole his car on monday morning may not have known exactly where they were going but they sped into a special highway exit reserved for employees of the national security agency the agency , the country s largest and most secretive intelligence organization , is protected by its own police force on a sprawling maryland campus and is on permanent alert against intruders the encounter ended with both men shot , one fatally , by agency security personnel , the authorities said there s still a lot of investigating to do , said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the episode but it seems very possible that they did n't set out to go to nsa officials said they found cocaine and at least one firearm in the stolen ford escape suv , which was perhaps why the driver did not obey orders from nsa officers to stop they said both young men were wearing women s clothing officials identified the wounded passenger in the stolen car as kevin fleming , 20 , of baltimore the name of the driver , who was pronounced dead at the scene , was not disclosed by late monday government officials in europe and the united states have been especially wary of terrorist attacks in recent months , with the islamic state and the yemen branch of al qaeda both calling on devotees in the west to lash out but surely none of the myriad counterterrorism briefings for the nsa staff had prepared security officers for this two men , dressed as women , driving up to the nsa employee checkpoint at fort meade , off maryland route 295 , the baltimorewashington parkway initial reports suggested that the men were shot as they tried to crash the secure entrance but in a statement on monday afternoon , jonathan freed , an nsa spokesman , described a more complicated encounter mr freed said the car approached an nsa gate shortly after 9 am , and the driver failed to obey an nsa police officer s routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus the vehicle failed to stop , and barriers were deployed , he said after that , the car accelerated toward an nsa police vehicle blocking the road nsa police fired at the vehicle when it refused to stop the two men s vehicle crashed into the police car , the statement said one nsa police officer was injured in the crash and was taken to a hospital the incident has been contained and is under investigation , said col brian p foley , fort meade garrison commander we continue to remain vigilant at all of our access control points an fbi spokeswoman , amy j thoreson , said at midday , we do not believe it is related to terrorism for much of the morning , however , the sketchy news reports from nsa suggested the possibility of a terrorist assault dozens of emergency vehicles rushed to the scene guards with automatic weapons patrolled the area television networks dispatched helicopters to film the chaotic scene from above but as investigators pieced together the prelude to the fatal encounter , they found a far more banal sequence of events the law enforcement official , who said he was not authorized to speak on the record about the continuing inquiry , said the owner of the ford escape had picked up the two younger men on sunday night and taken them to a motel in elkridge , md on monday morning , when the car owner , who is about 60 years old , was in the motel bathroom , the two younger men decided to steal the escape where they intended to go was uncertain , but they exited maryland 295 at the special nsa exit , which is closed to the public fbi agents were on the scene for several hours on monday , interviewing witnesses along with the nsa s police force , and a bureau forensic team was collecting evidence at the crime scene , ms thoreson said the , which eavesdrops on foreign communications , has always tried to operate out of public view , though with about 35 , 000 employees it is the largest united states spy agency it has drawn unprecedented public attention since 2013 , when a former nsa contractor , edward j snowden , released thousands of classified documents and accused the agency of violating the privacy of americans and foreigners the agency s campus was open to car traffic for decades but after the 2001 terrorist attacks , security was tightened , and access , through gates operated by armed guards , is now limited to employees and precleared visitors monday s episode was involving gunfire at the agency a beltsville , md , man , hong young , a 35yearold former prison guard , was arrested march 3 in connection with a series of random shots fired near public and commercial buildings , including one at the nsa the police said no one was seriously hurt in those episodes , though at least one man was grazed by a bullet while walking near a mall in that case , too , the authorities say there was no evidence of terrorism relatives and officials say mr young appears to have been suffering from mental illness and had no political motive

senator marco rubio of florida surprised some democrats and moderate republicans last week when he said during the republican presidential debate that he opposed abortion even in cases where rape or incest were involved he had previously backed legislation allowing those exceptions though many abortion opponents applauded the bill , some groups were frustrated with mr rubio for what they saw as compromised values in 2013 , mr rubio cosponsored legislation that would have banned abortions more than 20 weeks into a pregnancy the bill , which ultimately failed , did grant exceptions in cases of rape or incest during subsequent interviews this week , mr rubio explained that his primary goal was to reduce the number of abortions , and that exceptions are not a dealbreaker when it comes to backing a bill i ll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions , mr rubio said on nbc s meet the press and there are those that have that exception what i ve never done is said i require that it must have or not have exceptions mr rubio added that cases of pregnancy through rape were rare , and that medical treatment can make them rarer still other senators who oppose abortion and every prolife group in america backed the law that he cosponsored , he said groups such as national right to life and the family research council did support the bill , on the grounds that it represented progress bob van der platt , president of the family leader , said that while legislation with no exceptions is the gold standard , the social conservative organization supports bills that will save babies even if they are not perfect several other antiabortion groups , however , were angered that mr rubio , and others who claim to support their cause , did not take a clear and uncompromising zeroabortions stand \( mr rubio has also supported legislation that did not grant any exceptions \) the fact that marco rubio is willing to support these bills renders his opposition moot , said rebecca kiessling , president of save the 1 , an advocacy group that opposes abortion in all cases it s useless because he s not willing to take a stand on it ms kiessling said that lawmakers who compromise on abortion legislation , despite their good intentions , neglect the suffering of unborn children conceived through violent means dan becker , president of the personhood alliance and the georgia right to life group , concurred while he applauded the case that mr rubio makes against abortion , he argued that his actions do not live up to his words we re never going to be able to establish legal protection for all classes of human life while allowing and acknowledging exceptions within the movement , mr becker said , saying that many state groups opposed the 2013 bill , which mr rubio sponsored with 39 other senators abby johnson , founder of the antiabortion group and then there were none , said that she thought candidates such as the former governors rick perry and mike huckabee had the strongest records on abortion , and that there should not be shades of gray when addressing the matter of life and death my goal is not to reduce abortions , it s to end abortion , she said as long as we continue to settle , we will never get what we want under pressure from both sides , mr rubio continues to defend the bills he backed asked if the senator would support legislation with exceptions in the future , alex conant , his spokesman , said , yes , of course
growing up catholic in the 1980s , i attended a number of bostonarea churches , each a snapshot of a religious community in flux an africanamerican parish that had once been baptist , a historically irish parish making room for immigrants from vietnam , a suburban parish whose acoustic guitar hymns made it virtually indistinguishable from protestant churches down the road at other times , my family worshiped with conservative anglicans , liberal congregationalists and assorted charismatics after i left home for college , when a favorite professor led shabbat services at the campus hillel , i attended those , too later , i dabbled in buddhism , got married in a presbyterian church and wrote a dissertation on yiddish literature at a jesuit university what does that make me , religiously speaking \? one answer might be american to live in a country as pluralistic as the united states is inevitably to be influenced by a grab bag of beliefs thou shalt reconsider assumptions you held as a child and remain open to new ideas might as well be the first commandment of our national faith yet according to a major study on america s changing religious landscape released last week by the , my eclectic spiritual formation has also made me an unwitting member of the nones in this and other recent surveys , we who check no single box when it comes to religion are considered part of an unaffiliated population whose resistance to such classification has become a tidy category all its own the rise of the religiously unaffiliated , by pew s accounting , has been so swift \( up more than six percentage points of the total population in seven years \) , and the simultaneous decline among members of catholic and protestant churches so severe \( down about the same when combined \) , that coverage of the survey has largely presented the religious lives of americans as numbers on a score card as usa today put it , christians drop , nones' soar religion , however , is not a zero sum game just as any individual s life might include periods of greater and lesser religious interest , every tradition is home to remarkable diversity of belief and practice church pews may hold nonbelievers a chanter of mantras may still recall the bat mitzvah prayers of her youth to claim one religious identity is not necessarily to forsake all others , no matter what a pollster s multiple choice options might imply the pew study itself acknowledges this , and it does so mainly as it applies to nonaffiliation nones , who according to the study now account for nearly 23 percent of all americans , are made up of people who describe themselves as atheists , agnostics or nothing in particular within these denominations of the unaffiliated , there are in fact deep theological divisions though the survey s nones include those who have little use for belief or the acts associated with it , others in the category believe in god , pray at least occasionally and think of themselves as spiritual people while the prospect of a future inquisition begun by the orthodox church of the believing nones against the heretical nothing in particular sect sounds like a satire of the whole exercise of quantifying something as elusive as belief , the use of such categories is a reminder that the history of religion is rife with seemingly trivial differences that morphed into epochal debates american religious history especially has been shaped by sagas of minor disagreements revealing hidden rifts that shift power from dominant beliefs to those on the margins this history suggests that , despite the headlines to the contrary , we are not necessarily seeing a period of religious decline rather , this may be just the latest in a series of moments when more americans are intent on customtailoring their religious identities the pew numbers support this at least a third of americans today do not maintain the affiliation with which they were raised change of a similar magnitude marked america s first period of religious upheaval , the 18th century s great awakening then , too , another quickly growing portion of the population was leaving traditional ways behind called the new lights , as opposed to the old lights of traditional belief , they replaced what one minister called the old rotten and stinking routine of religion with hugely popular openair revivals , building on longsimmering dissatisfaction with existing worship styles to become newly ascendant denominations many of these churches are those that appear to be losing numbers to the nones today the man often credited with jumpstarting this new phase of american religious life , the itinerant evangelist george whitefield , was known for sermons calling into question the divisions between christians , which was as close as anyone at the time might get to praising disaffiliation standing on a balcony in philadelphia , the city in which benjamin franklin once estimated that whitefield could reach a crowd of 30 , 000 with his unamplified voice , the orator called out to the sky to ask father abraham who could be found in heaven any episcopalians \? no whitefield preached any presbyterians \? no any baptists \? no have you any methodists , seceders or independents there \? no , no he shouted with dramatic exasperation , why , who have you there \? the answer he provided , as if in the voice of abraham himself we do n't know those names here surely gave solace to any believing nones who heard him more recently , americans' desire in the 1970s and '80s to devise spiritual identities apart from traditional categories was labeled sheilaism by the sociologist robert bellah , for a woman called sheila who believed in god , did not go to church , but trusted her own internal voice to direct her on a spiritual path many of today s nones are yesterday s sheilas , and some of them may be spiritual descendants of those new lights whose innovative ways of being \( and not being \) religious established trends in american belief nearly three centuries ago the rising and falling preference for the open air of unaffiliation is not only not new , it is exactly how religion in america has been periodically enriched and expanded from the beginning it s too soon to tell what the continuing negotiation between belief and unbelief described in the pew study will bring , but the picture it provides of religious communities in flux suggests that the next great awakening a transformation of the religious character of the nation as radical as it is unexpected might be led by those with too many spiritual influences to choose just one
following sunday s finale of the jinx the life and deaths of robert durst on hbo , questions have arisen about the timeline of events presented in the documentary \( gawker has a particularly detailed account here \) whether it s because of those unanswered questions or for other reasons , the director andrew jarecki has canceled previously scheduled appearances on the tonight show and msnbc s all in with chris hayes , as well as with other media outlets  the documentary series finale centered on a dramatic interview in which mr durst , the real estate heir implicated in one disappearance and two deaths , was confronted with handwriting evidence that appeared to connect him to the killing of his friend susan berman in 2000 after the interview , when he walked into a restroom still wearing a live microphone , he was recorded saying to himself what the hell did i do \? killed them all , of course on saturday , before the episode was shown , mr durst was arrested in new orleans in connection with ms berman s death people associated with the production have told the new york times that the interview took place in april 2012 many viewers who watched sunday night s episode , however , assumed that the interview took place sometime after mr durst s august 2013 arrest for trespassing at his brother douglas durst s property the episode shows footage of mr durst exiting court after being bailed out assuming that the dramatic interview shown in last night s episode did indeed take place in april 2012 16 months before the arrest here s my best guess as to how the seeming conflict can be reconciled , given that even in our own interview with mr jarecki , we could not pin down a precise timeline the early parts of the episode are focused on the filmmakers frustrating attempts to schedule the final interview , which mr durst continually delays first he claims to be in spain \( which is apparently a lie \) , before simply deciding he doesn t want to participate at all then , in a dramatic scene , the filmmakers learn of his arrest voiceovers and older footage establish that the arrest stemmed in part from their own work mr durst had violated an order of protection taken out by douglas durst in 2012 , following a filming session for the documentary during which mr durst was taken to various locations associated with the durst family what comes next , at about the 19minute mark , is a scene in which mr jarecki listens to a voice message from mr durst that refers to walking up a stoop and then speaks by phone with a lawyer about sharing footage this , he tells someone off camera , gives us a lot of leverage in the next sequence , we hear mr durst saying , i am ready to be filmed none of these scenes are dated onscreen , but as a viewer , based on the flow of events , it s natural to assume that the voice message about the stoop and mr jarecki s discussion of sharing footage are in reference to mr durst s august 2013 arrest it then seems to follow that mr durst s agreement to do the final interview also comes after that arrest but it s also possible that the telephone message , and the discussion with the lawyer , took place in 2012 , at the time that douglas durst was asking for the order of protection this would fit with a timeline in which the final interview was conducted in april 2012 \( in an earlier scene in which the filmmakers are actively pursuing the interview , at about the 14 50 mark , a calendar on the wall is turned to january 2012 , a year in which martin luther king jr day fell on monday , jan 16 \) in this scenario , the episode was edited in such a way that the action jumped ahead a year and a half to the trespassing arrest in august 2013 and then back to the interview negotiations in 2012 , thereby creating a false impression about when the interview took place without any further comment from mr jarecki \( who has released a statement that reads , given that we are likely to be called as witnesses in any case law enforcement may decide to bring against robert durst , it is not appropriate for us to comment further on these pending matters \) , one possibility is that there was a desire on the filmmakers part to include the 2013 arrest in the story , but that there was no natural place to put it , given that the real story arc of the documentary ended in 2012 in that case , putting it where they did made some sense because of its connection to the 2012 events , but it was a tenuous connection and the result was a confusing timeline the lack of clarity in the episode about when the interview took place wouldn t seem to have any bearing on the realworld case involving mr durst , and it doesn t really change any of the facts or conclusions of the documentary but for a highly wrought and publicized work of narrative nonfiction , fostering a misleading impression about the timing of such an important series of events would be a significant lapse the question of whether chronology has been obscured or fudged for dramatic effect comes up often in the documentary field if that happened here , it will leave an unusually large number of viewers feeling cheated
tommy caldwell and kevin jorgeson have completed  on the 19th day , caldwell and jorgeson , completing a quest that included years of planning and that many considered the most challenging rock climb in the world dozens of family members and friends greeted the climbers when they reached the top at 3 25 pm on a cloudless day they are the first to free climb every inch of the 3 , 000foot in a single expedition , long considered impossible , using only their hands and feet to pull themselves up ropes were merely safety devices to break the occasional fall by virtue of its scale and difficulty , the climb was considered by some to be the most difficult ever accomplished about three dozen people are waiting at the top , mostly friends and family at front of the group is caldwell s wife , rebecca \( she ultimately decided not to bring their 20monthold boy , fitz \) jorgeson s girlfriend , jacqui becker , and his father , eric , are also near the front of the group preparing to greet the climbers upon their arrival , the climbers will receive two trophies purchased at a vintage story by one of caldwell s friends a bowling trophy and a preaching trophy there are also several bottles of sparkling wine nearby the top of el capitan is not flat , so there will be no cartoonlike arrival no hand appearing on the ledge from the abyss below the vertical wall has no sharp edge at the top , but gives way to a steep slab of granite , sprinkled with crumbling rocks and small pines and shrubs a dropped ball 100 yards from the cliff would bounce and roll downhill and then plunge out of sight the climbers are expected to finish the last pitch and perhaps scramble or crawl the last few feet to their awaiting friends and families an hour ago , there were about a dozen people a few reporters , cameramen and representatives from the climbers' sponsors , who are trying to manage whatever reception the climbers receive a group of friends and family climbed up the east ledges , about a threehour hike and climb up fixed ropes , and jorgeson s father , eric , hiked the eightmile trail that passed upper yosemite falls and climbs 3 , 600 feet to the back side of el capitan the reporter john branch hiked an eightmile trail to get up there , departing at 3 30 am and arriving about five and a half hours later the trail ascended 3 , 600 vertical feet , and now john has a sweeping view of the yosemite valley many of the climbers' family and friends are taking an alternate route one suitable for experienced climbers it s known as the east ledges , a series of fixed ropes that takes less time than the hike but requires some climbing skills among those on the way now via the east ledges is the climber alex honnold , who is carrying tommy caldwell s 1yearold baby , fitz the weather is clear in the yosemite valley , john says , the sun illuminating el capitan s southeastern face , known as the dawn wall and kevin hope to reach the summit wednesday , becoming the first ever to free climb the route in a single push they reached the small ledge of the ship s bow on tuesday night , leaving them perhaps 500 vertical feet from the top by the standards of other pitches on the dawn wall , the four remaining pitches are not extremely difficult , but they are relatively unfamiliar to the climbers , who last spent time on the upper parts of the wall several years ago they woke in the portaledges to temperatures near freezing , but the forecast calls for the mid50s by midday , when the climbers hope to complete their 19day trek veteran rock climbers who have done this sort of thing well , perhaps not quite this difficult all over the world , originally from estes park , colo , was named one of for 201415 is from santa rosa , calif no one has ever freeclimbed the dawn wall route on el capitan free climbing means they are using ropes and other gear , but only for safety they are not actively pulling up on bolts or other equipment to help their ascent \( that s known as aid climbing \) what makes the dawn wall so special is that it s almost not possible , the renowned climber alex honnold said the hardest pitches on the dawn wall are harder than i 've ever climbed honnold is famous for freesolo climbing , which means he does not use any ropes at all but he has never attempted the dawn wall tom evans , a climber who has chronicled pursuits at el capitan for years through his camera lens and , said that only about 13 of el capitan s climbing routes had been free climbed the dawn wall , so named because its southeast orientation catches the first light of morning , is far harder than any of the others , climbers said yes , many times , but their ropes prevent them from falling too far major injuries are still a concern , since it is common to slam against the wall on a fall there are about 100 routes up el capitan , first summited from the valley floor in 1958 the tip of el capitan is about 3 , 000 feet up from the base there are about 31 pitches , or sections , of varying difficulty and length in the dawn wall route warren harding and dean caldwell \( no relation to tommy \) were the first to climb dawn wall , in 1970 , using ropes and countless rivets over 27 days they endured a treacherous fourday storm and made national news they also turned down the national park service s attempt to rescue them , offering their wouldbe saviors wine instead we received a lot of questions from readers about rock climbing in general and about the dawn wall effort specifically so we had two worldclass climbers , alex honnold and beth rodden , field some questions if one of the climbers ca n't get to the top , do they rappel all the way down \? if they are injured , how do they get rescued \? they will both be able to get to the top , it s just a question of whether or not they will both be able to free climb the route both of them are incredibly talented climbers that can either ascend the fixed ropes to the summit or aid climb if they cannot free climb the route yosemite search and rescue is very talented if they got seriously injured but again , they are both extremely talented and competent , so i think that is a slim chance can you guys explain how tommy caldwell and kevin jorgesen will measure their success on this dawn wall free climb attempt \? i think success will be both of them free climbing the wall anything less than a team ascent would be hugely disappointing , though i'm sure they are open to all potential scenarios but they both hope to free the wall is this a new route , and if so has tommy named it yet \? how many rope lengths is it and how many vertical feet altogether would you estimate it is from base of the cliff to the high point \? i'm pretty sure they 're just calling it the dawn wall or the free dawn wall , to differentiate it from the aid routes it s probably about 3 , 000 feet from the bottom to top , though some of the climbing is horizontal , so they actually climb more than that , i think back to how they will measure whether this will be a successful free climb ascent is the measure of success that each member of the climbing team tommy and kevin climb each pitch without falling \? in other words , are an unlimited number of falls allowed on this multiday attempt , so long as the bottom line is each climber ultimately does climb each pitch without aid and without falling \? yes , as many falls as it takes , as long as they ultimately free climb each pitch without falling it seems to me that the mental strength required to complete a climb of this sort is even more impressive than the extreme physical difficulty of each pitch periods of almost inhuman focus and concentration surround by hours and hours of nothing waiting for parts to heal , staying limber and ready for the next pitch could be incredibly tedious and boring and alongside that , there is fear to surmount , anxiety about the prospect of failure , etc i 'd love to hear alex and beth s thoughts on this , their own techniques for dealing with this sort of thing , and , to the extent they know , how caldwell and jorgeson each deal with the mental side of this battle with el cap there is definitely mental strength involved , but maybe not as much as you think yes , i'm sure they 're anxious about failure and conditions and weather and all those things but they definitely are n't feeling any fear about the actual climbing they 've worked on the route for seven years they 're well prepared both physically and psychologically yes , it must be really hard for them to maintain their psyche and motivation while spending entire days resting their skin not being able to move at all must be tedious , and i'm sure they 're pretty tired but they are climbing what will probably be the biggest route of their lives i'm sure it s not that hard to stay motivated if kevin sends the dyno pitch , does tommy come back and try to do it , too \? it s my understanding that the dyno is part of the original dawn wall line it is also a much cooler movement and is not a giant loopdeloop top rope would n't kevin s ascent then become the stylistically better of the two \? the dyno is definitely a cooler looking way to climb that section , but whether you jump across a blank section or climb around it , either way you 're free climbing it style can be argued any way you want yes , dynos look cool but either way is valid , and considering few people in the world will ever be able to do the dyno , the circle around makes a lot of sense generally a first ascentionist chooses the path of least resistance in this case , they 've both chosen what they consider the easier way to each their own how does a climber decide to make a leap or go around the leap in this section \? they decide based on their own personal strengths and abilities in tommy s case , the jump is really , really hard , so it makes more sense for him to go around but kevin is naturally better at that kind of jump , so for him it makes more sense to jump than have to climb in a long and difficult 100foot circle basically it s personal choice , depending on what seems easier how do tommy and kevin belay each other when they are separated by several pitches \? they have fixed lines on the wall so they can commute up and down between the particular pitches so they are belaying each other , just moving back and forth for each climber how are anchor points established in the wall in very hard to reach points on the wall \? does someone come from the top down \? some of the anchor points follow the old aid route line , others have been established by the free climbers most free routes these days try to follow the no hands stance approach this means that at the end of each pitch , you are able to get into a stance where you can stand without hands and set up your belay this allows for the entire route to go free with zero points of aid hypothetically if you set an anchor at a hanging belay \( one where you could n't stand without hands \) then there would be a section of wall , however small , that you did n't free climb , where you had to hang on the rope to move upward after you reach the no hands stance , you are able to hang on the belay some pitches are long , as in a rope length which is approximately 180200 feet others are shorter where it makes sense because of rope drag , etc is there a bigger team accompanying caldwell and jorgensen other than the extra photographer \? how did caldwell climb to top of pitch 20 without jorgensen belaying him \? when caldwell climbs back to the top of pitch 20 after helping belay jorgensen will he use aid on his reascent so he wo n't wear himself out \? there have been 2 or 3 cameramen on the wall with them each day , some shooting video and some shooting still photos kevin did belay tommy on all the pitches , they were able to descend their fixed lines back to their camp at night i would imagine tommy will jumar \( ascend the rope not the rock \) behind kevin to reach his high point did tommy relocate his ledge after climbing pitch 17 and 18 , and or 19 and 20 \? or does he keep coming back to the same base camp \? what can you tell me about their approach to shoes \? how long do they use a pair \? do they refile the soles for better edging \? he did go back to the same camp i'm not sure the duration of approach shoes i do n't understand how 1 caldwell is multiple pitches above jorgenson at this point in free climbing , do n't they have to ascend pitch by pitch together \? 2 caldwell can complete the climb on his own without jorgenson does n't one have to manage the rope for the other as he climbs upward \? 1 in the ideal world you ascend the pitches together , what we climbers call swapping leads where one person leads the pitch cleanly then the other follows it cleanly you would alternate who leads and follows each pitch for the entire route tommy and kevin currently have ropes fixed on the route for the camera crew and to make it so they can get back and forth to their camp in this regard , tommy can ascend the rope to his high point , kevin can do the same , belay him on a pitch , jumar \( a term using ascenders that attach to the rope to ascend the pitch \) behind him to clean the pitch this way kevin avoids having to grab the sharp holds and he can rest while belaying tommy 2 if tommy did do the route by himself , kevin would most likely follow in this way , by jumaring behind him instead of free climbing wondering who takes their gear portaledges up for them and how also , did they bolt the routes in advance or how are they clipping in \? they have had their portaledges on the route for the season while they have been working on the route they have people resupplying them with food and water during their push some of their protection is preplace bolts , but some is traditional gear like self camming devices and passive protection such as nuts why are they climbing at night \? they 're climbing at night because it s too hot in the sun that part of the wall bakes in direct sunlight as soon as it rises hence the name , dawn wall in cool conditions they can stick to the holds better , which makes the climbing feel easier in full heat it feels impossible if tommy is several pitches above kevin , they ca n't be belaying each other , so who is \? or are they using selfbelaying devices to protect themselves individually \? or are they rappelling and or using ascenders to get together so one can belay while one climbs and then each goes back to the start of the next pitch he s up to , now 16 for kevin and 20 , i think , for tommy \? similarly , one story a few days ago said they were climbing two or three pitches above their portaledges we 're they rappelling down to eat and sleep and then using ascenders to get up to the next pitch they were up to \? and lastly , are they placing bolts for the rappelling , portaledges , etc , or are they using existing ones \? thanks much as a very mediocre climber like up to 57s here in new hampshire i'm following this story with much interest as far as i know , they 're belaying each other they have static ropes running all the way up the wall so that it s possible to commute up and down between where they 're climbing where they 're sleeping using ascenders to go up and down is basically trivial compared to the difficulty of the actual rock climbing , so it s not a big deal for them to move around and work on particular pitches they 've had to place some bolts to protect blank faces , but for the most part they 've been using natural protection and bolts that were already in place for various aid routes but they 've been very conservative about their bolting do you think that , as new generations of climbers enter yosemite , ascent times for the dawn wall will become the new standard for climbing excellence \? do you foresee athletes eventually speed climbing the dawn wall just as today s climbers do with half dome \? i really doubt it , thought it s certainly possible that s sort of the case for normal el cap free routes like freerider but it s really hard to imagine climbing progressing so far that the dawn wall is ever easy but someday someone will repeat it , and it will probably take less time than tommy and kevin are taking we 'll see for those of you unfamiliar with climbing lingo , phil powers , the executive director of the , has provided what he calls a short glossary of terms to put the vertical world in context is the most common form of climbing today this is the style that caldwell and jorgeson are using to work up the dawn wall prudently , they have ropes that catch them if they fall , but those ropes do not help them ascend in any way clearly there is a huge psychological advantage in using a rope as a safety system to back up one s climbing ability but the rope provides no physical advantage in making progress up the rock progress is only made with strength , skill , perseverance and creativity has become very popular in the past 20 years it is just plain old climbing as we all have done on jungle gyms bouldering is generally done near to the ground on freestanding boulders , and it requires no protective equipment aside from a ground pad to soften a fall is just like bouldering but taken to extreme heights this is the style of climbing that alex honnold has made so famous whether one is 75 feet off the ground or 2 , 000 , like honnold , the results of a fall are the same fatal it seems crazy , i know but think of a 2yearold free soloing up a flight of wooden stairs you and i solo that staircase with ease at 2 it is potentially deadly an accomplished and mentally adept climber can free solo unthinkable routes with great control but let s be clear the consequences of a mistake or a miscalculation are devastating describes the style used to climb the dawn wall before caldwell and jorgeson aid refers to relying on tools metal wedges , cams , hooks and pitons to make upward progress they are set in cracks or hooked onto edges in the rock , and climbers pull on them or hang short rope ladders from them they effectively climb the tools , not the rock until now , aid was the only way climbers had ascended this route on el capitan note that this type of climbing is not described by the word free free basically means free of aid a is a general term that describes the distance between places where a team of climbers can anchor and rest free climbers like caldwell and jorgeson are using 200foot ropes , so they must stop periodically at a logical anchor spot before running out of rope a shorter rope would limit their access to resting spots on such a blank wall a longer rope would be too heavy on a wall like this , comfortable resting spots are rare rather than rest on ledges or terrain features , they rest by hanging on equipment anchored in the rock it is expected that caldwell and jorgeson will complete the 3 , 000foot dawn wall in roughly 31 pitches at some of those resting spots the team must sleep from those anchors , they hang nylon tents built on aluminum frames these are really quite comfortable the trick is making one s anchor safe enough that sleep is possible i liken it to investing just as one must invest one s money safely enough to sleep at night , one must build enough of an anchor to sleep with ease on a big wall \( in addition to the tent , they wear harnesses and are tied in to their anchors with a rope always \) they carry or haul all of this equipment , as well as food and water , with them as they progress up the wall there is a lot more to climbing , and its various incarnations , than i have described here alpine climbers venture into the treacherous realms that include high altitude , snow and ice ice climbers swing picks into frozen water but no matter the style , the question that many people have is why \? all of us can identify with the tendency americans have had to explore we pushed west to the pacific , deep into the ground for oil and minerals and to the moon and mars out of our innate desire to explore and to expand the envelope of human potential the vertical exploration , of both terrain and human potential , is , in my mind , just the logical extension of our basic

new haven before he fired the shot , the einsatzgruppe commander lifted the jewish child in the air and said , you must die so that we can live as the killing proceeded , other germans rationalized the murder of jewish children in the same way them or us today we think of the nazi final solution as some dark apex of high technology it was in fact the killing of human beings at close range during a war for resources the war that brought jews under german control was fought because hitler believed that germany needed more land and food to survive and maintain its standard of living and that jews , and their ideas , posed a threat to his violent expansionist program the holocaust may seem a distant horror whose lessons have already been learned but sadly , the anxieties of our own era could once again give rise to scapegoats and imagined enemies , while contemporary environmental stresses could encourage new variations on hitler s ideas , especially in countries anxious about feeding their growing populations or maintaining a rising standard of living the quest for german domination was premised on the denial of science hitler s alternative to science was the idea of lebensraum germany needed an eastern european empire because only conquest , and not agricultural technology , offered the hope of feeding the german people in hitler s second book , which was composed in 1928 and not published until after his death , he insisted that hunger would outstrip crop improvements and that all the scientific methods of land management had already failed no conceivable improvement would allow germans to be fed from their own land and territory , he claimed hitler specifically and wrongly denied that irrigation , hybrids and fertilizers could change the relationship between people and land the pursuit of peace and plenty through science , he claimed in mein kampf , was a jewish plot to distract germans from the necessity of war it is always the jew , argued hitler , who seeks and succeeds in implanting such lethal ways of thinking as exotic as it sounds , the concept of lebensraum is less distant from our own ways of thinking than we believe germany was blockaded during world war i , dependent on imports of agricultural commodities and faced real uncertainties about its food supply hitler transformed these fears into a vision of absolute conquest for total security lebensraum linked a war of extermination to the improvement of lifestyle the chief nazi propagandist , joseph goebbels , could therefore define the purpose of a war of extermination as a big breakfast , a big lunch and a big dinner he conflated lifestyle with life to expand germany s lebensraum hitler aimed to seize ukraine from the soviet union , starve 30 million eastern europeans and transfer the food to germany when germany invaded the soviet union in 1941 , the campaign had two major aims the control of fertile ukrainian soil and the destruction of jews living there it was this invasion that placed defenseless jewish children at the mercy of the murderous einsatzgruppen climate change threatens to provoke a new ecological panic so far , poor people in africa and the middle east have borne the brunt of the suffering the mass murder of at least 500 , 000 rwandans in 1994 followed a decline in agricultural production for several years before hutus killed tutsis not only out of ethnic hatred , but to take their land , as many genocidaires later admitted in sudan , drought drove arabs into the lands of african pastoralists in 2003 the sudanese government sided with the arabs and pursued a policy of eliminating the zaghawa , masalit and fur peoples in darfur and surrounding regions climate change has also brought uncertainties about food supply back to the center of great power politics china today , like germany before the war , is an industrial power incapable of feeding its population from its own territory , and is thus dependent on unpredictable international markets this could make china s population susceptible to a revival of ideas like lebensraum the chinese government must balance a notsodistant history of starving its own population with today s promise of everincreasing prosperity all while confronting increasingly unfavorable environmental conditions the danger is not that the chinese might actually starve to death in the near future , any more than germans would have during the 1930s the risk is that a developed country able to project military power could , like hitler s germany , fall into ecological panic , and take drastic steps to protect its existing standard of living how might such a scenario unfold \? china is already leasing a tenth of ukraine s arable soil , and buying up food whenever global supplies tighten during the drought of 2010 , chinese panic buying helped bring bread riots and revolution to the middle east the chinese leadership already regards africa as a longterm source of food although many africans themselves still go hungry , their continent holds about half of the world s untilled arable land like china , the united arab emirates and south korea are interested in sudan s fertile regions and they have been joined by japan , qatar and saudi arabia in efforts to buy or lease land throughout africa nations in need of land would likely begin with tactfully negotiated leases or purchases but under conditions of stress or acute need , such agrarian export zones could become fortified colonies , requiring or attracting violence hitler spread ecological panic by claiming that only land would bring germany security and by denying the science that promised alternatives to war by polluting the atmosphere with greenhouse gases , the united states has done more than any other nation to bring about the next ecological panic , yet it is the only country where climate science is still resisted by certain political and business elites these deniers tend to present the empirical findings of scientists as a conspiracy and question the validity of science an intellectual stance that is uncomfortably close to hitler s the full consequences of climate change may reach america only decades after warming wreaks havoc in other regions and by then it will be too late for climate science and energy technology to make any difference indeed , by the time the door is open to the demagogy of ecological panic in the united states , americans will have spent years spreading climate disaster around the world the european union , by contrast , takes global warming very seriously , but its existence is under threat as africa and the middle east continue to warm and wars rage , economic migrants and war refugees are making perilous journeys to flee to europe in response , european populists have called for the strict enforcement of national borders and the end of the union many of these populist parties are supported by russia , which is openly pursuing a divideandconquer policy with the aim of bringing about european disintegration russia s 2014 intervention in ukraine has already shattered the peaceful order that europeans had come to take for granted the kremlin , which is economically dependent on the export of hydrocarbons to europe , is now seeking to make gas deals with individual european states one by one in order to weaken european unity and expand its own influence meanwhile , president vladimir v putin waxes nostalgic for the 1930s , while russian nationalists blame gays , cosmopolitans and jews for antiwar sentiment none of this bodes well for europe s future or russia s when mass killing is on the way , it wo n't announce itself in the language we are familiar with the nazi scenario of 1941 will not reappear in precisely the same form , but several of its causal elements have already begun to assemble it is not difficult to imagine ethnic mass murder in africa , which has already happened or the triumph of a violent totalitarian strain of islamism in the parched middle east or a chinese play for resources in africa or russia or eastern europe that involves removing the people already living there or a growing global ecological panic if america abandons climate science or the european union falls apart today we confront the same crucial choice between science and ideology that germans once faced will we accept empirical evidence and support new energy technologies , or allow a wave of ecological panic to spread across the world \? denying science imperils the future by summoning the ghosts of the past
a college education is a basic requirement for many middleclass jobs , but it is increasingly harder to afford that is why every presidential candidate needs to explain what he or she will do to make higher education attainable for more americans without them having to take on crippling amounts of debt on monday , hillary rodham clinton , the democratic frontrunner , released an ambitious that aims to help students at public fouryear colleges graduate without incurring any debt for tuition bernie sanders , a senator from vermont who is also seeking the nomination , has gone even further and said that he would make tuition free for all undergraduate students at public institutions regrettably , none of the republican candidates have come up with anything comparable students and their families are paying more for college and going deeper into debt every year about 60 percent of graduates from fouryear public universities had student loans in 2013 on average , they owed 25 , 600 , up 20 percent from 2000 after adjusting for inflation , according to the they are paying more in large part because state governments reduced higher education spending by 25 percent per student between 2000 and 2014 in inflationadjusted dollars , according to the more than 11 percent of total outstanding loans are delinquent by more than 90 days compared with 6 percent in 2005 , according to the  mrs clinton s aims to reduce college costs for students by giving federal grants to states and colleges and by allowing borrowers to refinance their student loans at lower interest rates it would reward states that agree to spend more money on higher education and give more money to colleges that reduce expenses , though it does not say what kind of costs should be lowered it also includes a good proposal put forward by president obama in january to make twoyear community colleges free to all americans the plan 350 billion over 10 years , which is close to what the federal government on pell grants those grants will continue ms clinton would raise the money by capping unspecified deductions wealthy families can take on their income taxes mr sanders s freetuition plan would offer states 2 of federal money for every dollar they spend on reducing or eliminating tuition his would cost 750 billion over 10 years and mr sanders says he would raise the money by imposing a small tax on financial transactions martin o'malley , the former maryland governor , who is also seeking the democratic nomination , has said he has a plan to help students avoid , but his campaign an estimate of how much his proposal would cost these plans are missing important details , so it s hard to determine their potential impact a big unanswered question is how state governments would react in congress , conservatives will be especially hostile to any tax increases to help reduce tuition costs but young americans buried by student loans want fresh thinking on the crisis , something the republican candidates in fact , they barely spent any time talking about it last week at their first two debates senator marco rubio of florida has his own struggle with student debt and has supported linking loan but he does not have a comprehensive plan another republican candidate , gov scott walker of wisconsin , has caused great harm to the university of wisconsin system by 250 million from its budget , which is forcing administrators to raise tuition for some students the country has a college affordability crisis but candidates from only one party are taking it seriously

in the weeks before senator s decision to oppose the iran nuclear accord , john shapiro , a new york financier and a leader of the american jewish committee , had his ear , plying him with reasons to oppose it mr shapiro , a longtime benefactor of the new york senator and other democrats , was hardly alone some of the wealthiest and most powerful donors in american politics , those for and against the accord , tried to get a word in with mr schumer now , approaching a vote on president obama s most important international priority , the fight is expanding , with tens of millions of dollars flowing into ad campaigns , and contributors leveraging access to undecided democrats s daniel abraham , a jewish philanthropist who made billions on slimfast drinks , dispatched emails to senate democrats while vacationing in sttropez , urging their support the gay rights patron tim gill and his husband , scott miller , also have quietly urged lawmakers to back the president , telling them the deal is in israel s best interest norman lear , the tv producer who has raised millions for democrats , said he wrote to mr schumer to criticize his decision at the very least , it was a mistake , mr lear said the furious lobbying lays bare the volatile politics of the iran accord , which has already pitted mr schumer , the likely future leader of senate democrats , against the democratic president it also reveals donors' divisions over the deal and the extraordinary access those donors have wielded to speak directly to lawmakers and their top aides mr shapiro said he spoke with mr schumer about his meeting with egypt s president , abdel fattah elsisi , including the leader s warning that the agreement would increase regional terrorism he also related discussions with officials in jordan , and made sure mr schumer had read critical essays and columns mr schumer said wednesday that he did not believe all of the activity would ultimately determine the deal s fate , nor , he said , had donor appeals determined his decision all the sturm und drang around this is going to mean less than on less important issues , he said i know that sounds ironic , but the more substantive the decision , the less the push and pull matters donors said they did not believe any senator would vote based on threats to give or withhold money and none admitted to giving such ultimatums but with poised to dump tens of millions of dollars into senate races next year , the passions of big contributors and their ability to change a candidate s fortunes are a keenly felt undercurrent to the debate some of the biggest donors to also have strong opinions about the iran deal and israel s security among them are george soros and the entertainment mogul haim saban on the left , for example , and the hedge fund investor paul singer and the casino billionaire sheldon adelson on the right i'm sure that there is a level of risk on either side of this very sensitive question , said victor a kovner , a prominent new york communications lawyer and schumer benefactor who knows of other donors considering a boycott of democrats who follow mr schumer s lead i continue to support senator schumer , although i am deeply disappointed with this decision republican leaders have promised a vote in midseptember in both houses on a resolution to disapprove of the accord so far mr schumer is the only senate democrat to formally express opposition , though more are likely president obama has said he will veto such a resolution he must hold 34 senators or 146 house members to sustain his veto both sides have mobilized the , members of which are potent forces in both parties' fundraising efforts , is spending millions to block the deal , both directly and through an affiliate , citizens for a nuclear free iran j street , the liberal israel advocacy group , is spending 5 million to build support for the deal \( neither j street nor the citizens group would reveal who is funding the campaigns \) moveonorg , a liberal group , that it will urge its large grassroots membership to withhold campaign contributions from the democratic senatorial campaign committee and from any democratic candidate who succeeds in undermining the president s diplomacy with iran j street helped organize an open letter this month signed by 120 philanthropists , activists and former government officials , many of them jewish , to signal to democrats that the perception opponents are trying to create that there will be a political cost to lawmakers who support the agreement is not accurate a critical goal , people involved with the letterwriting effort said , was to signal significant jewish support for the deal , including among prominent donors to democrats the signatories include some of the top bundlers for president obama s presidential campaigns , among them margery tabankin , an adviser and gatekeeper to hollywood donors others , such as arnold hiatt , founder of stride rite , are members of the democracy alliance , a club of wealthy progressive donors that helps finance political nonprofits and super pacs on the left j street is trying to show the congressman and senators that there is a strong jewish constituency supporting this agreement , mr abraham said in an interview , adding , i am really sorry to see some democrats separate on the issue at a democratic congressional campaign committee event at the hamptons home of mr soros last month , representative nancy pelosi of california , the minority leader , spoke glowingly of the iran deal then donors pointedly turned to representative steve israel , democrat of new york , who said he did not want to publicly contradict his leader on such an important matter , according to mr kovner the lawyer then dispatched a number of donors to discuss the matter with mr israel it s hard to say he was roughed up , but pressed , mr kovner said really , the greatest pressure came from the leader herself mr israel came out against the deal anyway mr schumer said that if anything , he has spoken to more deal supporters than opponents , since much of his information came from the administration but opponents had their say , too mr shapiro , founder of chieftain capital management and chairman of the american jewish committee board of trustees , said he spoke to the senator a halfdozen times before his decision , pressed him on concerns that the lifting of sanctions would finance a wave of iranianbacked terrorism , and questioned a lastminute decision to eventually lift the embargo on ballistic missile components for tehran that said , mr shapiro conceded that lawmakers are trying to decide between two really bad choices without a deal , congress is banking blindly on the hope that international sanctions can be reconstituted , and that iran can be pressured back to the table to negotiate a more restrictive accord with the deal , tehran will have more money to finance nonnuclear terrorism , more access to conventional weapons , and , after 10 to 15 years , the freedom to resume development mr schumer said some democrats are discussing ways to pressure the administration to somehow toughen the deal on its own , but he said he is not involved he also stressed that while he has made courtesy calls to some 30 senators on his decision , he is not trying to influence their vote there are some people out there who think i can force colleagues to vote one way or the other , he said that is not how the senate works

under the weight of the locks is a metaphor of modern love , overloaded with high expectations we expect the spouse to be perfect , perfect father , mother , lover , worker , socially valorizing this also explains why so many couples divorce for want of accepting the imperfection of the other we value love so much that we love love instead of the persons candace hilldrup , a psychoanalyst who works in the marais district , said the placing of love locks was magical thinking it s like people carving initials in trees , she said trees live longer than we do , and we are projecting into the future this action will make our love exist forever and protect our relationship in time ms hilldrup added that whereas carving the initials of your beloved in a tree was a relatively private act , smartphones and the internet have globalized its modernday equivalent people might feel that if they come to paris and they do n't do this , perhaps it s playing with fire , she said the custom is variously attributed to a that dates to world war i , or to the 2006 novel i want you , by the italian author federico moccia , in which a character invents the ritual it is prevalent in cities all over the world , but paris , doubtless because of its image as a city of romance , seems to be the most popular and the pont des arts , said andrew hussey , the author of paris the secret history , has always been about starcrossed lovers he cited the medieval clerics h lo se and ab lard , as well as jane birkin and serge gainsbourg , the british actress and the french singersongwriter whose 1969 duo je t'aime moi non plus caused a sensation lovers do not have long to leave their locks on display here according to the city , every lock is destined for removal a rumor has circulated that they will be melted down and sold as scrap metal , but the city hall spokesman said that for the moment , all suggestions are being considered those include a threemile hollow glass wall along the banks of the seine , filled with discarded locks , to which people could add new ones or iron trees or towers on which to hang the locks , like those that already exist in moscow and seoul , south korea \( not very parisian , said eric carlson , an architect in paris \) there could be a giant installation on the pedestrianized lower highway next to the river , suggested ariela katz , a parisbased architecture professor tom miles , a british tourist taking a selfie with his girlfriend in the lovelocked little square around the statue of henri iv on the pont neuf , said , melt down the metal and make a giant lock to symbolize everyone s love there was a strange contrast between sentimentality and constraint in the symbol of the lock , said franck rezzak , a parisian artist who lives near the canal stmartin , who noted with alarm the recent appearance of locks there most people still think of love as a kind of contract , with a vocabulary of faithfulness , betrayal , possession , he said now they will probably have to melt the symbol of that contract it is part of a capitalist cycle the locks will become something else it s sort of perfect
waltham , mass after a recent practice at the team s training site here , i asked guard marcus smart why he felt that so many great college coaches had failed to make a successful leap to the nba the list of those who have tried and failed is impressive lon kruger , tim floyd , mike montgomery , p j carlesimo rick pitino had a good first run with the knicks but failed with the celtics there was talk during this year s ncaa men s tournament that john calipari might leave kentucky and try for a second stint in the nba calipari is currently the emperor of lexington , but as the coach of the nets from 1996 to 1999 , he was 72112 and 03 in the playoffs the biggest thing is you have to be able to leave the ego at the door , said smart , who as a rookie is only recently removed from the college game and thus has a fresh perspective on the differences between coaching on the college and professional levels you 've got guys who have been in this league for a long time , smart said it s not college kids , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 years old there are grown men there are certain things you did in college you ca n't do up here smart said that the great college coaches often had egos that worked against them in the nba it s not their fault , smart said that s what makes them great in college they 're so prideful , they have an ego , they have a swagger your swagger has to change coming to the nba the jury is still out on celtics coach brad stevens , but if his first two seasons in boston are any indication , he at least has the even temperament to have a sustained nba career stevens , 38 , led butler to two unlikely final four appearances in six seasons and did it without pounding his chest or wearing the imperial cloak of grandeur bestowed on superstar coaches by the news media and fans the celtics had a losing record last season , stevens s first , and they started poorly this season but they surged and surprised by earning a playoff spot , though they trail lebron james and the cleveland cavaliers , three games to none , in a firstround eastern conference playoff series we do n't know if it s a success yet , stevens said of his boston tenure long term , we do n't know it s a real positive experience , and i'm going to make sure it s a positive experience for everybody who s in here leonard hamilton , the florida state head coach , lasted only one season in the nba after signing a fiveyear contract in 2000 with the washington wizards hamilton does n't agree that raging ego is the reason that so many good college coaches fall into the lurch when making the jump to the nba hamilton believes that too many college coaches have taken professional jobs with teams that had dysfunctional front offices there are ego guys who are successful in the nba , hamilton said it depends on the coach s relationship with management and owners if players know the ego guy is tied into management and ownership , they know they ca n't mess with him , and he s safe stevens has the backing of the celtics organization and a front office that has been able to provide playoffcaliber talent college coaches recruit their own talent nba coaches largely rely on the front office to acquire players who can help win games you ca n't be successful in this without the support of your ownership and your management team , stevens said i 've never felt like that s ever wavered we were n't very good last year , and we were n't very good at the start of this year , and we 've still got a long way to go but these guys , they 've committed to me and i 've never felt like it was n't longterm commitment he added people get antsy in this business , which i understand people are paying a lot of money i get it the celtics reportedly gave stevens a he said his other motivation for taking the celtics job was to become a better coach i 've looked at it more like a chance to learn about the game get a phd in the game , he said stevens added in the nba , you 're playing against basically 30 similar styles there might be tweaks and adjustments , but it s 30 similar styles because the players are so good that probably everything has been tried you 're playing against lebron james , paying him the appropriate amount of attention , getting to love and irving kevin love and kyrie irving and keeping them off the glass the challenges are so great , and they do really provoke a lot of thought it makes you think and it stretches you the celtics have given stevens the gift of time he in turn has put the celtics ahead of schedule but is stevens sold on the nba as a longterm commitment he would like to make \? patience is not a virtue in the nba just ask scott brooks , who by the oklahoma city thunder teams are constantly falling in and out of love with coaches stevens clearly likes his financial compensation and enjoys the challenge of coaching great players but he also said that the most difficult part of his nba adjustment was leaving butler , and that there still were times when he thought about his decision while many an ambitious college coach has jumped to the nba and failed , i would n't be surprised if , one of these seasons , stevens makes a voluntary leap back
some quake in terror as we approach the terminator scenario , in which clever machines take over the world after all , it is n't scifi when stephen hawking says things like , the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race but before the robots replace us , we face the challenge of decreasing real wages resulting , among other factors , from automation and outsourcing , before long inequality \( you do n't on this , do you \? \) is the biggest social challenge facing us \( let s call climate change , which has the potential to be apocalyptic rather than just awful , a scientific challenge \) and since wealthy people do n't spend nearly as high a percentage of their incomes as poor people do , much wealth is sitting around not doing its job the result is that we 're looking at fewer jobs that pay the equivalent of what an autoworker or a teacher made in the '60s and '70s all but a lucky few will either have the kind of service jobs that are now paying around 9 an hour , or be worse off and if robots can think , be creative , teach themselves , beat humans at chess and , , take care of your aging parent , plant , tend and harvest lettuce , drive cars , deliver packages , and run warehouses amazon s kiva robots can carry 3 , 000 pounds , stock shelves and select and ship packages it s hard to imagine what these jobs might be welcome to the brave new world , one featuring even fewer haves and more havenots than the current one the winners and losers are the same , but the polarity is even more extreme and although this is morally detestable , as robert b reich , the former secretary of labor and current professor at the university of california , berkeley , told me a couple of weeks ago , it s also a crass economic issue because as you have more and more people who are getting paid relatively little , the question in most economic heads is , where is the aggregate demand going to come from \? if no one can buy , there s very little to sell again , relative to their income , rich people do n't buy much \( a hundred million people with 100 each spend a lot more than one person with 10 billion \) in other words , almost everyone agrees that income inequality stinks , but what s to stop it from getting worse \? \( certainly not ! \) defeatism will only guarantee defeat , but there are shortterm solutions that can come from both top and bottom the government s role should be to stop corporate handouts , accept that rising tides do not lift all boats and prioritize a decent life for all citizens through a desperately needed enormous public works program , one that would create at least some dignified and wellpaying jobs those unable to get those jobs and , given that one in six americans qualifies for food stamps , it s clear that there is n't enough good work to go around can survive only if income distribution is addressed one way to do this is through the earnedincome tax credit , a kind of reverse income tax , similar to milton friedman s proposal and therefore acceptable to many republicans but this assumes that people have work that pays a taxable income , and that s not a safe assumption better is the guaranteed basic income , which is \( it s at least as old as thomas paine , was endorsed by the economist friedrich hayek and was recently considered by switzerland \) , because it would simplify matters and help keep the economy moving how all of this would be financed is of course a question we could make the income tax look like it did 60 years ago , when the top rate was 91 percent \( and , by the way , the economy was just fine \) , or we could institute a 100 percent tax on wealth over 1 billion , or well , there s no dearth of ideas the way to address income distribution is to redistribute income a combination of public works and guaranteed welfare \( not , by the way , a dirty word \) is the best topdown solution for the short term but the bottomup situation has even more potential for a more equitable economic system what we 're seeing , on a small but growing scale , is a world where energy and even power may become increasingly decentralized , and communities are building more on local and regional levels , creating organizations that benefit more of their members which , for obvious reasons , combats income inequality directly is becoming more common , and these organizations are talking to one another locally even something as simple as the farmtoschool movement means that economies are becoming more local and communities are supporting their own businesses the historian and economist gar alperovitz , who details these efforts in his book what then must we do \? \( a tolstoy quote about , essentially , inequality \) , recently said to me , the political game is beginning to resemble a checkerboard strategy some of the squares on the board are clearly blocked , but others are open the goal , of course , is to expand the number of squares that are receptive to democratization efforts not just to restore economic health and sustainability in struggling communities , but to demonstrate viable alternatives none of this is short term , but neither are the robots taking over tomorrow , and it s safe to say that nearly all the humans on earth 20 years from now would prefer an economic system that would guarantee a decent life , whether their rulers are heartless robots or merely gazillionaires we just need to do shortterm work with a long view , and remember that few predicted the great changes of our time the civil rights movement , the fall of the berlin wall , the arab spring nineteen years ago , bill clinton signed the defense of marriage act , which allowed states to refuse to recognize samesex marriages blessed by other states and look what s happened since between the recession \( which is only over if you were making real money to begin with \) and the crushing of our spirits by deathraywielding , 40foothigh titanium monsters , perhaps there s time to reimagine society it s not as if this question has n't been well considered there was karl marx , whose analysis was largely correct but whose reputation was soiled by the alternatives developed in his name there was edward bellamy , whose anticipated a kind of internet and the ease with which things are made and delivered , and painted a picture of cooperation instead of competition , describing in sensible detail what was once called a socialist utopia \( we 'd have to pitch this differently , of course , as both those words are forbidden in neoliberal society \) and there was even john maynard keynes , who suggested that a 15hour workweek would eventually be considered fulltime and why not \? we need equally big thinkers now , and dreamers , and we need to be acting with them we have achieved a level of social equality barely imagined by progressives 50 years ago , but economic equality has gotten much worse no one knows what the world will look like in 50 years , but if we resign ourselves to dystopia in which capital has full control , as it nearly does now we 'll surely have one let s resolve to build something better in the long run we know that we 'll make the transition from capitalism to some less destructive and hopefully more just system why not begin that transition now \? if there is going to be a global market that will further enrich capitalists , there must be guarantees that the rest of the population can at least afford housing and food and things can be even better than that we 'll have the robots work for us
poor pergolesi alliteration can be cheap and easy , but and pretty much invited it pergolesi power games , they called their presentation at the alchemical theater laboratory on west 14th street over the weekend , adding the slogan pain pleasure pergolesi pain , surely , would apply to the first half , a staging of pergolesi s 1736 oratorio stabat mater , which relates the agonies suffered by jesus' mother at the foot of the cross pleasure would just as surely follow in a production of the composer s delightful comic intermezzo , la serva padrona \( the maid as mistress \) but the point of the exercise was to show pain and pleasure intermingled the concept arose from the observation that in the stabat mater , some of the music clashes inexplicably with the text , as annie holt , the executive artistic director of morningside opera , and amber youell , a singer in the stabat mater , wrote in a production note cheerful , almost comic melodies and jaunty accompaniments , they add , set words like he mourns and suffers while his mother watches the anguish of the dying son' but the production , as seen on friday evening , merely amplified the inexplicability the two singers , the soprano \( brett umlauf \) and the mezzosoprano \( ms youell \) , first appeared scantily clad in short chemises , then gradually added items of period clothing , cavorting about erotically , only to strip them off again their performances were remarkable , especially ms umlauf s , singing the aria she saw her sweet son dying while being roughly strapped into a black leather corset but none of this frippery enhanced the music or the text this production , from 2012 , was paired with a new , updated staging of la serva padrona , which , in keeping with the overall concept , had to tilt the balance the other way , from pleasure toward pain so serpina , the chirpy maid scheming to win the hand of the her master , uberto , is transformed into a dominatrix \( yes , clad in a black leather corset , and wielding a whip \) , with uberto her paying client almost needless to say , much rewriting was required in a libretto now laden with crudities and trendy references to social media this score , too , calls for only two singers brittany palmer \( serpina \) and michael shaw \( uberto \) got the job done , though with less distinction than the stabat mater duo members of the female instrumental ensemble siren baroque made up the orchestra for both works a harpsichordist \( kelly savage \) and a string trio the string players had occasional tuning problems and sounded a bit scrawny at times , in part , no doubt , because they were meant to be four , their violist having come down with the flu call the whole thing , perhaps , pergolesi pirated but unlike , say , stravinsky s reuse of pergolesi s music in the brilliant ballet score pulcinella , which helped cement his immortality , this production mostly just threw more dirt on his grave
when the deputy head mistress pulled malala yousafzai out of high school chemistry class one morning a year ago , malala nervously searched her mind for recent offenses you usually get a bit scared if your head teacher comes , because you think you are being caught doing something , malala recalled but she told me i need to tell you something you have ' after a brief celebration , malala returned to class for the rest of the school day as the world s news organizations clamored for interviews , she wrestled with physics she s a champion of girls' education worldwide , she explains , and that must include her own malala , now a high school junior , was in new york this past week to , attend the premiere of a fulllength documentary movie about her life and hound world leaders to pay attention to girls' education she hopes the movie , , will galvanize a push to provide 12 years of quality education to all children worldwide the movie relates how she grew up in rural pakistan , became an advocate for girls' education and spoke out against the taliban then when she was 15 years old , taliban gunmen retaliated they stopped her school bus and shot her in the head as she hovered between life and death , supporters held candlelight vigils , and a plane rushed her to a hospital in birmingham , england , that specializes in brain injuries today the left side of her face is still partly paralyzed , and she is somewhat deaf in that ear , but she s as outspoken as ever and the taliban is still determined to kill her , so she and her family remain in birmingham the movie offers a revealing portrait of a global icon who s also a teenager giggling about sports heroes , worrying about acceptance by peers and rolling her eyes at siblings people think she is , like , very kind , and she speaks for people s rights , her younger brother khushal grumbles at the breakfast table , needling her but that s not true , i think at home she is so violent ! malala squeals with outrage i'm not violent ! it s clearly awkward to be a teenager and have your sibling rivalries , your skirt length \( long \) and your boyfriend history \( none \) explored on the big screen , along with your painstaking physical therapy to recover from brain damage but malala embraces the film as a way to highlight the transformative power of education her own mother is deeply conservative she has discouraged malala from shaking hands with men or looking them in the eye but is moderating her views and now also learning to read for the first time the mother also takes the global fuss about her daughter in stride , and has no problem ordering a nobel laureate to clean up her room malala s main message is that all children should get 12 years of free , safe , quality education , and that girls are too often left behind some between the age of 6 and 15 are not in school millions of others attend but sit in classes of 100 students , taught in a language they do n't understand , without so much as a pencil , and learn nothing teachers often do n't show up \( the big truancy problem in the developing world is with teachers \) , and when teachers do show up , they sometimes prey on girls in pakistan found that 24 percent of primary schools do n't have any textbooks for students , and 46 percent lack desks for them yet education is still the best hope to transform countries as well as individuals , told me that when he was a teenager he was brainwashed into praying for war between muslims and nonmuslims , hoping to become a martyr the antidote to such extremism , he says , is education malala is determined not to be used as window dressing by world leaders , and her advice to presidents and prime ministers is to focus not on elementary school or middle school but on 12 full years of education your dreams were too small , she tells un members your achievements are too small now it is time that you dream bigger she scolded nigeria s president at the time for by boko haram she at the white house that drones were counterproductive and that he should invest in education just eight days of global military spending , she notes , would pay to get all remaining kids in school worldwide no world leader would want nine years of education for their children , she told me every world leader wants quality education for their children they need to think of the rest of the world s children as their own children
los angeles here on the set of the new prequel a mother , her son and her boyfriend are crammed together in the cab of a beatup ford truck , terrified that something s not quite right in their city after the pickup careens out of a tunnel to the los angeles river , the mother frantically tries to call her other child , while the sullen teenager twirls the radio dial , fruitlessly seeking information about the disturbing sights they 've witnessed nobody s talking about this , he says with disbelief nobody s saying anything come aug 23 , when has its premiere on amc , they will the walking dead has more than 20 million weekly viewers , and this companion series enables the network to dip back into its enormous , devoted fan base , this time with a dark family drama it will explore some of the same ideas about survival and human nature but will also stake out its own thematic terrain the new show will make a character of the urban , arid chaos of los angeles , not the rural swampiness of georgia and virginia and rather than beginning four to five weeks into the epidemic , it will portray a world just beginning to confront a shattering upheaval i think more than anything else , fear the walking dead' will get to show people coming to grips with society crumbling around them in a way we mostly skipped over on the walking dead , ' said robert kirkman , a creator of both shows and the walking dead comicbook series the series does not come without risks for the creators and amc , which would like to add more buzzworthy hits to a lineup that no longer has mad men and breaking bad unlike the flagship show , there s no comic book providing a structural backbone the carefully calibrated slow build of dread could alienate prospective fans who prefer more zombie carnage and spinoffs that share none of the same characters or are n't variations of the triedandtrue police procedural format are exceedingly rare in tv history if this one works , it s going to be a first in my television experience , said tim brooks , a former executive at nbc , usa networks and lifetime television , and the coauthor of the complete directory to prime time network and cable tv shows , 1946present the blended family at the center of fear the walking dead is completely illprepared to survive in this changed world kim dickens \( deadwood , treme \) plays madison , a high school guidance counselor and single mother of two teenagers , one a drug addict \( nick , played by frank dillane \) and the other a seeming golden child \( alicia , played by alycia debnamcarey \) kim s boyfriend , travis \( cliff curtis of gang related \) , is an english literature teacher at the same school , and he has moved in but he has a disaffected teenage son of his own , who wants no part of this new , juryrigged family as he remains with his mother \( elizabeth rodriguez of orange is the new black \) it s very much about two parents who are trying to bring everybody under one roof and protect them , the showrunner , dave erickson , said over breakfast in los angeles in midjuly the new threat just happens to be zombies the infected do n't look like decaying monsters yet they 're all fresher , still resembling the colleagues you saw at work the other day , the family members you just made dinner for only now they want to rip your throat out it s a bit jarring , mr erickson deadpanned your first impulse is to help them , and then short of that , to run , he added it is n't to pick up a handy weapon and bludgeon them to death and crush their skull a coming apocalypse was familiar terrain for mr erickson he had previously written a pilot for a family drama based on a treatment by mr kirkman called five year the elevator pitch there s a meteor coming , you know you have five years until it hits , what do you do with your time before the world ends \? the two men enjoyed working together except for the part where the show did n't get made and stayed in touch over the years efforts to bring mr erickson into the writers' room of the walking dead never quite worked out but when mr kirkman approached him late in 2013 about collaborating on a companion series to the walking dead , the timing clicked amc was finally ready to capitalize on its biggest success charlie collier , the president and general manager of amc and sundancetv , said the question he s been bombarded with most since the walking dead debuted is what is going on elsewhere in the apocalypse but though the possibility of a scripted walking dead spinoff arose fairly early on , it never progressed much past vague discussion even as amc s live talk show dissecting every episode , racked up mindboggling numbers \( the most recent season drew an average of 65 million viewers , according to nielsen \) the first few seasons of the flagship show were not the most stable or safe places for its creative masters frank darabont \( the shawshank redemption \) , who developed the show , was dropped as showrunner just weeks into production for season 2 his replacement , glen mazzara , departed after the third season but as a new showrunner , scott m gimple , settled in and tensions eased , amc and mr kirkman set about creating a companion series the two shows fit under the same mythological umbrella created by mr kirkman in his comicbook series , with the same rules governing the type of zombies \( the lumbering kind \) and how to kill them \( stabbing , shooting or smashing them in the head \) the characters are clueless , at first , at what they 're facing , and the actors were encouraged in their ignorance as the audition approached , ms dickens asked the producers which episodes of the walking dead she should watch to get a handle on the new show the response none i feel better that way , she said on a break between scenes on a sunday in midjuly , fake blood applied to the left side of her face , neck and jacket i do n't want it in my head , any sort of idea of what it should look like , the apocalypse , or the monsters , or the infected , or the world itself it should be more of a mystery to me the audience , likely to be made up of walking dead fans , is going to be many steps ahead of the new characters , who are only slowly awakening to the horror awaiting them and the creators have gleefully , and perhaps a bit sadistically , embraced this state of affairs by ratcheting up the tension and toying with expectations for me , it s fun to tease the audience , and i think the audience kind of likes to be teased , said adam davidson , a coexecutive producer on fear the walking dead who directed the first three episodes the biggest difference between the two shows , however , turns on the protagonists in fear the walking dead , there s no one like the sheriff s deputy rick grimes , who s used to responding to emergencies and facile with firearms instead we get teachers and counselors and students and barbers mr erickson said that when mr kirkman first described his idea for the new series , with madison and travis working at a high school in los angeles , the one thing he requested was to bring his own personal baggage into the writers' room a divorced father of two sons \( 13 and 15 \) , with a fianc e who has two children of her own , mr erickson liked the idea of introducing the fissures in a blended family dynamic , then using the zombie apocalypse to jack those tensions up on a more epic scale do your own children come first \? and if your biological children become too much of a burden , do you cast off the weakest link so the rest of the group can survive \? the los angeles setting also permitted fear the walking dead to show a grittier side to the city than typically seen on screen the creators promise we 'll never see the hollywood sign or zombies shuffling past the griffith observatory the main characters live in el sereno , one of the oldest neighborhoods in los angeles and one of its most diverse the cast mirrors the city s diversity ms rodriguez s character , travis s exwife , was reimagined as latina after the actress read for the part , she said travis was originally written as latino , but that was changed to maori to reflect mr curtis s heritage and fear the walking dead pointedly delves into the immigrant experience through ruben blades s character , a barber named daniel salazar , who fled el salvador in the early 1980s people who come here have many different reasons , said gale anne hurd , an executive producer on both walking dead series quite a few of them are escaping violence in their own countries , want to start over and los angeles is a city of rebirth , it s a city of reinvention this being a walking dead series , viewers will come with expectations of violence the more gruesome the better while some of the producers bristle at intimations that the gore plays an outsize role in the success of the walking dead , mr erickson understands that the trappings of the zombie genre are a key part of the equation after all , the television landscape is dotted with plenty of wellwrought character dramas that do not draw in excess of 20 million viewers every week fine tuning that proper mix of character development and zombie violence is one of the challenges he and his colleagues face particularly because season 1 of fear the walking dead is more of a slow burn , as the walkers slowly evolve and the writers ramp up the paranoia the wild success of the walking dead only the big bang theory and ncis get better overall ratings , and no series attracts more of the 18 to 49yearolds who are coveted by advertisers also brings with it hopes of supersized viewership numbers but fear the walking dead is venturing into untested territory most spinoffs feature a character from the original \( frasier out of cheers , or better call saul from amc s own breaking bad \) or are clones of police procedurals \( ncis los angeles \) , not a serialized character drama and there are no plans to connect the casts of the two shows it would certainly make a good miniseries , said mr brooks , the former tv executive it could make a good movie will it make a series that goes on for a while \? that s where you really got to have characters that people want to come back and see that s the tougher part having already given the goahead for a second season of 15 or 16 episodes , amc appears confident about the show s prospects meanwhile , mr erickson will soon convene the writers' room to block out the coming story lines before the show resumes shooting in november wherever madison , travis and their blended and extended family end up next season , in los angeles , elsewhere in california or along the pacific northwest coast , eventually mr erickson would like the survivors to head east at a certain point , i like the idea of trekking into the interior of the country , mr erickson said a lewis and clark expedition , in reverse he paused for a moment lewis or clark or the donner party
lunel , france when this picturesque southern french town of just 25 , 700 people first learned late last year that six local muslims had been killed fighting for islam in syria , accounting for 10 percent of the total number of french killed there , the rightwing mayor quietly asked the head of the local mosque for help i need you , and you need me to stop this , the mayor , claude arnaud , recalled telling lahoucine goumri , who was president of al baraka mosque in lunel at the time we agreed he would make a statement he did but instead of condemning the surge of young recruits , mr goumri told local news media that the policies of president fran ois hollande were the main culprit and complained that it was not his job to denounce the jihadists when nobody protested french citizens who traveled to israel to help the army kill babies this is their choice , mr goumri was quoted as saying at the time by the newspaper it is not for me to judge them in the wake of last week s attacks by terrorists in and around paris that killed 17 people , lunel is still struggling to fathom how such a small town , nestled in the sunsplashed languedoc winegrowing region , has come to earn its dubious distinction as a breeding ground for jihadists investigators have long noticed that particular towns or even streets tend to spawn unusually high numbers of jihadists , a phenomenon thrown into relief on thursday when in the eastern belgian town of verviers , from which about a dozen residents are said to have gone to fight in syria but lunel s situation shows how hard it will be to identify , never mind halt , the forces pushing s young muslims toward extremism , even as the authorities face pressures to take more seriously the potential threat of informal clusters of radicalized youth , and to uproot extremist networks that have sent more than 1 , 000 french citizens to syria and iraq the mayor , noting that the number of lunel residents who traveled to syria is perhaps no more than 20 in all , said his town had been unfairly put in the spotlight because of its bad luck at having so many be killed in quick succession but after initially playing down the problem , he is now scrambling to figure out what went wrong and to ensure that those who went to syria and managed to stay alive do not return after being trained to shoot and to cut throats this is an immense danger antiterrorism prosecutors in paris are investigating whether lunel has been infiltrated by a jihadist cell or underground group like the socalled butteschaumont network , which once sent fighters to battle united states troops in iraq and which for at least one of last week s paris gunmen , ch rif kouachi mayor arnaud said he doubted the existence of a network in lunel , believing that those who left were just a group of school friends who decided to take up jihad after being influenced by radical websites as well as peer and family pressures the six killed in syria ranging in age from 19 to 28 all seem to have known one another we are all trying to understand but feel completely out of our depth , he said , flicking through a file prepared by the municipal police with the names and brief biographies of each of the deceased all were born in , he said , and none had previously attracted the attention of the local police one of those who left , raphael amar , is the son of a jewish engineer he grew up in a comfortable home with a swimming pool , played the guitar and loved led zeppelin last july , after traveling to paris for a job interview , mr amar , a 22yearold convert , vanished , calling home a few days later to announce that he had gone to syria , not to fight but to do relief work he was killed just three months later in clashes at deir alzour , in eastern syria the same battle also claimed the lives of two of his school friends from lunel , a town that in the medieval era and later attracted a large number of jewish immigrants , particularly from spain , but is today about a third muslim from almost one day to the next raphael rejected everything , said a person close to the family , who asked not to be named it was as if he had joined a sect in an effort to get to the bottom of what happened , the family has hired a lawyer to file civil charges against x , a french procedure that allows a plaintiff to gain access to official inquiries and to seek redress for a crime committed by a defendant not yet identified many here have turned their attention to mr goumri and al baraka the mosque , unlike another in town , was attended at one time or another by all of those who went from lunel to syria on jan 6 , a day before the paris attack on the satirical newspaper charlie hebdo , pierre de bousquet , the state s senior representative for the region , visited the town and said he was preoccupied by al baraka there is clearly a risk of a fundamentalist takeover , he told the local newspaper , stressing that the french state also had a responsibility to show to young people that the republic has not forgotten them , to show that there is a place for them , a future mr amar s family believes that the mosque leadership did not urge worshipers toward jihad but that it did allow activists affiliated with tabligh jamaat , a secretive islamic revivalist group that originated in india , to spread its ideas , which german and other european intelligence services have characterized as sometimes leading to extremism a 2010 study by france s institute for islamic studies and the muslim world said the mosque was close to tabligh , but it raised no concerns about any tilt toward violence france s surging national front , a farright party that won 37 percent of the vote in lunel in elections last may for the european parliament , believes that it is past time to take action against the mosque it is very simple this mosque should be shut down , said guillaume vouzellaud , a local national front leader , calling for an investigation of its activities and an end to national policies that he said allowed immigrants to impose their own values and culture instead of forcing them to assimilate and show a strong will to be french on sunday , in a vote that had been scheduled before the attacks in paris , congregants at the mosque chose a president to replace mr goumri , who decided not to seek another term but the urgent issue remains finding out why , at a certain moment in this town , which has social and economic problems but no worse than in many other places , so many young people left for syria , said philippe moissonnier , a socialist party member of the local council did they leave because of the mosque \? he added we do n't know but there was clearly some sort of catalyst or accelerator taher akermi , a counselor at a statefunded youth and cultural center who knew most of the six killed in syria , said he was baffled by their departure for jihad young muslims in lunel , he said , face a host of problems , including 40 percent youth unemployment , but just because you do n't have work does not mean you are going to blow yourself up or do jihad he said that he noticed an increased religious zeal among some of those who went to syria but that this did not cause undue concern mr amar , who had celebrated as a boy , was once an enthusiastic participant in musical and other events at the center but he eventually stopped attending and started spending much of his free time at the mosque , upbraiding others for insufficient devotion yet , mr akermi said he had no inkling that he and the others might join jihad in syria this has been my work for 25 years , and i feel this as a failure , he said what am i doing here \? the authorities have set up a hotline to help parents spot and cope with children who might be drifting into extremism they also hope that the election of the new mosque president , rachid benhadj , a shop owner who declined to be interviewed , will usher in a new era of cooperation marked by a greater appreciation of the real dangers posed by radical islam but mr benhadj has yet to declare publicly where he stands , and some worshipers at the mosque insist that there is no need for a new direction the imam at the mosque , who speaks only arabic , condemned the paris attack in his sermon last week at a central traffic circle , a small replica of the statute of liberty , erected in 1889 for the 100th anniversary of the french revolution , has been draped with a je suis charlie banner but worshipers at the mosque expressed little of the solidarity found on the streets of paris what we did before we will continue , said one , who declined to give his name another , complaining of stigmatization by nonmuslims as he brusquely ordered a reporter to leave the mosque s private property , asserted that the paris attacks had not been carried out by muslims but by the french state , to discredit their faith all the same , local officials are still waiting to see what the new mosque president might bring we do n't know what he is like , said pierre souljol , the town s first deputy mayor he seems like a normal local resident we just hope he will help stop this conveyor belt that is sending young people to their deaths as cannon fodder
washington former president george bush s unusually sharp indictment of his son s presidential advisers touched off a round of recriminations on thursday that exposed rifts within america s leading political dynasty and complicated its efforts to recapture the white house mr bush s assertion in a new biography that vice president and defense secretary undercut s presidency rattled the extended bush political world , and forced the second bush son now seeking the presidency , jeb , to straddle an awkward line between family and politics at 91 and in the twilight of a long and storied public life , the first president bush evidently felt free to express views he had long suppressed in the interest of family harmony mr cheney , he said , was very hardline and too eager to use force to get our way mr rumsfeld was an arrogant fellow full of swagger he used the same phrase , ironass , to describe both men the comments , included in s destiny and power the american odyssey of , to be published by random house next week , drew a biting retort from mr rumsfeld on thursday bush 41 is getting up in years and misjudges bush 43 , who i found made his own decisions , mr rumsfeld said in a statement the father s comments also prompted the son to come to his advisers' defense i am proud to have served with dick cheney and don rumsfeld , said george w bush dick cheney did a superb job as vice president and i was fortunate to have him by my side throughout my presidency don rumsfeld ably led the pentagon and was an effective secretary of defense but no one was put in a more uncomfortable position than , who has labored to define his own identity separate from his famous father and brother while mounting his own campaign for the white house this year once again he was compelled on thursday to talk about his family rather than his own plans for the country on the campaign trail , he suggested his father was trying to find a way to take the heat off george w bush by faulting advisers for troubles in his administration my brother is a big boy , jeb bush told nbc news his administration was shaped by his thinking , his reaction to the attack on 9 11 i think my dad , like a lot of people that love george , want to try to create a different narrative , perhaps , just because that s natural to do jeb bush said that mr cheney served my brother well as vice president and he served my dad extraordinarily well as secretary of defense he added , we have to get beyond , i think , this feeling that somehow 1991 is the same as 2001 the seemingly divergent messages from different corners of the bush family represented the latest chapter in a longrunning and at times operatic drama for years , the relationship between the two bush presidents has captivated the nation , generating endless speculation , articles , books , television reports and even a bigscreen movie w that starred josh brolin and was directed by oliver stone caught in the middle now is the next son , who is trying to accomplish what no family has done in american history with a third bush administration those who have worked for either of the two presidents strongly testify to their deep love and scoff at what they call overwrought oedipal theories of rivalry and resentment just last year , george w bush published his own biography of his father , venerating him in loving terms the elder george bush has often bristled at criticism of his son both men hate being put on the couch , to use a phrase each one employs yet few who know them well would assert that they see the world exactly the same way the younger , brasher and more conservative george w bush has made clear that he shaped some of his policies in the white house based on the lessons of what he saw as his father s mistakes friends of the older , more genteel and moderate president bush have often said he was deeply uncomfortable with the more hawkish elements of his son s administration in the new book , the first president bush expresses his love and support for his son and sticks by his decisions to go to war in iraq and remove saddam hussein from power but he gently chides his son for hot rhetoric like his axis of evil speech , and says that the real responsibility for the way mr cheney and mr rumsfeld operated belonged to the president the buck stops there , he said what was so surprising about the comments was not their sentiment , but rather that the older mr bush would express them in public when mr meacham went back to show him a transcript of his remarks and ask if he wanted to clarify , the expresident took none of it back that s what i said , he told mr meacham the remarks reflect a long history with both mr cheney and mr rumsfeld the elder mr bush and mr rumsfeld were rivals going back to the 1970s , and although mr cheney served as his defense secretary , mr bush told mr meacham that mr cheney had changed as vice president speaking with fox news on thursday , mr cheney took the comments in stride , saying he viewed ironass as a compliment i took it as a mark of pride , he said given the devastating losses on sept 11 , 2001 , he said many would agree that i was aggressive in defending , in carrying out what i thought were the right policies having never written a true memoir of his own , mr bush effectively decided to use mr meacham s book as a last chance to make his case for history the elder mr bush opened up to mr meacham in a series of interviews from 2006 to 2015 in which he spoke more candidly than many politicians would he described his youth , when he lusted after pretty girls , including a couple who had nice racks he also mused about his friend bill clinton s marriage i do n't feel close to hillary at all , mr bush said , but i do to bill and i ca n't read their relationship even today like so many former presidents , he measured himself against the 42 other men who have held his office i feel like an asterisk , he told mr meacham wistfully one day at the family s cliffside house in kennebunkport , me i am lost between the glory of reagan monuments everywhere , trumpets , the great hero and the trials and tribulations of my sons , mr bush reflected on another day in houston , where he also has a home on still another occasion , he fretted about the judgment of historians what if they just find an empty deck of cards \? he asked diaries that mr bush gave to mr meacham opened a contemporaneous window into his time in office even in private , mr bush seemed determined through the first war with iraq in 1991 , but afterward fell into an emotional despondency , a letdown , once he was no longer at the center of a profound mission he considered not running for a second term i'm not in a good frame of mind now , he dictated into his diary shortly after american troops vanquished iraqi forces and expelled them from kuwait my whole point is , i really do n't care and that s bad that s bad but i 'll get in there and try for a president who lost reelection in 1992 after being perceived as out of touch , mr bush sensed his political doom even when he was at the peak of his postwar popularity the common wisdom today is that i 'll win in a runaway , but i do n't believe that , he dictated in march 1991 as he returned on from a rally with troops i think it s going to be the economy that will make that determination i think i can talk proudly about what happened in desert storm , but i think it will be overshadowed in the fall of '92 by other issues on that , at least , he proved prescient
the united nations has had eight secretaries general all have been men each has been selected through backroom dealing dominated by the five world powers that hold permanent seats on the security council it s time to change that the appointment of the civil servant who serves as the next head of the united nations should be more transparent it would be powerfully symbolic to appoint a woman to the helm of an organization created 70 years ago to tackle the world s most pressing problems through diplomacy and global consensus encouragingly , both objectives are being championed this year with unprecedented vigor within the united nations as the current secretary general , , moves toward the end of his second fiveyear term on dec 31 , 2016 croatia and namibia are leading an effort to give the organization s 193 member states a greater say in the selection of the secretary general as part of a yearly resolution that is being drafted new guidelines , which are still being negotiated and will be finalized by midseptember , would allow members to formally nominate applicants and vet the finalists until now , the five permanent members of the security council britain , china , france , russia and the united states have bargained behind closed doors to pick from a short list of candidates that is not formally publicized those who have prevailed have been palatable to those five governments , a commondenominator criterion that has the potential to doom the chances of more impressive and qualified public servants currently , there is not an effort underway to make the process truly democratic by allowing member states to elect the secretary general though a vote yet , by opening it to greater public scrutiny , the security council would be likely to take into account input and concerns from around the globe whether or not the process is overhauled , dozens of members of the united nations are pressing for a woman to succeed mr ban , who has been a leader the government of colombia , part of the roughly 20 percent of countries represented by a female ambassador at the united nations , is leading an effort to put forward women for the job gender equality is one of the world s most serious challenges , an unfulfilled goal that remains critical to advance towards an inclusive and sustainable future , mar a emma mej a , the colombian ambassador , wrote in a letter seeking support for a female secretary general a 1946 united nations resolution established that a man of eminence and high attainment should serve as secretary general that obviously should n't be read literally today so far , 44 governments have signed on to colombia s initiative none of the permanent members of the security council have backed it the united states , which is represented at the united nations by samantha power , who has championed women s rights , should be a vocal supporter informal lists of potential candidates have begun to circulate one published by the , an independent group , features the biographies of accomplished world leaders of diverse backgrounds they include president of liberia , , the head of the international monetary fund , and alicia b rcena ibarra , the executive secretary of the  there is no shortage of distinguished women who would revitalize the role of secretary general and energize the organization s ongoing efforts to promote gender equality

nairobi , kenya gang rape , the massacre of civilians and even instances of forcing captives to jump into fires and eat human flesh are among a long list of atrocities committed during s continuing civil war , according to a longawaited by the  the report , published late tuesday but not widely available in eastern africa until wednesday , was written more than a year ago but was held back because officials feared that it could complicate the onagain , offagain peace efforts for , a fragile , destitute nation that exploded into ethnically driven violence two years after winning independence in 2011 according to the african union investigation , the government of president salva kiir , and rebels led by riek machar , the vice president he fired in the summer of 2013 , both targeted civilians the stories and reports of the human toll of the violence and brutality have been heartwrenching , the report said people being burned in places of worship and hospitals mass burials women of all ages raped , both elderly and young women described how they were brutally gangraped and left unconscious and bleeding people were not simply shot , they were subjected , for instance , to beatings before being compelled to jump into a lit fire investigators also heard of some captured people being forced to eat human flesh or forced to drink human blood , the report continued all these accounts evoke the memories of some of the worst episodes of earlier human rights violations on the continent , including in south sudan itself many of these allegations surfaced at the time of intense fighting in late 2013 and early 2014 , but were denied by rebel and government military commanders a south sudan presidential spokesman , ateny wek ateny , told reuters that the government had acknowledged that some individuals have taken the law into their own hands he said the cabinet would meet on friday and issue a more specific response to the report we will not allow impunity , he added the conflict started after mr kiir the two belong to rival ethnic groups that have battled in the past , and their quickly reopened deep ethnic fault lines since then , thousands of people have died , and just last week , united nations agencies warned of an impending famine in areas that continue to be racked by conflict some people fleeing have survived by hiding in swamps and  international mediators have tried to stem the violence , pushing the government and rebels to sign several ceasefire agreements and peace plans so far , none have lasted
paris marine le pen s concession speech after her national front party on sunday was anything but conciliatory , despite more than 70 percent of voters rejecting the farright leader s message of hostility toward immigrants and open borders that bristly intransigence , analysts say , is the key to both the national front s history and its destiny , and the reason in the absence of truly dire economic conditions that a takeover by the far right in is not likely anytime soon what gives the party its fiercely loyal following its vituperative denunciation of migrants , its unconcealed hostility toward muslims , its xenophobic for the french message also makes it an impossible partner for any political group closer to the mainstream and helps block its advancement as a political force throughout the country , in sunday s second round of regional voting , the mainstream parties formed a de facto alliance against the national front , which even lost in the two regions where ms le pen and her niece marion mar chal le pen were favored to win in those areas , in the deindustrializing , highunemployment north and in a south full of those who still regret the loss of french algeria , the thirdfinishing socialist party pulled out of the race , allowing the mainstream right party of the former president , , to win permanent outsider status for the national front outside the golden palaces of the republic , as ms le pen sneered sunday was the result a similar dynamic was in play in departmental elections in march , when over half of the left s voters switched to the mainstream right candidate in the second round , and the right went on to win 535 out of 538 contests with the national front j r me fourquet , a polling expert , noted that the republican front was effective , as a big proportion of the left s voters voted for the right , meaning mr sarkozy s party in the southern region around nice , 65 percent of those who voted socialist in the first round voted for the right s candidate in the second , and in the north around lille , where ms le pen was running , the figure was 70 percent , mr fourquet said at a news conference the gravelly voiced party leader , perpetually sucking on an electronic cigarette , appears to both revel in that status and to be embittered by it and since she represents the courageous and determined patriots , defeat is never her party s fault nevermind the big turnout sunday jumping by more than eight percentage points between the first and second rounds , suggesting an electorate mobilized to beat her and the lopsided rejection instead , she was the victim of a conspiracy , she told her disappointed supporters in the strangely highflown language that is the uneasy bearer of her populist message sunday s loss revealed the fundamental lie on which has rested for decades the french political system , ms le pen said what was revealed with no possible ambiguity were the hitherto occult connections of those who claim to oppose each other but who , in reality , share power , without ever resolving your problems , and worse , lead the country , from one mandate to another , into submersion by migrants and into chaos in other words , the two mainstream parties , the socialists and the republicans , ganged up on her , and she lost the party does n't realize that in order to win power , it has to make allies and expand its audience , said sylvain cr pon , a political scientist and an expert on the national front you can see the limits of its strategy any alliance with the right is impossible , he added to be sure , sunday s election was not a total loss for the party it tripled the number of councilors who will sit on the country s regional assemblies , to 358 , providing a potent carrier for the party s message and it scored a record number of votes , 68 million 400 , 000 more than the previous record in the 2012 presidential election ms le pen made it clear that she is looking forward to the 2017 presidential election in relation to 2017 , she is clearly positioning herself , said val rie igounet , a historian who specializes in the national front the party s political representatives are now spreading themselves out all over france , she said but ms le pen will face the same hurdle then their ideas continue to repulse over 70 percent of the french , mr cr pon said both right and left freely steal from the national front s ideas , with the left often sounding lawandorder themes and the right vowing to crack down on immigration the other two parties wage their campaigns around the front s ideas , mr cr pon said but they are always careful to avoid its extreme xenophobia and its antimuslim rhetoric what distinguishes the national front is its outrageousness , its radicalism , mr cr pon said the party s dilemma , never resolved , is that if it is too radical , it marginalizes itself , but if it normalizes itself , it becomes too commonplace as ms le pen s father , jeanmarie , the party s founder , once remarked , none of its base voters would be interested in a national front that sounds too tame the party s supporters made that much abundantly clear at a boisterous flagwaving rally here last week with all this immigration , and then the immigration leading to terrorism she said it , and nobody was listening , said nellie viaro , a national front municipal councilor from the paris suburbs she s a woman of conviction who is persecuted by the socialists , said yves breugnot , a party activist he added , referring to france s flag , with the socialists , there is no bluewhitered , there is only red there were no big winners in sunday s vote , though the ruling socialists did better than expected , holding on to five regions to the right s seven and getting just under 30 percent of the vote mr sarkozy s party , with just over 40 percent , was hoping to sweep the boards but fell far short , a result interpreted by most pundits as a sign of strength for the socialist president , fran ois hollande , in the preelectoral period before 2017 france s stagnant economy and high unemployment have kept mr hollande at rock bottom in the polls for much of his tenure but he rose in popularity after the nov 13 , when he was credited with unifying and reassuring a frightened country that rise was reflected in sunday s less than disastrous regional poll results
re \( sunday review , feb 8 \) judith shulevitz is of course right that many schools are failing to handle reports of sexual violence appropriately yet her proposed answer to integrate school proceedings with police reporting would return us to the early days of coeducation , when women , despite their formal admittance to university life , faced unconscionable barriers to learning and thriving in the form of assault and harassment without meaningful recourse title ix , which compels universities to respond to these issues , does not replace the criminal law but offers an additional option for students who need help staying in school after abuse and these students overwhelmingly tell us that , were their schools to turn over their reports to the police , they would simply report the abuse to no one at all fair process for the accused is a critical component of title ix counter to ms shulevitz s representation , the department of education provides the most robust protections for students accused of sexual assault , more than classmates facing any other disciplinary charges let s encourage schools to follow title ix rather than destroy a safety net that many survivors of abuse or assault need to stay in school dana bolger alexandra brodsky washington the reason the government is mandating action against sexual assault on campus is that many schools have avoided acting on their own when statistics show that the university of virginia expelled 180 students for cheating since 1998 while none have been expelled for sexual assault in the school s history , it is time to mandate a reexamination of the school s policies the university of virginia does not stand alone adjudication of sexual assault on a college or university campus is not a criminal trial it is to determine if there is a violation of student conduct many victims do n't want to endure the stress and emotional impact of a criminal trial but have the right to be safe on campus bullying , verbal harassment , drinking , vandalism and racism all fall under behaviors that schools address to make their campuses safe and productive places to learn sexual assault should be no different allison tombros korman arlington , va re \( editorial , feb 8 \) you accurately note the inadequacy of current data regarding sexual assault on american college campuses the association of american universities campus climate survey on sexual assault and sexual misconduct , which will be administered by the research firm westat to thousands of students on 28 university campuses in april , will help address this problem our primary goal is to provide data to these universities that will inform their efforts to formulate policies and practices for keeping students safe and helping them to feel safe in addition , we hope that the aggregate data , which westat will analyze and we will make public later this year , will not only help government policy makers as they work on related legislation and administrative actions , but also make a significant contribution to the existing body of research in this important , complex field hunter r rawlings iii president association of american universities washington
jalalabad , afghanistan parveena almost got away she was on her way home from a visit to her parents in a remote corner of eastern with her children by her side and a small group of women two men , their faces covered by kaffiyehs , pulled up on a motor scooter who is parveena , daughter of sardar \? said one , looking at the group of women , their faces hidden behind blue burqas no one answered one of the men took his kalashnikov and used the muzzle to lift the burqa of the nearest woman in conservative afghan society , a gesture akin to undressing her in public it was parveena , who like many afghans used only one name she grabbed the muzzle , according to her father and her brother , and said , who is asking \? but the gunmen had seen her face , and they fired 11 bullets into her parveena s story she was one of six policewomen killed in 2013 is an extreme case , but it reflects the dangers and difficulties of afghan policewomen and the broader western effort to engineer gender equality in afghanistan the plight of women under the captured the western imagination , and their liberation became a rallying cry a flood of money and programs poured into afghanistan , for girls' schools and women s shelters and television shows , all aimed at elevating women s status but these good intentions often foundered against the strength of afghan sexual conservatism as the tale of afghan policewomen shows , repressive views of women were not just a taliban curse , but also a deeply embedded part of society now , as western troops and money flow out of afghanistan , the question is just how much the encounter with the west and its values has really changed the country , and whether any of the foreign ideas about the status of women took hold in 2001 , when the taliban regime fell , women in afghanistan were among the very worst off on earth they had no access to education , women s health care was scant , and governmentsanctioned public beatings were widely accepted women rarely ventured out at all , and when they did , they had to be accompanied by a man and covered head to toe with a burqa fourteen years later , there is a palpable sense of possibility for women , especially in urban areas girls are going to school in large numbers , at least up to age 11 , and there is more access to women s health care even in some remote parts of the country however , in rural areas and in the pashtundominated east and south , most women still live confined lives they are subjected often to forced marriage , child marriage and beatings , and sometimes to honor killings and conditions for afghan women over all still rank close to the bottom among developing countries hiring and training policewomen have been key priorities of western governments and funders they reasoned that afghan women and girls , who face high levels of violence , sometimes on a daily basis , would be more likely to report abuse or seek help if they could turn to other women , and that meant ensuring there were women on the police force but those hopes ran up against the sexual taboos that haunt every interaction between men and women in afghanistan policewomen have been branded as little more than prostitutes , dishonoring their families that stigma means that mostly desperate women , usually illiterate and poor , have joined the force in a society where coercive sex is a frequent tool , many endure sexual harassment for fear of losing their jobs afghan policewomen , struggling to maintain good reputations , face a legion of logistical problems poorly understood by western donors a need for separate changing rooms in police stations , for example , since women are afraid to wear their uniforms on their way to work after a decade and millions of dollars , even the modest goal of recruiting 5 , 000 policewomen remains a mirage in fact , only 2 , 700 are on the force , less than 2 percent of the 169 , 000 members , according to the united nations' office in kabul based on numbers from the afghan interior ministry the situation in afghanistan is not prepared for women to work with men , and our community is not ready for female police to work here , said col ali aziz ahmad mirakai , who heads recruitment for conservative nangarhar province , where parveena worked colonel mirakai , who supports having more policewomen , sighed the police commanders i work with say we do n't need them to work with us until noon and go home instead of female police , send us male police' he said , alluding to the reality that many women have to leave work early to care for their families to assemble a portrait of policewomen s experiences , the new york times interviewed more than 60 policewomen , male police commanders , interior ministry officials , western military officials and staff members of nongovernmental organizations a united nations report given to the ministry in 2013 but never publicly released in part because of fears of possible reprisals against policewomen found that 70 percent of the 130 policewomen interviewed had experienced sexual harassment , with smaller numbers reporting rape or more explicit pressures to have sex the interior ministry s and afghan society s generally negative view of policewomen , the lack of a confidential complaints mechanism , corruption , lack of facilities , discrimination and sexual harassment remain primary barriers , said georgette gagnon , the head of the united nations' human rights division in afghanistan the clash between western ideals and afghan realities means a program established to promote women has all too often backfired , subjecting the recruits themselves to abuse and retribution the small but real achievements have been in some of the familyresponse units , which give female victims a chance to talk to a policewoman and gain access to female lawyers it s the absurdity of imposing our liberal western beliefs , said a western diplomat who has spent many years in afghanistan and asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject for governments that have invested heavily in training afghan women for the security forces it s easy for us to put these women out there and tout their accomplishments , but then we leave , cut them loose , and what happens to them \? like all the women who work with her in kabul police district no10 , sharifa aziza is too frightened to wear her uniform outside the office she does not want her neighbors to know she is a policewoman unlike most of her colleagues who stay inside a rickety trailer working as searchers and patting down women who enter the police compound , ms aziza works in the familyresponse unit and occasionally helps with criminal cases she counts herself lucky that she is subjected less to the harassment of younger male police officers , who bother the female searchers almost constantly one spring day , the windows of the female searchers' small trailer were open and a policeman kept poking his head in , saying kiss me to a young female colleague of ms aziza i have told him no , ' the young woman said forcefully i will not leave until i bite your face , he said in a tone that was meant to be playful but that had an edge to it the woman looked at the floor there is no effective confidential complaint system when policewomen are harassed senior police officials could not remember any complaints from women that had been formally prosecuted , and they minimized the problem some women are pressured into giving in good women are pushed into doing bad things , said madina , 21 , a policewoman in eastern afghanistan who would allow only her first name to be used to protect her safety ms aziza s boss , nooria sediqi , a second lieutenant who is about 50 , displayed considerable knowledge of prostitution arrangements within the police the salaries are low , she said of police pay for a session of sex , a woman could earn 100 or even 200 , she said that is half a month s salary for a junior policewoman , and a great deal even for a more senior one occasionally older policewomen have acted as madams , procuring younger ones either for men within the police force or outside it , according to two of the policewomen interviewed for this article as well as western officials who work with the police interviews suggest that many policewomen , aware they have few useful skills and untrained in how to behave professionally , are vulnerable to sexual pressure they are easy targets for more senior males who can withhold their pay or assign them to jobs far from home , and so policewomen are fearful of complaining ten years ago , ms aziza followed two of her brothers who had joined the security forces and enlisted with the police , hoping to earn enough to help sustain her family in those early years of president hamid karzai s administration , afghanistan was full of promise women in cities had begun to take off their burqas and there was a widespread sense of a new start it seemed to me then a very good and clean job , she said then her husband died of cancer and she had to take in the wife and children of her brother , who is a drug addict even though she earns twice as much as cleaners for the education ministry , her 240 monthly salary is nowhere near enough after paying 100 for rent and as much as 80 for electricity , there is rarely more than 60 left for food , medicine and clothing this is the room of a widow woman , ms aziza said , gesturing to the dark tworoom hovel where she lives on an abandoned construction site outside , a broken bedspring sat between torn bags of cement , a promise of construction that was never realized the sharp smells of urine and sour milk pervaded the house it was a friday , her day off , and she flung open her sole cupboard to show her prized possessions her crisply pressed police uniform was draped in plastic to keep out the relentless dust she showed certificates for attending police seminars , describing which dignitaries presided over each ceremony then she rummaged until she found a picture of a pretty 8yearold girl smiling into the camera my daughter , she said here , when a woman is widowed , she has to marry her husband s brother and i refused , she said it was a moment of independence , but it quickly turned tragic her motherinlaw , concluding that ms aziza must be morally lacking when she turned down a chance to be respectable , took the child from her while afghan law allows a widow to have custody of her children , as a practical matter the lack of money often results in the children staying with relatives ms aziza sees her daughter now only once a year , on her birthday she took my daughter by force , said ms aziza , staring into the photo as if the girl might walk out of it and into her arms tears came to her eyes embarrassed , she looked away soon it would be time to make dinner and there was not much other than some bread left from the morning and a bag of okra ms aziza s family obligations are common among women in the police force , and often limit what they can accomplish on the job they have to look after their children , cook , make dinner , clean they have to leave early to take care of family matters , said col ali akbar mahmoudi , the former police chief in ms aziza s district , who is a supporter of policewomen none of the women police are coming during the night just in some exceptional cases when we send them a police vehicle to pick them up for a raid the men , by contrast , he said , are flexible , they work all jobs , 24 hours they pull guard at night in fact , many of the women said they had been left to make their own way home after raids and only recently had been given separate toilets and changing rooms ms aziza s day starts in the dark hours before dawn when she rises to make tea before setting out at 6 30 am for work , which begins at 8 usually she takes a series of minibuses , squeezing into vehicles so packed with people that they are in danger of tipping over the need for transportation for women in a society where respectable women do not go out of their homes alone was one of the many details that escaped western organizations that gave money for women s empowerment , said anastasiya hozyainova , who worked as a consultant to the united nations and the european union the policewomen do n't receive transportation help , for instance , so how can a woman even get to work \? she said under pressure by western funders to meet gender targets , police officials hired any woman who would sign up but there were few recruits in the countryside col saboor khan , who until 2014 was the longtime deputy for gender , children s rights and human rights at the interior ministry , said that in traditional afghan culture , it s a shame for a woman to work , and that also reflects on the family ms aziza works in the gender and family response unit of district 10 , a section that exists at least nominally in every police department in afghanistan to deal with domestic violence but many women are not allowed to leave the house except with a male relative , and often that relative is either the person who was beating her or someone in the family allied with him and even if a battered woman is able to get away , there is a profound shame associated with talking about such matters to someone outside the family even other women the result is that 12 years later , there are still relatively few cases for the units of the 13 policewomen in the 318member force in district 10 , most are searchers one , feriba , stood in the trailer s small entry , looking out at the scrawny shrubs in the yard her salary supports a disabled husband and six children do you think we want to do this \? she asked i would do anything else , she said , answering her own question ms aziza nonetheless believes that district 10 is better than most both the former interior minister , umar daudzai , and the new one , nur alhaq ulumi , have tried to push commanders to find jobs more suitable for women they listen to women more here , ms aziza said in the past year , at least they gave us a separate toilet maybe they received much pressure from the world community and that has created pressure to take care of the women , she said early in 2014 , when there were still substantial numbers of american and nato troops in afghanistan but i am worried , she said after 2014 , what should we do \? zarif shaan naibi is that rare figure among afghan policewomen a success story the first female warden of kabul s women s prison , she stands out among the overwhelmingly male command structure of the interior ministry her realm is a barren patch of ground on the northeast side of kabul with the threestory prison at its center six days a week ms naibi goes to her office in a building next to the prison , and after attending meetings and signing paperwork , she wades into the prison itself once painted white , the prison building is now badly scuffed , and the female prisoners seem to pour out of it the prison has been overcrowded for years at the end of 2014 , it housed 33 percent more women than the 120 it was supposed to hold , according to prison officials the women jostle to lean out of the windows and crowd at the front door , but there is nowhere to go other than the small bare yard , where even weeds seem to have a hard time growing before she even reaches the stairwell , ms naibi is besieged by women asking her for medical care , to arrange lawyers' visits , or for help settling disputes a woman of medium height with hair either swept under a police cap or under a neat hijab , ms naibi neither puts on airs nor appears particularly dominating , but her sense of purpose is unmistakable she steadily navigates the prison s maelstrom of emotion , keeping herself at arm s length she relies on her rare ability to create privacy for conversations she pats one inmate on the arm and then does the same to another , a gesture that is at once maternal and admonishing she asks them to hug each other and makes them promise to stop fighting her success appears to be rooted partly in her training in the late 1970s and the 1980s , when afghanistan s government was imbued with communist ideology the period offered exceptional opportunity for women , especially in urban areas as ethnic hazaras , a group that was persecuted by the taliban and has now embraced education and the modern world , ms naibi s mother and brothers allowed her to join the police , and when she married , her husband allowed her to continue he is now in the defense ministry ms naibi recalls that in her day all her teachers at the police training center were women now they are almost all men under the communists , women s education was valued and candidates for the police were vetted , she said if she was n't educated , they would n't take her if she had graduated from high school , they would send her to the police academy but these communist ideals encountered resistance from much of afghan society then under the taliban , most policewomen were banished , and ms naibi s family , as hazaras , had to flee when the police were reconstituted after the taliban s ouster in 2001 , the afghan leadership was desperate for women to serve , calling former policewomen back to work as well as recruiting new ones for ms naibi , it was a second birth when the ministry put out the word , she went immediately still wearing her burqa , required garb under taliban rule , because she could not quite believe it was safe to take it off many other women came , too we were standing in this room and then we began to recognize each other s voices coming from under our burqas and we were saying is it really you \? are you still alive \? ' more than half of her charges in prison today are there for moral crimes , a vast category that includes running away from home and intending to commit adultery either crime can taint a woman for the rest of her life also among the inmates are policewomen , most of them in prison for running afoul of morality laws of the six there during a visit last winter , only one was accused of a violent crime \( she tried to kill her husband \) two appeared to have been victims of an unsuccessful effort to blackmail them into paying a bribe to avoid jail , but since they had no money , they ended up in prison forlorn and confused , they were embarrassed that they had accepted an invitation to have dinner with the son of a police commander , setting them up to be arrested for being alone with a man to whom they were not married watching ms naibi is a lesson in what could be possible for women in afghanistan one morning , she was arguing with the male security guards about their schedules just keep on one guy who knows everything , she said the guards sat in silence , leaving it unclear whether they understood her instructions one then complained that the ministry did not act quickly on personnel matters she sighed audibly yes , ok we 'll fix everything , i 'll sort it out the male guards saluted her when they left as they would a male commander yes , there will be negative discrimination against women , but it s up to you to command authority , ms naibi said it does n't matter if you 're a man or a woman it s your duty that defines you with five children and a disabled husband , parveena , 28 , was both desperate for work and overwhelmed by the task of caring for her family there were few choices and none that would pay as well as being a policewoman , she said in an interview barely a month before she was killed in july 2013 parveena was attending a seminar for junior policewomen in jalalabad , the largest city in conservative eastern afghanistan , where tribal law often trumps government authority in contrast with a number of fully veiled women in the room , parveena wore a white shawl over her head and had a warm open smile of the 3 , 850member force in nangarhar province in 2013 , there were just 32 women , which meant most women worked alone in a sea of men , struggling to preserve their reputations i am the only female where i work , parveena said then i do n't talk to anyone , i do n't give anyone my phone number or take anybody s phone number i just come at 8 and leave at 12 and then take the leftover food that people do n't eat for my kids , she said , referring to the leftovers from policemen s lunches even then , she knew the risks my inlaws do n't support me , she said , but then suggested that she had never told them about her job they do n't know only my brothers know still , parveena was enthusiastic about her work her father , a frail man of 70 , said she liked it so much , she persuaded her younger brother to join the police as well her commanders said they respected her hard work , so much so that they entrusted her with the dangerous mission of recruiting more women for the police force when she was visiting her home district of lal pur , near the pakistani border recruiting women for the security services can be dangerous even in a large city , but in a region where the government had no presence , it turned deadly all the more so because as much as a year before she was killed , the taliban learned of her job , said wali khan , 21 , her younger brother she was doing the job secretly , he said , telling only her immediate family and not wearing a uniform then a year ago one of our relatives who was in the taliban found out and he told people that put her life at risk agnesa shinwari , a member of the local provincial council , said , in afghanistan , if your husband allows you to work or your father allows you , it does n't matter the woman is still not safe , she said , if another family member does not approve she said she had heard that cousins of parveena were involved in her death the provincial police accused the taliban , but local taliban commanders denied involvement after the killing , the family quickly called relatives who were in the taliban and they heard there had been a spy , a person they knew in the community who had tipped off the taliban to her visit to her home district her brother s casual reference to taliban relatives is a chilling reminder of how hard it is to know which side people are on or if they are on both her father summed it up bitterly as he sat on a lumpy cot in the bare room in jalalabad where he was visiting his son who killed her \? god knows , god knows better than i everyone is pulling a shawl on their face and calling themselves taliban , he said as word spread that parveena had been killed , some whispered that she had had an affair or had been bold with men madina , 21 , a policewoman who attended seminars with parveena , said the talk of immoral acts was a lie she was a good and clean and honest woman , she said yet the stigma of being a policewoman remains so powerful that even after parveena s father and brothers picked up her body , they could find no mullahs in their village who would bury her or say the funeral prayers there were six mullahs in our village , and after she was killed they disappeared intentionally , her brother wali said the taliban had told the mullahs , do n't do a funeral ceremony for those people , ' and not one would say the prayers for my sister
morgantown , wva rudolph norris walked out of morgantown federal prison two weeks ago carrying a duffel bag like no other first , he had spent six months handstitching it himself from dozens of mottled leather scraps , symbolizing the shards of his life he longed to piece back together then he unzipped it and pulled out his invitation to try dear rudolph , the letter began , i wanted to personally inform you that i have granted your application for commutation it was signed  mr norris s 22 years behind bars over with the stroke of the president s pen , he showed off the letter to his receiving crowd of siblings , inlaws and , mostly , his allgrownup daughter , rajean , who had wondered if she would ever again see her father out of an orange jumpsuit \( that s my daddy ! she said as he came into view , sounding like the 8yearold she had been back when he was sentenced \) mr norris hugged and cried and fistbumped then the exinmate , a newly minted symbol of second chances , rode the family s rental van from west virginia back to maryland mr norris , 58 , was one of 22 federal prisoners released on july 28 through a continuing bipartisan to shorten the sentences of nonviolent drug offenders who , during the warondrugs fervor of decades ago , received punishments far lengthier than they would have drawn today the mass incarceration of those days crowded prisons at great expense , and was found to have disproportionately penalized minority crackcocaine offenders like mr norris , who was convicted of possessing and selling the substance in 1992 and sentenced to 30 years in prison the commutations , announced on march 31 , preserve the conviction but end the sentence one commutation went to a 65yearold kentucky who had drawn a life sentence for running a huge marijuana farm six others were freed from life sentences for cocainerelated offenses announced another round of 46 commutations on july 13 prisoners must wait three months for their actual release and is considering more mr norris s winding , sixprison path to freedom followed early resentment over his long sentence , fatalistic acclimation to a middle age lived behind bars , and then 10 years in which he spent dozens of hours a week in prison libraries learning federal drug law and pursuing legal avenues to release his efforts foundered before mr obama s clemency initiative saw his case routed to a law school clinic and a student who received it as a class assignment their serendipitous work together , culminating in mr norris s release , led prisoners and wardens alike to call him the miracle of morgantown during his first days of freedom , mr norris delighted in slurping his first chocolate shake and fixing his granddaughter s barbie playhouse he goggled at technology he had never used , from the internet to handsfree bathroom sinks but he also recognized the challenges so many recently released prisoners face finding work despite his record getting his own home rather than crashing in his brother s basement indefinitely and generally convincing a skeptical society that he is a changed man not everyone will fly the yellow happyface balloons that greeted him at his big sister s welcomehome party the afternoon he arrived he s going to be fighting for his life , said courtney stewart , the founder of the reentry network for returning citizens , a volunteer organization based in washington that helps recently released prisoners pursue employment , housing and mental health services it s going to be hard as hell , but he has to be willing to do whatever it takes it s not going to be up to him what that is he wo n't decide how long he s going to have to do it he 'll have to have some faith mr norris immediately called his parole officer to learn his responsibilities and pledge to follow them \( his clemency does not vacate the eight years of probation to which he was originally sentenced \) he applied for food stamps and , because all he had was his morgantown inmate card , pursued a more marketable driver s license his commitment to playing by the rules was so strong that he avoided a daylabor landscaping opportunity because it paid in cash , and he wanted to pay taxes like everyone else as i navigate my way back to society and begin a productive life , he wrote to mr obama in april , one of the first and foremost thoughts on my mind will be my solemn commitment to prove to you that your faith in me was not at all misplaced mr norris fit the requirements of the obama administration s clemency program almost perfectly he had demonstrated model behavior while serving at least 10 years for a relatively lowlevel , nonviolent drug crime the court s 1993 presentencing report stated flatly , there was no victim in this offense still , sentencing standards of the time called for 30 years in prison not that mr norris s record had been exemplary before that a lifelong resident of hardscrabble northern washington , dc , he had been convicted of seven crimes since he was a teenager , from possession of marijuana to check forgery to robbery none involved violence or a weapon he was in and out of prison until the mid1980s , when he held legitimate jobs painting and rustproofing cars , delivering water bed mattresses but also made 7 , 000 a month dealing crack cocaine , a drug so pervasive that even washington s mayor , marion s barry jr , was smoking it in 1992 , police officers targeting mr norris found 291 small bags of crack totaling 29 grams in his chrysler lebaron convertible i was n't addicted to the drugs , mr norris said during his van ride back to maryland , adding that he has not used any illegal substance or alcohol since 1983 i was addicted to the lifestyle having had discipline issues during several earlier incarcerations including a fight in which he stabbed an inmate with half a pair of scissors mr norris , then in his mid30s , committed himself to clean time and the development of work skills he took a 4 , 000hour course as an electronics inspector , worked jobs like making furniture and packaging recyclables , and had only three minor disciplinary violations in 22 years , according to prison records his behavior earned him a 2012 transfer to the minimumsecurity prison in morgantown ribbed by younger inmates there as old gangsta , mr norris spent several hours a day in the law library , poring over the federal rules of criminal procedure and case law that might suggest some way to shorten his sentence \( he said he received tutoring from a fellow inmate , , a corporate lawyer serving 12 years for insider trading \) in april 2014 , when the obama administration announced its clemency initiative , he sensed an opportunity but federal public were not allowed to handle clemency applications , so the lawyers who had represented mr norris forwarded his case to law school s neighborhood law and policy , which allows 10 students per semester to assist inmates for class credit a thirdyear student , courtney francik , got the assignment last fall ms francik , 27 , a harvard graduate from the baltimore suburb of cockeysville , had heard from friends who had gone to law school that their most valuable experience came from handling real cases in a clinic , she said in a recent telephone interview she signed up and soon found herself engrossed , taking the unusual step of staying on for the spring semester as well i almost moved into the clinic building for mr norris s case , ms francik said i could n't wait to get to the clinic building in the morning and start working working closely with two lawyers at the clinic , ms francik prepared 182 pages of legal and personal material to support mr norris s clemency application her enthusiasm and confidence during their one facetoface meeting at morgantown , in november , along with phone calls and numerous letters , so encouraged mr norris that he began sewing the leather bag he hoped to carry out of prison his application was submitted in midfebruary , joining thousands of others from inmates nationwide they were evaluated by department of justice lawyers , who recommended top candidates for white house officials to cull mr obama reviewed data on each finalist , a white house spokesman said , before using his constitutional authority to commute their sentences in the early afternoon of march 31 , a white house lawyer called the clinic to say that mr norris had become one of 22 people who would be getting letters of congratulations from mr obama ms francik received a text and bolted from her class professional responsibility to join the phone call alerting mr norris , who naturally was in morgantown s law library he burst into tears i'm not going to die in prison , he recalled saying as he cried once more i'm on my way home mr norris spent the threemonth wait for his release making sure he did nothing to jeopardize his good fortune \( although most inmates were happy for him , a few resented his special treatment and tried to provoke altercations , he said \) on the morning he left for good , he told a crowd of hundreds of inmates seeing him off i'm not better than you i just had to grow up walking toward his family in the parking lot , mr norris wore heavy gray sweatpants and heavier gray whiskers , some pounds having migrated from his barrel chest to his belly , but still with the muscular shoulders of his distant youth \( his brotherinlaw remarked , man , he looks good \) mr norris s younger son , raymond , who could not travel to the reunion from new mexico , received mr norris s first phone call and a promise it 'll be my last game of basketball i'm going to show you what daddy s got left and then retire the fivehour ride home , during which he took 34 calls on six different family cellphones , included crucial stops for a wendy s chocolate frosty and some outletmall sneakers having never used a cellphone , he officially entered the 21st century when spotty reception on interstate 68 caused him to inquire , can you hear me now \? family members fought over who would buy him a wallet , a watch and a jersey of his beloved washington redskins do n't buy anything for me wait till i work , i 'll buy it for myself , mr norris pleaded i do n't want to be no burden i been y'all s burden for 25 years at the welcomeback barbecue among two dozen family members in his older sister s backyard , mr norris destroyed a crate of hardshelled crabs brought just for him he met his daughter s three children , including 2yearold zuri , whom he hoisted on his shoulder and told can i have some sugar \? i 've been waiting to see you this is all your family it s my family , too mr norris s younger brother , bruce , brought him back to his house in upper marlboro , md , where a new fullsize mattress and several sets of clothes awaited in the madeup basement room he will use until he gets on his feet the next morning , he showed that his playful side had survived prison he phoned bruce and said frantically , i messed up the alarm and the police have me in cuffs outside the house ! only to bellow in laughter afterward mr norris then met his probation officer to learn the terms of his supervised release he may not leave the district of columbia , maryland or virginia for 60 days , must check in with her regularly , and is subject to drug testing a violation could bring its own punishment , which could include jail , but would not affect his commutation a growing number of state and federal officials from both parties are supporting measures to decrease the prison population by lightening punishments for some drugrelated offenders , who according to federal make up roughly half of the 15 million federal and state prisoners the fair sentencing act of 2010 eliminated the fiveyear minimum sentence for firsttime possession of crack , and decreased higher mandatory punishments for dealing crack with a prior criminal record the day after visiting the probation office , mr norris met with a social services agent who briefed him on more than a dozen state assistance programs , including ones that offer free interview clothes and health exams at the wellmobile , a clinic on wheels that drives around maryland applying for food stamps meant his first attempt at a technology forbidden in prison the internet i feel like a 5yearold trying to learn this stuff , he said , poking hesitantly at a keyboard as for the critical job hunt , the social services representative told mr norris that he has more skills than many people in his position besides his experience painting cars and delivering packages , she said , his electronicsinspection classes and exemplary prison work record would encourage employers willing to look past his incarceration the question is how many of those there will be mr stewart , of the association that aids exprisoners , said initial job searches typically last between nine months and two years and tend to lead to work that is custodial , or related to the restaurant or lodging industries one of mr norris s brothersinlaw is a shuttlebus driver for a local hotel and will try to get him a job there , while another looks into some gardening work i 'll take the lowest honest job out there i just want to get started , mr norris said society does n't owe me anything i owe society for dealing drugs a few nights after his release , mr norris phoned the person he credits most for his coming home ms francik , the student with whom he had not spoken since she delivered news of his clemency three months ago she graduated in may and just started work as a public defender in shelby county , tenn miss courtney , y'all kept telling me i was a primary person the clemency was about , mr norris told her i kept hearing how confident y'all were that s what made me make it y'all were the vessels to get me home it was an honor , mr norris it really was , she replied i believe in you i'm trying to get gainfully employed in a hurry , he said , so i can be able to provide and get my own place i have the freedom to do what i want to do as long as i do it right the two spoke for an hour as the conversation wound down , ms francik told him , i'm going to be back in a few weeks and the whole clinic team wants to take you out to dinner wherever you want i 'll be dressed , pressed and at my best , he said then he paused for drama , as if his story lacked any but one thing , he said what \? i 'll have a job by then , he vowed and i'm paying for you
to the sports editor re outspoken and , now , out of work , dec 5 as reported , morgan burke , athletic director at purdue , was a vice president at the inland steel company he reported directly to me this was during a period when the north american steel industry was beleaguered and our survival was very much at risk we had to execute an aggressive turnaround effort , and even though we were able to increase sales , layoffs were inevitable at morgan s urging , he and i met with small groups of affected employees , explaining our situation and laying out the prospects as to when they might be recalled to work , if at all i well remember how deeply he was touched after each of these tough , emotional meetings i have rarely seen such a combination of empathy , skill and leadership in an individual i seriously doubt that within the purdue athletic department itself , much less the entire university campus , speaking one s mind freely and openly is discouraged to the sports editor re poets cheer bryant s crossover move , dec 3 andrew keh notes that kobe bryant s poetic announcement of retirement was an exciting , rare moment in which a poem entered mainstream culture the article also quotes david gordon , who imagines a world in which stadiums are filled with people screaming for poetry , along with basketball keh reminds us of bryant s earlier efforts in rap , and writes that after the retirement announcement , slam poetry suddenly had new meaning indeed , it is easy to imagine connections among rap , slam poetry , and bryant s poem , and to remember then that rap artists do fill stadiums with audiences eager to listen to poetic verses even if meant to be lighthearted , in its casual acceptance of a narrow definition of poetry this article about a poetic newcomer only preserves such narrowness it is also worth noting that for a piece about an africanamerican athlete who drew on traditions of hiphop and slam poetry , none of the poets interviewed is africanamerican or a slam poet to the sports editor re few wins but much chaos at rutgers after move to the big ten , dec 9 i found this to be an incredibly disconcerting piece due to its dwelling so much on rutgers s past , despite the positive changes as of late the article made it sound as if rutgers , a great academic university , has poured all of its money into athletics as a senior student , i have seen new academic buildings , new dorms , new faculty , exciting events and positive adjustments around campus rutgers absolutely could not refuse the invitation into the big ten it was a life raft additionally , rutgers just reached a 1 billion endowment with all of this , people should look to new jersey s state university s future a lot of house cleaning has been done in our athletics department , and rutgers will , undoubtedly , become a school with greater academics and great athletics soon
for fans , yoenis cespedes has been the ultimate summer romance a dynamic outfielder acquired at the end of july but almost certain to go elsewhere after the 2015 season , when he will become a free agent one reason for that perception is that cespedes , one of the most physically talented players the mets have ever had , is in line for a new contract of 150 million or more , which is a huge amount of money for the financially modest mets another reason is that cespedes s current deal , which he signed with the oakland a s in 2012 , included an unusual provision that gave whatever team he was playing for in this case , the mets only five days to resign him when his initial fouryear contract expired if the mets could not do that and signing a player to a major deal in a fiveday window is not easy for any club the mets would be unable to offer cespedes a new contract until next may in other words , say goodbye and then sit and watch cespedes play like a demon in some other location , maybe even the bronx , in 2016 all of that might still happen but if it does , at least the mets will have had a fighting chance to keep cespedes , which did not appear to be the case until tuesday , when it was disclosed that the daunting fiveday provision in his current contact had been waived under an agreement reached by the mets , major league baseball , the players' union and cespedes s current agent , roc nation sports , the mets will now be able to negotiate with cespedes throughout the freeagency period this winter , just like any other club no doubt , it made sense to cespedes s representatives to give a largemarket team like the mets a full shot to retain their client and maybe even push up the bidding now all the mets have to do is sign him whether they will make a competitive offer to cespedes is anyone s guess though their payroll has inched up some in the wake of their damaging involvement in the bernard l madoff financial scandal , the mets have studiously avoided bidding for topline free agents and have instead chosen to spend on cheaper alternatives like curtis granderson , bartolo colon and michael cuddyer in addition , general manager sandy alderson has cautioned against mortgaging the team s future by signing any player to an exorbitant deal , and the fact that cespedes will turn 30 in october will probably make alderson even more cautious still , there has been a wow factor in cespedes s limited time in new york that the mets are quite aware of in 34 games entering tuesday s contest against washington , he had collected 24 extrabase hits and 31 runs batted in his arm is second to none in baseball and more than any other player , he has propelled the mets to what could be their first division title in nine years the mets do have a few factors that might work in their favor in trying to keep cespedes in flushing they have two veterans , colon and daniel murphy , set to become free agents after this season , and with the mets unlikely to resign either player , their departure will represent a savings of about 19 million a year in addition , cespedes appears to genuinely enjoy playing on the new york stage , and with the mets in the clubhouse , he jokes around with juan lagares , ruben tejada , juan uribe and colon on the field , he seems energized by playing in the mets' first pennant race in years , and mets fans clearly adore him the day the mets acquired him was the turning point of their season i do n't really know what they 're thinking , cespedes said through an interpreter after monday s stirring win over the nationals , in which he homered and had two doubles but my thing is to go out there and have fun i enjoy the team it s a really great team i love the city of new york i love the fans what we 've got going here is a really good thing as encouraging as those words might sound to a mets fan dreaming that cespedes will stick around for a few more years , there were more sober ones offered last weekend by john ricco , the mets' assistant general manager speaking before it was publicly known that the mets would have a much bigger window to retain cespedes , he said the way the rest of the season , and a potential postseason , played out would have an immense impact on how hard the mets might fight to keep cespedes from going elsewhere if we do n't make the playoffs , versus winning the world series those are two different scenarios , ricco said and his contribution to either is going to factor in on tuesday night against the nationals , cespedes made a rare and costly mistake , letting a basesloaded single bounce past him in center field everyone scored , including the batter , michael taylor but an inning later , cespedes made up for all of it , lining a twoout , basesloaded double that put the mets right back in the game it was just one more reason the mets will think long and hard about if they can keep him , and how much it might cost
toronto marco estrada came up with a superb start in the most important outing of his career , stopping the ' hit parade and helping the send the american league championship series back to kansas city estrada pitched onehit ball into the eighth inning , giving toronto s tattered bullpen a rest , and the blue jays beat the royals , 71 , on wednesday to close the gap in the series to three games to two it s the start that we needed , troy tulowitzki said they 're a great team over there we know that but this guy kept them off balance and allowed the offense to settle in and get some runs tulowitzki provided three of those runs he broke the game open with a basesclearing double against kelvin herrera in the sixth , giving him seven rbi in the series edwin encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against edinson volquez , who seemed flustered by close calls against the royals kansas city had 30 hits in the first two games in toronto , but estrada faced the minimum number of batters , 20 , before lorenzo cain walked with two outs in the seventh roberto osuna was perfect in the ninth yordano ventura will start for the royals , the defending al champions , on friday in game 6 against david price , who lost game 2 estrada , a 32yearold who will be a free agent in the offseason , enabled his bullpen to rest , a day after kansas city romped , 142 , in a game that saw infielder cliff pennington pitch in the ninth this time around , i had a better fastball command , said estrada , who gave up three runs in the opener that was the key to this game toronto is trying to become just the 13th team to rally and win among the 80 who have trailed three games to one in bestofseven postseason series it has happened four times out of 17 in league championship series , including when the royals bounced back against the blue jays in 1985 on their way to their only world series title in this year s bestoffive division series , toronto fell behind two games to none , then won three straight against texas before 49 , 325 roaring fans , chris colabello hit a solo home run in the second inning into the leftfield seats to give estrada a lead it was the only mistake by volquez , who won game 1 estrada did not make a miscue until salvador perez homered with two outs in the eighth estrada retired his first nine batters and in the process ended escobar s record streak of leading off playoff games with a hit at four games escobar , who entered 9 for 15 \( 600 \) , got kansas city s first hit when he opened the fourth with a groundball single past a diving tulowitzki at shortstop zobrist promptly grounded into a double play to second baseman ryan goins he was really good today , escobar said he threw the ball down , down and away , down and in he did n't miss many pitches today kansas city had no other runners until cain walked with two outs in the seventh price was up in the bullpen , but estrada got eric hosmer to fly out volquez allowed just two singles after colabello connected , but lost the strike zone in the sixth ben revere led off with a walk , and volquez hit josh donaldson with the first pitch in august , volquez hit donaldson in a testy game that included a benchesclearing scrum he then walked jose bautista in a 10pitch atbat on a knuckle curve that looked as though it caught a piece of the plate i thought the pitch to bautista was definitely a strike , royals manager ned yost said yost shouted from the dugout for perez to appeal to first base on ball four , thinking bautista may have swung but it was too loud in the closedroof stadium for perez to hear we were trying to get their attention to get him to appeal it , yost said i do n't know if he was arguing the pitch i do n't know what he was talking about encarnacion walked on another pitch that upset volquez and yost volquez turned his back to the plate umpire dan iassogna as revere jogged home for a 20 lead it was his last batter herrera relieved and struck out colabello with the crowd chanting tulo ! tulo ! tulowitzki sent a drive to the centerfield wall , sending fans into a towelwaving frenzy bautista and donaldson had consecutive doubles against danny duffy in the seventh to make the score 60 , and kevin pillar doubled in a run in the eighth
gettysburg , pa lincoln hated thomas jefferson that is not exactly what we expect to hear about the president who spoke of malice toward none , referring to the president who wrote that all men are created equal presidents have never been immune from criticism by other presidents but jefferson and lincoln \? these two stare down at us from mount rushmore as heroic , stainless and serene , and any suggestion of disharmony seems somehow a criticism of america itself still , lincoln seems not to have gotten that message mr lincoln hated thomas jefferson as a man , wrote william henry herndon , lincoln s law partner of 14 years and as a politician especially after lincoln read theodore f dwight s sensational , slashall biography of jefferson in 1839 , herndon believed mr lincoln never liked jefferson s moral character after that reading true enough , thomas jefferson had not been easy to love , even in his own time no one denied that jefferson was a brilliant writer , a wide reader and a cultured talker but his contemporaries also found him a man of sublimated and paradoxical imagination and one of the most artful , intriguing , industrious and doublefaced politicians in all america lincoln , who was born less than a month before jefferson left the presidency in 1809 , had his own reasons for loathing jefferson as a man lincoln was well aware of jefferson s repulsive liaison with his slave , sally hemings , while continually puling about liberty , equality and the degrading curse of slavery but he was just as disenchanted with jefferson s economic policies jefferson believed that the only real wealth was land and that the only true occupation of virtuous and independent citizens in a republic was farming those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of god , if ever he had a chosen people , jefferson wrote he despised the selfish spirit of commerce for feeling no passion or principle but that of gain and he regarded banks with special suspicion as the source of all commercial evil banks may be considered as the primary source of paper speculation , and only foster the spirit of gambling in paper , in lands , in canal schemes , town lot schemes , manufacturing schemes and whatever could hit the madness of the day lincoln , who actually grew up on a backwoods farm , saw little there but drunkenness , rowdyism and endless , mindnumbing labor under the rule of his loutish and illiterate father he made his escape from the farm as soon as he turned 21 , opened a store \( which failed \) and finally went into law , that great enforcer of commercial contract i was once a slave , he remarked , but now i am so free that they let me practice law as an illinois state legislator , lincoln promoted a state banking system and public funding for canals and bridges as a lawyer , according to colleagues , lincoln was never unwilling to appear in behalf of a great soulless corporation especially railroads and had no compunction about recommending the eviction of squatters who farmed railroadowned land as president , he put into place a national banking system , protective tariffs for american manufacturing and government guarantees for building a transcontinental railroad lincoln was jefferson s nightmare but jefferson also held out a second example to lincoln , as the man who , for all his limitations and fixations , still managed to articulate certain universal truths about life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincoln understood that jefferson s words if not his practice formed the definitions and axioms of free society when he was urged during the civil war to ignore the constitution s restraints on presidential power , he echoed jefferson s warning against taking possession of a boundless field of power by asking would i not thus give up all footing upon constitution or law \? would i not thus be in the boundless field of absolutism \? and so , lincoln concluded , all honor to jefferson , who had the coolness , forecast , and capacity to fix in the declaration of independence the abstract truth that all men are created equal , so that it would be a rebuke and a stumbling block to anyone who planned to reintroduce tyranny and oppression this was lincoln s other jefferson , the man who wrote better than he knew , the enemy of classification and caste history is neither a political fable in which all the brothers are valiant and all the sisters virtuous , nor is it a tabloid expos , full of crimes and follies , signifying nothing but victimization there is , i admit , a caustic delight in unveiling the frailties of our jeffersons \( and our lincolns \) but the delight turns malevolent when it serves only to strip the american past of anything remarkable or exceptional , or when it demeans or discourages civic engagement and confidence patriotism without criticism has no head criticism without patriotism has no heart lincoln was capable of understanding both the greatness and the limits of thomas jefferson and the founders and still come out at the end embracing the american experiment for giving liberty , not alone to the people of this country , but hope to the world for all future time and so should we

cambridge , england the light was fading on the hills above the arno , and my closest friend in the careworn ranks of foreign correspondents was sitting crosslegged on a canopied chinese daybed , in a lovely old treeshaded house in his native village , a brisk walk from the heart of florence his name was tiziano terzani , one of italy s most celebrated writers , and on that weekend , a decade ago , he was host with his wife , angela , for the marriage of their daughter in a soaring renaissance basilica in florence at 65 , tiziano was in the final weeks of a terminal cancer , and he used a languid lunch the day after the wedding to offer , from his place on the daybed , a personal farewell , along with some gentle wisdom he 'd accrued in 40 years as a roaming reporter for the german newsmagazine der spiegel and leading italian newspapers and as the author of a library of deeply engaging books of adventure and reflection never forget , he told the rapt gathering of musicians , physicians , politicians , entrepreneurs , writers , diplomats and reporters it s not how far you 've traveled , it s what you 've brought back if i have been remembering tiziano with a special fondness in recent days , it is because i , too , have reached the 40year milestone in my career at the new york times , and formally retired last week , six months past my 70th birthday our careers , tiziano s and mine , were improbably similar we spent years shadowing each other in soviet russia and the china of mao zedong and deng xiaoping , and chronicling the wars , assassinations and other disasters of india , pakistan , north korea , afghanistan and a host of countries beyond we were both imprisoned in china , on charges officials there later acknowledged to have been false , and we both shared , at the same time in the 1990s , the same cancer nonhodgkin s lymphoma and the same oncologist in new york now the wheel has turned , and the time has come to begin meeting the challenge tiziano issued on that florentine afternoon , after some familiar chatter among his guests how far each of us had traveled , the wonders and miseries we 'd chronicled , and the most fascinating , or cruel , dictators and rulers through whose realms we 'd passed it was a fine thing , tiziano said , to have accumulated all those visas and passport stamps , all those exotic datelines , all those saddam hussein puppets and little red books of mao s wisdom , all those richly seasoned tales of derringdo but what , please tell , had we brought back \? in my case , poking from the very top of my traveler s backpack is something you might expect of a reporter who spent long years in what were then some of the nastiest places in the world , each of them fraudulently dressed up , in their enveloping propaganda , as something entirely different , and benign what those years bred in me , more than anything else , was an abiding revulsion for ideology , in all its guises from soviet russia to mao s china , from the afghanistan ruled by the taliban to the repression of apartheidera south africa , i learned that there is no limit to the lunacy , malice and suffering that can plague any society with a ruling ideology , and no perfidy that cannot be justified by manipulating the precepts of a mao or a marx , a prophet muhammad or a kim ilsung as tiziano surely knew , distilling some semblance of enlightenment from a lifetime s work is not the easiest of challenges , and not only because it supposes the wit to bring order and sense out of years of jumbled , helterskelter experience of repression by forces of the left and right , of man s propensity for cruelty to man , and of the countervailing strains of humanity that endure wherever the worst kinds of malevolence prevail there is the fear , too , of indulging in what reporters of my generation have been disciplined to avoid abandoning the dictates of objective reporting for the hazardous ground of moral presumption , and with it the dreary vales of selfrighteousness what a reporter carries out grows , inevitably , from the beliefs and standards carried in for me , those were set out by the times editor who first assigned me abroad in 1976 , a m rosenthal , and by his successors over the years abe called for keeping the paper straight he issued the dictum before my first foreign assignment apartheid south africa , a country justly seen as an openandshut case of oppression but even there the need to keep the paper straight demanded , abe said , that we tell not only the story of the oppressed , but that of all the other major players in south africa s tragedy , including the afrikaner people who built the fortress of racial prejudice that the country had become those stories might surprise us , he said , and give us a more textured sense of the truth the commitment to fairness and balance , and to shunning conventional truths when our reporting leads us in unexpected directions , has been our gold standard and one that i , like other reporters , undoubtedly failed on occasions when my passions , and the passions of those around me , ran at their highest those moments , i fear , might have to include for me the hours after american troops overran baghdad in april 2003 at the time , i witnessed and shared the wild public rapture at saddam hussein s fall , which gave way almost overnight to grim forebodings about the murderous sectarian chaos that was to ensue , and which continues , with a redoubled vengeance , in tikrit , mosul , ramadi and dozens of other iraqi cities and towns where the islamic state has held sway my impatience with ideology has carried over in recent years to my encounters with the societies in the west that are my home to the widespread propensity , as i have sensed it , for people who lack the excuse of brutal duress that is a constant in the totalitarian world to fall sway to the formulaic isms of left and right , each of them full of yeats s passionate intensity , that excuse , and indeed smother , free thinking the bankruptcy of the approach that divides the world into camps of left and right was a lesson learned early an assignment to china in the early 1970s exposed me to the murderous doctrines of mao zedong thought , with victims that numbered in the millions and a posting to moscow in the early 1980s , 30 years after stalin s death , was redolent of the miseries that a perverted form of marxismleninism imposed on soviet russia , with its own ghastly toll in the millions my five years in south africa carried their own lessons the more i saw of the ugliness of apartheid , the more evident it became that the apparatus of rightwing repression the twisted ideology , the pervasive role of the secret police , the dehumanization of an entire population was little different from leftwing dictatorships , save in the sheer number of victims if ideology was the scourge of the 20th century , so it has continued to be in many of the worst places of the 21st perhaps the most murderous of all states in our time is the north korea of the kim family , with millions dead from hunger and the deprivations of vast , hidden prison camps and the beheadings , mass shootings and burningsalive committed by the islamic state have their origins in yet another kind of corrupted , extremist thought in all of these places , my experience has been that when it suits the ends of power , ideology can be invoked to prove that 2 2 5 , or 3 , or any other number that suits the state , and to demand that all embrace the madness it is a truly frightening thing to interview a topranked nuclear scientist , or a distinguished brain surgeon , or a concert pianist , as i did in china under the sway of mao , and to hear them , as ideological outcasts , justify with utter conviction the brutalities inflicted on them by their ideologycrazed persecutors crushed fingers , smashed heads , broken marriages , vilification by their own families elsewhere , the lunacy was of an order that invited a response of laughing mockery , if that were not potentially fatal to the system s loyalists , or those pretending to be so in north korea , while kim ilsung was still alive , there was a brand new , hightech hospital built in his name in pyongyang , floor after floor laden with tens of millions of dollars in the latest american , swiss and german equipment , but no patients to be seen and why not \? as we have explained , the most senior comradephysician responded , the korean people s great leader comrade kim ilsung has taken such care for the health of his beloved people that none of his people gets sick not ever \? no , never , was the reply my catalog of such moments in the grim dictatorships of the world could fill a book , or three but coming home to the countries of the west , where nobody dies for a moment s lapse in fealty to a prime minister or a president , it can be depressing beyond words to hear the loyalists of a given political creed whether of the left or the right adopt the unyielding certainties common in totalitarian states our rights to think and speak freely have been won at great cost , and we abuse them at our peril
washington not long after it was formed last year , members of the select committee on benghazi gathered to meet privately with family members of the four americans killed on that dreadful night in libya in 2012 the meetings were emotional , and the chairman assured those present that the committee would be scrupulously nonpartisan and devoted to finding out the truth of what had happened instead , the select committee became little more than a partisan tool to influence the presidential race , a dangerous precedent that will haunt congress for decades this is all the more painful when you consider how grievously the committee has let down those families , along with the rest of the american people on rare occasions , congress has determined that an issue is of such surpassing significance that a focused , resourceintensive inquiry is called for , and it creates a special investigatory committee among the very first was one formed after the election of george washington in order to the disastrous defeat of the st clair expedition in the 1791 battle of wabash since then , congress has convened select committees to investigate everything from to , from to  with some exceptions , these committees have attempted to conduct their work in a bipartisan way , issuing consensus reports signed by both democrats and republicans they have had welldefined scopes , moved quickly and dissolved when they were done congressional inquiries into hurricane katrina , pearl harbor and irancontra were all completed in less than a year even the bipartisan 9 11 commission established by congress produced its report in 19 months when the house speaker , john a boehner , announced the creation of the select committee in may 2014 , he it would ensure the american people have the truth about the terrorist attack he took this step , despite the fact that eight standing congressional committees had already investigated the attacks , as had the independent  i know , because i assisted with one investigation , conducted by the house intelligence committee , which the many conspiracy theories alleging malicious actions or a vast coverup the committee s republican chairman at the time was even by members of his own party for the investigation s objectivity when i was asked to join the select committee , i was deeply skeptical about its true mission , and questioned whether i or any other democrat should participate after , what could a ninth contribute \? but i was determined to do my part since its formation , the select committee on benghazi has been aimless and slow moving , not knowing what it was looking for or where it has acted in a deeply partisan way , frequently failing to consult or even to inform democratic members before taking action , and selectively leaking information to the press after 16 months and more than 4 million , the committee has gained no additional insight into the attacks in benghazi it has nothing new to tell the families of those killed or the american people but it does have emails some of them are from former secretary of state hillary clinton but none of her emails tell us anything of consequence regarding the events of sept 11 , 2012 they do n't substantiate the bogus theory that the state department ordered the military to or that there was , or that the secretary somehow provided at the diplomatic facility or annex nor were any of the secretary s emails marked classified at the time she received them some in the intelligence community believe that a subset of them should have been , a conclusion with which the state department disagrees that s not an uncommon clash of views as the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee , i am deeply interested in making sure that all classified information is protected and yet , as a member of the select committee charged with finding out the truth about the attacks , i am appalled at how much we have lost sight of the mission if indeed that was ever the point whatever their original purpose , the select committee s leaders appear no longer to have any interest in benghazi , except as the tragic events of that day may be used as a cudgel against the likely democratic nominee for president the committee is solely concerned with damaging her candidacy , searching for something , anything , that can be insinuated against her with all of the committee s obsessive focus on mrs clinton , you would think that she was a witness to the killings , instead of half a world away some of my colleagues think this is just good politics and already , other ambitious committee leaders are hoping to get in on the act with their own inquiries and attacks on mrs clinton this is a terrible mistake , and it would be no less offensive if it were a democratic majority going after a republican candidate do we really want to see future select committees ginned up to attack other likely presidential nominees \? a committee that cannot tell the american people what it is looking for after 16 months should be shut down otherwise , benghazi will come to be remembered not for the tragedy that claimed four american lives , but for the terrible abuse of process that now bears its name
washington a bipartisan effort to fight human trafficking hit an unexpected obstacle on tuesday as senate democrats objected to an provision republicans had attached to the bill the legislation introduced by senator john cornyn , republican of texas , and backed by senator amy klobuchar of minnesota and a number of other democrats , would increase the penalties for those convicted of human trafficking , and protections and services for its victims but democrats railed against a republican provision that sought to prevent the fines from being used to help victims pay for abortions republicans said the provision was in accordance with a law , known as the hyde amendment , that bans federal funding from being used for abortions democrats said it amounted to an expansion of that law the republicans are trying to pull a fast one here on the human trafficking bill , but it is absolutely wrong , and , honestly , it is shameful , said senator patty murray , democrat of washington the democrats' sense of betrayal was a stark change from about 24 hours earlier , when senator harry reid of nevada , the minority leader , expressed his support for the bipartisan effort , which had been promoted as a rare show of harmony i doubt there will be problems on my side , mr reid said on the senate floor monday but the democrats' objections raised uncomfortable questions about whether their members on the senate judiciary committee had read the bill before joining the unanimous vote last month to move it to the full senate for consideration mr cornyn said the idea that democrats had not known about the bill s restriction on abortion funding was simply untrue that presupposes that none of their staff briefed the senators on what was in the legislation , that nobody read a 68page bill and that senators would vote for a bill , much less cosponsor it , without reading it and knowing what s in it , he said none of that strikes me as plausible the bill had been introduced last year before it was reintroduced in the new congress senator charles e schumer of new york , the no 3 democrat and a member of the judiciary committee , said that a list of changes made to the bill had been circulated to members , and that the abortion provision was not on it a copy of an email exchange between democratic and republican staff members obtained by the new york times briefly summarized the changes made to last year s bill before it was introduced in january it did not mention the abortion provision an aide from mr cornyn s office said the provision was in last year s bill and remained there when it was reintroduced senator patrick j leahy of vermont , the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee , told reporters that he was sure the abortion measure considered a deal breaker by some democrats had not been in the legislation senator cornyn s language restricting needed , legal health care for women was not included in the trafficking package the judiciary committee reported last year , mr leahy said in a statement i regret that senator cornyn put it in his new legislation this year mr reid said , you can blame it on staff , blame it on whoever you want to blame it on , but we did n't know it was in the bill as debate over the legislation continued on the senate floor , republicans applauded what they still publicly called a bipartisan effort , and democrats discussed how to move forward on what they deemed an important bill senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , said on the senate floor tuesday that he expected a vote on the bill on wednesday suffice it to say that there are legitimate contentions about misrepresentations made during consideration of this bill , said senator richard blumenthal , democrat of connecticut and a member of the judiciary committee and the backandforth wo n't help resolve the issues , which is my goal , because the underlying bill is a good one
rancho mirage , calif a week that began with many people in golf dissecting tiger woods s preparedness for the masters and debating the future of the men s game ended with the world s best women showcasing a product that has never been more hale or less predictable the american stacy lewis , a once and almost certain future world no 1 , has a cumulative score of 79 under par in her first seven starts , but she left the ana inspiration , the first major of the year , still looking for her first victory of 2015 lewis , playing in the final group , closed with a twounderpar 70 to finish tied at nineunder 279 with brittany lincicome , who carded a 69 while playing in the secondtolast pairing lincicome , the 2009 winner , eagled the par5 18th to grab a share of the lead , then won on the third extra hole morgan pressel , the 2007 champion , came within inches of holing her approach for an eagle at the 18th that would have propelled her into the playoff she closed with a 70 to finish third at eight under sei young kim , the latest in a line of south korean prodigies , was the 54hole leader but she struggled down the stretch on a 39stroke back nine , she did not have a par until no 18 she closed with a 75 that left her tied for fourth with anna nordqvist and carlota ciganda at seven under lydia ko , the women s world no 1 , never contended after equaling annika sorenstam s record of 29 consecutive subpar rounds with an opening 71 , she posted three overpar scores , including a closing 73 with her 72hole total of three over , ko snapped two other impressive streaks her tie for 51st marked the first time she has finished outside the top 10 in her past 11 starts it was also the first time in the last 18 tournaments , dating to last year s women s british open , that ko failed to break par for 72 holes obviously a little disappointing , said ko , who does not have a top20 finish in three starts here ko , a south koreanborn new zealander , added all majors , you need your a game , and to win every week , you need your a game but especially here , you need to be straight and make a lot of good putts alluding to her selfimposed retirement age , ko said , hopefully that will come before i'm 30 it was not long ago that south korea s supremacy showed signs of tailing off last june , inbee park , the former world no 1 , won her first tour event of the year to end a title drought for south koreans of 17 tournaments , which had dated to the end of the 2013 season park , a fivetime major champion , was not worried about the perceived dropoff in the performance of the south koreans she told anybody who would listen that the pipeline was bursting with talent , and sure enough , by the end of 2014 , kyujung baek and hyo joo kim , both 19 , had broken into the winner s circle inbee and some of the girls were kind of telling us that there were some young koreans coming that were pretty good , lewis said we did n't really know what to expect , but they 've been there you can tell they 've got a lot of experience from playing in korea , and they know how to win lewis singled out hyo joo kim , who won the evian championship , the women s fifth major , last september before becoming an lpga member she won again last month at the founders cup with four sub70 rounds i threw everything i had at her in phoenix , said lewis , and she kept responding by making putts and hitting shots michael whan , the lpga commissioner , believes the tour is on the right track to me , we 've proven that we do n't have to have one superstar or an american as the dominant player , he said none of those things matter what goes on inside the ropes is compelling and interesting no matter who the winner turns out to be
london shimmying on stage in a slinky banana skirt , the black american performer josephine baker enthralled many in the paris of the 1920s and '30s none was more riveted than her fellow expatriate alexander calder he crafted wire sculptures of the chanteuse , with sinuous limbs and spiraling , circular breasts one such work is aztec josephine baker from 1930 , a suspended figure that sways gently when approached it is among the highlights of alexander calder performing sculpture that opened on wednesday and runs through april 3 at tate modern in london the largest calder show ever staged in britain , it consists of about 100 works spread across 11 galleries roughly half have been borrowed from the calder foundation in new york , which is run by the artist s grandson , alexander sc rower tate sees the exhibition as a chance to reconnect people with an artist who , at his death in 1976 at age 78 , had come to be critically underappreciated calder s mobiles and stabiles proliferated in public spaces and office blocks , and his colorful designs even appeared on jet planes \( braniff airways \) and race cars \( the first bmw art car \) in the 1970s as a result , said achim borchardthume , tate s director of exhibitions who was a cocurator of the show , calder s work did n't carry a lot of cachet anymore , and did n't feel like it was communicating anything meaningful tate modern s ambition is to demonstrate that nearly four decades after his death calder is an artist in sync with the times the museum has been hosting performance art on its premises since 2012 in a program sponsored by bmw , and as it prepares to expand next year and devote new spaces to live and performance art , it is presenting calder as the natural companion to those cuttingedge disciplines we work more and more with live art , mr borchardthume said , a type of spectatorship where it s important that viewers are seeing something together in real time you can only see it that one time , while you 're there , and it s a shared experience calder s art replicates that experience , mr borchardthume said he is the artist who totally embraces the notion that you make the work and it will change its appearance once you 've seen the mobiles , he added , you will never see them quite the same way again calder produced a staggering 22 , 000 documented pieces wire sculptures , mobiles and stabiles , monumental outdoor sculptures , paintings , works on paper , toys , jewelry , and domestic objects in documentary films made of him in the 1950s and '60s , he came across as chirpy and jolly mr rower , who started the calder foundation with the calder family in 1987 and who has played a key role in the tate show , remembers a different reality my grandfather was a grumpy and surly and very dedicated and very focused person , mr rower said he enjoyed his life and he enjoyed himself , but he was n't a funloving , goofy kind of person at all calder was born into art his father , a sculptor , and his mother , a painter , gave him tools as a boy , with which he made toy animals and jewelry for his sister s dolls he went on to study mechanical engineering as a young man , but switched to art , publishing a drawing manual \( animal sketching \) and producing circus illustrations for a magazine in 1926 , at 28 , he moved to paris , where he was based for seven years this was an exhilarating time for the artist , as the tate show demonstrates besides crafting miniature animals and circus acrobats which he animated in his famous performance work cirque calder \( 192631 \) he produced the wire portraits of baker and of artists in his circle , such as joan mir and fernand l ger on a 1930 visit to piet mondrian s paris studio , calder was so fascinated by the unframed colored rectangles pinned on the wall that he made a leap into abstraction the tate exhibition illustrates that dramatic jump , as wire figures suddenly make way for abstract sculptures featuring lines , circles and spheres calder then set out on a quest to introduce motion in art he produced a series of motorized sculptures which marcel duchamp promptly dubbed mobiles several are in the exhibition \( though their mechanisms are too fragile to be turned on small video monitors show them in action \) elsewhere , he suspended moveable elements in front of colored panels to create kinetic paintings the show presents a roomful of that work before long , he transitioned to creating motorless moving sculptures the mobiles that he is best known for tate has a huge room of them , dangling delicately from the ceiling in a nearby gallery , it also has the towering black widow \( 1948 \) , a 35meter megamobile that calder made for the institute of architects of brazil and which has left s o paulo for the first time the show ends in the early 1950s , when calder started making motionless sculptures , a strand of his art that the tate has deliberately ignored because of the exhibition s emphasis on movement and performance \( a notable absence is cirque calder it cannot travel and is on permanent view at the whitney museum of american art in new york \) according to his grandson , calder worked seven days a week throughout his career after morning coffee and a softboiled egg , he headed straight for his studio , whether in roxbury , connecticut or in sach in france s loire valley it was a very silent place , like a sanctuary , with no music and not a single assistant , mr rower said the whitney curator barbara haskell said calder did do monumental pieces that are ubiquitous all over america in malls and buildings , but the reputation has definitely survived all of that there s something totally joyous and unpretentious about the work which communicates to people , she added he s one of the few artists who can sit in both camps the public and the elite world ms haskell credited the calder foundation for helping keep the calder flame alive everyone that does anything with calder has to go through the foundation , she said the foundation is supported predominantly through funds from the family , said mr rower , who is the biggest donor it has 1 , 300 works in its collection , 1 , 100 of which were donated by calder s daughter \( mr rower s mother \) at her death three years ago the foundation does sell works on occasion it sold one this year , mr rower said , for a couple of million dollars to a collector whose entire calder collection is about to go to a museum \( mr rower declined to identify the buyer \) but it does not require art sales to keep it afloat , he said in addition to making its holdings available to scholars and for exhibitions , the foundation also cosponsors an artist residency program at calder s former house and studio in sach some of those residents were marina abramovic , jaume plensa and abraham cruzvillegas who has a horticultural installation at tate modern as this year s commissioned artist for the turbine hall mr cruzvillegas said he was a little boy in mexico city when he discovered calder s giant red stabile the red sun outside aztec stadium he said he learned playfulness from the artist , and transformation it s never the same sculpture as for calder s loss of popularity in the 1970s , mr cruzvillegas said , it happens to all artists he added it s kind of a cycle sometimes you are up , and sometimes you are down consequently , he said , there is no need to rescue calder he s a very big artist
cleveland in s locker room after saturday night s , the whiteboard still bore the coaches' talking points in black sharpie on offense great movement great shots on defense , the only instruction underlined in blue was level 5 team rebounding how many levels of rebounding are there \? five is the highest one , the sophomore forward austin torres said the whiteboard s advice might seem obsolete after saturday s downtothewire finish , when the irish lost , 6866 , leaving kentucky 380 heading to the final four yet wisconsin , which will play kentucky in the national semifinals for the second straight year , could do worse than to pick the brains of the notre dame staff and to watch the irish s performance over the next week , one debate will dominate college basketball did notre dame demonstrate to the world how to beat kentucky \? or did the irish demonstrate that barring something unforeseeable , kentucky is all but unbeatable \? we 're undefeated , but we 're not perfect , kentucky coach said after the game , reprising a note he had sounded many times it is possible that a great team executing the optimal game plan against kentucky will translate to what notre dame got a 2point loss few have been as good this past month as the irish , who barreled through the atlantic coast conference tournament and displayed grit in their first three games of the tournament it is also possible that kentucky had an off night tyler ulis , a freshman guard , called the wildcats flat we played arguably our worst game defensively , said willie cauleystein , the only upperclassman who plays substantial minutes for kentucky he added i got dudes texting me from way back home , saying , dude , you should not have won that game' glad you won it , but you should not have won that game' i'm just like , yo , you 're right' the way they played and the way we played defensively , we should n't have won the game the notion that the wildcats won the game while at their worst should be nauseating for any team that still has to face them yet there is also the tantalizing possibility that wisconsin could come through where notre dame did not take rebounding kentucky , , grabbed 29 rebounds in the game it entered the game averaging 387 kentucky had 10 offensive rebounds it entered the game averaging 128 before the game , it had limited its opponents to 193 rebounds per game notre dame had 28 maybe that was poor rebounding by kentucky , or maybe it was level 5 rebounding by notre dame or consider the concept great movement great shots at times , notre dame looked like the san antonio spurs , driving and kicking , spacing the floor , making the extra pass to get the better look guards jerian grant and demetrius jackson drove , creating space for a dumpoff to pat connaughton or an insideout pass to the marksman steve vasturia the guards ran pickandrolls with zach auguste , who finished with a teamhigh 20 points maybe kentucky s pickandroll defense was unusually poor or maybe kentucky can be beaten by a good pickandroll defensively , notre dame set out to deny kentucky 3pointers the wildcats went 4 for 8 from beyond the arc on average , they try 15 3point shots per game we were going to live with the 2s , the notre dame assistant martin ingelsby said after the game wisconsin might make the same choice so , on \( to \) wisconsin according to the analytics site , notre dame scores the secondmost points per 100 possessions , adjusted for opponent , in division i wisconsin scores the most , by a wide margin the badgers have scored the most since at least 2002 in an interview sunday , seth greenberg , the espn analyst and former virginia tech coach , said wisconsin shared notre dame s ability to put four men on the floor who could shoot 3pointers lacked guards , as notre dame had , who could penetrate off the dribble and had topnotch , versatile big men , which notre dame did not you have the ability to invert your offense and pull the bigs away from the basket , greenberg said you have the ability to attack matchups in your frontcourt because of the versatility of nigel hayes and sam dekker he added , referring to wisconsin s center , you have a unique matchup with frank kaminsky because you can move him so many places greenberg said that wisconsin must limit fouls , something at which the badgers typically excel but after averaging just more than 12 personal fouls per game during the regular season easily the best in division i wisconsin has averaged 1575 in its four tournament games , including 21 on saturday against arizona beyond the matchup minutiae , two things will be drastically different next saturday compared with this one first , both teams will have enjoyed a week of rest and preparation , as opposed to the fewer than two days notre dame had before facing kentucky this might benefit wisconsin more than kentucky wisconsin lacks kentucky s depth having lost for more than two months , the badgers have five players who average more than 28 minutes kentucky has none still , kentucky s players said fatigue was an issue , and cauleystein was adamant that more time would have helped against notre dame one day to prepare for a team like notre dame that s why we could n't stop them , he said second , several kentucky players suggested that saturday s brush with mortality would serve as a psychological boon cauleystein said that with 6 minutes 14 seconds left , after a grant steal led to a vasturia 3pointer , he felt defeat was imminent then cauleystein realized there was enough time for kentucky to make up the difference to have that feeling , and you remember that feeling that s the closest we 've been to losing in that high stakes a game , he said cauleystein , who was on the bench with an injury when kentucky lost to connecticut , added , to lose at this time is heartbreaking
in an election that turned on economic uncertainty and fierce debates over immigration , danish voters on thursday ousted their centerleft government in a clear swing to the right that unexpectedly elevated an antiimmigrant , antieuropean union party that had been on the margins of the country s politics polls had predicted a close race , but as the night wore on , the farright danish people s party emerged in second place over all , raising questions about the role it could play in a new government and the country s path in the coming four years the outcome took even senior members of the danish people s party by surprise it s gone beyond my wildest expectations , peter skaarup , a senior lawmaker with the party told , a danish news outlet i know we often fare better in these elections than the polls suggest since people often are n't willing to admit that they vote for the danish people s party , but it really does look fantastic so far based on preliminary results published by , the centerright bloc that includes the danish people s party secured a majority of 90 seats in parliament that would allow it to form the next government , with the leader of the conservative liberal party , lars lokke rasmussen , expected to become prime minister although the danish people s party won more votes than the liberals , none of s many smaller parties was willing to form a government with it , according to kasper m hansen , a professor of political science at the university of copenhagen the election , called by prime minister helle thorningschmidt just three weeks ago , came at a time when danes increasingly feared that their cherished system of generous welfare benefits was being abused by migrants from southern europe and a recent surge of more than 14 , 000 asylum seekers , mostly muslims the country remains shaken by a in copenhagen by the 22yearold son of immigrants at a freespeech event and outside a synagogue that left two people dead and five police officers wounded with all votes from the mainland counted , showed ms thorningschmidt s social democrats emerging as the strongest party , with 263 percent of the vote , yet without enough seats to form a government that task appeared to go to mr rasmussen , 51 , despite a weak showing for his liberals the danish people s party s won 211 percent of the vote , according to drdk that compares with only 123 percent four years ago polls had consistently shown the two main political alliances neck and neck denmark has a singlechamber parliament with 179 members , of which 175 are elected in denmark itself , and two each by the country s two former colonies , the faroe islands and greenland ms thorningschmidt , who became the country s first female leader in 2011 , tumbled in popularity after unpopular economic changes passed by her government , while the economy dipped in and out of recession yet signs of an economic revival in recent weeks helped bolster her alliance in polls , although her main challenger , mr rasmussen , claimed the improvement was linked to changes introduced by his government when he led the country from 2009 to 2011 we won the campaign , but not the election , ms thorningschmidt , 48 , told her party , announcing she was quitting as leader of the social democrats after the announcement of the outcome early friday both of the leading parties had pledged a tougher stance on immigration , with the prime minister campaigning on a vow to require refugees to work an unusual position for her party denmark has consistently ranked among the world s happiest nations , but the flow of immigrants ignited a backlash that has heightened nationalist sentiments , something that also unfolded with political upheaval in neighboring finland where the populist finns party joined the government and to some extent in other european countries immigration has been a very key and decisive issue in this campaign , mr hansen said debate focused largely on the number of workers coming from places like bulgaria and romania , what sort of benefits they should receive , and whether denmark should take in more of the migrants arriving at europe s southern borders , he added
paris europe s top air safety regulator called on friday for a series of measures aimed at strengthening the medical and psychological oversight of the region s commercial airline pilots , including random drug and alcohol testing of flight crews the report with the recommendations , which has been presented to the european transportation commissioner , violeta bulc , for review , follows more than two months of discussions led by the regulator , the , after the the flight s copilot had a history of and had shown  if accepted by the european commission officials , the changes could take effect within the next year but the initial proposal has already been watered down , notably because of privacy concerns from germany , and officials said they were prepared for delicate negotiations over the coming months with european pilots' unions , which have until now resisted such monitoring as overly intrusive and only minimally effective in improving safety if improvements are to be made in the european safety and security rules or in their implementation , in order to help prevent future accidents or incidents , we will take the necessary action at eu level , ms bulc said in  aside from its new medical oversight proposals , the task force that issued the report said it would maintain its recommendation that two crew members be present in the cockpit at all times the twoperson rule , which was standard in the united states and other parts of the world after the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , was not widely adopted in europe before the germanwings crash the federal aviation administration in the united states is also conducting a review of existing standards and procedures for pilot medical oversight and cockpit door security its findings are expected to be published by the end of this year patrick ky , the european aviation safety agency s executive director and chairman of the task force , said in a telephone interview from brussels that most of the recommendations were common sense we will never find a magic set of tools or solutions that can prevent every kind of accident , he said , but let s try to do our best to maximize our chances of preventing this kind of thing from happening again french investigators say that the 27yearold copilot of the germanwings flight , , deliberately crashed the airbus a320 after locking the captain out of the cockpit on a flight to d sseldorf , germany , from barcelona , spain mr lubitz and the 149 other people on board were killed investigators have not uncovered any evidence that mr lubitz used illegal drugs or alcohol , but members of the task force identified drug and alcohol abuse as one of the disorders potentially affecting the mental health of pilots for which screening tests are readily available , the agency said in a statement although mr lubitz was a highprofile example of pilot suicide , his was not an isolated case over the past two decades , at least a halfdozen fatal airline crashes have been other episodes and close calls have been quietly played down by investigators until now , none have led to significant changes in the regulation of the psychological health of pilots a number of countries , including the united states and australia , require airline pilots to submit to random tests for the use of alcohol and certain controlled substances flight attendants , aircraft mechanics , air traffic controllers and others in safety sensitive roles are also subject to drug testing some european countries , notably in scandinavia , routinely test pilots , but there is no standard that applies to the roughly 65 , 000 commercial pilots based in the 28member european union mr ky said the european requirements would be modeled on the , which randomly selects 25 percent of aviation industry personnel for drug testing and 10 percent for alcohol testing every year initially , such testing would apply only to pilots , although it could eventually be extended to other employees who are critical to maintaining safety , he said many pilots' unions and large airline groups , including lufthansa , already have programs in place where pilots with drug , alcohol or other mental health problems can confide in specially trained colleagues , who can steer them toward professional help without them risking their jobs pilots can also confidentially report others who they suspect may have a problem , in order to encourage them to seek treatment the task force s report urges airlines to augment drug testing with such nonpunitive support and peerreporting programs for pilots with substance abuse or mental health problems mr ky said regulators would regularly review such programs as part of their mandatory periodic inspections of airline operations the report also calls for the creation of a central european union database , which would be maintained by the european aviation safety agency , containing basic information about pilots' medical certification status and contact details for the flight doctor who conducted their most recent exam airline pilots are generally free to choose their own flight doctors , in the same way that most people choose their personal physicians the lack of a central repository for pilots' records creates a loophole , medical experts say , and could allow a pilot to hide a previous diagnosis of a physical or mental health condition but bowing to the concerns from some member states with strict laws governing medical privacy , the task force stopped short of requiring that the full details of a pilot s medical records be included in the database in the case of mr lubitz , who had an episode of depression in 2009 , there was a note in his german medical file that required flight doctors to check for any signs of a recurrence during his regular annual exam under the task force s proposal , such information would not appear in the new database the task force s report also calls for mandatory and comprehensive psychological screening by a qualified specialist of all prospective pilots either during their initial training or before they are hired while such comprehensive tests are standard at many european flight schools and airlines including lufthansa , where mr lubitz was trained and eventually hired this is not a legal requirement across the european union the result of that exam would form part of a pilot s permanent medical record , mr ky said
if the programme which our people saw set on foot at appomattox courthouse had been carried out we would have no disturbance in the south , testified the former confederate general \( and future senator \) john brown gordon in 1871 speaking before a congressional committee investigating the widespread antiblack violence in the former confederacy , gordon was accusing radical republicans of bad faith specifically , of breaking the appomattox compact some northerners might have been surprised by the idea that anything resembling a compact came out of robert e lee s surrender to ulysses s grant in april 1865 but gordon , along with other prominent veterans of lee s army , believed that the agreement at appomattox was more twosided than many in the north believed the notion of the compact was rooted in two points that the union military victory was illegitimate , a triumph of might over right , and that lee had negotiated a deal with grant at appomattox containing the promise that honorable southern men would not be treated dishonorably this position might have seemed incongruous , were it not for the fact that gordon and a cadre of influential former confederate officers including the former generals henry a wise , armistead l long , william n pendleton and edward porter alexander , along with other senior officers like charles marshall and walter taylor spent decades advocating it , long after the north grew tired of arguing about the war and to a large extent , they won , not only undermining reconstruction , but distorting its memory gordon s first point , the might over right argument , was enshrined in lee s april 10 , 1865 , farewell address to his troops the address , drafted by marshall , his aidedecamp , attributed confederate defeat to the yankees overwhelming numbers and resources in the context of proslavery ideology , this was a kind of code , conjuring up images of the heartless efficiency of northern society responding to lee s repeated plea that the bravery and devotion of the army of northern virginia shall be correctly transmitted to posterity , lee s officers churned out speeches , articles and memoirs designed to banish the specter of confederate failure and to disseminate the idea that lee had faced insurmountable odds of fivetoone or worse in the final campaign lee s eight thousand starving men at appomattox , taylor explained , had surrendered to an unworthy foe that had long despaired to conquer it by skill or daring , and who had worn it away by weight of numbers and brutal exchange of many lives for one this doctrine referred not only to the size but also the social composition of the union army appomattox veterans lamented that they had been compelled to surrender to a mercenary army german , irish , negro , and yankee wretches , as pendleton put it bitterly of their social and racial inferiors scholars have since established that lee faced odds of twotoone at appomattox , no worse than odds he had beaten before but in its day , the numbers game had a distinct political purpose by denying the legitimacy of the north s military victory , former confederates hoped to deny the north the right to impose its political will on the south and it worked as reconstruction unfolded , northern commentators again and again observed that white southern recalcitrance was nourished by the sentiments of the farewell address an exasperated northerner traveling through the south in 1866 characterized his encounters with confederates this way we were overpowered by numbers , they say they ve said that to me more than fifty times within the last few weeks and they say that they are the gentlemen we are amalgamationists , mudsills , vandals , and so forth the message was clear the north had not won a moral victory or mandate at appomattox the second front in this war of words concerned the surrender terms themselves grant s leniency , so lee s officers insisted , was a form of homage to southern bravery in confederate eyes , lee was not a passive recipient of that leniency at appomattox , but instead made a series of propositions , such as the suggestion that confederates might retain their horses , to which grant assented more important still , lee extracted from grant , during their brief april 10 meeting on horseback , the promise that each confederate soldier would receive a printed parole pass , to prove that he came under the april terms in keeping with the language of the surrender terms , a parole certificate vouched that if a soldier observed the laws in force where he resided , he was to remain undisturbed confederates argued that these paroles conferred immunity against yankee reprisals generally , such as confiscation and treason trials edward porter alexander reckoned that the appomattox terms practically gave an amnesty to every surrendered soldier for all political offences when henry a wise , on his way home to norfolk from appomattox , was confronted by a yankee cavalryman who wanted to confiscate his horse , wise brandished his parole certificate , declaring that he had gen grant s safeguard and was under its protection ! a little more than a year later , in may 1866 , wise gave a pair of defiant speeches in virginia in which he insisted that securing favorable terms was a kind of victory i have the profound satisfaction , he declaimed , of saying that i fought until we won the privilege of being paroled but confederates went further still , emphasizing that the peace was conditional dependent on the north s good behavior in a late april 1865 interview with the new york herald , lee himself issued a warning if arbitrary or vindictive or revengeful policies were enacted by the yankee government , southerners would renew the fight , and give their lives as dearly as possible in the same spirit , pendleton asserted that the promise that southerners would remain unmolested by federal authorities was no mere military arrangement but instead a solemn compact , rigidly binding on both sides the confederates would not have laid down their arms without this pledge of honor for their protection as reconstruction got underway , former confederates again and again invoked their interpretation of the appomattox terms , and particularly the remain undisturbed clause , as a shield against social change republican efforts to give freedpeople a measure of equality and opportunity and protection were met by white southern protests that such a radical agenda was a betrayal of the appomattox agreement that the prospect of black citizenship , as one virginia newspaper put it , molests and disturbs us none of lee s lieutenants did more to register such protests than john brown gordon , a leader of georgia s ku klux klan and future senator and governor in his 1871 congressional testimony , he gave a stalwart defense of his region against charges of brutality and lawlessness , repeatedly invoking the appomattox terms back in april 1865 , gordon argued , confederates had been gratified by the deferential treatment they received at the surrender we should not be disturbed , so long as we obeyed the laws this was the pledge , gordon said , that grant had made to the confederates peace would have come swiftly and surely , gordon continued , if radicals had not betrayed the spirit of appomattox by telling confederates your former slaves are better fitted to administer the laws than you are trafficking in the toxic myth that congressional reconstruction was a time of white southern prostration and vindictive black rule , gordon claimed , our people feel that the faith which was pledged to them has been violated southerners were disturbed by the congressional program , deprived of rights which we had inherited which belonged to us as citizens of the country if they had known what indignities and disabilities awaited them , gordon surmised , confederates would not have surrendered on april 9 , 1865 gordon s message was clear the only way to restore peace was to leave the white south alone to manage its own affairs this confederate campaign did not go unchallenged northern republicans and southern unionists , white and black , offered their own interpretation of appomattox , in which the union victory was the product of skill and bravery , grant s magnanimity was the emblem of northern moral superiority and the paroles protected the lives of the surrendered rebels but also commanded their political atonement and obedience grant spoke for all these groups when he told a northern reporter in may 1866 that he was deeply disappointed in lee s demeanor since the surrender lee was setting an example of forced acquiescence so grudging and pernicious in its effects as to be hardly realized grant hoped more white southerners would make the choice that gen james longstreet who became a convert to the republican party after the war had made in longstreet s eyes , the north s victory at arms was a victory for its principles , and southerners must yield , in keeping , longstreet wrote , with the obligations under which we were placed by the terms of our paroles but longstreet was an anomaly gordon s views proved ascendant in the late 19th century , leaving those who favored social change and social justice to sing their own laments over the lost promise of appomattox in 1912 , with the lost cause cult at a peak of popularity , an article in the pittsburgh courier , a black newspaper , observed somberly , southern thought is conquering the entire country on the race question the article quoted a poem called appomattox , by the black poet charles r dinkins , in which lee addresses his defeated army with the following charge when fails the sword , the better way becomes the soldier s part to play the south will whip the north some day with ink and pen lee s prophecy , the article noted , had come to pass the unrepentant south had struck down the

most governors who seek the presidency promote executive experience as their chief credential , regaling voters with tales of big decisions they have made and budgets they have balanced gov chris christie of new jersey also mentions those things , but lately he has been digging deeper into his r sum with terrorism taking center stage in the 2016 race , mr christie seems to take the most pride in his days as a federal prosecutor five times during tuesday s republican presidential debate , and often unprompted , mr christie managed to work in the fact that he was once a united states attorney in new jersey the experience , he argues , makes him best suited to destroy the islamic state i will tell you this , i m a former federal prosecutor , i ve fought terrorists , mr christie said in opening remarks moments later , when asked how he would alleviate the fear of terrorist attacks that has become pervasive in america , mr christie said that because of his work as a prosecutor he knew that terrorists were planning attacks elsewhere people have good reason to be worried , he suggested i could tell you this , as a former federal prosecutor , if a center for the developmentally disabled in san bernardino , calif , is now a target for terrorists , that means everywhere in america is a target for these terrorists , mr christie said as rivals debated the details of immigration policy , mr christie jumped in to make the case that senator marco rubio and senator ted cruz were just talkers who knew nothing about really fighting terror as a prosecutor , he reminded viewers again , he has actually gone up against terrorists this is the difference between having been a federal prosecutor instead of being one of 100 people debating it , mr christie said , explaining that he had used the patriot act to stymie attacks in new jersey mr christie was appointed as federal prosecutor in 2001 and served in that role until 2008 , before becoming new jersey s governor his popularity in the state has faded in recent years amid economic turmoil , the george washington bridge scandal and frequent travel around the country to raise money and campaign for higher office looking to jumpstart his flagging presidential campaign , mr christie has latched onto his experience from the aftermath of attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , to remake himself as a national security candidate as tuesday s debate was winding down , the conversation turned to taking in syrian refugees mr christie has taken a hard line on the issue , saying that none should be accepted and pointing to concerns raised by james comey , the fbi director now , listen , i m a former federal prosecutor , i know jim comey , mr christie said , mentioning that the two go way back and had even worked together in law enforcement he was the us attorney in manhattan when i was a us attorney in new jersey
roanoke , va he was a fired television reporter with a history of conflicts at work and rage apparently stoked by racial grievances and when he sought revenge on wednesday , gunning down two former colleagues , he used to ensure that his crime was broadcast live , recorded from multiple angles and posted online vester lee flanagan ii , 41 , identified by the authorities as the gunman , waited until alison parker and adam ward , young journalists at wdbj in roanoke , were on air , then killed them while recording on his own video camera mr flanagan shot himself in the head hours later , the authorities said , but as the chase for him was on , he wrote about the shooting on twitter , uploaded his video to facebook and sent a manifesto to abc news that spoke admiringly of mass killers and said that as a black , gay man he had faced discrimination and sexual harassment the shooting and the horrifying images it produced marked a new chapter in the intersection of video , violence and social media the day began with the most mundane of ms parker and mr ward were working on a story for wdbj about the 50th anniversary of smith mountain lake , a reservoir tucked among farms and rolling mountains that is popular with anglers , kayakers and sunbathers they stood on a balcony of bridgewater plaza , a shopping and office complex on the lakeshore , talking with vicki gardner , executive director of the smith mountain lake regional chamber of commerce around 6 45 am , the shooting began shows ms parker screaming and stumbling backward as the shots ring out and a set of jumbled images as the camera falls to the floor eight shots can be heard before the broadcast cut back to the stunned anchor at the station , kimberly mcbroom shortly afterward , mr flanagan wrote on twitter , i filmed the shooting see facebook , and a shocking 56second video recording , which appeared to be taken by a body camera worn by the gunman , was posted to his facebook page it showed him waiting until the journalists were on air before raising a handgun and firing at pointblank range , ensuring that it would be seen , live or recorded , by thousands both social media accounts used the name he was known by on television , bryce williams , and both were shut down within hours of the shooting ms parker , 24 , a reporter , and mr ward , 27 , a cameraman , both white , were pronounced dead at the scene ms gardner was wounded and underwent emergency surgery , but was expected to survive mr flanagan shot and killed himself hours later after being cornered by the police on a highway about 200 miles away if the killings shocked the nation , they had particular resonance in this rural area where local reporters are recognized personalities ms parker and mr ward were known as hardworking , cheerful people who had grown up here and were romantically involved with other members of their station s staff at a midday news conference , bill overton jr , the franklin county sheriff , said ms parker and mr ward had interviewed him about three weeks ago , and he was watching live on wednesday when they were killed it has really stopped me in my tracks , he said like many viewers , i was watching this morning s broadcast and could n't understand , really , what was happening myself at that time almost two hours after the shootings , a 23page missive headquarters in new york , apparently from mr flanagan , pointed to the , in which a white supremacist is accused of killing nine black people in a bible study group abc reported that a man claiming to be bryce williams had contacted the network several times in recent weeks , saying he had a story for them he never said what it was why did i do it \? mr flanagan said in the rambling fax message , which the new york times obtained from a law enforcement official i was already on the edge the church shooting was a tipping point the victims' initials are written on the bullets he echoed the words of the accused charleston gunman , dylann roof , and spoke of a race war he also said jehovah had told him to act he spoke admiringly of the columbine high school killers and the gunman who carried out the virginia tech massacre that left 32 people dead at one point , he called his document a suicide note for friends and family the fax , which also contained allegations that he was repeatedly harassed , bullied and discriminated against for being black and gay , was turned over to law enforcement officials on twitter , he made similar charges of racism and harassment , adding that he had filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission , a federal agency a spokeswoman for the agency , kimberly smithbrown , said federal law prohibited her from confirming whether the agency had received a complaint this gentleman was disturbed at the way things had turned out at some point in his life , sheriff overton said at the news conference things were spiraling out of control accounts from former colleagues , competitors and court records indicate that mr flanagan , who had graduated from san francisco state university and worked in several markets around the south , was a skilled broadcaster , but also volatile , combative , threatening and prone to seeing himself as persecuted of mr flanagan s reporting , of the kind reporters often make to show prospective employers , begins , chillingly , with him holding a gun but at wdbj , he typically did humaninterest stories a town with seven churches within a threeblock area firefighters handing out free smoke detectors huntfest , an annual huntingproducts event at the roanoke civic center a local man turning 100 he worked there for less than a year before he was fired in 2013 he later , claiming discrimination , but the case was dismissed after a judge found the controversy had been settled speaking on the air wednesday , jeffrey a marks , president and general manager of the station , confirmed that mr flanagan had filed a complaint against the station , but said it was dismissed as baseless the station investigated the alleged racist comments , and none of them could be corroborated by anyone , he said we think they were fabricated he was sort of looking out for people to say things that he could take offense to , mr marks said eventually , after many incidents of his anger coming to the fore , we dismissed him he did not take that well , and we had to call the police to escort him from the building mr flanagan seemed to have particular animus toward ms parker and mr ward alison made racist comments , he wrote on twitter just after the shooting , an apparent reference to ms parker two minutes later , apparently referring to mr ward , he wrote , adam went to hr on me after working with me one time ! ! ! court filings in a civil lawsuit mr flanagan brought against the station documented his many confrontations in a may 31 , 2012 , memo , dan dennison , a wdbj executive , wrote that mr flanagan had , on three occasions , behaved in a manner that has resulted in one or more of your coworkers feeling threatened or uncomfortable in another memo two months later , mr dennison ordered mr flanagan to seek help through the company s employee assistance program , and stated that he engaged in behaviors that constitute creation of a hostile work environment in a 2000 lawsuit , mr flanagan also claimed to have been subjected to racial slurs at another station where he had worked , wtwc in tallahassee , fla , where he was also let go in a court filing , the station cited among other reasons , misbehavior with regards to coworkers , and the case was settled on undisclosed terms he was a good onair performer , pretty good reporter , and then things started getting a little strange with him , don shafer , who worked with mr flanagan at wtwc , on the station where he now works in san diego he said that mr flanagan s contract had been terminated , in part , because of bizarre behavior and threats to other employees he turned around and sued us , mr shafer said he wanted to sue us for something else , he ended up suing us for racial discrimination adam henning , the news director at waff , a television station in huntsville , ala , said mr flanagan sought a job there in 2011 , but was rejected after mr henning contacted a halfdozen references they told him that mr flanagan was exceedingly difficult to work with , he said , and had once gotten into a physical altercation at a company christmas party after the shootings on wednesday , mr flanagan left the scene in a rented car his own car was parked at the roanoke airport , sheriff overton said officials said the police pursued him going north on interstate 81 , but did not attempt to catch him , knowing that he was armed it is not clear whether they lost track of him after he turned east on interstate 66 , heading toward washington , a state trooper spotted the car using a license plate reader , and after being

stunned television station , coworkers mourned their slain colleagues mr ward was engaged to melissa ott , a producer at wdbj his facebook page shows pictures of the two of them on vacation in las vegas and , most recently this summer , atlantic city members of the station staff said ms ott was at the station , watching the broadcast when the shooting happened they said it was to be her last

university s school of media arts and design , said he had taught ms parker in three classes and mentored her for four years i'm devastated because i remember the amazing person , and that she wo n't be going after these stories , he said
i watched the first 2016 republican debate with four children , aged 14 , 11 , 9 and 9 that meant juggling pizza off the grill while juggling questions about immigration \( but why does it matter if they come here \? we re all on the same continent \) foreign policy \( we have enemies \? who \? china \? \) and donald trump s hair it meant introducing my oldest son to politifact and its pants on fire gif and teaching my suddenly very worried youngest daughter \( america is under attack \? \) about the concept of exaggerating for dramatic affect \( just like your sister does \) i agree with my colleague frank bruni fox news did an excellent job of structuring the debate three of my four children were genuinely riveted for more than an hour , and one stayed up to watch the whole thing i m learning a lot , he declared , and thanks to questions that demanded thought and understanding of the issues and a field of debaters who were , in some cases , actually willing to consider what they were being asked , i think he was right what my son didn t learn \( what none of us learned \) was where any of the republican candidates stood on issues of family policy , and that s where both fox and the candidates lost an opportunity while the fox team s questioning may have put the candidates on the spot in unexpected ways \( and kudos to megyn kelly for her direct attack on donald trump as part of the war on women \) , their focus was on what many believe to be the only issues of concern to the narrower conservative base and that meant that questions about family leave , sick leave , the minimum wage and affordable child care were noticeably absent that s a mistake workplace economic policy concerns male and female voters on both sides of the aisle providing workers with the ability to be both breadwinners and caregivers isn t a partisan issue in particular , a recent new york times cbs news poll showed that the vast majority of americans support both paid family leave and paid sick leave eightyfive percent favor requiring employers to offer paid sick leave , and 80 percent support paid family leave more than enough to swing an election policies that support keeping parents in the workplace after the birth of a child or during a family illness increase economic stability for everyone and at this point in our history , our country s record on such policies is dismal whether the answer is federally mandated family and sick leave policies or some alternative , there is no debating that we have a national problem a problem these debaters didn t discuss the opportunity for interesting questions was there ben carson , a retired neurosurgeon , said he had once separated siamese twins what kind of policies allowed their parents to care for them before and after the surgery \? donald jtrump has had thousands of employees what kinds of family and medical leave policies does he favor , and why \? voters in montclair , nj , approved paid sick leave last november thoughts , gov chris christie \? senator marco rubio rushed home from campaign travel when his daughter was injured in a golf cart accident , resuming work a few days later should a fastfood worker be able to do the same \? instead , silence it s a silence that won t last once the republican candidate is chosen the likely democratic nominee , hillary rodham clinton , looks poised to put family and medical leave at the center of her campaign no one , she has said , should have to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative but while her rhetoric seems obvious , the tasks of designing , funding and implementing a workable federal policy to provide paid leave will be challenging a good program will strike a balance that benefits employees without overburdening employers , and offer a leave that is not just available equally to women and men , but designed so that both genders take advantage of it creating such a program will require a robust , bipartisan debate , and in this country , a robust bipartisan debate generally begins with a partisan debate in october , the republican candidates will answer new questions on a different stage what policies do you support that will support working families \? should be one of them
patras , greece , s prime minister until he resigned last month to call new elections , was campaigning in this port city recently , in many ways looking like the same charismatic young politician who swept into office only eight months ago he bounded to the stage in an open square , tieless as usual , his shirt sleeves rolled up and he was again asking greek voters to say no , as he did earlier this year when he urged them to reject the strict terms the country s creditors were offering to bail this country out once more but for mr tsipras since he was first elected in january , not least that he ended up reluctantly supporting the same kinds of creditorrequired budget cuts and tax increases he came to power opposing so heading into sunday s national election , he is focused not so much on austerity and the wrongheadedness of the policies imposed on from outside and much more on a homegrown problem corruption a vote for mr tsipras s syriza party , he argued , was a no vote against the old ways , when government served the interests of the oligarchs and politicians made themselves rich a vote to return him to power , he suggested , was a no vote against the parties that had brought greece to its financial knees do n't allow those you kicked out the door in january to come back through the window now , he urged the crowd cheered , but some of his supporters noted that attendance was not quite what it was last january , when mr tsipras , enough for syriza , then proudly leftist , to lead a coalition government mr tsipras , 41 , has lost none of his charm , and as a politician whose party was never in power before january , he still appeals to many greeks who want to overhaul the government that is a card he is playing relentlessly these days but the bruising bailout negotiations and the fallout that split his party after he agreed to terms imposed by greece s creditors have left mr tsipras in an awkward position he is being attacked by the right for being inexperienced and by former far left elements of his own party , who say that his ultimate acceptance of the bailout terms was nothing less than treachery and a sign that he is unreliable his platform is now less radical , focused on enacting the changes required by creditors in a way that will minimize pain to ordinary greeks and hold elites and special interests accountable during his last campaign , he roused a population beaten down by years of depressionlike conditions , including an unemployment rate of 27 percent he called greece s creditors criminals and pledged never to accept more austerity measures today , facing the voters again after a very public metamorphosis , he admits errors , including having underestimated the creditors' resolve he remains proud , he says , of having tried and he argues that his experience this year is good preparation for the years ahead the people want a prime minister who speaks the truth and admits his mistakes , he said at a debate this week where he squared off against his leading opponent , evangelos meimarakis , a longtime member of the centerright party , new democracy but whether his pitch will resonate enough to win him the election remains in question most experts had expected an easy win for mr tsipras , who , at first , appeared to have held on to his popularity despite having to back track on his promises when faced with numerous syriza members of parliament who would not vote for the needed legislation , mr tsipras called for new elections in july his approval ratings were more than 60 percent , but that seems long ago now these days , most polls \( though polls in greece have a bad track record \) say it will be a close race and mr tsipras is likely to fail in his bid to cleanse his party of the farleft fringe and come back with a stronger majority the card he is playing is to admit he got a lot wrong and convince people that is part of the process , said nick malkoutzis , the editor of the economic and political analysis website macropolis but he may have a problem with trust after the erratic handling of the bailout he was the prime minister , not a teenager who was handed the keys to the car , and he made some serious mistakes nonetheless , there is no disputing that mr tsipras , who began in politics as a student organizer , is at ease in the political arena in this week s americanstyle television debate , mr tsipras delivered a forceful , steady performance , smiling and joking often , his illfitting suit occasionally bunching up on his arms in contrast , mr meimarakis , 61 , seethed with anger at several points , first arguing that he would deliver a stable coalition government , but then growing so annoyed with mr tsipras that he declared that he had no intention of working with him and that he could not stand listening to him mr meimarakis was considered only a temporary leader of the party , but his everyman talk \( and his tendency to swear \) has proved more popular than expected he has argued that continuing mr tsipras s education would be much too costly for the country as he campaigns , mr tsipras says that his syriza party has already made a difference , for example by creating emergency subsidies for families without work who have run out of benefits but his critics on the right say mr tsipras s thinking remains too grounded in his leftist ideology and his critics on the left , many of whom have formed a breakaway party advocating a return from the euro to the drachma , are concentrating much of their campaigning on flaying mr tsipras
you ca n't be a monday morning quarterback on something like the weather , bill de blasio said right after the snow oh really \? on tuesday morning we hurled second guesses and grievances the way tom brady tosses an inadequately inflated football by we i mean not just us new yorkers , who were promised the icy end of the world and then forced to make do with something less dramatic , but also all of those who gazed upon the city , state and region and gleefully joined a chorus of instant complaint we grilled de blasio , wondering if he might be using an emergency and his role as responder in chief to shake off that nastiness with the police and turn the page we put andrew cuomo on the hot seat , noting that as long as he was gasping at the possibility of a recordbreaking blizzard , he did n't have to deal with the actuality of jawdropping corruption on his watch and we marveled that chris christie was even present in new jersey he spent months gallivanting around the country collecting ious for a presidential campaign , then thundered home just in time to close roads and prophesy disaster \? what a storm queen that s one perspective , and a sizable share of the cynicism is warranted these guys are showboats who always preen and play the angles it s called getting elected but before we reflexively shovel too much censure on them , let s get a few things straight none of them hallucinated those forecasts of two feet \( or more \) of snow , nor did they cherrypick apocalyptic ones meteorologists and broadcasters aplenty tripped over their adjectives to describe the frigid horrors in wait for residents of the northeastern united states our politicians heard what we heard , and the same tidings that had us picking grocerystore shelves clean and standing in epic checkout lines had them cordoning off bridges and tunnels everyone braced for the worst , which is a whole lot smarter than hoping for the best all signs were that this was going to be very bad , juliette kayyem , a former assistant secretary of homeland security , told john berman and kate bolduan on cnn , adding that for de blasio to take many or most of the steps that he did would have been complete negligence and it was indeed a bad storm in new england , people did get several feet of snow they also got that much in areas of long island that are n't all that far from the new york city border , as the mayor noted at his news conference on tuesday but from the howls of inconvenience and accusations of overreaction in the city itself , you would have thought that central park s snowfall \( almost 10 inches \) was everybody s untrue in matters meteorological as in others , manhattan is solipsism central still , there are questions to be fairly asked was it really necessary , at 11 pm monday , to take the extraordinary step of shutting down the subways \? especially when it turned out that some trains were still running , empty , as a way of maintaining the system \? that was cuomo s call , and it could have waited , if indeed it ever had to be made friends who 've lived through moscow s brutal winters tell me that its mass transit never lets up and while russia s people are hardier , their vehicles are not to varying degrees , cuomo , de blasio , christie and other politicians overreacted , at least slightly , but who s to blame \? they 've seen leaders past including the new york mayors john lindsay in 1969 , michael bloomberg in 2010 and de blasio himself just a year ago endure or be undone by charges of insufficient girding for snow and they know that these days , thanks to twitter and the like , the verdict will be especially hasty and the jury unusually large and loud tv networks , pressed for money and ratings , will pay rapt attention , because weather is an easy news story to cover straightforward , theatrical the correspondents get to wear their skichalet best and to roar over the wind s whisper in a more nuanced environment , the politicians in the snow s path could have charted a better midcourse between readiness and runforcover alarm they could have trusted us to understand that their talents do n't include soothsaying and that their plans will never be precisely right but that s not the climate we live in no , ours is so gripehappy that not long after dawn tuesday , on the business insider website , henry blodget to the transportation shutdown with this sweeping judgment new york has become a nanny state perhaps but imagine if all the snow predicted had arrived and scores of motorists were stranded we 'd be asking those nannies why they 'd abandoned us , and we 'd be looking for their replacements
guatemala city guatemalans united to force their powerful president to step down but now , many who joined the demonstration movement worry that creating lasting change , and rewriting the rules of their fragile democracy , may prove even harder as former president otto p rez molina faced his second day in court with the prospect of a corruption trial , some protesters worried that the country s compromised judiciary might not follow through and they expressed concern that guatemala s entrenched political class , including the new interim president , will hold onto power as it has so many times before most immediately , many of the young and middleclass guatemalans who flooded the central square here every weekend for months simmered with frustration that a presidential and congressional vote they see as inherently flawed would go ahead as scheduled on sunday their demands for postponement were rejected by the national election tribunal , and that decision was supported by both the united states embassy and the organization of american states and so , the candidates whom guatemalans will have to choose from sunday mostly emerged from the same political mire that produced a series of dysfunctional governments that failed in the basic tasks of providing services and security polls suggest that as many as 30 percent of the 75 million eligible voters will abstain or annul their votes the argument is that protesting the election itself is the only way to force accountability from politicians there is a true and widespread desire for more changes , said eduardo stein , a former vice president and political analyst here , who argues instead that only voting will tell politicians that citizens will be watching their actions people feel that the traditional political parties have kidnapped representation even in the moment of triumph , many of the activists say their fear is that the political classes would again find a way to hold on to their privilege in that light , they see the call for a national discussion issued by the interim president , alejandro maldonado , a 79yearold conservative politician , as a way to try to play for time even as the election moves ahead it s clear that otto p rez molina s resignation and alejandro maldonado assuming the presidency were an escape valve for the 6 of september elections , said helen mack , a respected human rights activist and security expert in guatemala each of the leading candidates for the presidency have campaigned under one cloud or another the frontrunner for much of the campaign , manuel baldiz n , a businessman and political boss from the northern jungle region of pet n , has a seemingly bottomless campaign chest and there have long been questions about his links to the drug gangs that have operated freely near the mexican border his vicepresidential candidate , edgar barqu n , a former central bank president , is charged in a money laundering case involving a financial operator for drug gangs mr baldiz n , who pulled his party s support for mr p rez molina only at the very last minute last week , has been running for the presidency since he lost four years ago , apparently immune to campaign spending limits the same protesters who demanded mr p rez molina s resignation reserved some of their disgust for mr baldiz n it s not your turn , they chanted , a reference to the fact that the past five presidents came in second place in the preceding election a sign of how consistently the political class has recycled itself here that disgust has left a television comedian with no political experience as the most viable challenger to mr baldiz n running on the slogan not corrupt , not a thief , jimmy morales bills himself as an independent but his backing by a group of military veterans has raised concerns in a country still deeply scarred by a 36year civil war marked by human rights atrocities by the security forces and mr morales has been ridiculed for having performed skits in blackface in the past another candidate , sandra torres , is a former first lady who divorced her husband in 2011 in a failed attempt to skirt electoral rules that prevented relatives of presidents from running she , too , has associations that offer little hope she would align herself with the anticorruption citizens' movement , given that some of her close family members have been accused of embezzling public funds none of the candidates is expected to win the needed 50 percent on sunday and the election is expected to go to a second round on oct 25 for the next four months , then , the government is in the hands of mr maldonado , who was vice president under mr p rez molina he proclaimed that he would run a clean government but as a judge on the constitutional court , he helped overturn the genocide conviction of the former dictator gen efra n r os montt in the massacres of mayan indians in the worst periods of the civil war it is that sort of reaction the possible reversal of prosecutors' efforts to bring mr p rez molina to account that many guatemalans fear could come next if popular pressure dissipates the influence of powerful groups , from political party leaders who control vast unregulated donations to shady business owners who have been the counterparts to much of the government corruption , still weighs over many institutions here in the past , they have used their influence to rig the selection of judges and harass prosecutors with that in mind , many of the protesters say their movement must continue in order to give real reform a chance to take hold juan luis castro , 61 , a carpenter who attended a small rally outside the electoral tribunal on friday , said the events of the past few days were just the beginning , and that protests should continue to put pressure on politicians hopefully we will choose a congress with a conscience , he said
albuquerque we are back here , back in the place where mayhem lurks just a few steps beyond the culdesac in the vast expanse of desert with a downtown that has some teeth punched out , hotels that house only ghosts and strip malls short on commerce , time is fungible here is it 2014 or 1974 \? and where are all the people \? in this forest of billboards advertising quickbuck lawyers and tattoo removal , walter white is nowhere in sight , having gone down in a hail of gunfire after five seasons of breaking bad what remains is the impulse to tell the story of a fictional version of this place , of the hustlers , gangsters and losers who live like coyotes on the edge of this town for years , there had been jokes in the writing room and on the set of breaking bad about the saul goodman project , the one that would take the indelible lawyer inhabited by and wrap an entire show around him once walter had sold his last barrel of meth then something funny happened the joke came true sitting on the set in albuquerque in september while filming the first season of , which is to have its premiere on feb 8 on amc , mr odenkirk remembers that when the bluff had been called and the breaking bad creator vince gilligan and writer peter gould were actually writing the show , he still had his doubts it was clear that vince and peter were setting the show in albuquerque , and i would be away from my family for a long time , he said in a trailer while having a quick lunch between scenes i was worried about what it would do to my family and worried about whether i would end up being the guy who um , screwed up ' and then i talked to my daughter , who is 13 and incredibly mature , she said , it s a big opportunity , we will be fine , and if it s bad , really , how bad could it be \? ' and i said well , it wo n't be bad it s written by vince gilligan and peter gould the worst thing is it s a really interesting misfire if that s the worst thing it is , i 'd be more than happy to be part of that given that the writers and actors feel that they found something authentic and remarkable in saul and that the show has already been renewed for a second season , that s a pretty good punch line for something that started as a joke in the increasingly cluttered marketplace of television at a time when , you ca n't click a remote without bumping into some version of quality programming there is a huge advantage in spinning off a storied franchise but building on the embedded awareness of the character from breaking bad also means dealing with all the expectations that go with it that tension informed everything about the execution of better call saul for one thing , it is a prequel , set six years before saul and walter became known associates mr odenkirk is not playing exactly the same character instead , he is jimmy mcgill , a knockaround guy with a law degree who cannot catch a break or a decent case the series is the story of how a guy who struggled to stay between the lines and above the belt became saul , a criminal lawyer who is more criminal than lawyer in the time frame of the new show , walter is still teaching high school chemistry , perhaps to jesse pinkman , somewhere off screen , and mr odenkirk s character , rather than guiding the events around him as saul did , is lost , blown about by forces beyond his control then again , it is about as far from a lawyer show as you can get , long on character and less concerned with classic plot lines or courtroom procedure without giving away \( too many \) spoilers , the show opens in the future , after walter s downfall and saul s dispossession of his greasy empire saul is in his own version of witness protection , tucked away in the kind of job no one sees in a place where everyone goes he is a hunted shell of the smacktalking lawyer , who finds solace in running old tapes of his once ubiquitous commercials beckoning one and all to call saul it is grim and scary , but the vibe is as much xfiles \( which mr gilligan used to write for \) as it is breaking bad and then the tape ends and we are back to where saul started , as jimmy mcgill , a slipandfall shyster trying to walk back to more honorable pursuits by taking on public defender work short on real clients , he is looking after the interests of his brother , chuck mcgill \( michael mckean \) , a brilliant , successful lawyer who has lost his marbles and refuses to go outside he also works hard at earning the interest of another lawyer , an icy beauty played by rhea seehorn , who sees right through jimmy and still ca n't stay away she sees in jimmy what we all do , which is a beautiful loser who trouble clings to like a halo of flies but who could talk the birds out of trees i had no interest in doing some legal procedural , mr odenkirk said in between 12 hours of shooting interiors with mr mckean he told the writers to push my character into really extreme situations mr gilligan and mr gould , the cocreator of this show and a writing mainstay of breaking bad , were happy to oblige jimmy is a guy who does n't know who he is yet , mr gilligan said by phone from los angeles , where he and mr gould were attending the semiannual television critics association conclave of journalists he is struggling to be more than he is , and there is a poignancy to that mr gould said jimmy was determined to do the right thing , unless the right thing ends up being the wrong answer there are lines in the sand , he said , but the lines end up shifting based on the circumstance part of the reason they are continuing to write for mr odenkirk is that they have not yet gotten to the end of what he can do saul was conceived as a little comic leavening for breaking bad they decided a fasttalking consigliere would bring some funny to the proceedings and thought of mr odenkirk they were fans of his dating to , the 1990s sketch series on hbo and then mr odenkirk got to work , and saul became less of a sideshow the more we worked with him , the more soul and depth we found , mr gilligan said we loved that he was funny , but there was so much range there he crushed it so completely that we started to daydream about what else we could do it was still a dicey decision to take a fetish object like breaking bad and roll it backward amc , which produced the series along with sony pictures television , said it was actually an easy call there has never been a more challenging time to launch a series , said charlie collier , the president of amc but vince gilligan and peter gould are storytellers , and when they tell you that they have more stories to tell about someone , you pay attention for a while , the cocreators , who could write their own ticket given the success of breaking bad , tried to talk themselves out of it , but they kept returning to saul in part because they had fallen in love with the landscape and aesthetic of albuquerque i was nervous about it , and i still am , mr gilligan said not everyone who takes a look will love what we did with it , but that goes with the territory both mr gould and mr gilligan have made it clear they are making the first season of better call saul , not the sixth season of breaking bad , and viewers should not expect to see bryan cranston or aaron paul but we are in the same neighborhood , so it should come as no surprise that mike ehrmantraut , the beloved hit man played by jonathan banks , rears into view , his quiet fearsomeness contained for the time being by the parking garage booth where he first meets mr odenkirk s character in breaking bad , saul served as an odd sort of moral center , finding a thin reed of humanity in vile circumstance , all the while filling up the safe between fake greek columns with lots of illgotten gains his ability to pivot from the absurd to realpolitik is just as compelling to behold in its nascent state in better call saul until recently , mr odenkirk was known as a comic , writer and impresario who could pull laughs out of very unlikely places before that , he was an emmywinning writer for saturday night live , the ben stiller show and the larry sanders show but in addition to his headturning performance in breaking bad , in the past few years , he had a wellreviewed turn in the fx series fargo , and also received great notices for his film work in nebraska and the spectacular now mr odenkirk credits his acting run with a poor sense of boundaries , nothing more people always tell me how honest i am and the truth is i do n't know how to be brave in that way , he said i just do n't know how to play it any different on set , he admitted that even though he was filming the eighth episode of a 10part season , he had no idea how the first year would end they offered to send me outlines , but i have enough to worry about learning the dialogue that i have for each episode and to be fully present for anything in that moment , he said , pushing back the hair that grew to be almost its own character in breaking bad but is now much more sedate at 52 , he is playing a much younger version of his breaking bad character and has the kind of boyishness that makes it not much of a reach there is a very unactorly earnestness , a complete absence of vanity , to mr odenkirk having led his own show and run a set , he requires none of the wide berth generally given to a lead actor maybe i do n't have the reverence for breaking bad' that i should , but i love this show and i'm crazy happy to have been a part of it , he said and i already know that we are never going to repeat the social and viewing phenomenon of breaking bad' mr gilligan agreed i would not predict for a minute that it would be as big of a hit as breaking bad , ' but i am every bit as proud of this show , he said better call saul is driven less by macabre plot points than a characterheavy look at the burdens of the human condition and the price of one man s soul it s less frantic than breaking bad , relying on an anchored camera that zooms in for long hard looks it is carefully constructed , with an emphasis on physical detail and sound that makes jimmy s law office in the back of a nail salon seem more like a jail cell than a place of business it is a writerly series put out by people who scan as writers , first and foremost peter and vince are a lot more like playwrights and novelists than screenwriters , and on set , bob is always reading three books at the same time , ms seehorn said there are so many nuances to the work we are doing we know where saul ends up , but nothing here is played on the nose there is always something underneath what is being said and done there will be a few surprises along the way , unpleasant for jimmy but fun to watch one trademark of the saul writing team is rendering villains of epic proportions , and viewers might see a few familiar faces in season 1 after all , finding compelling outlaws around here is as easy as spotting snakes in the desert
on monday at noon , the columbia baseball team will gather for what has become a happy , if unlikely , ritual after practice , team members will go to an athletic complex lounge on 218th street in upper manhattan and watch on television as their program is selected to the 64team field of the ncaa tournament tournament regional play is set to begin friday , and an automatic berth goes to the champion , which for the last three years has been the columbia lions not even lou gehrig s lions could make that claim the ivy league did not exist when gehrig played in the early 1920s , and his columbia teams were barely 500 but his collegiate descendants are an emerging force in the northeast columbia \( 3115 \) is not generally lauded for achievement in the highprofile sports the football teams have been bad , basketball has been mediocre in recent years and hockey does not exist as a varsity sport the baseball team endured 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1990 to 2009 usually , when athletic success comes to columbia , it surfaces quietly in sports such as fencing , tennis and archery columbia s women s archery team won national titles in both recurve and compound on saturday but for all the futility , the baseball team has risen to carve out a miniature dynasty under brett boretti , who took over as coach in 2005 in addition , the team now plays in a refurbished stadium , robertson field at satow stadium , with about 300 seats there has been a complete culture change there with coach boretti , said gene larkin , the former minnesota twins stalwart and columbia s most accomplished player after gehrig and eddie collins a lot has changed since i went there in the 1980s the recent change of culture translates into an expectation of winning on may 10 , columbia beat dartmouth , 107 , to capture its third consecutive ivy league baseball championship and fourth since 2008 , a title year despite a losing record before that , columbia had not won an ivy league championship since sharing the title in 1977 with cornell on saturday , the lions swept lehigh in a doubleheader at columbia s new upscale stadium they scored 22 runs for the day and won their 31st game , a program record they won 29 last year and 28 the year before that this is a team with thumpers , but in recent years boretti has built his squads around pitching and defense three of the last four columbia players drafted by major league teams were pitchers , including pat lowery \( los angeles angels in 2012 \) , alex black \( kansas city royals , 2013 \) and david speer , who has a 242 era for the cleveland indians' class a team this year when speer , a lefthander , was on the mound , columbia had the chance to hold any team in the country to one run or none , including the powerhouse programs they drew in the tournament after all , in 2013 little columbia , in its pale blue uniforms , beat new mexico before being eliminated by arizona state last year , the lions had expectations of advancing even further , especially with speer pitching the first game but on selection monday , the day the tournament field is set , he had an emergency appendectomy and was lost for the tournament columbia still battled against texas tech but fell , 32 , on the red raiders' last atbat that was a rough day , boretti said of last year s selection monday and the news of speer s appendicitis but i was really proud of the guys there was real disappointment because we were n't just happy to be there same holds for this year mik aoki , who was a coach at columbia and is the head coach at notre dame , cited two reasons , without hesitation , for the lions' recent success it s the coach and the new facilities , he said columbia recently spent millions to refurbish its athletic facilities , and now it has , in addition to the 300 stadiumquality seats and a new press box , one of the few synthetic turf fields in the ivy league that allows the lions to practice outside in the winter before other teams can the new facilities also make it easier to lure talented players to manhattan boretti and his staff have recruited players from as far as oregon , texas , california and florida , and as nearby as brooklyn many , such as the junior pitcher kevin roy , who is from houston , felt they could not pass up the combination of academics and baseball my parents really pushed it as well , he said they always wanted me to think long term after baseball , and i do n't think i made a bad choice roy said that when he told teammates on his summer team that he was going to columbia , some thought he meant the nation of colombia i get that all the time , said gus craig , one of the lions' best players a senior outfielder , craig grew up in eugene , ore , and was also lured by the combination of academics and athletics he was named the ivy league s coplayer of the year and takes a 331 batting average into the tournament , with eight home runs and 35 runs batted in 46 games until the lions' recent success , some high school players did not realize that columbia had a baseball team that included joey falcone , the brooklynborn son of the former mets pitcher pete falcone a walkon at columbia , falcone served three tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan as a marine medic and then enrolled at the college of staten island before transferring to columbia s school of general studies although he had not played baseball in six years , he sent an email to boretti asking if he could try out when he arrived at the baseball office , his 6foot5 frame filling the doorway , his future coach s eyes widened that one kind of fell in our lap , boretti said since then falcone has slowly emerged as a potent power hitter , smacking a teamhigh 11 home runs with 52 rbi for the lions this year his swing is well suited to the short centerfield fence that is hemmed in by the harlem river to the north at 29 , and with a lifetime of experience in war , falcone did not come to columbia to party , and he was happy to see his younger teammates share his commitment to their sport a lot of kids in college have that party culture , he said i think 90 percent of the guys on the team would much rather win a baseball game than go to one of those raging college parties if someone was to show up to a game hung over , it would n't even take a captain to jump down their throat it would be anyone in that locker room there will be a party of sorts on monday afternoon for the annual selection show the players say they are looking forward to it again as long as no one s appendix gives out
london while entering the field at olympiakos , s players could hardly avoid the banner that was draped across the tunnel we rule this land was its message some two hours later , at close to midnight in piraeus , greece , arsenal had turned impending elimination from the champions league into one of the most memorable comebacks in the tournament s history the london team needed to win by at least two goals to qualify for the next round it scored three and conceded none olivier giroud , the gunners' center forward who has been doubted by many , fell during the first half and twisted an ankle moments later , he scored the first goal , then the second , then the third giroud ended up taking home the game ball as a souvenir mesut ozil , a playmaker so subtle that it has taken two years for arsenal supporters to appreciate his beauty , opened up olympiakos with meticulous passes joel campbell , who has barely been featured at arsenal since he starred for costa rica at the 2014 world cup , was swift and courageous and skillful on the wings and when he was substituted in the final minutes , the 31 , 388 people in the stands applauded this was the real triumph olympiakos is renowned for the hostility of its fans , yet here they were on their feet acclaiming an opponent in campbell s case , it was genuine affection because he had been loaned last season to the greek club and had given his all for their team but in general , those supporters showed their most sporting side they had arrived at the stadium hoping expecting even their team would qualify instead of arsenal olympiakos had shocked everyone by winning , 32 , when the two teams met in london earlier and arsenal was a weakened animal it has lost three key players francis coquelin , santi cazorla and alexis s nchez to injuries over the past three weeks it has others who were barely fit to play i told you this would be our greatest escape , arsenal manager ars ne wenger said on television immediately after the contest i must say , i am very proud tonight because we needed to be right on the mental side and on the tactical side as well we needed something special to come back , and we did it he keeps on doing it arsenal has reached the final 16 of this tournament for 16 straight years under wenger it has pulled out victories against the odds in some notedly difficult places to do so , but this was truly exceptional in every department defense , midfield , offense arsenal outgunned olympiakos the greek club had only lost to one team , bayern munich , in all competitions this season , and it went boldly for another win from the start arsenal s defense , held steady by the experienced goalkeeper petr cech and the calm presence of central back laurent koscielny , refused to give an inch the veteran mathieu flamini was back in midfield because so many alternatives were injured , but the group was composed , alert and primed to shape attacks ozil , as he does almost on a weekly basis now , created the opening goal with a sublime turn and a pass that once again seemed to be in his brain before any opponent could anticipate or react to it campbell was running here , there and everywhere , full of verve and energy , and he , too , created a goal with a disguised pass giroud was what giroud at his best is a striker prepared to put himself into scoring positions again and again until his perseverance pays off his first goal was a header at the near post , and his second was a cushioned leftfooted shot after he had asked \( demanded almost \) for the ball to be played his third was a penalty kick correctly awarded for a hand ball by the excellent italian referee , nicola rizzoli it takes a man of nerve to show olympiakos s kostas fortounis the yellow card and not be fooled by his theatrical fall in the penalty box in an atmosphere as febrile as it was wednesday the crowd knew what was going on , and at times the stadium seemed as quiet as a library as arsenal , little by little , imposed its rhythm and style as the pendulum swung so completely arsenal s way , one thought back to what wenger had said on the eve of the match we want to give absolutely everything to qualify , he told reporters if you want to jump over a hurdle , you do n't think what happens if you miss if you fall , then you have to respond you have to get over it there are countless critics who want wenger , 66 , to be sent off into retirement and replaced by someone younger his team is second in the premier league , despite having key players , like jack wilshere and theo walcott , who have barely contributed because of injuries the critics say that wenger has always been too stingy with arsenal s money , that he has failed to sign a striker , a solid central defender or an athletic midfield anchor his answer is that he trusts the team he has he will buy only if he sees players of demonstrably greater potential than what he already has we are very close in the dressing room , wenger concluded on wednesday you could see that tonight this result makes us stronger and strengthens our belief he then said something that few outsiders believe , that this could be arsenal s year in the champions league it was , to be fair , very late in the evening for so old a coach
molyvos , greece here s a rough guide to the modern world more efficiency , less humanity technology is principally at the service of productivity acts of irrational grace are not its thing they have no algorithm has made me think about everything statistics do n't tell you no european country has been as battered in recent years no european country has responded with as much consistent humanity to the refugee crisis greater prosperity equals diminishing generosity device distraction equals inability to give of your time modernity fosters the transactional relationship over the human relationship the rules are not absolute , but they are useful indicators , mainly from syria , have arrived in a greece on the brink this year , almost half of them coming ashore in the island of lesbos , which lies just six miles from turkey they have entered a country with a quarter of its population unemployed they have found themselves in a state whose percapita income has fallen by nearly 23 percent since the crisis began , with a tenuous banking system and unstable politics greece could serve as a textbook example of a nation with potential for violence against a massive influx of outsiders in general , the refugees have been well received there have been clashes , including on lesbos , but almost none of the miserable bigotry , petty calculation , schoolyard petulance and amnesiac smallmindedness emanating from european union countries further north , particularly hungary for several hours , i crisscrossed lesbos with a driver , michalis papagrigoriou , who had volunteered to help transport refugees from molyvos in the north of the island to the port in mytilene , about 45 miles away his bus , normally used to ferry pale north european tourists in search of mediterranean sun , had been leased by the international rescue committee \( irc \) to help the more than 2 , 000 refugees arriving in inflatable rafts every day papagrigoriou , besieged by calls to take his bus here and there , was in an irrepressible mood around each switchback on the hills between kalloni in the middle of the island and molyvos in the north , refugees came into view children , old men , pregnant women trudging through pine woods they raised their arms they pleaded they lay slumped against backpacks discarded water bottles traced their path papagrigoriou , with an appointment to pick up a busload in molyvos , could not help immediately but each group prompted an impassioned soliloquy about injustice and shared humanity on the way back , although full , he would bend the rules to squeeze in an extra woman and child he would also accept a plea from his village , mantamados , to pick up refugees there , although it meant working deep into the night in molyvos , refugees lined up by the side of the road papagrigoriou s was the secondlast bus of the evening the great golden orb of the sun was already halfway through its riveting plunge below the horizon irc officials explained how they try to stop refugees setting off on foot to mytilene , but some are too impatient to wait i got talking on the bus to taleb hosein , an afghan refugee he 'd been on the road for a long time , how long he could not say the worst was a walk of several days without food from iran into turkey he looked very young i asked how old he was he did not know in afghanistan , he said , there are often no birth records i think i am about 17 or 18 , he said where was he headed \? i want a safe place , i do n't care where , but britain would be my favorite , because i study english a 26yearold syrian dentist from damascus who had been listening to us told me he had gotten married two weeks ago his wife was sleeping , her head on his shoulder this is our honeymoon , he said night had fallen the groups of walking refugees held feeble flashlights many had stopped , having decided to sleep by the side of the road one young man stood in the path of the bus until the last moment papagrigoriou , slowly negotiating the switchbacks , talked about how certain situations demand that human beings help one another , other considerations be damned exhausted silence enveloped the bus hosein and the other afghans disembarked into a camp surrounded by barbed wire the syrian transit camp is less forbidding greek authorities quickly hand out a permit to stay for six months most refugees want to move north to germany , where they believe they will find jobs they will be lucky if they find papagrigoriou s humanity the world hardens in technology s vise the productivity of generosity cannot be measured i asked alexis papahelas , the executive editor of the greek daily kathimerini , what greece could teach the world that dignity and decency can be preserved , even through the hardest times it s a powerful , important lesson that alexis tsipras , reelected as greece s leftwing prime minister , should carry forward
swindon , england a few months ago , a reporter for the local newspaper here went to a charity event in town the manager of swindon town fc , the city s professional soccer club , was appearing at the function , and the reporter planned to write it up some handshakes , some smiles , a quick word between the writer and the manager , and a nice picture in the next day s paper it was the sort of thing that happened in small towns everywhere but when the reporter approached the coach , mark cooper , a team official said there would be no interview and when a photographer from the paper , the swindon advertiser , stepped in with a camera , team officials shut down the picture , too the journalists had no choice but to leave emptyhanded a story about a charity event a charity event ! gary lawrence , the editor of a group of local papers that includes the advertiser , said recently can you imagine \? in recent years , professional sports teams , and even some prominent college programs in the united states , have moved to exploit the shifting media landscape by limiting access and using their own platforms to control and tailor messages they then deliver through teamapproved media channels late last month , swindon town , a thirddivision club that typically plays in front of crowds of fewer than 10 , 000 , formally enacted some of the most extreme measures yet in effect , the team has eliminated nongameday news media access reporters , photographers and videographers are largely barred from interviewing any member of the team , the coaching staff or the club s management , save for a hurried question or two for the manager at a postmatch news conference lee power , the swindon owner , who put the policy in place , acknowledged the paradox of giving an interview to explain the decision but defended the policy because , he said , at the end of the day , the local paper needs the football club more than the football club needs the local paper mr power added that he had been displeased by coverage of the club s activities including a court battle over its ownership and did not deny that that had been a significant factor in his decision the local paper and the football club have n't seen eyetoeye on a number of issues over the years , he said as the owner , i did n't think they were very supportive of the club , and i'm not here to sell newspapers i'm here to do what i believe is best for the club the move prompted outrage from journalists , not only in swindon but around england , as well as from some fans but swindon town s decision is , in many ways , an unsurprising progression in a larger trend the nfl s chicago bears recently on what journalists at their training camp workouts may post on social media , including a ban on reporting team strategy or injury specifics \( fans attending the open workouts are free to post or otherwise reveal whatever they like \) last year , the washington redskins announced with the washington times that appeared to link enhanced access for the paper with favorable content and placement for the team swindon town s move , though , particularly given its place in a smaller community , is more emphatic most european soccer clubs do at least one news conference ahead of each weekend s match swindon town will not most soccer clubs have a big media day near the end of the preseason so that various outlets can put together preview packages swindon town will not according to a swindon town club statement , the vast majority of access to the team outside of the coach s leaguemandated postmatch news conferences this season will be through our inhouse journalist , who is also listed as the club s press officer to fill the content void , swindon town articles , photographs and video will be published on that app , known as fanzai , has so far proved polarizing it is described by some early users who have posted reviews of it as utter rubbish and like a poor man s twitter mr power said the club would still allow a reporter from the local bbc radio affiliate to ask tactical questions of the manager ahead of matches , which means the difficult issues will still be covered but tom bassam , who covers the team for the swindon advertiser , said , they want to engineer the coverage that they want without any accountability it is important to understand that the baseline relationship between professional sports teams and the news media in europe is different from the dynamic in the united states particularly in soccer , the growth of the athleteascelebrity culture has gone handinhand with a decline in access for journalists some rites that american fans might consider standard , such as journalists interviewing players in locker rooms after games , are nearly nonexistent in europe consequently , players and even coaches do not have to explain their mistakes \( or recount their successes \) to the independent news media most big clubs have their own television channels manchester united s mutv and barcelona s bar a tv are two examples and it is not uncommon for a player to go an entire season without speaking to the news media , other than in an occasional required interview for a broadcastrights holder when seattle seahawks quarterback russell wilson at the goal line with seconds remaining in , he answered questions well into the night when manchester united had a player ejected and lost to real madrid in the round of 16 of the 2013 champions league , no united players \( including the one ejected \) spoke to the news media afterward even the manager , alex ferguson , because , an assistant said , he was distraught there also is a long history of european clubs' avoiding , or even banning , certain news outlets or reporters bayern munich refused to give champions league credentials to two english newspapers last spring after the papers published headlines you schwein and you dirty schwein that made a pun of midfielder bastian schweinsteiger s name , and virtually every writer covering the sport in england has been barred at one time or another smaller clubs like port vale , crawley town and nottingham forest have refused access to various outlets for years , and now even some premier league clubs have closed their gates mr ferguson and manchester united had a lengthy ban list for years southampton ordered journalists from a local paper to stop interviewing fans outside its stadium last year and when newcastle appointed a new manager , steve mcclaren , in june , only the club s website sky sports , a televisionrights holder and the daily mirror , said to be negotiating a partnership deal with the club , were allowed to ask questions at the news conference mr power , the swindon town owner , said that his discussions with other executives in soccer had led him to believe that the number of clubs curating their own content would increase in england , there are no significant requirements for clubs to provide news media access at least not in comparison with prominent leagues in the united states and there is no strong union or association of journalists that has been able to push for more availability if i was a head of a man united or a liverpool , this is something i 'd be pushing to do , absolutely , mr power said it makes too much sense from the journalists' side , the trend is alarming , though , perhaps the country s most respected soccer writer , said he sensed that it could also be motivating banning papers is invariably counterproductive , he said , as reporters tend to double their efforts that was what mr bassam and his colleagues at the advertiser said that they intended to do mr lawrence , the editor , said that there had been some talk among local journalists about boycotting swindon town s opening game as a response to the club s policies but that such a stance by the advertiser ultimately would n't serve the readers instead , the paper will seek to cover the team without its cooperation although the club does not have to answer difficult questions , mr lawrence noted , it also misses out on coverage that might be advantageous , such as an article about reduced ticket prices or , say , the manager s appearance at a charity event mr power conceded that point and also said that he felt for the older generation of soccer fans at 43 , he called himself a digital cave man who were used to getting all the coverage of a team in the local paper but a few positive articles do not tip the balance , mr power said he said he was tired of reading articles that were always slanted against us , citing a piece from a local outlet last week that focused on how liverpool would most likely bring a weakened squad of players to an exhibition match at swindon town that hurts the club , mr power said , because we 're trying to sell tickets to the game the benefit we get from the local media is n't outweighed by the damage of their perspective , he said if i'm being honest , i 've got no qualms at all none about what i 've done

jeremy wladis was well settled into an evening train home from washington on tuesday , a commute he does at least once a week , his tablet , his smartphone , a notebook and pen arrayed in front of him to work the train pulled into a curve , then suddenly , a bump i did n't think of it , except you 're on an train and you do n't usually get a bump , he recalled then a shake , a crazy shake , mr wladis said , the whole thing was rattling , you heard tears and metal and you thought you were going to tip over as the train car landed at a 30degree angle , two people from several rows back were vaulted into the luggage rack above him mr wladis , 51 , was jolted from the aisle seat into the window , and pinned by a tray table laptops , cellphones , bags and purses went flying i was covered by human beings , by stuff , he said wednesday morning the first bump , you did n't know what it was , except that it was something strong the second , you knew something was wrong and the third , forget about it , now you 're praying what had been a regular commute for so many along the northeast corridor with its routine and its frustrations quickly became chaos on tuesday night when a sevencar amtrak train derailed as it sped around a curve heading north from philadelphia with the train twisted into what survivors described as a pretzel , seven people died , with many others , particularly at the front , critically injured passengers described seeing skulls fractured , faces damaged , leg bones jutting through skin some cars rolled several times , landing on their sides and leaving disoriented people who had just settled in with wine , reading and headphones trying to figure out how they could stand up before they could think of how to escape there was blackness , and some people recalled a moment of calm as they wondered if what had happened had really happened then there was smoke , and everywhere , panic people were screaming , we got to get off , we got to get off ! ' said mr wladis , who owns several restaurants , ag kitchen and the fuel pizza chain passengers who had managed to hold onto their devices held them up as flashlights while trying to find an exit a passenger who identified himself as a police officer pushed open a door and began helping people out people shouted warnings , not to step on the rails , to watch out for the live electrical lines and downed telephone wires as people stood on the cars in the middle of the train that were resting on their sides , they looked ahead to the first two cars and realized that the damage there was even worse some passengers called 911 , but the operators told them they could not pinpoint their location one woman , who was pregnant , stayed calm and pulled up the gps on her phone to direct responders in the quiet car , passengers moved toward the doors , but they were blocked by debris an arrow pointed to the emergency exit , but with the train toppled on its side , passengers could not tell where that was where am i crawling to \? asked a man in a bloodied white dress shirt crawl forward , sir , a passenger behind him said crawl forward everything just happened so fast and so violently , patrick murphy , a former pennsylvania congressman , told reporters near the crash site on wednesday morning he was on his way from washington to trenton , hoping to kiss his children before they fell asleep after the train derailed , mr murphy , who was uninjured , said , i just checked my arms and legs to make sure they were there , and then i checked the people around me to see that they were ok it had been a hot spring day in washington , and amtrak 188 had been delayed about 15 minutes when passengers boarded , an announcement told them there had been a power problem , so some cars would be warm while the airconditioning rebooted but as the train moved north , passengers noticed that it was making good enough time that it was no longer delayed jillian jorgensen , 27 , a politics editor at the new york observer who had been in washington to cover a visit by mayor bill de blasio , was seated in the quiet car when she looked out and saw the train approach a sharp curve to the left but she never felt the train move left instead , it banked right something bad was happening , and it was fast , she recalled i could see the car in front of me going off to the right she looked for something to hang onto , but there was nothing the train car flipped , ejecting her from her seat she landed about five feet away , wedged between a wall and a damaged seat halfway down the third car , seyward darby , who often took the 7 10 from washington when working there , was leaning into a window , editing an article on her laptop and not paying much attention to where the train was suddenly it began to feel as if it was going too fast into a curve , like when you 're riding a bike on a curve , or a gocart , and you get pulled really hard to the outside the train began jolting violently people screamed luggage and laptops and bodies were flying everywhere the car rolled several times , then skidded to a halt on its side i felt like i was on a roller coaster , said ms darby , 29 , an editor at foreign policy magazine i remember thinking , i need to brace myself as hard as i can she had knee surgery several months ago , and her first thought was , i really hope my knee is ok then , i really hope i'm not dying none of the passengers in the car could figure out how to work the emergency exit , so they decided to push out the windows , which were now on the ceiling , using the dangling seats to hoist themselves up the police had also cut holes in the side of train cars , and cut down a chainlink fence to get to the train dazed , passengers walked what many recalled as the length of two football fields , where they came to a northeast philadelphia neighborhood where residents were coming out of a bodega , offering cases of water , and phones for passengers who had lost theirs to call their loved ones in the dark outside , ms darby s instinct was to get away from the train she walked for about 40 yards , then saw a teenager clutching her hands , with bones poking out she put an arm around her , then , as she felt her own shock , someone else arrived to put an arm around her and warm her with a sweatshirt they saw police helicopters , and then officers rushing people were just hugging each other , pure strangers , ms darby said if you saw someone who just needed human contact , people were being so kind to each other she asked if anyone had died an officer told her it sounded as if people were getting out fine i knew he was lying , ms darby said she wondered about the polite naval midshipman who had sat next to her , but whom she had not seen outside the train having felt the sensation of being in that train as it was hurtling , she said wednesday , there s no way everyone was going to walk away from it a police officer drove ms darby , who had hurt her back , and an injured teenager to temple university hospital a nurse there ms darby recalls her name as angel was using her own phone to field calls and texts from family members of the patients ms darby left the hospital around 3 30 am , and headed to 30th street station , where she gave a statement to a police officer there , she saw her reflection in a bathroom mirror , and realized she was covered in dirt the head of security then walked her to the holding area where families were waiting i saw my fianc , ms darby said i was in shock , shaking he could n't tell if it was me
washington the justice department on wednesday called on ferguson , mo , to overhaul its criminal justice system , declaring that the city had engaged in so many that they could be corrected only by abandoning its entire approach to policing , retraining its employees and establishing new oversight in one example after another , described a city that used its police and courts as moneymaking ventures , a place where officers stopped and handcuffed people without probable cause , hurled racial slurs , used without provocation , and treated anyone as suspicious merely for questioning police tactics gave credence to many of the grievances aired last year by africanamericans in angry , sometimes violent protests after the deadly police shooting of michael brown , an unarmed black 18yearold though the justice department separately concluded that the officer , in that shooting , attorney general eric h holder jr said investigations revealed the root of the rage that brought people into the streets seen in this context amid a highly toxic environment , defined by mistrust and resentment , stoked by years of bad feelings , and spurred by illegal and misguided practices it is not difficult to imagine how a single tragic incident set off the city of ferguson like a powder keg , mr holder said the findings will force ferguson , a workingclass city near st louis that is about twothirds black but has a mostly white police force , to make changes or face a federal civil rights lawsuit justice department officials , who met with city leaders to discuss their findings this week , said that it appeared that ferguson was open to making changes that would head off a court battle in a statement he read to reporters wednesday night , mayor james knowles said the city had begun making changes he did not directly address all the steps that the justice department called for in the report or say whether he would fight the federal government in court today s report allows the city of ferguson to identify problems , not only in our police department but in the entire st louis region , he said we must do better not only as a city , but as a state and as a country we must all work to address issues of racial disparity in all aspects of society mr knowles did not answer questions from reporters it is rare for the justice department to bring the weight of the federal government down on a small city normally , it targets large police forces but mr brown s shooting prompted a broader investigation , and mr holder said what investigators uncovered raised questions about what went on in police departments around the country their report described a city where police officers did not know the law or did not bother to follow it internal documents showed ferguson police officers conducting pedestrian checks , in which they stopped people walking down the street and demanded to see their identification without any probable cause one officer cited in the report told investigators he considered people who refused to show identification to be suspicious or aggressive , and typically arrested them when people refused to comply with or even questioned unconstitutional orders , police sometimes responded with force stun guns , for example , were commonly used even when officers were not threatened supervisors seem to believe that any level of resistance justifies any level of force , the report found blacks in ferguson accounted for 85 percent of traffic stops , 90 percent of tickets and 93 percent of arrests over a twoyear period studied by investigators in cases like jaywalking , which often hinge on police discretion , blacks accounted for 95 percent of those charged a black motorist in ferguson was twice as likely to be searched , according to the report , even though searches of whites turned up drugs and other contraband more often the justice department s analysis found that these disparities could not be explained even when correcting for crime rates and demographics these disparities occur , at least in part , because ferguson law enforcement practices are directly shaped and perpetuated by racial bias , the justice department concluded in one example cited by the report , a police officer pulled up behind a 32yearold black man who was cooling off in his car after a basketball game without cause , the officer demanded the man s identification , ordered him out of his car , patted him down and asked to search the car the man objected , citing his constitutional rights , the justice department wrote in response , the officer arrested the man , reportedly at gunpoint , charging him with eight violations of ferguson s municipal code in july 2013 , when officers arrived at an apartment building to arrest a suspect , they found an africanamerican man in the parking lot the officers knew he was not the man they were looking for nonetheless , without even reasonable suspicion , they handcuffed the man , placed him in the back of a patrol car , and ran his record , the justice department found it turned out , he was the building s landlord and he helped officers enter the building to make the arrest the police department defended the detention as minimal , noting that the car was airconditioned when officers do not have probable cause to make arrests , investigators found , they often use what are known as wanteds by putting someone s name in a police computer system , officers ensure he is arrested if he is ever stopped by the police in ferguson or surrounding cities one veteran officer told us he will put out a wanted if i do not have enough probable cause to arrest you , ' the justice department wrote after a local prosecutor wrote we just do n't have enough for a warrant right now , a detective responded that he would simply use a wanted to ensure the arrest oversight in the department is so lax and recordkeeping is so inconsistent that illegal stops and arrests go unnoticed or unquestioned supervisors are more concerned with the number of citations and arrests officers produce than whether those citations and arrests are lawful or promote public safety , the justice department concluded but federal authorities reserved some of their harshest criticism for the local court system , which does not function as an independent branch of government court employees answer to the police chief the prosecutor is also the city s lawyer judges are installed by the city council and must be reappointed every two years the justice department report describes the courts as a bureaucratic morass in which people often receive the wrong court dates , court procedures are made up on the fly , and it can be unclear how much people owe or when they owe it the punishment for missing a payment or an appearance , even for routine traffic violations , is often jail court fines are a major source of revenue , and internal emails show city officials pushing for more tickets and fines , then congratulating one another when revenue exceeded expectations police supervisors insisted that officers hit ticket quotas and reorganized the shift schedules to help hit them everything s about the courts , one ferguson officer told federal investigators the court s enforcement priorities are money poor , mostly africanamerican residents have described being trapped in the court system for years as they are repeatedly jailed , even when trying to make payments meanwhile , the justice department found , police officers and city officials regularly fix tickets for each other and their friends federal investigators also found that city officials circulated racist jokes on their government email accounts without fear of punishment one portrayed president obama as a chimpanzee another included a photograph of african women dancing topless along with the caption michelle obama s high school reunion a third joked that a black woman should receive a crimeprevention award for having an abortion senior city officials , including those who will be in charge of deciding whether to make changes in response to the justice department report , received the emails , federal officials said in his statement , mr knowles said that one police official was fired for sending racist emails and two others were under investigation after city officials were told about the emails by the justice department these actions taken by these individuals are in no way representative of the employees of the city of ferguson , he said i think a lot of people need to lose their jobs , said alexis templeton , a resident who has organized protests in ferguson when you have people sending certain emails and saying certain things , and then they go out and police the community , which happens to be predominantly black , those stereotypes play into the work ms templeton said she thought ferguson s police department should be disbanded her distrust runs deep late last year , when her grandmother s home in ferguson was broken into , ms templeton said she told her not to call the police , because i do n't trust them to do their jobs at allthe justice department called for an entirely new approach , one built upon community policing it said ferguson should change the way it stopped , searched and arrested people that will require new work schedules and a focus on crime prevention and outreach it will also require extensive retraining and , justice department officials said , some outside overseer to ensure ferguson makes the changes for mr holder , who declared last year that he stood with the people of ferguson , the report culminates a tenure that has made civil rights investigations a priority he is leaving office as soon as his successor is confirmed , probably within the coming weeks his department has opened more than 20 investigations into police departments but none has received the attention of ferguson with the conclusion of our investigations into these matters , mr holder said , i again commit to the people of ferguson that we will continue to stand with you and to work with you to ensure that the necessary reforms are implemented on wednesday night , there were two dozen protesters outside the police department , and officers made a handful of arrests of those standing in the streets
a downtown manhattan performance center has canceled an event featuring a new play by neil labute with a title making reference to mohammed , on the grounds that the play is offensive to muslims the event , called playwrights for a cause and featuring four new short plays about censorship in the arts , was set to take place on june 14 at the sheen center for thought and culture in greenwich village , as the opening of the planet connections theater festivity , a monthlong arts festival at various locations on tuesday , the sheen center canceled the contract for the event , which was organized as a benefit for the national coalition against censorship william spencer reilly , the executive director of the sheen center , said in an email that the play and its title was not in keeping with the mission of the center , which opened last year with funding from the archdiocese of new york and is named for former archbishop fulton j sheen  when an artistic project maligns any faith group , that project clearly falls outside of our mission to highlight the good , the true , and the beautiful as they have been expressed throughout the ages , mr reilly said , referring to the center s mission statement , which describes it as serving catholic and noncatholic audiences alike the sheen center , he added , will not be a forum that mocks or satirizes another faith group mr labute s oneperson play , which was written for the event , is about an actor asked to perform in an offensive satire a description posted online reads the prophet mohammed stands on a barren stage , recalling the first time he made love to a white woman is this reality or a theatrical convention \? where do the lines between satire and censorship intersect or is nothing sacred when it comes to the theater \? the play s title refers to mohammed as having an erection in an email , mr labute said that the play did not depict the actual prophet muhammad \( spelled differently than my title \) , but declined to say more , citing his desire to preserve the audience s sense of surprise in an email , glory kadigan , the founder of planet connections , described the play as a discussion of whether or not it s all right to poke fun at religion or religious figures she said the group did not have titles or scripts for the plays when the contract was signed none of us knew what the writers would write , she said the group is seeking another stage , she said mr reilly said he had signed the contract in february but had only become aware of the play s title earlier this week , after a staff member noticed it on the planet connections website after seeing the script , he decided to cancel the event in light of what he called the play s clear offense to muslims the other plays written for the occasion by erik ehn , halley feiffer and israel horovitz treat censorship issues relating to race , gender and sexuality , which were also set to be discussed in a panel discussion following the performances mr labute , in a statement , said the sheen center was was absolutely within their right in canceling the contract but said he was saddened by the decision this event was meant to shine another light on censorship and it was unexpected to have the plug pulled , quite literally , by an organization that touts the phrase for thought and culture on their very web site , mr labute said both in life and in the arts , this is not a time to hide or be afraid recent events have begged for artists and citizens to stand and be counted
may day in new york has n't always been dancing girls and flower garlands and poles wrapped in ribbons ok , so there is n't a lot of that now , either back in the 19th century , however , those traditional may day celebrations were overshadowed by a less merry rite it was moving day in the city , the day all leases expired rents went up tenants moved out hordes of them all on may 1 an article in the new york times on april 30 , 1873 , traced the history of may day around the world and lamented what it had become in the city the housewife of newyork today , who is not so fortunate as to possess a permanent domicil , wakes up to other thoughts than those of flowers and green boughs on may morning , the article said to many it is a dream of torment , confusion , and expense , and landlords and real estate agents are the evil spirits that rule the day when newyorkers celebrate the day , as they invariably do , it is , if not in sackcloth and ashes , amid dust and piles of carpets and confused heaps of furniture it is certain , the article went on , whatever be the moving cause , that the annual spectacle of a whole drove of gothamites struggling amid pots , and pans , and pictures , and rolls of carpet , to break away from the ties of place and friendship just as they are warming in their old nest , to find a new and cold home and cultivate fresh friendships , is not the kind of picture to gaze on with poetic rapture but , then , they who move are not always the ones to censure it is undeniable that for years the best investment and the surest means of acquiring sudden wealth outside of corrupt political preferment have been real estate speculations but enough about today a happier may day tradition in new york centered on parties and picnics in the parks from an article in the times in 1900 may day as a popular festival in manhattan was celebrated yesterday on a scale that would have horrified the pilgrim fathers , who detested the observance as heathenish' the article continued the chief downtown celebration yesterday was held in battery park , and for the first time in history , it is said , the sacred grasses of the park were trod by the feet of women and children and of men other than policemen and lawn trimmers and what not the herbage did not wilt visibly under the pressure of merry feet the trees did not faint because of the music of a band and a hand organ uptown celebrated too up in central park , the fact that mrs maria wynne , the matron at the police station , had had six lost children to take care of in as many hours , the article said , speaks volumes for the success and enthusiasm of the may day celebrations there mrs wynne did not fail to call the attention of the reporter to the fact that all the lost children were boys , alleging her belief that this was strong proof of the greater intelligence of the girls may day is also traditionally celebrated by workers an article in the times reported on a parade of thousands converging on union square in 1894 , noting particularly the female marchers the women , who were chiefly cigarmakers and shoemakers , were remarkable for their comeliness , neatness of attire , and modest bearing the comely , neat and modest women were , as one of their banners proclaimed , parading for equal rights and equal duties for male and female producers none to parasites happy may day

oakland , calif after the pregame introductions and usual pyrotechnics , but before the game s opening tip , golden state warriors forward draymond green took a microphone to center court he thanked fans at oracle arena for their support and wished them a happy holiday season let s make history tonight , he said happy ! about a minute later on tuesday night , green drained the game s first shot , a 3pointer , against the the warriors never trailed and the never threatened with a 11177 rout , golden state set an record for the best start to a season , winning its first 16 games eventually we will lose , the warriors' interim coach , luke walton , said afterward , though no one can reasonably guess when it might happen the warriors , a cornucopia of talent and a feast for the eyes , reached playing better than they did last season , when they won a franchiserecord 67 regularseason games and cruised to their first championship in 40 years behind guard , as slippery as mercury , the warriors are dominating teams in ways rarely seen , outscoring opponents by an average of 156 points attention now turns to when the warriors might lose and whether they can reach two other records the 33game winning streak of the lakers in 197172 or the 7210 season of the 199596 chicago bulls the warriors play at phoenix on friday and back home against the sacramento kings on saturday they then embark on a sevengame trip , including games in toronto , brooklyn and boston seventytwo is a special number , curry said at his locker after the game thirtythree is a special number as well there are obviously still milestones we can continue to go after but you go after them with how you approach each game we 're not going to win 72 on friday you got to continue to just stay in the moment when you stay in the moment , good things happen , because everybody s just wrapped up in the process those numbers feel attainable but far away sixteen became a goal for the warriors only about a week ago the last few games , we kind of locked in on it , green said we said hey , a chance to make history why not \? ' now that the record was theirs , it felt both monumental and small it s cool to be in the history books , but at the end of the day , it s 16 regularseason wins , green said two other teams had won their first 15 games the , coached by red auerbach , started 150 and pushed their record to 212 but they finished just 3822 and lost to the minneapolis lakers in the basketball association of america championship series , the season before the baa and the national basketball league merged to create the nba \( the nba considers the 194647 founding of the baa as the start of its official history \) the , led by center hakeem olajuwon , also began 150 they slowed to finish the regular season 5824 , the secondbest record in the league , but won the nba title that season and the next before this season , the warriors could be fairly dismissed as likely championship repeaters last season felt like a surprise , as if the warriors had caught the rest of the nba off guard with their small lineups and freespirited style built from the outside in , dependent on speed and 3point shooting , the warriors have none of the usual ballast that stabilizes traditional nba powers playing the warriors is like chasing butterflies , the strongest opponents dizzied by feints and flits to the point of looking foolish the lakers were flatfooted victims of an array of sleight of hand and alleyoops as the warriors had 32 assists on 45 field goals treats every trip down the floor as an exuberant tease , another opportunity for a mindbending highlight a higharcing 3pointer here , a nolook pass there , a doublecrossover move to make opponents fall and fans rise as if tethered to the same invisible pulley system only the harlem globetrotters toy with opponents in so many ways curry can be halfexpected to whistle as he plays keepaway from opponents , or to appear midgame holding a bucket of confetti he leads the league in scoring \( 321 points per game \) and is on pace for 400 3pointers he set the league mark last season with 286 midway through the first quarter against the lakers , a curry 3point attempt hit the back of the rim harrison barnes snared the long rebound and shuffled the ball back to curry , who faked another 3 , drove toward the basket and flipped a pass behind his back to barnes , standing on the 3point line barnes drained the shot the crowd erupted the lakers called timeout by the end of the first quarter , the score was 3011 , and the only remaining suspense was whether the halftime entertainer , an acrobat on an eightfoot unicycle , would drop any of the dishes that she flipped from her feet to a stack atop her head she did not it was one performance that even curry could not match curry had 24 points in 30 minutes and rested alongside other golden state starters in the fourth quarter as the warriors pushed the lead as high as 41 as if the generational torch had not already been passed , los angeles' , now 37 and in his 20th season with the lakers , missed 13 of his 14 shots and had 4 points he was the anticurry you ca n't have so much bravado and enjoy the good times and then have times like this and kind of cower away from it , bryant said you 've got to take your lumps as well beyond the predictions of when the warriors might lose or how many they might win , the only other suspense until the postseason may be the date of steve kerr s return as head coach kerr had surgery in july to repair a ruptured disc in his back and followup surgery in early september he is in regular contact with the team and is at oracle arena during games , but he is not coaching from the sideline , leading practices or traveling to road games walton , the 35yearold son of the hall of fame player bill walton and a twotime nba champion with the lakers , has presided over the team in kerr s absence officially , the team s record , including its 16 victories , will get credited to kerr s coaching ledger kerr called that ridiculous , but walton said on tuesday that kerr s fingerprints were all over the team s success everything we do is based on what steve has set up here , walton said kerr came to golden state s shootaround on tuesday , walton said , and praised the team s dedication to the four core values he has established joy , mindfulness , compassion and competition when we hit those four things , walton said before the game , we 're not only tough to beat , but we 're very fun to watch , we 're very fun to coach , and we 're very fun to be around when the clocked ticked to zeros , the video boards over the court displayed the warriors at 160 , atop the 150 capitols and rockets of years past the warriors know they will lose at some point most likely , curry admitted but they received the congratulations of coaches in the locker room they 're in the history books , walton said but we also reminded them that it s november , and we have a lot of work to do
al bendich , a lawyer who successfully defended the right to free speech in two landmark midcentury obscenity cases involving s poem howl and lenny bruce s nightclub act died on jan 5 in oakland , calif he was 85 the apparent cause was a heart attack , his wife , pamela bendich , said mr bendich was the last living member of the defense team in the howl case , in which the poet lawrence ferlinghetti , who had published and sold howl in book form , stood trial in san francisco in 1957 he was the sole defense lawyer in the first of bruce s obscenity trials , in san francisco in 1962 of the four obscenity trials bruce would go through , the san francisco case was the only one to end in an acquittal al s work set a standard for freedom of artistic expression , the civil rights lawyer michael e tigar said in a recent interview can you imagine a world in which it could be a crime to say words that you can hear on cable tv every night \? that s the world of the sixties , in which there were legal prohibitions of the work of henry miller and allen ginsberg and comedians such as lenny bruce so this was pathbreaking more striking still is the fact that when mr bendich wrote the brief in the howl case a document widely considered to have brought about the defense victory he was just two years out of law school albert morris bendich \( pronounced bendick \) was born in new york city on june 18 , 1929 he earned a bachelor s degree in economics from the university of california , berkeley , in 1950 , followed by a master s in economics and , in 1955 , a law degree there he joined the staff of the northern california american civil liberties union in 1957 that june , the united states supreme court had issued a ruling in an obscenity case , , which deemed speech found to be obscene an exception to first amendment protections it said that this subcategory of sexually oriented expression is completely beyond the first amendment pale it can be absolutely criminalized , nadine strossen , a past president of the national aclu , explained in an interview and that had an enormous chilling impact mr ferlinghetti s trial was scheduled to start soon he had been charged with publishing and selling obscene material after he offered copies of howl for sale in the , the san francisco institution he had helped found the roth ruling carried potentially grave implications for howl , which was rife with sexually explicit language it was incredibly important to provide persuasive arguments to the judge in that case about how he should construe the supreme court exception narrowly , ms strossen said and in such a way that it did n't extend to howl' or city lights bookstore mr ferlinghetti s trial a bench trial , with no jury opened in san francisco municipal court on aug 16 , 1957 , before judge clayton w horn the defense team was led by jacob w ehrlich , a largerthanlife litigator given to sartorially extravagant courtroom presentations he wore cuff links that at the time cost 25 , 000 more than 200 , 000 today ronald k l collins , a professor at the university of washington school of law who has written about the case , said in an interview \( sam benedict , a television series starring edmond o'brien and based on mr ehrlich s career , was broadcast on nbc from 1962 to 1963 \) mr ehrlich , assisted by the civil liberties lawyer lawrence speiser , would handle most of the courtroom arguments jake ehrlich spent most of our time reading from books like moll flanders' to prove that this was nothing new , mr ferlinghetti said in an interview on tuesday and we were left with only a few minutes at the very end for al to make the constitutional points on which the case was won it also fell to mr bendich the guy at the bottom of the totem pole , mr collins said to write the crucial document known familiarly as a brief but more formally as a legal memorandum judge horn would consult it in drawing up his ruling in judge horn , a sunday school teacher in his spare time , the defense seemingly could not have drawn a less sympathetic jurist he s a man of the lord , said mr collins , whose 2013 book , mania , written with david m skover , chronicles the howl trial before this case , five women were in his court for shoplifting and what was the sentence he gave them \? they had to go and watch the movie the ten commandments' released in 1956 and then playing in theaters write an essay and then come back and read it to him in court on oct 3 , 1957 , judge horn delivered his opinion that he produced a written opinion was noteworthy in itself rarely if ever will a municipal judge get a first amendment case , mr collins said if you think about the kind of cases he gets traffic violations , littering he s not going to write an opinion in those cases more than 4 , 000 words long , judge horn s opinion concluded in considering material claimed to be obscene it is well to remember the motto honi soit qui mal y pense' \( evil to him who evil thinks \) therefore , i conclude the book howl and other poems' does have some redeeming social importance , and i find the book is not obscene the full opinion mirrored , in structure and substance , the central points that al bendich made in his memorandum , mr collins said he added if you took into consideration jake ehrlich s arguments and speiser s contributions , it may well be that they disposed the judge to rule the way that he did but then he needed the law to support it , and that s where bendich comes in to use a basketball analogy , they did the setup he did the dunk on oct 4 , 1961 , bruce was arrested after a profanityladen performance at a san francisco nightclub his trial began on march 5 , 1962 judge horn again presided the judge s presence now seemed to augur well for the defense , but bruce , ever the contrarian , demanded a jury trial bruce had this romanticized view of the people , ' said mr collins , also the author , with mr skover , of the trials of lenny bruce \( 2002 \) so bendich has to do two things if he plans to win this trial he has to have an array of witnesses sociologists and others to support the idea that certain forms of ribald comedy really further the importance of comedy he also has to be very skilled in crossexamining the state s witnesses but he does one more thing that will prove to be extremely important he writes jury instructions the proposal that the judge considers , with that of the prosecution , before making his charge to the jury on march 8 , the jury heard judge horn s instructions , which were , mr collins said , either verbatim or very close to the ones bendich gave him retiring , they deliberated for 5 hours and 25 minutes before acquitting bruce from newspaper interviews afterward , it was pretty clear that if it were n't for those instructions , they were going to convict , mr collins said a resident of berkeley , mr bendich taught speech at the university of california there in the 1960s other seminal cases on which he worked included , a 1967 california supreme court case that ensured the constitutional rights of recipients of public assistance at his death mr bendich was a copresident of , an entertainment concern in berkeley he joined the company , originally fantasy records , in the late 1960s in the '70s , after mr zaentz began producing feature films , mr bendich helped him secure the rights to ken kesey s novel one flew over the cuckoo s nest the film version , coproduced by mr zaentz , was released in 1975 mr bendich s first marriage , to hilary solomon , ended in divorce besides his wife , the former pamela strebel , his survivors include three children from his first marriage , nora bendich oldwin , jonathan bendich and bridget bendich a daughter from his second marriage , adrianne bendich keffeler six grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren more than half a century later , the howl case and bruce s san francisco trial remain highwater marks in first amendment law if it were not for al bendich making the constitutional points that won the howl' trial for us , the prosecution of publishers who publish something that could be judged obscene would have gone on and on , mr ferlinghetti said but as it was , even though this was only a municipal court , this was a precedent that stood up all these years it was no longer possible for some narrowminded local authority to win a case against a book for obscenity throughout his courtroom career , mr bendich s ready wit stood him in good stead this was perhaps nowhere more evident than in the bruce trial , where , in his opening statement , he discussed the timehonored role of comedy as a vehicle for social criticism in his memoir , how to talk dirty and influence people , bruce recalled what transpired we are going to prove , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , that the nature of mr bruce s performance on the night of october the fourth was in the great tradition of social satire , related intimately to the kind of social satire to be found in the works of such great authors as aristophanes , jonathan swift the prosecutor would have none of this i'm going to object , he interrupted aristophanes is not testifying here your honor , mr bendich shot back , i did n't say i would call mr aristophanes
prague , okla yanked without warning from a deep sleep , jennifer lin cooper , whose family has lived near here for more than a halfcentury , could think only that the clamor enveloping her house was coming from a helicopter landing on her roof she was wrong a 50magnitude earthquake the first of three as strong or stronger over several days in november 2011 had peeled the brick facade from the 117 , 000 home she bought the year before ms cooper , 36 , could not get out until her father pried a stuck storm door off the front entrance repairs have so far cost 12 , 000 and forced her to take a second job , at night , to pay the bill at a packed town hall meeting days later , ms cooper said , state officials called the shocks , including a 57 tremor that was oklahoma s largest ever , an act of nature , and it was nobody s fault many scientists disagree they say those quakes , and thousands of others before and since , are mainly the work of humans , caused by wells used to bury vast amounts of wastewater from and gas exploration deep in the earth near fault zones and they warn that continuing to entomb such huge quantities risks more dangerous tremors if not here , then elsewhere in the state s sprawling well fields as long as you keep injecting wastewater along that fault zone , according to my calculations , you 're going to continue to have earthquakes , said arthur f mcgarr , the chief of the induced seismicity project at the federal earthquake science center in menlo park , calif , who has i 'd be a little worried if i lived there in fact , i 'd be very worried but in a state where and gas are economic pillars , elected leaders have been slow to address the problem and while regulators have taken some protective measures , they lack the money , work force and legal authority to fully address the threats more than five years after the quakes began a sharp and steady increase , the strongest action by the republican governor , mary fallin , has been to name a council to exchange information about the tremors the group meets in secret , and has no mandate to issue recommendations the state legislature is not considering any earthquake legislation but both houses passed bills this year barring local officials from regulating oil and gas wells in their jurisdictions the state seismologist s office , shortstaffed , has stopped analyzing data on tremors smaller than magnitude 25 even though says those quakes flag hidden seismic hazards that might prove invaluable for avoiding a damaging earthquake the governor referred an interview request to michael teague , her energy and environment secretary mr teague said the governor s earthquake council was helping coordinate the response to the shocks and that underfunded regulators and scientists had benefited from efforts to find new state and federal assistance for their work it s not working well enough if your house is shaking , absolutely no doubt , he said but it s working very well but others say the political will is missing to confront an earthquake threat tied to oklahoma s dominant industry it is a dangerous game of russian roulette , said jason murphey , the republican state representative from earthquakeridden guthrie , in central oklahoma if a dangerous earthquake happens and causes lots of damage and injuries , he said , a cloud will hang over the energy sector for a long time to come if scientists see dangers , many oklahomans are wary of disrupting an industry so woven into everyday life the state s oil and gas wells gush profits to corporate owners , but also royalties to farmers and homeowners , and tax payments to the state and cities by some accounts the industry supports as many as one in five oklahoma jobs it showers oklahoma universities with millions of dollars in donations and helps make dreams like oklahoma city s nba franchise , reality it is also a major political contributor to ms fallin , legislators and all three elected members of the , which oversees oil and gas production and disposal wells we always want to be invited to the prom , said state representative cory williams , a democrat from stillwater , the home of oklahoma state university and one of the state s most seismically active areas and we 've decided that oil and gas is the best prom date we 'll ever get , and we do n't want oil and gas to go away those blessings , however , are not unalloyed from 2010 to 2013 , oklahoma oil production jumped by twothirds and gas production rose by more than onesixth , federal figures show the amount of wastewater buried annually rose onefifth , to nearly 11 billion barrels and oklahoma went from three earthquakes of magnitude 30 or greater to 109 and to 585 in 2014 , and to 750plus this year , should the current pace continue in the united states , only alaska is shaken more the corporation commission lacks explicit authority to regulate earthquake risks so it is trying to contain the risks posed by roughly 3 , 200 active wastewater disposal wells using laws written to control water pollution last spring , the commission began trying to weed out quake risks by scrutinizing wells near larger quakes for operational problems and permit violations a few dozen wells made modifications four shut down it is now difficult to win approval for new wells near stressed faults , active seismic areas or the epicenters of previous quakes above 40 magnitude regulators significantly expanded the areas under scrutiny last month yet the quakes continue privately , some companies are cooperating with regulators and scientists by offering proprietary information about underground faults publicly , the industry wants oklahomans to beware of killing the golden goose many in the industry were reluctant to comment for this article but kim hatfield , the regulatory chairman of the and president of crawley petroleum , warned a reaction of panic is not useful shutting down disposal wells and the industry they serve , he added , will make look like a cheery movie the mechanics of wastewaterinduced earthquakes are straightforward soaked with enough fluid , a layer of rock expands and gets heavier earthquakes can occur when the pressure from the fluid reaches a fault , either through direct contact with the soaked rock or indirectly , from the expanding rock seismologists have documented such quakes in , new mexico , , kansas and elsewhere since the 1960s but nowhere have they approached the number and scope of oklahoma s quakes , which have rocked a fifth of the state one reason , scientists suspect , is that oklahoma s main waste disposal site , a bed of porous limestone thousands of feet underground , lies close to the hard , highly stressed rock containing the faults that cause quakes the salty , sometimes toxic wastewater is a byproduct of extracting oil and gas , whether by hydraulic fracturing of onceunreachable shale deposits , commonly called fracking , or from conventional wells most is pumped out of the ground with oil or gas , then returned to the earth in a socalled disposal well , often at a different location the corporation commission faces a complicated task it can order a shutdown or operational change only one well at a time , and only if a well violates its operating permit or is clearly tied to an earthquake risk but geologists say the sheer volume of waste being buried in an area with many wells and not any single well causes most quakes it often is difficult or impossible to assess blame to a particular well some other states like arkansas and , this week , , have imposed blanket shutdowns or cutbacks on wells near active quake zones we do n't have the ability or the legal authority to issue a moratorium , dana murphy , one of the three elected corporation commissioners , said in an interview we do have the ability to take certain actions in emergency situations , she continued but that s emergencies when they start happening it does n't talk about what happens before the emergencies occur the 2011 quakes that damaged ms cooper s home in prague \( pronounced prayg \) illustrate the regulators' limited reach acting on geologists' suspicions after the first temblor , regulators tested and pored over operations data from three wells two small ones and a huge one , called wilzetta , sunk by the tulsabased company new dominion in 1999 they were seeking some definitive cause of the tremor they found none the wells still pump today , even as worried regulators wave off operators who want to sink new ones indeed , by december 2013 , wilzetta had nearly doubled its average monthly volume of waste compared with the months before the 2011 shocks without convincing evidence that a well poses a seismic threat , one official said , regulators are powerless to order precautions , much less shutdowns shut it in \? how \? said that official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was barred from discussing specific cases show me the cause show me the violation hamstrung , regulators now may have pushed their authority to its limits beginning last may , the commission began tightening permits for new disposal wells , requiring seismicity tests and requiring shutdowns if quakes occurred nearby existing wells were unaffected but last month the agency required operators of hundreds of wells to prove they were not accidentally pumping wastewater into bedrock , which seismologists say raises earthquake risks we are operating on the assumption that time is of the essence , a regulatory program manager at the commission , matt skinner , said in an interview scientists certainly agree federal seismologists have for a year warned of rising earthquake risks last july , that wastewaterinduced earthquakes were approaching a fault near oklahoma city capable of producing a magnitude 70 shock , though other experts call that unlikely in january , scientists including oklahoma s state seismologist , austin holland , and identified three faults capable of significantly larger earthquakes last month , a south african geophysicist delivered another magnitude 5plus quake could occur by 2016 , and one fault running through stillwater and two other cities potentially could yield up to a magnitude 65 shock while scientists worry , political leaders have been slow to recognize the threat first elected in 2010 , governor fallin appointed the earthquake advisory council last september oklahoma has always had seismic activity , but the reality is we are seeing more , she said then it s important that we study this issue and have sound science that can inform decisions she allowed only last week that wells accidentally drilled into rock containing faults could potentially set off shocks scientists say that is only one factor at play in the quakes the governor s 12member earthquake advisory council , drawn from industry , government , the legislature and academia , works as an information clearinghouse , said mr teague , her energy and environment secretary and the group s chairman the whole idea of the group , he said , is what are you working on \? what are the gaps that you 've got , and is there somebody else that can fill that gap \? the most glaring gaps , however , remain mostly unfilled last month the state promised a clerk , two technical experts and 50 , 000 to help regulators assess wells , but a 600 millionplus budget deficit makes significant aid unlikely the legislature could grant the commission greater authority , but legislators say that is not an option in a state where regulation is deeply unpopular , and the oil and gas industry holds political and economic sway the industry has worked on several fronts to contain concern about the quakes in october 2013 , almost two years after the prague quakes , dr holland , the state seismologist , issued a news release warning that the earthquake risk in oklahoma city , about 50 miles west of prague , had increased wastewater disposal wells , he added , may be a contributing factor two weeks later , he was summoned to the office of the university of oklahoma s president , david l boren , to meet harold g hamm , the chairman of continental resources , one of the state s biggest oil and gas companies mr boren sits on continental s board , for which he has been paid more than 16 million in stock awards and directors' fees since 2009 , according to proxy statements continental officials did not respond to a request for comment last month , after the newsletter reported the meeting , mr boren called the session purely informational dr holland said that mr boren assured him his academic freedom as a scientist was unchallenged then , dr holland said , mr hamm told him that public discussions of disposal wells are unnerving they can dramatically affect the industry continental is seeking to shape that public discussion , arguing , and that the earthquake epidemic is not manmade , but part of an unusually active period for quakes worldwide and in courtrooms , some residents have begun to demand an accounting in august , sandra ladra , a prague resident injured by a collapsing fireplace during the 2011 earthquakes , sued the wilzetta well s operator , new dominion , and the spess oil company , which operates the two smaller wells nearby then , in february , came a classaction lawsuit against the two companies by ms cooper , whose house in prague was heavily damaged her suit seeks compensation for quake damage not only to her home , but to any homes in nine counties surrounding prague that case has yet to be heard but ms ladra s suit , now before the state supreme court , previews the industry response the wells operate legally , and regulators should hear complaints against them letting juries decide their culpability in earthquakes invites financial disaster i do n't want to belittle the public s concern about earthquake swarms i live here , too , robert g gum , a lawyer for new dominion , said at an october hearing but it s no more important to the people sitting in this courtroom and the people in this state than the state s economy it s no more important in recognizing how important the oil and gas industry is to that economy if juries hold the companies liable for prague s earthquakes , he added , i doubt if this is the last lawsuit that will get filed these wells will become economic and legal liability pariahs they will be shut down to ms cooper , that message is clear people need to just take their losses for the greater good of the oil and gas companies you know , do your part , she said she does not buy it if the truth destroys something , she said , then it needs to be destroyed
esperanza spalding held a small screen in front of her face as she took the stage at le poisson rouge on friday night , whipping it aside with a theatrical flourish there at once was glam pants , candycolored eyeglass frames , long braids in place of her trademark afro but the show s big reveal had more to do with her music as a bassist and a singersongwriter , ms spalding has been showered with acclaim for her nimble selfpossession for her belllike sonority and for her effervescent breadth of style , encompassing modern jazz , brazilian pop , vanguardist soul and chamber art song she s now 30 , four years past at the grammy awards , and evidently interested in new ways of working with her talent and her image she has described emily s d evolution , her conceptminded new body of songs , as a callback to the purer creative intentions of a child emily is her middle name , and it was what people called her back when she first wore braids and big glasses , and seemed always to be putting on a show in the backyard if that sounds like wistful remembrance of a simpler time , maybe it is see this pretty girl were the first words ms spalding sang on friday watch this pretty girl flow those lyrics came from good lava , with a fouronthefloor drumbeat and a thorny electric guitar riff , as if to fly the pirate flag of the ms spalding sang the song s melody with her usual swooping grace , but also with sturdy and welldrilled reinforcements corey king and nadia washington on background vocals and keyboards , matt stevens on guitar and justin tyson on drums ms spalding played electric bass throughout the show with zippy flair but also a hard , focused restraint the show consisted entirely of new songs , none of which had yet surfaced on social media , which meant that the standingroom audience was n't cheering the familiar \( make no mistake people were cheering \) ms spalding is still enamored of wayne shorter s harmonic depth and stevie wonder s melodic lift , but her frame of reference has broadened in salutary ways had the serpentine gnarl of a funkadelic anthem , and noble nobles brazenly evoked hejiraera joni mitchell \( the encore and sole cover was ms mitchell s help me , from a couple of albums prior \) every now and again in the show , ms spalding and her backup singers engaged in a coordinated burst of spokenword patter or street theater one of these involved diplomas and a mock processional , and led into a sardonic tune called ebony and ivy , presumably referring to about the legacy of slavery in american institutions of higher learning elsewhere , ms spalding created set pieces with lyrics alone , addressing class divisions in a purposefully bleary tune called tambien detroit , and relationship falsehoods in , a winningly chromatic funk ballad change us , which evoked prince in righteous soulwarrior mode , featured a chorus built around a complaint why must we fuss \? ms spalding cried just when it s good , you want to change us ms spalding has never had to say those words to her fan base , given how quickly she moves emily s d evolution will probably be her next album , but those details have n't yet been announced what s certain is that she s getting this music out on her own terms , including at a free show at the celebrate brooklyn ! festival on june 12 if the crowd there is anything like the one on friday , she 'll have no problems at all with the rollout
tucson araceli rodriguez crossed the border for the first time on friday , traveling from her home in nogales , , to the federal district court here to face the agent accused of firing multiple shots into and killing her younger son the agent , lonnie swartz , looking squarely at the judge in his first court appearance here , and not at ms rodriguez , pleaded not guilty to seconddegree murder his trial has been scheduled for nov 17 he may be tried and convicted , but none of it will bring my son back , ms rodriguez said the case against mr swartz is being closely watched on both sides of the border because he is the first border agent to face federal murder charges for a crossborder shooting , despite 33 deaths in encounters with border and customs agents since jan 1 , 2010 the crowd in the courtroom here included officials from the mexican consulate , along with american lawyers and civil rights advocates all of them eager to see if the trial sets a precedent for crossborder relations ms rodriguez and her family have waited three years for their day in an american court on oct 10 , 2012 , mr swartz opened fire into mexico , emptying his 40caliber pistol , reloading , then pulling the trigger again , court documents say the bullets struck 16yearold jos antonio elena rodriguez 10 times he collapsed on a cracked sidewalk , across from the border fence and mr swartz , under a sign that read emergencias m dicas medical emergencies officials said that jos antonio was throwing rocks at its agents , and that mr swartz fired in selfdefense witnesses said he was peacefully walking down the street we 'll see what the courts decide , what the jury decides , art del cueto , president of local 2544 of the national border patrol council , the labor union that represents agents in the tucson sector , the agency s largest regional division we want justice , like everyone else we do n't want a witch hunt jos antonio lived in nogales , mexico , four blocks from one of the ports of entry that leads into nogales , ariz , where his grandparents live they are united states citizens his grandmother , taide elena , often spent the day at his home while his mother worked he was a citizen of mexico with a foot in the united states , ms elena said crossborder connections are ubiquitous in the neighboring cities named nogales mexican children commute across the border daily from their homes to school workers spend their paychecks in supermarkets , restaurants and discount stores that sell clothes and medication on both sides families live split lives relatives who are not legally permitted to visit one another talk and touch through the fence until mr swartz s indictment last month , the justice department had never filed criminal charges against border agents implicated in crossborder killings in other cases , federal prosecutors found justification for the agents' actions or lacked the evidence required to secure an indictment and sustain a criminal charge in court in civil lawsuits , the courts have been more divided on how to apply american law to the borderlands in june 2014 , the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit upheld a lower court s ruling saying that a mexican teenager shot dead by a border patrol agent was not entitled to fourth amendment protections because he was a foreign national standing on foreign soil when he died the teenager , sergio hernandez guereca , 15 , was in ciudad ju rez , mexico , under the pillars of a crossborder bridge the agent , jesus mesa jr , on the other side of a barbedwire fence , in el paso the family of jos antonio invoked the fourth amendment in its own lawsuit , using the same rationale articulated by sergio s parents in their claim a cocked gun and a pull on the trigger are enough to constitute assault , regardless of where the victim is and in their case , judge raner c collins of federal district court endorsed their argument , allowing the lawsuit to go forward several months ago alongside the separate criminal proceeding peter j spiro , a constitutional law professor at temple university , described the ruling as very elegant because it took into consideration the blurred divisions that the area holds he acknowledged that there s something particular about this area family connections , a border patrol that exercises a certain degree of control on territory that projects into mexico and those factors point to the application of the fourth amendment in a way that even 50 miles into mexico would n't work the same way , mr spiro said it says that this border area is distinctive and is not as clear a line as the fence makes it seem if mr swartz is convicted , he faces up to life in prison
kabul , afghanistan faheema stood trembling in the courtyard of the large house , steeling herself for the meeting with her family she took a deep breath and ran inside , her black abaya swirling around her , and fell to the floor at her uncle s feet , hugging his knees , her face pressed against him , her shoulders heaving the reproaches came immediately how could you do this \? her uncle said you were always so sweet to everyone how could you have done this \? what faheema , 21 , had done was to run away from her home in eastern with the man she loved she left behind her large family and the man that her family had promised her to although her uncle s words at first seemed kind , his tone had a dangerous edge faheema had to come home for a young woman from an afghan village to go home after running away with a man is tantamount to crossing a busy street blindfolded there is a strong likelihood that she will be killed for bringing shame on her family faheema , who like many afghans uses a single name , was one of the lucky ones she had made it to an emergency women s shelter , one of about 20 that over the last 10 years have protected several thousand women across afghanistan from abuse or death at the hands of their relatives these shelters , almost entirely funded by western donors , are one of the most successful and provocative legacies of the western presence in afghanistan , demonstrating that women need protection from their families and can make their own choices and allowing women to decide for themselves raises the prospect that men might not control the order of things , as they have for centuries this is a revolutionary idea in afghanistan every bit as alien as western democracy and far more transgressive as the shelters have grown , so has the opposition of powerful conservative men who see them as western assaults on afghan culture here , if someone tries to leave the family , she is breaking the order of the family and it s against the islamic laws and it s considered a disgrace , said habibullah hasham , the imam of the nabi mosque in western kabul and a member of a group of influential senior clerics what she has done is rebelling the opposition comes not only from conservative imams , but also from within the afghan government itself lawmakers came very close in 2011 to barring the shelters altogether and in 2013 nearly gutted a law barring violence against women they yielded only after lastminute pressure from the european union and the united states now , as the western presence in afghanistan dwindles , this clash between western and afghan ideas of the place of women means many of the gains women made after the 2001 invasion are at risk although the taliban s harsh restrictions on women alienated many afghans and helped rally foreign support for the war , the idea that women must submit to men remains widely held a lot has changed since 2001 , but most people still have conservative , traditional views of women , said manizha naderi , who runs women for afghan women , which operates shelters or other programs in 13 provinces that makes the fragile network of safe houses and the women who staff them even more vulnerable to restrictive legislation and attacks by local strongmen the shelters , like so much of the western project to coax change in afghanistan , are emblems of a society in transition while the shelters have brought freedom to many women , others are stranded , safe for a time from their families but unable to leave because neither their families nor society accepts them ms naderi estimates that about 15 percent of the women in her shelters cannot leave ever for these abused women , the longer they live suspended between two worlds , the less the shelter comes to feel like a haven and the more like a jail above all , faheema wanted to avoid , an 18yearold who ran away from her family in rural baghlan province in the summer of 2013 and whose case became widely known she fled when her family told her she would be marrying an older man amina made it to the provincial capital and was picked up by the afghan intelligence service unlike many runaways , who are seen as fallen women and are prey to being molested by the police , she was not abused instead , she was brought to the women s ministry office , which exists in every provincial capital in afghanistan the women s ministry sent her to the only shelter in the province but after one or two nights , her family arrived they promised not to harm amina if she returned home with them , repeating that pledge on a videotape after meeting with the head of the provincial women s ministry office , khadija yaqeen the girl then climbed into a taxi with her family amina never made it home nine men accosted the vehicle on a deserted stretch of road not far from her home , pulled her out and shot her , according to her family no one else was harmed , they later told the ministry women s advocates and the police doubted the story why would armed men take just one young girl out of a car and shoot her \? why would n't the family call for revenge \? the answer pointed to something far more sinister than a random holdup in much of afghanistan , a runaway is a tainted woman , who cannot be married off this is the perception once she leaves the family , she s in the hands of others , and they can do whatever they want with her sexually abuse her because she has left the family circle , said mr hasham , the imam in kabul by tribal custom , which is particularly strong in rural areas , a socalled honor killing is the only way to eradicate the shame the baghlan provincial police chief , amer khail , believes amina s brother was involved in her killing , but said there were conflicting reports the women s ministry office did not press for arrests amina s short life and death drifted into sketchier and sketchier memory , with everyone involved claiming they had done the right thing ms yaqeen of the women s ministry said she had to let amina go because she asked to leave with her family nobody had beaten her , she said , so i had no excuse to keep her ms yaqeen admits she was called by a member of the provincial council she said the council member did no more than urge her to talk to the family , who had come to the provincial capital to get their daughter back provincial council members tend to be deferential to the desires of powerful local families , who would be eager to cleanse the family honor but ms yaqeen said amina made the choice herself it seems likely that a young girl , frightened and among strangers and faced by her angry family , would try to appease them because she could hardly believe that her family would be willing to kill her women s advocates in baghlan have little question that this was an honor killing she should have been kept in the shelter for much longer , said homaira mohammedi , the acting head of the baghlan shelter at the time , who says that she was away the weekend that amina came in we did everything according to the rules and regulations , ms yaqeen insisted this is a problem of the society faheema was sure that her family would not spare her if she left the shelter and went home i had a problem with my father , she said he engaged me to my uncle s son , and i was n't happy to marry him , so i married another man her father told her he had bought a gun wherever i see you both , i will kill you , ' he said before she ran away the desperation of her family to have her come home suggested that her view was correct they were willing to agree to almost anything to pry her away from the safety of the shelter a younger girl , or a weaker one , might have given in but one of the most striking characteristics of many of the women who make it to a shelter is that , like faheema , they have a sad but cleareyed understanding that they are in danger from their own families this is often the first step toward being able to save themselves unlike the baghlan women s ministry , where amina had just one meeting with her family before she was given back to them , women for afghan women requires repeated sessions between the young woman , her family and a mediator before she can go home the average number of meetings is about eight , said nuria kohistan , who mediated faheema s case if the staff is not satisfied that the young woman will be safe , they will keep her as long as necessary faheema s third session with her family was a few days after the first and involved her mother , a younger sister , a younger brother and the brother of her spurned fianc , who had been at the previous meeting the 45minute session was filled with tears and screaming and bordered on physical violence several times faheema s mother grabbed her daughter s arm and held it in an iron grip as if to drag her from the mediation room , through the door and out the gate a tall , thin woman with a frightening strength , she seemed to hold faheema in her sway far more than the men in the family as if to protect herself , faheema entered the room with a veil covering her whole face first her mother said to the mediator my daughter wants to go with us her father is now in the hospital she turned to faheema and said , we will get you divorced from that guy , referring to the man faheema ran away with her fianc s brother and her mother said they would support her marrying someone else ms kohistan , the mediator , said in an aside , they 're saying these things , but as soon as they get custody of her , they will kill her heaping on the guilt and reminding faheema of her shame , her mother said , we have two houses in ghazni , but we will sell them , because we ca n't live in ghazni anymore the mediator pleaded please talk about this in a way that this problem could be solved faheema put her head in her hands her 3yearold brother knelt on the floor with his head under his mother s long skirt as if he were trying to block out the sound of the warring grownups as it became clear that the shelter was not going to turn faheema over to her family , her mother tried offering the mediator a bribe please help us , and we will give you a gift , she said , her voice pleading , tears in her eyes then she turned , almost spitting , to faheema you know your father , you know the character of your father , she said gripping faheema , she dragged her up from the chair he will kill me you can come to my grave tomorrow finally , faheema summoned her courage why do n't you understand \? she said i already got married and then she appeared to resign herself to the future this thing i did , i did i cannot go with you , even if i lose everyone in my family , she said and added , half speaking to them and half to the mediator , i cannot go back home , because they will kill me she pried her arm away from her mother s grip and ran into the main building s basement rooms there , her mother could not reach her she was kept out , and faheema locked in , by a heavy metal gate her shoulders heaving , faheema sank to her knees and wept hopelessly the women in the longterm shelter try to cheat sleep by huddling together in the dark , their voices a way to ward off nightmares the torments they endured at the hands of their families are written on their bodies knife scars traverse their faces and necks beatings with chains mark their backs some limp from broken bones that were never properly set several have faces eroded by acid , a favorite weapon here daily life is an endless effort to escape the haunted precincts of memory images of pummeling hands , the thumping sound of wood hitting their legs , of their bodies falling to the floor , the taste of blood in their mouths there are 26 women in the longterm shelter run by women for afghan women in kabul if faheema s family continued its threats , this shelter would become her home that these women are still standing , and that some are trying to piece together complete lives , is a cause for wonder and a testament to their strength in the safety of the halfway house , the women offer a glimpse into the worlds they have fled muddy courtyards strung with laundry screaming children and squawking chickens cramped rooms for women and often not enough food women in afghanistan are the last to eat , the last to bed and the first to rise gul meena , 16 , survived a brutal attack by her brother after she fled an older husband , who had beaten her , and ran away with another man she had been just 8 or 9 in her home in kunar province on the pakistan border when a man in the next village offered money to her unemployed father for her in her innocence , she was thrilled to be given a white dress and makeup for the wedding ceremony i was thinking , this is the future , my husband would be buying me new clothes every day , she said in the car on the bumpy ride to her new home she remembers addressing her new husband as uncle uncle , please take care of me i'm afraid i will fall , she said as she bounced on his knee in the car from the moment she arrived in his house , she was a servant the only grace was that he was not allowed to have sex with her before she had her first period two years after they wed , the moment came and he forced himself on her i was like a thing and they sold me , she said he was beating me with everything near to him with his glasses , with his mobile phone , with wood , with stones , and with his hands lonely and bewildered , she tried at least twice to return to her father s house , but the family sent her back to her husband and finally she went to a neighbor s home the husband of the family ran away with her to nangarhar province in eastern afghanistan when her brother caught up with them , he slit the man s throat and slashed gul meena 15 times with an ax , nearly blinding her and leaving her for dead when she woke up in the hospital , she looked in the mirror i was very damaged , she said before , i was beautiful and young although she does not see herself that way , she is still a stunning young woman she has never gone to school but speaks with a simple eloquence now she fears that she is ugly and no one will marry her men are always interested in the beauty of a woman , she said they are never interested in the heart in the longterm shelter , most women feel a deep relief no one is beaten there is enough food chores are shared and , above all , there are choices some girls decide to go to school and try to make up for the years they were kept as virtual slaves others go to classes at beauty school in the hope of learning a skill that they will be able to use one has a job as a house cleaner , and another is a skilled tailor and makes clothes while caring for her 6yearold daughter we try to find a solution , ms naderi said , but she admitted there were few options in afghanistan it is exceedingly rare for a woman to live alone here , and so the staff tries to help women recreate families when their own have shunned them sometimes we can find husbands , she said we 've married maybe 10 or 11 , but it s difficult while traditional attitudes remain deeply ingrained , women s advocates do see changes now women are finding a voice , said soraya sobrang , a member of the afghan independent human rights commission and also they want to have some rights and have some decisionmaking if you want to marry my daughter , you have to ask me as well the men think the women want to deprive them of rights this touches their pride and this creates violence in the family the battle between tradition and a fragile new sense of women s rights continues a government committee investigated the shelters after a television program accused them of forcing battered women into prostitution the committee found that most of the shelters were well run the committee members recognized that most of the women were at risk of beatings or death if the shelters were closed or their capacities diminished , but no one wanted to defend the shelters publicly the outcome relieved the women who ran the shelters and western aid organizations the government would not close the safe houses but , at the same time , there was little public support for spending money from the afghan budget on them however , ms sobrang said the international community has promised to continue support such funding is essential if the shelters are to survive ms naderi relies on generous funding from the united states government , which accounts for close to 90 percent of her budget the balance is raised from private , mostly foreign donors the women inside the halfway house understand the risks they would face if they had to leave i cannot go anywhere alone , said mariam , 22 who escaped an abusive taliban husband and fled to the shelter everybody likes to have their freedom , but i cannot have mine in the end , faheema was able to leave the shelter , with the help of a lawyer provided by women for afghan women after four or five months , a court recognized her marriage to her husband , ajmal , and the attorney general ordered her to live with him in kabul but it is not exactly a happy ending although they are in love , they live in terror of being cornered by a member of faheema s family and being beaten or killed they live in poverty because ajmal had to shutter his shop in their hometown , ghazni , and cannot go there for fear of being killed he has no money to start a new business a thin young man who wears western clothes and , in keeping with more modern afghan ways , does not have a beard , ajmal comes across as serious and anxious we live in fear and in hiding , he said three times a day , when he goes out to buy a long loaf of afghan bread , he finds himself looking around nervously to see if any of faheema s family is lying in wait for him he worries all the time about his widowed mother and two sisters , who still live in ghazni when he had his small cosmetics shop there , he contributed to supporting the family but now , only his widowed mother s meager income as a tailor helps feed the family none of this has weakened the couple s resolve to be together , but it weighs on them because in afghanistan , to not be able to go home is to be an outcast , almost an orphan faheema tried to make peace between their two families and braved a phone call with her angry father to beg him to meet with elders from ajmal s clan but her father refused to see them and said the only thing that would satisfy him is if they gave him a daughter to marry off to his son or nephew in exchange for ajmal s taking faheema despite the hardship , faheema hopes her sisters and cousins will have the courage to demand that their families ask permission before making plans to marry them off she wishes that her father had respected her enough to ask her my message to my father is that he should ask his children first before making any decision for their lives , she said , wistfully in the cold kabul winter , as they prepared to return to their small , damp apartment , which is all they can afford , faheema said she had one more wish take us out of afghanistan , she said , because we wo n't be able to have a quiet life here
representative of wisconsin is riding high capping a sevenweek honeymoon , the 45yearold house speaker navigated the huge yearend spending and tax bills through congress without any government breakdown he has promised to set a bold conservative agenda for republicans and has the party s rightwing caucus , which made the previous speaker s life miserable , largely quiescent as prominent republicans look at the chaotic presidential race and contemplate a possible deadlocked result , mr ryan s name rolls off their lips mr ryan does n't carry the baggage of the other name that keeps coming up , mitt romney , and would be a fresher contrast to hillary clinton the ryan camp knows this is a long shot but is preparing to respond if the idea gains currency fiftythree days , however , does not make a season mr ryan has experienced the easy part big challenges loom the stage was set for the final funding bills in october by the former speaker , john a boehner , with mr ryan s full support mr boehner then stepped down , frustrated by the ruleorruin demands of the socalled freedom caucus mr ryan did negotiate the addons or riders to the basic yearend funding measure some of these , such as lifting the ban on foreign oil exports , achieved conservative goals mr ryan assuaged some critics by consulting more with rightwing members than his predecessors did but the rightwing agenda for the past several elections was to repeal and replace obamacare slash spending cut tax rates block president obama s executive actions liberalizing immigration and strengthening environmental rules and , more recently , defund planned parenthood and stop syrian refugees from entering the country none of that is in the omnibus bill , thus the headline on the website politico conservatives give ryan a pass on budget deal they despise rightwing outsiders were not as generous gop sells america down the river , thundered the website of the radio talk show host rush limbaugh when the current funding expires next september , in the midst of the general election , these rightwing politicians are less likely to give passes conversely , the white house is delighted about the endofyear deals that achieve a lot of the spending goals the administration sought and even the republicanorchestrated tax cuts included a number of major antipoverty measures , at the white house s insistence mr ryan s relations with mr obama have sometimes been testy but last week , as they were discussing the final deal on the phone , mr ryan , who has grown a beard , told the president that some on the angry right have even accused him of being a muslim the president , who has long faced the same absurd allegation , chuckled the speaker would like to secure passage of the transpacific partnership the obamabacked trade deal is opposed by many democrats but has the support of many republicans however , the senate majority leader , mitch mcconnell , wants to delay any action until after the election to protect a couple of his politically vulnerable members a few weeks ago , mr ryan set out what he called a bold mandate for house republicans a complete alternative to the left s agenda the intent is to lay out a platform for republicans , particularly the party s presidential candidate , to run on next year therein lies a huge problem two of the leading candidates for the nomination are donald j trump and senator ted cruz mr trump s posture on trade and immigration are anathema to mr ryan mr cruz is campaigning as a hardright candidate more in sync with the house s freedom caucus than with its speaker there rarely has been a congressional leader with more policy bona fides than mr ryan , and he charms much of the commentariat but it s na ve to suggest that this promises grand opportunities in this congress or the next one , even if there is a democratic president
kabul , afghanistan the unprecedented wave of attacks here three major bombings in less than 24 hours that killed at least 65 people and wounded hundreds of others was arguably a major victory for taliban forces , who proved they could mount simultaneous operations with devastating effect , including on an american military base in afghanistan , the attacks on friday were also being seen in other lights afghan security forces handled three complex emergencies almost simultaneously , proving perhaps that training of afghan forces has paid off afghan officials were quick to congratulate themselves , noting that in none of the three attacks , scattered widely around the capital , did the insurgents manage to breach their targets' inner defenses most of the victims were outside the walls , either passersby or defenders at the gates afghan officials were quick to blame the intelligence agencies of neighboring countries code for pakistan , which has long sheltered the haqqani network and given sanctuary to the taliban s leadership the insurgents carry out such attacks targeting civilians in order to attract the attention of the world , and to hide their failures on the battleground , said brig gen dawlat waziri , a spokesman for the afghan ministry of defense on the front lines they 've been defeated by the afghan national security forces , so that s why they resort to conducting suicide attacks general waziri added that 97 percent of wouldbe attacks by the insurgents are thwarted by afghan government forces before they can take place nonetheless , on friday made it not only the single deadliest day in kabul this year , but the deadliest in many years the attacks , which caused the first american military fatality since june , were also proof that even american soldiers , now here in greatly reduced numbers and on mostly a training and advising mission , are still vulnerable while the taliban s claims of hundreds of dead were almost certainly wildly inflated , the insurgents did prove that despite the infighting in their leadership they are still able to evade the heavy security cordon around kabul almost at will , and mount sophisticated , largescale attacks all three of the attacks were directed at security targets a military intelligence headquarters for the ministry of defense the kabul police academy s training facility and an american and coalition military base , camp integrity , just north of kabul s international airport the fighting there was so intense that an american soldier was killed along with eight military contractors , according to a statement from the united states military the attack on the american base took place at 10 15 pm friday , and continued for hours , with the insurgents using a suicide car bomber to blow a hole in the outer wall , allowing at least three other attackers to enter they were stopped at an inner gate by coalition soldiers and contractors the taliban were quick to take credit for the attack on camp integrity as well as the separate attack earlier in the evening on the police academy , where a suicide bomber , wearing an explosives vest under a police cadet uniform , mingled with a crowd of cadets who had returned late to the base after their weekend s leave they were waiting to be allowed to enter the heavily guarded base when the attacker detonated his vest ramin , 21 , who lives near the academy , was coming home when the bomb went off suddenly i saw a column of flame rise up from among the cadets , he said those killed were lying on the ground like slaughtered sheep in the distance , i saw a man who was wounded , he would struggle to sit and call for help , but no one got to him to help witnesses said that most of the 40 people who died were cadets an official statement put the death toll at about 40 , cadets and civilians the insurgents did not take responsibility for the third attack , a massive truck bomb that exploded at 1 am outside the headquarters of afghan military intelligence , possibly because nearly all the victims were civilians the bomb leveled rows of shops and dozens of homes , killing at least 15 and wounding 240 the attacks were vivid evidence that the insurgents' struggles with an internal succession crisis have not prevented them from carrying out largescale attacks , the taliban have been forced to admit that their founder and leader , mullah muhammad omar , was dead , and apparently had been since early 2013 shortly after , , the founder and leader of the haqqani network , the most violent wing of the taliban , had similarly died , last december , although taliban officials denied that the divisions among the taliban are mostly political , but militarily the enemies are united and they still follow the same tactics , said atiqullah amarkhel , a retired afghan general when they can successfully carry out not just a single attack , but three in one day , on strategic targets , this shows the weakness of the government they have n't learned anything in 14 years of attacks the attacks friday highlighted the weakness of the coalition government , still wrestling with internal dissension between followers of the president , ashraf ghani , and his chief executive , abdullah abdullah in the middle of a long and bitter war , the country remains without a confirmed defense minister 11 months after mr ghani and mr abdullah s inauguration mohammad osman , 55 , a former government employee , was one of many who wondered how the attackers could reach the center of the city with something as large as a truck bomb there has to be insider cooperation , or it would be difficult to get into kabul , he said the afghan government is a failed and divided government , which is why security is deteriorating in the qasaba neighborhood near camp integrity , salim , 28 , had similar doubts the area has so many bases and training facilities , as well as the international airport , that movement through it is difficult even for residents everyone in our neighborhood is concerned how could they manage to pass through several security checkpoints \? said salim , who like many afghans uses only one name mohammad shafi , 43 , who lives near the gate to camp integrity , said , yesterday s attack broke our hearts to see how helpless we are , adding , nobody feels safe anymore
since no amount of dead bodies seems enough to spur lawmakers to rein in access to guns , let s focus on the living the children gun violence leaves behind start with the little boy and girl belonging to jennifer markovsky , a 35yearold mother who was last friday during the latest mass shooting of 2015 this time , a lone gunman s of a planned parenthood clinic in colorado springs for the crime of accompanying her friend to an appointment at the clinic , ms markovsky lost her life in the most brutal and pointless , yet entirely american , manner here s a thought for lawmakers who refuse to consider any meaningful legislation to reduce the daily carnage of gun violence across america thanks to your singleminded defense of unfettered gun rights at the expense of all reason and respect for life , there is an endless supply of children to be consoled the other two victims of friday s assault , a police officer , and , an iraq war veteran also  of course , children are n't the only ones who endure this unnecessary suffering so do parents and grandparents grandchildren and nieces and nephews husbands and wives and brothers and aunts lifelong friends and beloved colleagues every life unique and irreplaceable , yet all equally defenseless in the face of a bullet but rather than taking action to address the full measure of destruction america s gun violence inflicts , many politicians appear more comfortable offering rote words of shallow sympathy to the victims' families , then jumping quickly behind distractions like the state of mentalhealth care in america was robert l dear jr , the , mentally ill \? did he oppose abortion \? or was he just extremely angry \? the truth is , the characteristics of killers may vary , but the result is always the same a massacre of the innocent , made possible by virtually unimpeded access to guns mr dear had several runins with the law and still had plenty of weapons at hand many who oppose sensible gunsafety measures point to the already in circulation and say it s too late to turn back now their chilling solution is for everyone to be armed , and ready to shoot , at all times gov john hickenlooper of colorado was right to call mass shootings even as politicians and those in congress pump up public fears at the fleeing syria , every day in america people are walking into movie theaters , restaurants , churches , grade schools and health care centers armed to the teeth , determined to take as many people out as they can this is not an intractable problem countries have dealt with mass shootings quickly and effectively with better laws as a result , and none of those laws have created the tyrannies that fuel the paranoid fantasies of some activists even in america , where the second amendment provides robust protection of gun rights , there are reforms that modestly brave politicians could pass if they wanted to , including universal background checks expanding the categories of people deemed too dangerous to have guns funding research into gun violence and instead , the rhetoric on this issue swerves between the irrational and the deranged consider a recent sampling from the leading republican presidential candidates ben carson i never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away donald trump , who once supported expanding background checks , the murders in the terrorist attacks in paris were connected to france s strict gun controls senator ted cruz suggested mr dear could be a days earlier he proudly announced of troy newman , president of the antiabortion group operation rescue , who the execution of doctors who perform abortions meanwhile , the killings go on more than once a day on average this year , mass shootings have destroyed lives and families president obama on saturday said this endless ritual of murder is but that is precisely the problem in america , it has become all too normal
for more than five years now , as western terrorism investigators have searched for critical influences behind the latest jihadist plot , one name has surfaced again and again in the failed attack on an airliner over detroit in 2009 , the stabbing of a british member of parliament in london in 2010 , the lethal bombing of the in 2013 and now the machinegunning of cartoonists and police officers in paris , has proved to be a sinister and durable inspiration two of those four attacks took place after mr awlaki , the silvertongued , americanborn imam who joined al qaeda s branch in , was killed by a cia drone strike in september 2011 in the age of youtube , mr awlaki s death or martyrdom , in the view of his followers has hardly reduced his impact the internet magazine inspire , which he oversaw along with another american , samir khan , has continued to spread not just militant rhetoric but also practical instructions on shooting and bombmaking in effect , mr awlaki has become a leading brand name in the world of armed jihad he operated mainly in english , the language of global commerce , and has helped attract a diverse group of volunteers the four attacks were carried out by a nigerian banker s son , a british college student , two chechen immigrants to massachusetts and two frenchmen of algerian background his pronouncements continue to provide a supposed religious rationale for thuggish acts vehemently denounced by the overwhelming majority of muslims and islamic authorities mr awlaki also became the face in the west of , or aqap , as it is widely known against the odds , the group , which was formally created in early 2009 by yemeni and saudi militants , has supplanted al qaeda s old core in pakistan as the terrorist organization most feared by the united states and now , perhaps , by europe as well since it split with al qaeda a year ago , the islamic state , also known as isis or isil , has seized the international spotlight , first with territorial gains and more recently with beheadings of journalists and other hostages but if aqap was behind the machinegunning in paris of cartoonists and editors at the satirical newspaper charlie hebdo , then al qaeda may have regained the publicity advantage in its rancorous rivalry with its offshoot the evidence that yemen s al qaeda branch , and the late mr awlaki , had a role in preparations for the paris assault has accumulated steadily since wednesday s shootings the two gunmen , identified by the french police as the brothers sa d and ch rif kouachi , seemed determined to attach the aqapawlaki label to their shooting spree an eyewitness heard the brothers yell to passersby at the shooting scene to tell the media that this is al qaeda in yemen they reportedly told the driver of a car they hijacked that their attack was in revenge for mr awlaki s death intelligence officials and eyewitnesses said the older brother , sa d kouachi , 34 , had spent time in yemen between 2009 and 2012 , getting firearms training from the qaeda branch and , according to some reports , meeting with mr awlaki according to a yemeni journalist , mohamed alkibsi , sa d kouachi roomed briefly in the yemeni capital , sana , with umar farouk abdulmutallab , who tried to blow up an airliner over detroit on christmas day in 2009 with explosives hidden in his underwear mr abdulmutallab , who is now serving a life sentence in federal prison , told the fbi that his plot was approved and partly directed by mr awlaki and ch rif kouachi , 32 , in a brief telephone interview with a french television reporter before he was killed with his brother on friday , firmly associated the attack with aqap and its former propagandist i , ch rif kouachi , was sent by al qaeda in yemen , the younger mr kouachi said in audio later broadcast by the bfmtv channel in france i went there , and it was sheikh anwar alawlaki who financed me fran ois molins , the paris prosecutor , said at a news conference later that day that ch rif kouachi had visited yemen in 2011 also on friday , a member of aqap s media committee sent journalists a statement explicitly claiming responsibility for the brothers' attack the leadership of aqap directed the operation , and they have chosen their target carefully as revenge for the honor of the prophet , the statement said another aqap leader who regular speaks for the organization , harith alnadari , issued an audio statement praising the attack , though he did not claim explicitly that the group was behind it none of the statements explained why the brothers had allowed nearly three years to pass after their return from yemen before they attacked the newspaper awlaki s name still pops up pretty often in cases of western radicals , but given the amount of time since his death , it is unusual to see a case where the suspects actually met him , said j m berger , a with the brookings institution s project on american relations with the islamic world who has studied mr awlaki it reflects the long lead time on this plot we may never know if this attack was formulated back then , or if the targets or particulars changed over time mr awlaki was born in new mexico in 1971 while his yemeni father was a graduate student , went with his family to yemen at the age of 7 and returned to the united states at 19 to study engineering at colorado state university he discovered a knack for preaching and spent eight years as a highly successful imam at mosques in denver , san diego and washington , where he preached at the capitol and was a luncheon speaker at the pentagon he came under fbi scrutiny briefly in 1999 for contacts with known militants , and again in 2002 when agents discovered that three of the sept 11 , 2001 , hijackers had worshiped in his mosques the national sept 11 commission raised the possibility that mr awlaki was part of a support network for the hijackers , but the fbi concluded that he had no prior knowledge of the plot in 2002 , mr awlaki moved to london , where he became a popular speaker and flirted more openly with militancy after moving to yemen in 2004 , he began to espouse violent jihad against the united states and other countries he labeled enemies of islam by 2009 , when mr awlaki was linked to maj nidal hasan , the army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in a shooting at fort hood , tex , the fbi , as well as the authorities in canada and britain , found that the cleric s calls for violence were turning up on the laptops of nearly everyone they charged with plotting jihadist attacks his website and facebook page had attracted a large following across the englishspeaking world , and scores of foreigners traveled to yemen to meet him awlaki was a huge magnet , said morten storm , a danish man who visited the cleric in yemen , first as a convinced militant , and later , after growing disillusioned with islam , as an agent of danish , british and american intelligence agencies mr storm said the leader of aqap , nasir alwuhayshi , a former secretary to osama bin laden who now is the secondranking figure in the global qaeda network , remained a revered figure among jihadists if you want oldschool al qaeda , the place to go is still yemen , mr storm said in a telephone interview in the case of major hasan , who asked his views on the religious justification for killing american soldiers , mr awlaki declined to answer directly , sending two noncommittal replies but by late 2009 , the cleric had joined aqap and was helping to prepare mr abdulmutallab for his airliner attack after the underwear bomb fizzled , president obama , judging that the cleric was now an operational terrorist , sought and received a justice department legal opinion declaring that killing him without a trial , despite his american citizenship , would violate neither the law nor the constitution during a 17month manhunt , mr awlaki called for the murder of cartoonists who insulted the prophet muhammad and helped aqap send bombs in printer cartridges to the united states on cargo planes a saudi tip foiled the plan but the cleric s followers kept getting arrested , including roshonara choudhry , who said , after listening to more than 100 hours of mr awlaki s lectures , that she had stabbed a member of parliament who had voted in favor of the iraq war the drone strike that killed mr awlaki also killed samir khan and two other qaeda operatives , and two weeks later , another american strike killed mr awlaki s 16yearold son , infuriating many yemenis obama administration officials have said the son , abdulrahman alawlaki , also an american citizen , was not the intended target of the strike by then , in the fall of 2011 , chaos in the wake of the ouster of yemen s longtime ruler , ali abdullah saleh , had allowed al qaeda to seize large swaths of territory in the country s south in 2012 , yemeni forces , and american drones strikes , drove aqap out of the towns it had captured but in recent months , as a shiite militia known as the houthis seized power in sana and elsewhere across yemen , aqap has gained strength by rallying sunni tribesmen against the houthis the growing violence , including numerous aqap bombings , underscores the failure of yemeni and american efforts , including the drone campaign , to dismantle the group american officials had hoped that the deaths of mr awlaki and mr khan , who were viewed as part of an aqap cell focused on attacking the united states and europe , would curb the group s ambitions but aqap attempted a second underwear bombing of an airliner in 2012 it was foiled because the wouldbe bomber was an infiltrator sent by saudi and western intelligence agencies in april 2013 , investigators found that the two tsarnaev brothers , the chechens accused in the boston marathon bombing , had been deeply influenced by mr awlaki and had gotten their bombmaking directions from inspire magazine the killings of aqap s main englishlanguage propagandists did not slow down its robust media production in fact , aqap englishlanguage videos and audio messages at a far faster rate in 2013 and 2014 than in earlier years , according to intelcenter , a company that tracks jihadist media inspire magazine has continued to appear , and a 2013 issue called for the killing of charlie hebdo s editor , st phane charbonnier , among others the kouachi brothers sought out mr charbonnier by name when they invaded the newspaper , and he was among the first to be killed meanwhile , mr awlaki s voluminous work retains a huge following on youtube and islamic sites most of the tens of thousands of awlaki videos on youtube feature his earlier , less controversial talks , which made him a bestseller on cd but his later calls for attacks on america can also be found on the site without difficulty according to the company , youtube prohibits material intended to incite violence , and it is removed when flagged by the site s users and reviewed by the company s paid staff some 14 million videos that violated youtube s rules were taken down in 2014 but company officials have wrestled with the freespeech implications of censoring material that may have news value or shed light on an important phenomenon like islamist radicalism the graphic footage of the kouachi brothers gunning down a french police officer , for instance , may technically violate youtube s standards but has been played on television around the world youtube has clear policies prohibiting violent content or content intended to incite violence , the company said , and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users we also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization mr berger , the brookings fellow , said that while there had been a shift in online attention among jihadists from clerics to fighters , most of awlaki s work is carefully constructed to be evergreen it does n't become dated it will continue to be important for years , he added

todd bowles had at least six interviews for head coaching jobs over the past five years after each interview and rejection , he called an adviser to report who had been present , what questions had been asked , how long the interview had lasted and how he had performed mr bowles was operating under an nfl diversity program that requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate when searching for a new head coach and requires that those interviews be conducted in good faith and to the same standards as those for other candidates on wednesday , when mr bowles , 51 , is introduced as ' coach , his long journey to the position will be the latest demonstration of the program , established under a regulation known as the rooney rule the policy has been much admired , much emulated and much studied some , however , worry that it is merely tokenism in a league that is dominated by black players but has relatively few members of minority groups in leadership positions charles ogletree , a professor at harvard university s law school and the founder of the charles hamilton houston institute for race and justice , embraces the rule but he said that it had not corrected the wide disparity between the numbers of black players and black coaches there is a big difference between interviewing and hiring , professor ogletree said there has just been too little effort in that regard there needs to be more hiring in a significant way , and not just because they are black , but because they are talented and do well when they get those jobs there is no acceptable reason for this underrepresentation there were two black coaches in the nfl in 2001 after the rooney rule was enacted , in 2003 , the number increased to a high of seven in 2006 , later matched in 2011 there are currently six head coaches who have minority backgrounds , including one , ron rivera of the carolina panthers , who is of puerto rican and mexican descent the others , along with mr bowles , are marvin lewis of the cincinnati bengals , jim caldwell of the detroit lions , mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers and lovie smith of the tampa bay buccaneers among the league s hundreds of assistant coaches , 16 percent were members of minority groups in 1991 that proportion increased to 36 percent in 2007 and 29 percent in 2013 mr bowles gives the nfl a net increase of one nonwhite head coach over last season , in a league where 67 percent of the players were africanamerican in 2013 , according to data published by the institute for diversity and ethics in sport i think the rule is working well , and there are ways to reinforce it , said jeremi duru , a law professor at american university in washington who worked on the rule for the fritz pollard alliance foundation , a group that monitors the league s minority hiring practices and i think you also see that over time , the culture of the league has changed a bit for much of its history , the nfl floundered with diversity hiring in leadership positions , despite the legacy of fritz pollard , an africanamerican who in 1921 broke ground as the head coach of the akron pros of the american professional football league a year later , the league changed its name to the national football league it was almost seven decades before the los angeles raiders hired art shell as the league s second africanamerican coach , in 1989 but other seemingly strong coaching candidates , like tony dungy , were routinely passed over john wooten , a former player and executive in the nfl and now the chairman of the fritz pollard alliance , said he had finally found an ally in paul tagliabue , the commissioner from 1989 to 2006 first , tagliabue merely asked teams to interview members of minority groups that approach did not work well when herman edwards was an assistant coach with the kansas city chiefs in the early 1990s , his fellow assistant mr dungy was thought to be headcoach material but he and mr edwards would lament the seemingly meaningless interviews that mr dungy was given perfunctory phone calls , for the most part , that would later be leaked to the news media so teams could claim they had interviewed a minority candidate mr edwards , who said he was named the jets' head coach in 2001 because the owner woody johnson had heard him speak at owners' meetings , said he liked the intent of the rooney rule but he cautioned that repeated interviews without a job offer could create a stigma other teams , he said , might wonder , why is n't anyone hiring this guy \? that s what happened with tony , mr edwards said about mr dungy he would tell me herm , i got a call asking if i would be interested i'm reading about it in the paper , but i never heard back from the them' eventually , mr dungy was hired by the buccaneers in 1996 , and was then fired after his third consecutive winning season in 2001 he later won the super bowl as the indianapolis colts' head coach the same year , dennis green was fired by the minnesota vikings after his first losing season in 10 years after those two dismissals , the lawyers johnnie cochran and cyrus mehri issued a report criticizing the lack of diversity in the league s coaching ranks and threatened a lawsuit mr mehri had won large settlements in discrimination cases against texaco in 1996 and cocacola in 2000 those settlements created outside task forces to monitor and make suggestions about hiring practices and pay scales at the companies precursors to the rooney rule but according to kenneth shropshire , the director of the wharton sports business initiative at the university of pennsylvania , the nfl did not copy its rule from the corporate world if anything , it is the other way around , mr shropshire said some business are looking at adopting similar rules in july , robert l johnson , the founder of black entertainment television , supported the passage of senate resolution 511 , introduced by tim scott , republican of south carolina the resolution follows mr johnson s socalled rlj rule , which asks companies to voluntarily interview at least two minority candidates for managerial jobs the bill cites the rooney rule in its opening sentence in 2002 , within a month of mr cochran and mr mehri s report , mr tagliabue appointed a diversity committee , headed by dan rooney , the steelers' chairman professor duru said the rule included procedural standards mandating that interviews be conducted at the same location as those for other candidates and for the same length of time and that they be conducted with people of the same rank it also specified fines for lack of compliance the nfl and the pollard alliance monitor the process , and professor duru said that after a 200 , 000 fine was levied on the lions when they hired steve mariucci in 2003 without interviewing anyone else , there had been no further violations the league has also expanded the rule to apply to general managers \( the jets interviewed their own frontoffice assistant , rod graves , before hiring mike maccagnan as general manager \) there are seven minority general managers in the nfl but in a sobering reversal in 2013 , the league went 0 for 15 no minority candidates were hired for any of eight coaching vacancies or seven general manager positions after that , the league introduced an advisory committee to help identify candidates and bolstered a training program to help candidates of all backgrounds move up the ladder , efforts applauded by the pollard alliance mr bowles , who grew up in elizabeth , nj , played in the nfl from 1986 to 1993 and started as an assistant coach at morehouse college in atlanta in 1997 he eventually ascended to the nfl , where he held several assistant positions , including one in dallas with bill parcells , who has urged teams to hire mr bowles as a head coach i think he 'll do very well , mr parcells said now , he s not playing solitaire out there he needs the full support of the organization to succeed in 2013 , mr bowles joined the arizona cardinals as defensive coordinator before the latest hiring period , mr bowles was a candidate with the kansas city chiefs , the lions , the denver broncos , the oakland raiders and twice the miami dolphins none of those interviews led to jobs it was frustrating , sure , said mr wooten , the adviser who debriefed mr bowles after interviews for all of us but over all , the process has to help him after the last round , we talked about making some changes in his approach , and to his credit , he did he told me after his first interview with the jets , he nailed it attempts to reach mr bowles through his agent were unsuccessful mr wooten acknowledged that some interviews might be token efforts , but he said the experience candidates gained even in those could be invaluable robert gulliver , the league s chief of human resources , has worked with mr wooten to supplement the rule with the advisory board and the training program he lauded the effectiveness of those efforts but added that the rule had not guaranteed that mr bowles would be hired he got the job due to his own merits , mr gulliver said of the seven head coaching vacancies this year , six have been filled , and mr bowles is the only minority to have been hired , leaving the nfl with a total of 19 percent of head coaches who are from minority backgrounds for some , that is not enough others say they believe mr bowles represents what the rooney rule was designed to do i am not an affirmativeaction guy , mr wooten said i do n't believe 70 percent of the coaches should be black , or any percentage i believe the best man should get the job , and for years , that was n't always true in this case , it is the hope is that one day

louisville , ky the hardest job at knights hall on tuesday morning belonged to the student managers who were charting the points the was engaged in one of its more familiar segments of practice , a twominute drill that featured players running and passing and shooting from different areas of the court 3pointers , bank shots and layups coach scott davenport considers a final score of 90 to be respectable the goal with his roster this season is 120 on tuesday , the knights seldom missed no surprise given the program s reputation for having the most adept shooters in division ii the buzzer sounded 142 might be the highest total ever , the assistant coach michael scott said bellarmine , which is ranked no 2 and no 4 in , fell to 122 on thursday after losing to no 3 the knights were shooting 511 percent ahead of the game and have ranked among the top 10 in fieldgoal percentage in each of the past seven seasons last season , bellarmine led division ii by shooting 529 percent a figure better than the one compiled by the miami heat , who led the nba at 501 percent and after shooting 739 percent last season to lead all division ii players , the senior forward jake thelen again ranks among the top five at 683 percent whenever we shoot , thelen said , we all feel like it s going down yet the secret to the knights' torrid shooting their willingness to pass might come as a surprise the mentality of everyone on the floor is , i may have a good shot , but there s always a chance to get a better one for someone else , the junior forward george suggs said bellarmine shoots well because the players take highpercentage shots thelen , who was averaging a teamleading 178 points through wednesday , relies on a diet of crafty layups the knights are allergic to contested jumpers during games , members of davenport s staff track insideout passes and ball reversals every player thinks they 're passing , davenport said , but it helps to show them what s really happening davenport , 58 , who claims to have never had a sip of coffee , nonetheless emits a low hum wherever he goes those who have been around him for a while tend to hear him in their sleep he does not lack energy , and he makes sure to indoctrinate players who are new to his system for the first month of practice each season , every shot davenport s team takes is a bad shot or at least that is what he tells his players it could be an open 3pointer it could be an easy 10footer it makes no difference if only his players had continued to move the ball , he says , they would have gotten an even better look at the basket it is often nonsense , of course many of the shots were terrific shots , and davenport would be pleased to see his players attempt them in games but he wants to send an early message to value ball movement above all passing is a lost art , davenport said it s never taught but do n't get me started i sound like the old man yelling , get off my grass ! ' davenport is easy with words rather than use a whistle at practice he has never worn one he exercises his vocal cords away from the court , he sometimes tells stories about himself telling stories they begin like , coach pitino and i were jogging on treadmills at the final four in 2005 and i was telling him how and then you might as well get comfortable he might talk about growing up in louisville and going to freedom hall for the first time at age 10 and collecting autographs from all of the players or keeping a daily basketball diary as a teenager and jotting down everything he had done in practice or taking a date to a basketball game when he was a high school senior \( his coach , who was also present , spent the evening passing him notes about strategy his date was not amused it was oneanddone , davenport recalled \) but there is more , because there is always more about coaching allan houston at louisville s ballard high school about his time under denny crum and rick pitino as a longtime assistant at louisville about leaving louisville for bellarmine in 2005 and pitino asking him to stay the ultimate compliment about how his two best friends from elementary school attend every home game about inviting archbishop joseph e kurtz of louisville to visit with his players but only before big games davenport tends to wax most nostalgic about his family as well as winning the division ii national title in 2011 and being attached to his players he hates to see his seniors go i could cry at a grocery store closing , he said davenport said his basketball philosophy was rooted in a book he first read when he was 13 years old the open man the championship diary of the ny knicks , by dave debusschere the book chronicled the 196970 season and celebrated the team s selfless style of play davenport has a dogeared copy somewhere at home i honestly think that book is why we pass so much , he said every kid should read that book davenport has his team practice the same things every day the same cuts , the same fiveman passing drills , the same emphasis on the same basics the challenge , he said , is concocting new practice plans so that the material feels fresh to the players otherwise it s just monotonous , he said but really , it s all the same a bit of a basketball hoarder , davenport has kept all of his practice plans for the past 30 seasons some of the rubber bands have rotted he sticks with what works bellarmine s offense produces an inordinate number of backdoor layups davenport tells his players who run the baseline to watch their defenders' heads if a defender turns to locate the ball along the perimeter , it operates as an instant cue for the offensive player to cut to the basket none of this is to suggest that the players do not hone their shooting stroke , because they do like pitino , davenport devises individual workouts for his players for 30 to 45 minutes three times a week , each player receives tailored instruction from the coaching staff corbin maynard , a senior guard , recalled how he had a slight hitch in his shot as a freshman for 10 straight sessions , the coaches filmed him and effectively drilled the bad habit out of him coach s big thing is , do n't be a lazy shooter , maynard said always be ready step into your shot i 've probably heard that hundreds of times thelen estimated that he takes 1 , 000 shots a week during the season and nearly 600 a day during the summer , when the players live in dormitories and work as counselors at the university s basketball camps they augment their offseason work by playing pickup games with players from louisville for thelen , that meant regular matchups last summer with louisville s montrezl harrell , a 6foot8 forward who offered stiff competition maynard said , a lot of teams do n't have that advantage the team also has a sponsorship deal with trumoo chocolate milk , which davenport described as the latest craze in energy replacement drinks given bellarmine s throwback style , the milk deal seems appropriate the players treat it like liquid gold , davenport said at practice this week , davenport watched his team s oldfashioned fundamentals at work passing , cutting , shooting he noticed everything , even the occasional miscue get a stick and kill that thing ! he shouted when a player lost control of the ball each drill led to the next two hours went fast that , davenport said , is when you know you love your team
san francisco a man bleeds profusely from a leg shattered by a missile he drags himself slowly across a field until he dies in the dirt these images from heather linebaugh s dreams play back endlessly , even in her waking hours cian westmoreland dreams of dozens of children staring at the sky in terror and brandon bryant writes poems about soldiers dying in a sea of blood , their bodies imagined in the grainy infrared imagery of military operations i interviewed all three young air force veterans in order to gain a greater understanding of the costs of the white house s secretive operations as public support for foreign wars has fallen , following yearslong occupations of afghanistan and iraq , the obama administration has favored this form of remotecontrol warfare in the president s first five years in office , the made 330 drone strikes in pakistan alone , compared with 51 strikes in four years of george w bush s presidency the rationale for weaponized drones was twofold the powerful

nevada desert , keeping american personnel  neither assumption was correct the issue of drones' civilian body count is well documented the cia , in classified submissions to congress , claims civilian death rates typically in the single digits per year , senator dianne feinstein in 2013 , who then chaired the senate intelligence committee independent sources differ sharply from the official account in in pakistan , somalia and yemen recorded by the bureau of investigative journalism , as many as 1 , 128 civilians , including 225 children , were killed 22 percent of deaths the new america foundation s are lower , but suggest a civilian death rate of about 10 percent the drone wars are also taking a toll at home air force psychological studies have found widespread stress among pilots , analysts and operators what we see are elevated rates of emotional exhaustion and distress , said dr wayne chappelle at the school of aerospace medicine at wrightpatterson air force base in ohio the air force recently announced that graduate from training each year , while some of the 1 , 260 pilots currently working expected not to continue once their sixyear expire soon after the government accountability office that only about onethird of drone pilots in a sample had completed their full training before being pressed into service , the pentagon reluctantly cut back on combat air patrols until it could find more pilots pilots are only part of the story as many as people , from military lawyers and commanders to private contractors from and , are required to maintain each patrol of three to four predator or reaper drones around the clock many technicians who review footage and other data are employed soon after high school , with less than a year of training none of the veterans

humantechnology interactions in the military the air force is providing psychological support for drone personnel , but this interim solution seems unlikely to be adequate we can say we see children and we think you should n't do it but it is n't up to us , one former analyst , who asked to remain anonymous , told me we are completely outranked , and at the very bottom of the food chain stories of the psychological trauma suffered by lowerranked air force personnel are starting to emerge veterans like mr bryant , ms linebaugh and mr westmoreland have attested in documentaries and the media to deepseated flaws they 've observed in drone warfare we need far greater transparency about the targeted killing operations from the glimpses we have seen , we know there have been tragic failures in 2011 , a of a drone strike , obtained under the freedom of information act by the los angeles times , revealed widespread among imagery analysts in florida , pilots in nevada and the missile operators on kiowa helicopters in afghanistan , resulting in the killing of some two dozen innocent civilians with no terrorist connections in 1971 , in the wake of the my lai vietnam massacre , vietnam veterans against the war held a series of hearings in detroit called the the purpose was not to scapegoat anyone , but to gather testimony on military policies and war crimes from those who experienced the atrocity firsthand we need a similar forum today for a full accounting of the impact of america s drone wars , at home and abroad , our representatives in congress must hear directly from the veterans
i ve found myself wondering lately which of my patients were lucky enough as children to play hideandseek with their parents when it s played as it s meant to be , it s such a delightful game kids ask to play it , though , only when they re confident that they ll be found in that way , it s a bit like psychotherapy only when patients feel hopeful that their experiences and feelings will be understood does the work begin in earnest we all need to hide sometimes we need to go into the private space of our mind and take measure of our thoughts we need to enter this space so we can reflect and then , having done so , we long to be discovered by someone who s looking , someone who really wants to find us if we never have our feelings known and accepted by the people who are important to us , then hiding is no game it s a way of life it is joy to be hidden , the pediatrician and psychoanalyst dw winnicott once wrote , but disaster not to be found early in my training as a psychologist , i worked with a 4yearold girl for whom hiding was a way of life that girl , sandra , was selectively mute she spoke on occasion inside her home , but never in public after years in which no one had come looking for her , she had gone into a deep and desperate hiding in our first session , sandra and i met with her mother in a room full of toys the mother was a small woman in her mid30s whose dark hair , pulled back in a ponytail , set off an angry and anxious face the pair sat down at a long table , and the mother turned away from both of us i brought over some toys fuzzy hand puppets and a basket of plastic fruit no one moved after a minute , i put a dog puppet on my hand and started feeding it a plastic banana , narrating all the while yum , yum , yum boy , that tastes good i glanced at sandra she was intrigued i glanced at her mother she was still looking away after watching me play and narrate for a few minutes , sandra picked up a plastic apple and began bouncing it on the table i made percussion noises in time with the bounces badum , badum , badum sandra looked at me and smiled she bounced the apple faster i kept time she threw the apple into the basket it landed with a thud kaboom , i said she was really smiling now i glanced again at her mother she looked crestfallen sandra grabbed the puppet off my hand and smashed it on the table i spoke the part of the wounded puppet ouch yowie zowie oh , boy , that hurt sandra grinned widely then she got up from the table , walked to another part of the room and silently called me to join her with a curl of her tiny index finger i arrived at her side she pointed to a basket high on a shelf and asked , in perfectly articulated english , as if speaking were the simplest thing in the world and she did it all the time , what s in that \? i took down the basket and we explored its contents we continued playing , both of us speaking now , until the hour ended i was sorry it was over i squatted down and told her so , adding that i was looking forward to playing with her again next week when i straightened up and turned toward her mother , i was alarmed to see that her mother s face was fixed in a tight , angry expression she gestured to the room , strewn with toys from an hour of play , and said to her daughter in disgust , look at the mess you ve made ! i haven t seen sandra in many years she would be a woman now when i think of the little girl she was , my heart breaks not only did her mother fail to look for her , but when sandra did venture from her hiding place , she was also intensely shamed all those feelings sandra and i played with during that first session the hunger of need , the joy of connection , the excitement of curiosity , the thrill of anger were denied by her mother , who condemned her daughter for having them look at the mess you ve made ! soon after this session , i began working with sandra s mother in her own therapy i continued to work separately with sandra , too , but my hope was that the work with the mother would help them both in meeting with the mother , i learned , not surprisingly , about how she herself had never been found as a child because no one had come looking she passed it down like a genetic trait i m sure it could be traced to sandra s grandparents as well , and to their parents before them none of these people was a villain if there s one thing i ve learned in my years as a therapist , it s that there are no villains rather , there are generations upon generations of hurt people who cause others pain because it s the only way they know how to communicate their own by turning away from sandra , by failing to engage with her , by shaming her , sandra s mother showed her daughter what her own disaster felt like strange to think that mother and daughter shared that feeling , because it seemed to be all they did share i no longer work with children , but i m so glad i did the years i spent engaging with them in play has taught me much about therapy with adults it has helped me understand what allows for or prevents a playful engagement in treatment with my grown up patients what i mean by a playful engagement is a steppingback from one s own tightly held perspective so as to fool around with other ways of looking at things when we engage in this way , my patients and i formulate ideas that are rich with meaning , but we hold them lightly , because we re ready to build on them , reshape them or even let them go , just as a tower of blocks might be transformed into a rocket ship or happily demolished to make way for something new play is not always an easy thing to master first we have to be met where we are , and understood well enough , by someone who s interested and engaged i think that s what i did for sandra when i made percussion noises in time with her bouncing apple , and again when i acknowledged her anger when she smashed the puppet i can t say i planned it that way rather , it just felt natural to narrate what was going on in doing so , i gave voice to some of her feelings i found her or at least some aspects of her and i showed her that her feelings weren t shameful not to me at least after she saw this , sandra could begin to play in earnest in broad outline , i think this is what happens in therapy with my adult patients , too at least when all goes well and when it does , i am left moved and enriched by the chance to playfully seek to discover , along with them , who it is they are details have been altered to protect patient privacy is a psychologist in private practice in new york
let s see , america is prepositioning battle tanks with our east european nato allies to counterbalance russia us and russian military planes recently flew within 10 feet of each other russia is building a new generation of longrange ballistic missiles and the us and china are jostling in the south china sea did someone restart the cold war while i was looking the other way \? if so , this time it seems like the cold war without the fun that is , without james bond , smersh , get smart agent 86 s shoe phone , nikita khrushchev s shoebanging , a race to the moon or a debate between american and soviet leaders over whose country has the best kitchen appliances and i do n't think we 're going to see president obama in kiev declaring , la president kennedy , ich bin ein ukrainian also , the lingo of our day reset with russia or pivot to asia has none of the gravitas of drum roll , please d tente no , this postpostcold war has more of a wwe world wrestling entertainment feel to it , and i do n't just mean president vladimir putin of russia s riding horses barechested , although that is an apt metaphor it s just a raw jostling for power for power s sake not a clash of influential ideas but rather of spheres of influence you cross that line , i punch your nose why \? because i said so you got a problem with that \? yes , let me show you my drone you got a problem with not at all my cyber guys stole the guidance system last week from northrop grumman you got a problem with  the cold war had a beginning , an end and even a closing curtain , with the fall of the berlin wall but the postpostcold war has brought us full circle back to the precold war and the game of nations there was a moment when it seemed as though it would all be otherwise when it seemed that arabs and israelis would make peace , that china would evolve into a more consensual political system and that russia would become part of europe and the g8 that was a lifetime ago now western reporters struggle to get visas to china , no american businessman with a brain takes his laptop to beijing , chinese hackers have more of your personal data now than linkedin , russia is still intent on becoming part of europe by annexing a piece here and a piece there and the g8 is now the g15 \( america and germany \) when did it all go sour \? we fired the first shot when we expanded nato toward the russian border even though the soviet union had disappeared message to moscow you are always an enemy , no matter what system you have when oil prices recovered , putin sought his revenge for this humiliation , but now he s just using the nato threat to justify the militarization of russian society so he and his fellow kleptocrats can stay in power and paint their opponents as lackeys of the west nato s toppling of the libyan leader muammar elqaddafi , the arab spring and the moscow street protests that followed rattled putin , said sergei guriev , the noted russian economist now based in paris putin understood that he lost the russian middle class and so he started to look for legitimacy somewhere else in hypernationalism and antiamericanism but guriev makes an important point if not for the western sanctions on russia , east ukraine would already have been part of russia today , he said , adding that there is nothing putin fears more than ukraine succeeding in diminishing corruption and building a modern economy that would be everything putin s russia is not guriev is worried , though , that the antiwestern propaganda putin has been pumping into the veins of the russian public will have a lasting effect and make his successor even worse either way , russia will be a big challenge for your next president the chinese leadership is not as dumb or desperate as putin and needs access to us markets more so , for now , china s leaders still behave with some restraint in asserting their claims in the south china sea but the fact is , as the asia expert andrew browne the uschina relationship has lost its strategic raison d' tre the soviet union , the common threat that brought the two countries together they have not forged a new one , like being comanagers of global stability in short , the attraction of the us economy and the bite of us sanctions are more vital than ever in managing the postpostcold war game of nations , including bringing iran to nuclear talks we may be back to traditional geopolitics , but it s in a much more interdependent world , where our economic clout is still a source of restraint on moscow and beijing putin does n't disguise his military involvement in ukraine for nothing he s afraid of more us banking sanctions china does n't circumscribe its behavior in the south china sea for nothing it ca n't grow without exporting to america it s not just our guns it s our butter it s why we should be expanding usshaped freetrade deals with asia and europe , and it s why the most important source of stability in the world today is the health of the us economy we can walk softly only as long as we carry a big stick and a big wallet
gaza city for much of the past year , has sat in frustrated isolation as it struggled to recover from a devastating war with but for the people of the battered coastal enclave , the past week brought some welcome signs of relief first , opened its border crossing , allowing thousands of to exit gaza after being penned in for months then , egypt allowed in 8 , 000 tons of cement , a fraction of what the territory needs to rebuild but the move suggested a thaw in relations between the egyptian government and , the group that governs gaza meanwhile , news has been emerging that hamas has begun quiet negotiations with israel via intermediaries to extend a truce and to ease the tight restrictions on the territory the shifts underscore how far hamas has staked out its own path , bypassing its reliance on the government in ramallah , the administrative center of the west bank , for money and reconstruction and they came as the ramallah government , which has been rived by infighting , appeared close to collapse but while hamas appears to be striking out on its own , partly in response to what it sees as intransigence by its rivals in ramallah , there are concerns that its recent moves might undermine palestinian unity and compromise the campaign for an independent state there is some fear that we will have a separate state in gaza , said sameer abumdallala , an economics lecturer at in gaza this is dangerous to the national palestinian project gaza , a tiny territory that lies between israel and egypt s sinai desert , has been governed by hamas for nine years , the product of an enduring political rift among palestinians the rules communities in the israelioccupied west bank , in a government headed by , also the leader of the fatah party since driving out fatah in 2007 , in a civil war that followed an attempt at a unity government after hamas won the 2006 palestinian legislative elections many palestinians view healing the rift and the formation of a unity government as the key to harnessing the energy of both parties and eventually achieving a palestinian state but neither hamas nor fatah has been willing to loosen its grip on territory , despite years of pledges to seek reconciliation a consensus government , with officials approved by both hamas and fatah , was set up last july under prime minister rami hamdallah as a part of a broader reconciliation attempt but mr hamdallah s government was never able to assert itself in gaza or lead a reconstruction effort there the government is blamed , as are mr abbas and hamas , for the destruction that still pocks gaza , and the high unemployment and poverty this week , officials said mr hamdallah had appeared to tender his resignation to mr abbas but after negotiations , it appears that mr hamdallah s government will continue until officials can agree on the formation of a new one it is unclear whether it would be composed of technocrats , fatah loyalists and their allies , or hamas supporters it is clear that the division is widening and deepening instead of narrowing or lessening , read a recent editorial in , a palestinian daily , in response to the week s events mousa abu marzouk , a hamas leader , has met four times in the past two months with egyptian intelligence officials to try to repair relations with egypt , according to ahmed yousef , an adviser to the leader of hamas in gaza , ismail haniyeh hamas has been aligned with the muslim brotherhood , which briefly held power in egypt until mid2013 , when the military seized control the new egyptian government set out to punish hamas , which it accused of offering a haven to militants carrying out attacks in egypt , and shut the main crossing into gaza before this week , it had been opened only five times this year , for brief periods egypt has also blocked the hundreds of tunnels that once crisscrossed the border , which were used to bring goods into gaza that israel had tightly restricted the , which levied taxes on the trade , hampering its ability to pay government employees in gaza for months hamas officials said they had reassured egypt that the organization was not offering sanctuary to islamic extremists seeking to end the rule of president abdel fattah elsisi hamas officials said the meetings had helped improve relations the border crossing was meant to open for three days , they said , but stayed open for a week the cement was also a goodwill gesture , they added perhaps it means there is a fundamental change with their relations with gaza , said mr yousef , the adviser , speaking of egypt we are on the brink of an explosion here it will blow up either in gaza or on the border because of the pressure , he said the border is a safety valve that releases the pressure on gaza egyptian officials , for their part , said that policy toward hamas in gaza had not changed hamas s drift away from its palestinian rivals has been bolstered by qatar , which has long been sympathetic to conservative islamic governments in april , qatar began shipping in reconstruction materials , although it was unclear when actual building would commence it plans to rebuild 1 , 000 demolished apartments and repair the two main roads that run gaza s 25mile length the materials were being transported through israel , which appeared to be reluctantly shoring up the hamas government , seeing it as a lesser evil than hardline militants , loyal to the islamic state , who now are trying to assert power in gaza israel was alleviating the crisis in gaza by allowing in more materials so as to brace hamas s rule , said ofer zalzberg of the international crisis group hamas is still viewed as an enemy , he said , but one that israel finds more useful to help than defeat a spokesman for the israeli agency that handles palestinian civil affairs said that about 11 million tons of reconstruction materials had been allowed to pass into gaza from israel since september , but he did not provide further details negotiations between israel and hamas , facilitated by european and arab mediators , have also begun , according to a hamas official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter s sensitivity the negotiations have been widely reported , however , in hebrew and arabic news media the hamas official said it was unclear if the talks , which have focused on the extending the truce in exchange for loosening the restrictions on gaza , would produce any results still , gaza s needs remain vast less than half of 137 , 000 homes damaged in the summer war have been repaired , and none of the 9 , 000 homes that were completely destroyed have been rebuilt yet , said adnan abu hasna , a spokesman for the united nations relief and works agency the united nations counts only homes of registered refugees in gaza , and the total amount may be much higher mr abu hasna said the qataris were working on different projects unrelated to the united nations , leaving the hardesthit families to repair their homes themselves nor has a week s opening of the border crossing served as a sustainable alternative for a regular passageway out of gaza of the estimated 15 , 000 palestinians in gaza on official lists waiting to leave , only 3 , 200 were able to exit and whatever small advances there have been have come at the cost of what palestinians ultimately seek a united homeland this is about the fate of the land , our state , our future and our present , the alquds editorial said , warning about the collapse of the recent government and hamas drift history will have no mercy , and our people will never forget !
washington relations between american military trainers and specialists advising the nigerian military in the fight against boko haram are so strained that the pentagon often bypasses the nigerians altogether , choosing to work instead with security officials in the neighboring countries of , and , according to defense officials and diplomats like these between the nigerian and american militaries have been hampering the fight against boko haram militants as they charge through northern , razing villages , abducting children and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee secretary of state is scheduled to travel to nigeria on sunday to meet with the candidates in nigeria s presidential elections , and the pentagon says that the nigerian army is still an important ally in the region vital to checking boko haram before it transforms into a larger , and possibly more transnational , threat in some respects , they look like isil two years ago , michael g vickers , the undersecretary of defense for intelligence , told the atlantic council last week , using another name for the militant group known as the islamic state how fast their trajectory can go up is something we 're paying a lot of attention to but certainly in their area , they 're wreaking a lot of destruction but american officials are wary of the nigerian military as well , citing corruption and sweeping human rights abuses by its soldiers american officials are hesitant to share intelligence with the nigerian military because they contend it has been infiltrated by boko haram , an accusation that has prompted indignation from nigeria we do n't have a foundation for what i would call a good partnership right now , said a senior military official with the united states africa command , or africom , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter we want a relationship based on trust , but you have to be able to see yourself and they 're in denial the united states was so concerned about boko haram infiltration that american officials have not included raw data in intelligence they have provided nigeria , worried that their sources would be compromised in retaliation , nigeria in december canceled the last stage of american training of a newly created nigerian army battalion there has been no resumption of the training since then some nigerian officials expressed dismay that relations between the two militaries have frayed to this point for a small country like chad , or cameroon , to come to assist the americans , that is disappointing , said ahmed zanna , a senator from nigeria s north you have a very good and reliable ally , and you are running away from them , he said , faulting the nigerian government it is terrible i pray for a change of government the tensions have been mounting for years in their battle against boko haram , nigerian troops have young men in northern cities , rampaged through neighborhoods and , according to witnesses and local officials , in a retaliatory massacre in a village in 2013 refugees said the soldiers set fire to homes , shot residents and caused panicked people to flee into the waters of lake chad , where some drowned last summer , the united states blocked the sale of americanmade cobra attack helicopters to nigeria from israel , amid concerns about nigeria s protection of civilians when conducting military operations that further angered the nigerian government , and nigeria s ambassador to the united states responded sharply , accusing washington of hampering the effort the kind of question that we have to ask is , let s say we give certain kinds of equipment to the nigerian military that is then used in a way that affects the human situation , james f entwistle , the american ambassador to nigeria , told reporters in october , explaining the decision to block the helicopter sale if i approve that , i'm responsible for that we take that responsibility very seriously all the while , boko haram has continued its ruthless push through nigeria , bombing schools and markets , torching thousands of buildings and homes , and kidnapping hundreds of people now stretching into its sixth year , the militant group s insurgency has left thousands of people dead , the overwhelming majority of them civilians it killed an estimated 2 , 000 civilians in the first six months of 2014 alone , human rights watch said , and many of nigeria s major cities abuja , kano , kaduna have been bombed american officials say that while it is unclear exactly how much territory boko haram effectively controls in nigeria , the group is , at the very least , conducting attacks across almost 20 percent of the country they reportedly control a majority of the territory of borno state , in northeastern nigeria , and a significant portion of the border areas with cameroon and chad , said lauren ploch blanchard , a specialist in african affairs with the congressional research service even before the nigerians canceled the training program in december , american military officials were stewing when soldiers showed up without proper equipment given the nation s oil wealth , the americans attributed the deficits to chronic corruption on the part of nigerian commanders , saying that they had pocketed the money meant for their soldiers it s not like they do n't have the money , the senior africom official said there are some things that we require to be good partners the first of which is a commitment on the part of the nigerian government to support its own army they have a responsibility to provide adequate pay , to take care of their people , and to equip them none of those empty allegations have ever been proved , said chris olukolade , a spokesman for the nigerian military the nigerian military has always been receptive of honest support or assistance from wellmeaning friends or partners no one should however seek to use this security situation to usurp our sovereignty as a nationafter boko haram made international headlines last april by , the united states flew several hundred surveillance drone flights over the northeast to search for the girls , but those missions were unsuccessful when the pentagon did come up with leads , american military officials said , and turned that information over to nigerian commanders to pursue , they did nothing with it the frustrations between the two sides has broad implications for the fight against boko haram , officials said , including making it harder for other international partners who have joined the effort we are trying to work closely with the french and the americans in support of the nigerian military and government against boko haram , a senior british diplomat said a rift between one of our two partners and the nigerians is not a good thing
atlanta on monday , baseball s new commissioner , rob manfred , stood with reporters before the played the nationals in washington and ruminated on a sudden run of positive drug tests in his sport , all of them surprisingly involving stanozolol , an old , easily detectable steroid manfred said the fact that the same drug had shown up in positive tests for pitcher arodys vizcaino , seattle mariners pitcher david rollins and minnesota twins pitcher ervin santana had made him suspicious he wondered whether the players had obtained the substance from the same source manfred added that he had already assigned investigators to look for links in the three positive tests but that , so far , none had been found baseball is sure to keep looking because a fourth positive test for stanozolol was announced saturday , this one involving the mets' ailing closer , jenrry mejia the ofteninjured mejia , 25 , was placed on the disabled list tuesday with what was described as inflammation in his right elbow that condition had been expected to keep him sidelined for several weeks now , mejia will be suspended for 80 games and cannot return until july it is a body blow to the mets , who are hoping that 2015 will be a turnaround year but whose pitching staff has already been decimated by injuries the news of mejia s suspension broke saturday evening while the mets were taking batting practice before their 53 loss to the braves i know the rules are the rules , and i will accept my punishment , but i can honestly say i have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system , mejia said in a statement issued through the players' union collins met with the news media with a glum face and his arms crossed it happens in the business , but it s a little damper , collins said i'm going to be honest i love this kid we challenged this guy last year he stepped up and did a great job for us certainly this is a disappointment i always look at it as i understand everything about it i really do but you know what \? there s 24 other guys in that locker room who need him , too that s why it s really disappointing that was the general reaction in the clubhouse disappointment not only do you cost yourself 80 games and do n't get paid , but you 're hurting everybody in here , david wright said you 're letting down your teammates he added we 've all discussed the drug policy at length the players' association , the commissioner s office , everybody in baseball has done their best to try to clean up this game as much as possible as much as it hurts , as much as we love jenrry as a teammate , when you make a mistake , you 're going to be punished the mets had opened spring training talking brashly , about finishing with a winning record and making the playoffs , partly because of the strength of their bullpen but josh edgin , their top lefthanded reliever , ended up needing tommy john surgery , sidelining him for the season bobby parnell , their former closer , is still working his way back from the same operation vic black , a valued righthanded reliever , developed shoulder weakness and remained out of action , although he could return soon injuries and inconsistency marred the early part of mejia s career he has had two elbow operations , including tommy john surgery , while the mets shuffled him between the rotation and the bullpen at one point , he feared that being a reliever would result in a new injury last season , though , when parnell was injured , mejia settled in as the closer , saving 28 games in 31 chances , and he became a fan favorite for his elaborate celebrations jeurys familia , who emerged as mejia s setup man last year , will serve as the mets' closer for the foreseeable future he was not needed saturday as the braves bludgeoned dillon gee for five runs and eight hits in five innings and held the mets to three hits apparently overcome with emotion , familia refused to speak with reporters saturday he will get his chance , at least until black and parnell return black could return within a few weeks , but parnell is not expected back until may the mets are trying to be cautious with their tommy john patients , but with mejia suspended , parnell will presumably resume his role as closer we are n't going to rush him back , collins said of parnell i just think it s unfair for bobby to do that we certainly have n't done it with anybody else yes , we 're in a situation where we could certainly use bobby parnell and vic black but there s a process they 've got to go through to get ready , and we 'll abide by that collins refused to call mejia selfish then he was asked how , in this day and age when players are so meticulous in their training , they could not know what substances entered their bodies i know what goes in mine , he said , laughing i ca n't answer for everybody
when hillary clinton thinks about running for president , do you think she contemplates the fact that no democrat has been elected to succeed another democrat since james buchanan in 1856 \? we bring you this factoid in honor of the beginning of the 2016 election season \( only 55 weeks until the new hampshire primary ! \) we 've got so much time it s the perfect moment for random irrelevant trivia about presidential elections of the past which , to be honest , is my favorite part consider that succession information for a minute we have had democratic vice presidents step into office when the democratic president died but the voters have n't gone to the polls and elected one democrat to follow another since before the civil war what do you think this means \? actually , there were n't all that many republicans who were elected to succeed republicans either particularly if you acknowledge that rutherford b hayes james garfield did it , but then he was assassinated william howard taft followed theodore roosevelt , and then roosevelt came to hate taft so much that he ran as a thirdparty candidate in 1912 , throwing the election to woodrow wilson herbert hoover succeeded calvin coolidge , and we know how well that one worked out finally , george hw bush was elected after ronald reagan wow , think about that the only president elected to follow a member of his own party without creating some sort of cosmic disaster was george hw bush no wonder he always looks so cheerful these factoids refer only to elections between republicans and democrats even with nearly two years to go \( but seven months until the iowa straw poll ! \) , we do n't have enough time to deal with the whigs our two current parties began duking it out in yes ! 1856 , when buchanan ran against the first republican presidential candidate , john charles fr mont fr mont was an explorer whose political enemies claimed had resorted to cannibalism during one unfortunate western expedition i am just telling you this to make it clear how interesting american history can be anyhow , buchanan won and went on triumphantly to become possibly the worst president ever almost every chief executive in american history has his defenders i had a very nice time last year talking with people who feel warren harding has n't been given his due but you very seldom run into fans of buchanan , the man who cozied up to slaveholders and failed to stop southern secession he was terrible , said jean baker , a professor of history at goucher college and buchanan biographer this despite arriving in office with one of the best r sum s in the history of presidential candidates buchanan had been a congressman , envoy to russia , senator , secretary of state and minister to britain he was sitting around waiting and waiting with the best cv of any president we 've ever had that s what s so ironic , said baker did i mention that buchanan was also the last former secretary of state elected president \? i do n't think clintonbuchanan commonalities are likely to be a big concern liberals worry that hillary might be overly aggressive when it comes to foreign policy i do n't think anybody thinks she 'd sit on her hands and let any states secede \( only 58 weeks until the south carolina primary ! \) still , it never hurts to push a little random presidential history into the mix , if only to liven things up for the next year or so any suggestions \? i am in the market for some comparisons between ted cruz and millard fillmore but about james buchanan professor baker thinks his unwillingness to stand up to the south was because , at least partly , of his close friendships with southern politicians \( he described the abolition movement as weak , powerless and soon to be forgotten and referred to white men from the south as the chivalrous race \) buchanan roomed with william king of alabama during their senate days , and the pair were so close that people referred to them as siamese twins king went on to become the only bachelor vice president , under franklin pierce buchanan , you may recall , was our only bachelor president baker said that when she was writing her book on buchanan , arthur schlesinger jr , her editor , demanded that she take a position on whether he was gay or not she demurred buchanan never said , and he spent a great deal of time pretending to be courting various widows , none of whom managed to get him anywhere near the altar baker wishes she could have said for sure it would have been one of the few things i could present as positive about james buchanan well , he was kind to his nephews and nieces he had two pet bald eagles , which sounds sort of interesting and he was the only president who hailed from pennsylvania perhaps i should point out that joe biden was born in scranton
like any redblooded american i have my ticket for star wars the force awakens i m seeing it tomorrow and i m confidently expecting it to be lightyears better than the last three movies set in a galaxy far , far way yet in conversations with friends and on twitter , i ve often treated the event with jadedness and snark rather than full enthusiasm part of that reflects my assumption that jj abrams , the director , is only really capable of doing homage , and so this movie is likely to stand in the same relationship to a new hope that super 8 stands to et but there s something deeper at work in my tempered enthusiasm as well , and reading the end of david edelstein s review of awakens helped me put my finger on it that a sequel made by a fan would be better than one by a creator seemed counterintuitive 12 years ago , but as fan culture has become more dominant \( and lucrative \) , the idea now seems prescient it s the subtext of lucas s words at a recent kennedy center event , where he said with a touch of sadness that was the movie the fans have been looking for and that \( by implication \) he didn t give them i find myself of two minds about this apart from the suspenseful last halfhour of the revenge of the sith , the star wars prequels were truly terrible , marked by lifeless pageantry , tectonicplate pacing , jar jar , effectscluttered frames , and medusa dialogue \( ie , it turned actors to stone \) but lucas was attempting something that would surpass lawrence of arabia he wanted to tell the story of the fall of a democratic republic , beginning with the sabotage of trade routes , lingering on debates \( and betrayals \) in a government assembly , and ending with the corruption of an idealistic young man who would go on to become one of the most iconic villains in pop culture he wanted to explore the peril of having too much passion , which could be exploited by a knowing demagogue , so that the story of darth vader became the last temptation of anakin skywalker he wanted to do all this with lightsaber battles and awesome scifi spectacle yes , he forgot how to tell a story yes , he forgot \( or ignored \) what the fans wanted but in his clumsy way he was going for what had never been done instead of redoing something that had it s too bad it has to be one way or the other can someone as they d say in ghostbusters merge the streams \? a few weeks ago i wrote a post about the wisdom of fan theories , the ways that fan culture can help the wouldbe auteurs of fantasy and scifi and serial television when their stories threaten to spiral out of hand and their own gifts don t suffice to make it all make sense and there is no question , no question at all , that george lucas could have used some fan wisdom when he set out to make his prequels , that he produced such dreck in part because he lost touch with the reasons why people loved the star wars movies in the first place , and that he could have benefited immensely from having a jj abrams sitting his shoulder or an online message board chewing through his scripts but lucas did have a vision for star wars that , if he had actually pulled the sixmovie cycle off , would have belonged to a higher level of cinema than most of the obsequiouslyfanservicing blockbusters and adaptations that now dominate the multiplex the auteur theory has its weaknesses , but it isn t all wrong a new hope and empire are both masterpieces of pop art in a way that none of the endlesslyproliferating marveluniverse or dc blockbusters are likely to ever be the only superhero movies that have come close to the new hope empire quality , tellingly , are christopher nolan s dark knight trilogy , a selfenclosed project in the charge of a perfectionist director and the full rise and fall and redemption of anakin skywalker would have been something even greater , if only lucas could have sustained the quality of empire instead of succumbing to whatever it was that closed him off to constructive criticism and collaboration , and turned his genius into jar jar binks now we re never going to get that even greater story , because lucas tried to deliver it and failed that star destroyer has sailed what we re going to get instead star wars as another marvel universe , a sprawling genre world in which many directors get to play will probably produce some really good movies , and all in all i m glad it s happening , i m glad lucas sold the rights , i m glad that jar jar and naboo aren t the last word on the franchise but the story i wanted from star wars , the story that is star wars to me , is the one that lucas already finished and disastrously fouled up , and a cool space thriller about the spies who stole the death star plans or the adventures of young han solo just isn t going to be quite the same thing imagine , by way of analogy , if books five and six and seven of jk rowling s harry potter saga had for some reason been written at the level of a babysitter s club installment , to fans shock and horror and grief then imagine that ten years later , rowling sold the rights to the franchise and a team of brilliant youngadult novelists began writing new books set in the potter universe would potter fans be excited about it \? i m sure they would be but wouldn t they also feel that the original pottervoldemort saga was the real thing , still regret that rowling had botched it so dramatically , and regard the new books as a kind of consolation prize rather than the saga that they d hoped for \? that s how i feel on the eve of seeing the force awakens i m happy it s here , but it isn t the star wars story my fanboy self was looking for that one came and went already maybe i ll feel differently after seeing it but for now , my excitement is a mixed thing long live star wars , ' part of me says , while the other part is saying the real star wars is dead
wellington , new zealand the flightless kiwi bird with green lasers shooting from its eyes has been ruled out as has the woolly sheep with red stars for its eyes the more than 10 , 000 designs submitted for s new flag have been whittled down to five , four of which feature variations on a fern , an indigenous plant of great symbolism in the native maori culture and the logo of the national rugby team it is about new life , new growth , said andrew fyfe , whose blackandwhite spiral based on a fern made the final cut it would be amazing to spot that on a traveler s backpack in another part of the world most new zealanders , however , are somewhat less enthusiastic they are ok , rose pike , 21 , a university student from wellington , said of the five finalists but they look like they could have been done with photoshop on a home computer she would rather retain the current flag it is our history and our heritage , she said we should keep it all my flatmates feel the same way the idea of replacing new zealand s flag , a blue banner with britain s union jack in the upper left quadrant and the four stars of the southern cross in red on the right , has percolated for decades , with new proposals for changing it cropping up every few years but none has gotten as far as  prime minister john key promised last year that if he won the september election , his third , he would hold a nationwide referendum on a new flag the design of the new zealand flag symbolizes a colonial and postcolonial era whose time has passed , he said the flag remains dominated by the union jack in a way that we ourselves are no longer dominated by the united kingdom there were also practical reasons the flag of neighboring australia also features the union jack and southern cross on a blue field more than once at official functions abroad , mr key has been placed in front of the wrong flag there is sheer confusion over what our flag looks like , he said in an interview last week in the beehive , wellington s distinctive round , tiered government center i want to build greater signs of overt patriotism and pride in new zealand , he said we have those attributes in spades , but we do n't show them in the way other countries do he often cites canada , which in 1965 changed its flag to the instantly recognizable maple leaf , as a model canada , like new zealand , remains a member of the commonwealth and a constitutional monarchy under queen elizabeth ii but polls consistently show that 60 to 70 percent of new zealanders are content with the flag they have , according to barry milne , a research fellow at the university of auckland in a recent conducted by the university s compass research center , 61 percent opposed changing the flag , 27 percent said they might support a new flag depending on the design , and 12 percent favored changing the flag the attitude of tom dinning , 73 , a retired garden center manager from hamilton , was fairly typical if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it new zealand voters will be the ones to decide in may , they were asked to submit designs for a new flag by the midjuly deadline , the government had received 10 , 292 submissions a panel of 12 new zealanders chosen by politicians from six political parties reduced the list to 40 and , after a period of public discussion , trimmed it to four three of the designs featured a silver fern the fourth was mr fyfe s swirl , a maori symbol known as a koru , based on an unfurling fern frond but strong public criticism of the narrow choice led the government to add a fifth , nonfern option this design , known as the red peak , is also based on a maori motif , representing earth , mountains and sky there was early support for a black flag with a silver fern in white until someone noticed that it could be mistaken for the islamic state flag any new flag must be unmistakably from new zealand , said john burrows , a former lawyer and chairman of the flag consideration panel we must be able to recognize ourselves in it , he said , adding that , to his knowledge , new zealand s flag would be the first designed and chosen by the people it is an entirely democratic process voters will rank the five flags in a mailin vote during three weeks starting in late november in march , a second postal referendum will pit the most popular new flag against the incumbent some new zealanders have objected to the 18 million cost of the process , which includes the referendums , town hall meetings convened across new zealand , bunting and sample flags rameka wehipeihana , 35 , a welder , said the money would be better spent easing poverty or improving public schools or hospitals i feel there s nothing to change , he said people have fought under that flag and put their lives on the line for that flag for that reason , some military veterans are boycotting the first referendum because it does not allow them to choose the current flag why are we having a debate about the flag \? said bj clark , president of new zealand s largest veterans group , the returned and services' association our flag is relevant to our country mr key said he had mulled changing the flag for years but kept putting it off to deal with more pressing issues , like the financial crisis in 2008 or the earthquake that leveled central christchurch in 2011 by 2013 , i thought there would never be a right time , he said but this was a good time to get a lot more serious about it , and either get change or put the issue to bed dr milne said it might be the latter john key often shows up as most preferred prime minister in polling , he said but he may have got this one wrong
the , founded in 1981 by george rothman and anthony korf , has built a solid reputation for varied , sometimes challenging programs so time travel , its seasonopening concert on wednesday evening at merkin concert hall , proved something of a disappointment from the start charles avison s concerto no 12 \( 1744 \) , based on keyboard sonatas by domenico scarlatti , was presumably a nod to the notion of time travel , but its initial strains , as conducted by mr rothman and played on conventional instruments , sounded sweetly sentimental delius s air and dance \( 1915 \) , which followed , sweetly sentimental , and a new work , s djuna barnes settings , did little to shake things up after more nostalgia in grieg s two elegiac melodies \( 1880 \) , it was left to bartok s sturdy divertimento \( 1939 \) to stir the soul that it did , in an excellent , gritty performance , with fine violin solos \( as throughout the evening \) by cenovia cummins , the concertmaster none of this is to denigrate any of the music \( well , maybe the delius \) but it did not add up to exciting programming if this is time travel , so is almost every other multicomposer program of classical music the anderson work , a cycle of six songs to poems by barnes , the poet , journalist and illustrator , was commissioned by the riverside symphony and arranged for string orchestra by mr korf it was sung here , attractively if not always intelligibly over the hyperactive accompaniment , by the versatile elizabeth farnum , with even a touch of tibetan overtone singing mr anderson is a guitarist , and he writes , in mr korf s words , with a special emphasis on plucked instruments two players , listed simply as plectrum , wielded a variety of instruments and cemented their privileged status with a couple of backup vocals all mildly intriguing but less than captivating
dzigan professor einstein said , in the world , there is time and just as there is time , there is another thing space space and time , time and space and these two things , he said , are relative do you know what relative means \? shumacher sigh nu \? the point \? continue dzigan there is no person these days who doesn t know what relative means i will explain it to you with an analogy and soon you will also know relativity is like this if you have seven hairs on your head , it s very few but if you have seven hairs in your milk , it s very many 1 in the 1870s , leo tolstoy became depressed about life s futility he had it all but so what \? in my confession , he wrote sooner or later there will come diseases and death \( they had come already \) to my dear ones and to me , and there would be nothing left but stench and worms all my affairs , no matter what they might be , would sooner or later be forgotten , and i myself should not exist so why should i worry about these things \? life s brevity bothered tolstoy so much that he resolved to adopt religious faith to connect to the infinite afterlife , even though he considered religious belief irrational and monstrous was tolstoy right \? is life so short as to make a mockery of people and their purposes and to render human life absurd \? in a famous 1971 paper , the absurd , thomas nagel argues that life s absurdity has nothing to do with its length if a short life is absurd , he says , a longer life would be even more absurd our lives are mere instants even on a geological time scale , let alone a cosmic one we will all be dead any minute but of course none of these evident facts can be what makes life absurd , if it is absurd for suppose we lived forever would not a life that is absurd if it lasts 70 years be infinitely absurd if it lasted through eternity \? this line of reasoning has a nice ring to it but whether lengthening an absurd thing will relieve it of its absurdity depends on why the thing is absurd and how much you lengthen it a longer life might be less absurd even if an infinite life would not be a short poem that is absurd because it is written in gibberish would be even more absurd if it prattled on for longer but , say i decided to wear a skirt so short it could be mistaken for a belt on my way to teach my class , a colleague intercepts me your skirt , she says , is absurd absurd \? why \? i ask because it is so short ! she replies if a short skirt is absurd , a longer skirt would be even more absurd , i retort now who s being absurd \? the skirt is absurd because it is so short a longer skirt would be less absurd why \? because it does not suffer from the feature that makes the short skirt absurd , namely , a ridiculously short length the same goes for a onehour hunger strike the point of a hunger strike is to show that one feels so strongly about something that one is willing to suffer a lack of nourishment for a long time in order to make a point if you only starve for an hour , you have not made your point your onehour hunger strike is absurd because it is too short if you lengthened it to one month or one year , you might be taken more seriously if life is absurd because it s short , it might be less absurd if it were suitably longer absurdity occurs when things are so illfitting or illsuited to their purpose or situation as to be ridiculous , like wearing a clown costume to a \( noncircus \) job interview or demanding that your dog tell you what time it is is the lifespan of a relatively healthy and wellpreserved human , say somewhere between 75 and 85 , so short as to render it absurd , illsuited to reasonable human purposes \? time , as we all knew before einstein elaborated , is relative it flies when we are having fun it creeps in this petty pace from day to day when we are wracked with guilt five minutes is too short a time to explain einstein s theory of relativity but it s just the right length of time for the dzigan and shumacher routine about it our perception of time is relative to space , yes , but also to purpose , to other spans of time , to task and probably to other things i have not thought of to assess whether human life is usually too short , consider human aims and purposes people are commonly thought to have two central concerns love and work so much has been written about how little time there is to do both that we need not elaborate suffice it to say that when people ask me how i manage to be a philosopher , mother , teacher , wife , writer , etc , the answer is obvious by doing everything badly we could abandon love or abandon work , but giving up one fundamental human pursuit in order to have time for a better shot at the other leaves us with , at best , half a life and even half a life is not really accessible to most of us life is too short for work alone by the time we have an inkling about what sort of work we might enjoy and do well , most of us have little time to do it by the time we figure anything out , we are already losing our minds agerelated cognitive decline begins in our 20s , just as our prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for judgment , is finally completing its lengthy maturation process the rate of cognitive decline increases as we age , with a steep increase after age 60 we don t fare much better with time to love it takes time and experience to develop the wisdom and maturity to choose an appropriate partner and love him or her in a way that doesn t make everyone miserable relationships need attention , and attention takes time children take lots of time too , and some reflection and experience , yet we are biologically made to bear children when we are young and unwise maybe the problem is not that we don t have enough time but that we waste the time we have seneca famously thought this \( it is not that we have a short time to live , but that we waste a lot of it \) most of us seem unable to refrain from wasting time it is the rare person indeed who can be maximally efficient and productive for the rest of us that is , for almost all of us seneca s advice about not wasting time seems true but useless if we devoted our entire lives to one great painting or one beautiful melody , even if that work was a masterpiece , we might feel absurd to have spent our entire lives on it a life so spent is bound to have been narrow , confining and oddly obsessive that doesn t seem to be a reasonable way to spend one s entire life it seems out of scale but if life were much longer , we might have enough time to write many books , paint many paintings , compose many melodies and , over a couple of hundred years or so , get really good at it we might even feel fulfilled , accomplished and decidedly nonabsurd maybe not , but we would have more of a chance than we do now , in our fleeting , ludicrous , minute lifespan what if we lived for , say , 500 or 1 , 000 years \? would our ambition tend to grow to scale , making life seem absurdly short for human purposes , whatever its length \? is it human nature to adopt outsized ambitions , condemning ourselves to absurdity by having conceptions of reasonable achievement that we don t have the time to realize \? why haven t we scaled down our ambitions to fit the time we have \? is the problem our nature or our lifespan \? there may be no way to be sure but consider the fact that , although we have ambitions unsuited to our lifespan , we don t seem to consistently adopt ambitions unsuited to our species in respects other than time it s not absurd to us that we cannot fly or hibernate we don t think the fact that we can hold our breath for minutes rather than hours or memorize a few pages rather than a tome makes human life meaningless we don t find that our inability to read each other s minds , speak to animals , glow in the dark , run 60 miles an hour , solve complex equations in our heads simultaneously or lift thousandpound weights makes a sad mockery of human existence this makes it more likely that , given a longer lifespan , life might seem less absurdly short for our purposes just as a lifespan can be too short , it can be too long for many , it is far too long already many people are bored with life , irritated by the human condition , exhausted from suffering , tired of living for those for whom life is too long , a longer life would be worse and , quite possibly , more absurd for some , however , life seems too long because it s too short , meaning life is rendered so absurd by being short that even a short absurd life feels too long because it is pointless a life made absurd because it is too short would be rendered less absurd if it were significantly longer a millionyear or infinite life might be too long for human nature and purposes too , though such a life would be so radically different that we can only speculate an infinite life might become tedious , and people worldweary lifetime love commitments , a source of meaning now , would likely cease to exist a millionyear or infinite lifespan might be too long and slip into absurdity to everything its time both a too short lifespan and a too long lifespan present absurdist challenges to a meaningful life for a 500 or 1 , 000year lifespan to work to reduce life s absurdity , we would have to be able to sustain a sense of self over that time so long as our memories function well and our psychological continuity can be maintained , our sense of identity might hold up \( at least to a degree not all that different from our current condition \) there is also the matter of perception as we age , time seems to pass more quickly , probably because we become accustomed to life and pay less attention if life were much longer , we would have to find a way to notice so that it didn t seem to still pass in a flash of our inattention and then there is our health clearly , it will not be less absurd to lengthen our period of decrepitude the longer lifespan would have to be mostly spent in decent health an appropriately lengthened lifespan might make life much less absurd in the scheme of things , humans take up very little space the earth is a miniscule part of the universe and each individual takes up so little space on this miniscule part of the universe as to occupy almost no space at all , relative to the entire universe or even to the planet earth our physical smallness relative to the earth and the universe is taken by some to imply insignificance and , in turn , our absurdity but absurdity occurs when things are illsuited to their purposes , and neither human size nor the space allotted to humans is illsuited to human purposes unlike the time of a human lifespan , which is illsuited to our purposes , the space allotted to humans isn t we re neither too small nor too large to do what we want to do we are not forced to live cramped in tiny caves we are not so light as to be blown around by the wind if we had to stand on each other s backs to reach the leaves that we needed for sustenance , that might make us feel absurdly small but we d probably adapt to accommodate this feature of our physiology or build ladders for easier foraging if the atmosphere thinned out at four feet , we might feel absurdly large , crawling awkwardly on our bellies in order to breathe yet , if we were belly crawlers that would seem normal to us and our bodies would adapt to crawling we have evolved and adapted to our space , both to the space we take up and to the space available to us space is more manipulable than time we build chairs and tables to human size we blast through mountains to clear space for roads we build living space horizontally and vertically so that we can live in densely populated cities to some extent , we ve conquered space by increasing the speed of human travel and developing technologies to enable us to communicate easily across great distances this has made life more convenient but not less absurd because the absurdity of human life is not a space problem given enough time , we could cover more space , but more space will not solve our timerelated difficulties people have spatial needs , but , given that we can manipulate or adapt to our spatial parameters , our size and the space we have to live in do not seem crucial to our sense of ourselves very short lives seem

the fight over funding for moved to texas this week three days after gov greg abbott announced his decision to end funding for planned parenthood , state health department investigators showed up on thursday at planned parenthood health centers in houston , dallas , san antonio and brownsville with orders to turn over thousands of pages of documents , including patients' records and employees' home addresses and telephone numbers some , but not all , of the extensive records sought by the state related specifically to  for example , was told to produce five years of records whether electronic , paper or concerning any patients billed to medicaid who had an abortion in which any part of the fetus was removed or preserved for research use planned parenthood gulf coast was to turn over a complete copy of certain patients' records , including doctors' orders , nursing notes and lab tests , as well as the center s appointment books , patient signin sheets and contracts we 're concerned about the breadth and depth of what they 're asking for , said sarah wheat , a spokeswoman for  the battle over medicaid funding for planned parenthood has been at a high pitch nationwide since the release , starting in july , of videos secretly taken by abortion opponents posing as representatives of a biomedical firm seeking fetal tissue the videos purported to show planned parenthood officials trying to illegally profit from the sale of fetal tissue , and their release has led many states to question whether planned parenthood should be eligible for continued medicaid funding the organization said that the , and that it never violated federal law regarding the use of fetal tissue in medical research alabama , arkansas and louisiana have also moved to cut off medicaid funding for planned parenthood the group has filed suit to stop the cuts in each of those states in texas , the group has 30 days to appeal the medicaid termination in the notice of medicaid termination that the texas inspector general for the state s health and human services commission , stuart w bowen jr , sent monday to the planned parenthood affiliates , he said the state had determined that the group was no longer capable of performing medical services in a professionally competent , safe , legal and ethical manner the notices cited two reasons for that decision first , they said the videos showed that the organization had a policy of altering its abortion procedures to better procure fetal tissue , in violation of medical standards in addition , they said the videos showed people posing as buyers of fetal tissue being allowed to handle bloody tissue wearing only gloves , in violation of infectioncontrol standards the notices also said that the state had found a pattern of illegal billing practices that amounted to medicaid fraud chris cutrone , a spokesman for the inspector general , said he could not discuss the planned parenthood investigation or what the health investigators were looking for in their orders to turn over records planned parenthood said it saw the record requests as a politically motivated fishing expedition and one more battle in the state s long fight to limit abortion it is completely outrageous that texas officials are using thoroughly discredited , fraudulent videos to cut women off from , including screening , testing and , dawn laguens , executive vice president of planned parenthood federation of america , said in a statement some texas democrats , too , objected this is a gross invasion of client privacy , and i'm tired of watching lowincome women become collateral damage in attacks on planned parenthood that are based on deceptive videos and political grandstanding , state senator jos rodr guez , chairman of the texas senate democratic caucus , said in a statement texas should be increasing access to women s health care and expanding medicaid in order to take better care of our mothers and sisters , not shutting down health clinics and intimidating women from seeking services the inspector general said termination of medicaid for planned parenthood would not affect access to care in texas because there were thousands of alternative providers but after texas barred planned parenthood from participating in the state s women s health program two years ago , a state health department report found that the program served 30 , 000 fewer women , with the biggest drops in areas where a planned parenthood clinic had been forced to close in the past , two federal appeals courts have blocked laws excluding abortion providers from medicaid in indiana and arizona medicaid rules say states are not permitted to prevent providers from participating solely on the basis of the range of medical services they provide in louisiana , gov bobby jindal expected to end planned parenthood s medicaid funding on monday but a federal judge , john w degravelles , delayed the termination on sunday in language that left little doubt about the outcome , the judge ruled that the funding must continue for at least two weeks until a final ruling planned parenthood , he said , would most likely be able to prove that the attempt to end its funding was motivated by reasons unrelated to its competence uncontradicted evidence in the record at this time is that does not perform abortions in louisiana , is not involved in the sale of fetal tissue , and none of the conduct in question occurred at the ppgc s two louisiana facilities , he wrote other states have also grappled with the fallout of the videos officials in six states missouri , georgia , indiana , massachusetts , pennsylvania and south dakota opened investigations into planned parenthood s practices with fetal tissue and found no wrongdoing another seven states declined to investigate , finding no grounds for suspicion in an effort to quiet the controversy , planned parenthood said oct 13 that although it had never violated federal law , it would no longer accept reimbursement for the costs of providing fetal tissue , which made up only a tiny portion of the revenue of the one california affiliate that took reimbursement
as the civil war entered its final spring , its history already needed to be told fittingly , one of the earliest attempts came from the man whose election to the presidency , four years earlier , had precipitated the conflict on march 4 , 1865 , abraham lincoln gave his second inaugural address before a multitude who braved the rain and the mud for which washington was famous , to hear something out of the ordinary no president had been reelected since andrew jackson , so the very fact of a second inaugural was a rara avis in the taxonomy of political utterances furthermore , lincoln had not delivered a formal speech in some time consumed by the war , he had relaxed his ceremonial duties , with the important exception of the gettysburg address , a year and four months earlier earlier second inaugurals had not been especially memorable washington s second was a mere clearing of the throat four sentences long jefferson s was more substantial , restating his political philosophy , defending his administration against its critics , and ending with an appeal to that being in whose hands we are the other presidents reelected madison , monroe and jackson had followed that template lincoln might have done the same the crowds would have been satisfied with a few republican platitudes , and an assurance that the ship of state was sailing on a steady course the war was obviously ending on march 2 , gen robert e lee had requested a meeting with lt gen ulysses s grant , and on march 3 , lincoln issued instructions to grant on the surrender negotiations every day , maj gen william t sherman drew nearer , crushing resistance as he moved north from georgia march 3 had also brought the birth of the freedmen s bureau , the large federal entity that would oversee the work of converting former slaves into citizens lincoln could easily have cited these wondrous achievements , inconceivable at the time of his first inaugural instead , he offered something unique in the history of presidential rhetoric a speech that nearly removed the president from the occasion instead of the usual trumpet peals that accompany victory , he offered searching questions that went to the heart of american history instead of banal selfcongratulation , he pointed out that neither side had anticipated the astounding result of the war instead of clich s about piety , he wondered , daringly , if god had sent the war as a punishment for america s transgressions it began auspiciously , before a set that lincoln helped to design behind him , the capitol dome was finished , because he had ordered the work to continue throughout the war that powerful metaphor of union spoke volumes another good omen as he stood to speak , the sun broke through the clouds and , as one observer noted , flooded the spectacle with glory and with light six minutes later , lincoln sat down again many must have wondered what had just happened several newspaper accounts reveal a crowd unmoved and listless , barely applauding , then dispersing in his short time speaking , the president had announced no new policies , and made no promises instead , he simply asked americans to act charitably toward one another we can forgive the crowd \( captured in a photograph by alexander gardner \) if they had trouble getting it the words , like the image , may have been something of a blur today , we can see those words with more precision indeed , we can look straight at his reading copy , as he did at first glance , there s not much to it , only four pages of foolscap but those words wielded a deceptive , tensile strength as at gettysburg , the speech was lean according to ronald c white , jr , there were 703 words , 505 of which had one syllable gettysburg lingered in a single phrase , fitting and proper still , lincoln was somewhat ghostly , and barely appeared in any way inside his own speech he claimed that he could present little that is new , when that was certainly not true , and he ventured no prediction for the future only once did he use the favorite word of politicians i in a photograph taken two days later , march 6 , 1865 , he already appears to be fading from view still , it was one of the most profound speeches ever delivered by an american president lincoln sought to come to terms with the tragedy that was also part of his set design the amputees visible everywhere around washington the large number of exslaves now crowding the capital , many without homes or jobs the sharpshooters lining the rooftops to protect the exposed president from the anger simmering just below the surface of the southern city john wilkes booth was one of the people in the audience that day he later told a friend , samuel knapp chester , what an excellent chance i had to kill the president , if i had wished , on inaugurationday ! i was on the stand , as close to him nearly as i am to you lincoln chose to tell the story of the war again he had been telling it already , in his way in his annual messages to congress , dutifully submitted each december , and in his spontaneous remarks to serenaders who came by the white house he remembered , as surely they all did , what it had been like during his first inaugural , when the south would make war rather than let the nation survive , while the north would accept war rather than let it perish he put slavery back into the story , despite efforts already beginning to attribute the war to other causes by simply saying that all knew that this interest was , somehow , the cause of the war , he issued a powerful corrective to the revisionists then , a powerful short sentence and the war came it echoed an earlier line , in his 1863 annual message it came , and , as was anticipated , it was followed by dark and doubtful days the passive voice is not usually urged upon writers , but lincoln found it congenial to his temperament , and his growing sense that he was , in fact , the instrument of a higher design the most arresting part of the speech followed since george washington had acknowledged the parent of the human race , presidents had referenced god in their inaugurals , but their awkward phrasings had masked some discomfort before a subject that did not lend itself well to great occasions of state but here was lincoln , speaking in the accents of the old testament , trying to understand how a benevolent god could have brought such tragedy to a nation that lincoln had called , four years earlier , his almost chosen people lincoln was not a natural prophet he spent much of his life scoffing at religion in an 1837 letter , he bragged , i ve never been to church yet , and probably shall not be soon but an inner set of beliefs never stopped guiding him , sometimes in orthodox ways , and sometimes not he valued the separation of church and state a year before the second inaugural , to the day , he issued an order that the federal government stay away from the business of running any churches during the war effort yet his own need for faith deepened throughout the war after his personal losses , and what he increasingly felt were divine interventions in the course of the conflict that may explain the power of his remarks at gettysburg , and his belief in a new birth of freedom , a concept that resonates with the new testament as well as the obvious fact of emancipation it would be too simple to say that he was born again , but for lincoln , religion and emancipation were intricately tied together according to his navy secretary , gideon welles , lincoln announced in a cabinet meeting on sept 22 , 1862 , that he had made a covenant with god , and that if he brought military victory , he would consider it a sign that god had decided this question in favor of the slaves at times in the second inaugural , lincoln still seemed skeptical he noted that both northerners and southerners had prayed to the same god , and that neither side s prayers had been answered fully but he continued with the arresting thought that god might will the conflict to continue until the precise moment when americans had endured the same amount of suffering that they had inflicted , through centuries of slavery that view saw the war as a form of punishment for a society gone wrong an old testament view but then , as if understanding that he needed to soften that severe judgment , lincoln left the old testament for the new , and asked americans to treat each other gently , with malice toward none with charity for all the new testament is not always easy for leaders of empires to date , jesus has never been mentioned in an inaugural address but lincoln was showing signs of interest in one of his few speeches of the previous year , on sept 7 , 1864 , lincoln addressed a group of africanamericans from baltimore , who presented him with a bible and expressed the gratitude of their race for incorporation into the american family lincoln responded with thanks , and added , all the good the saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book john nicolay , his secretary , later wrote that although the president belonged to no denomination , he made the golden rule of christ his practical creed after the address was over , the crowd slipped away its torpor must have been disappointing to lincoln but one newspaper account differs from the others an alert journalist with the new york herald caught something unusual midway through the speech , a significant number of africanamericans began to murmur appreciatively , engaging lincoln in the callandresponse pattern familiar to the black church , and offering a chorus of bless the lord at the end of every sentence although not noted in the american press , the times of london wrote that at least half the crowd was africanamerican , a fact that significantly colors our understanding of the event most newspapers lambasted the speech the new york herald called it a little speech of glittering generalities used only to fill in the program the chicago times wrote we did not conceive it possible that even mr lincoln could produce a paper so slip shod , so loosejointed , so puerile the new york times complained that lincoln makes no boasts of what he has done , or promises of what he will do but in time , its power became clear to those who took the time to let those 703 words settle it helped that those words now had a life of their own , moving quickly along a technology corridor that was not quite an information superhighway , but was impressive all the same the morning after the speech , at 3 am , the telegraph wires between new york and san francisco were connected , and californians could read it over breakfast as clearly as those who had been in the audience the day before several lines deserved special scrutiny near the end , lincoln urged americans to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow , and his orphan that seemingly docile thought meant that lincoln would seek benefits for the widows of black soldiers a courageous act because it recognized slave marriages as legal , and implied that africanamericans were entitled to full citizenship , a hope that the freedmen s bureau would soon try to fulfill , with mixed results the final line promised a lasting peace , among ourselves , and with all nations that too held meaning for many nations were jolted by the quantum leap in military prowess that the united states had displayed over the previous four years a paris journalist reported that the french anxiously envisioned the appearance of an american fleet of ironsides in the port of havre , or a fleet of gunboats sailing up the seine to take paris it would be 79 years four score minus one before americans landed at normandy but by promising to wage peace , the second inaugural set a precedent for later disarmaments what lingers long after reading the speech is a sense of its honesty instead of simply castigating the south though he did lincoln implied that the entire country was implicated in american slavery instead of simply expressing faith in god though he did he confessed to not know , precisely , how god s future plan would unfold in so doing , he was swimming against a forceful tide of religious selfcertainty but by reasserting his belief that we humans cannot understand everything , he was saying something just as religious indeed , more so fortyone days after the speech , lincoln was killed by a member of his audience that he was killed on good friday was a fact widely noted at the time , although lincoln the skeptic would have dismissed the coincidence booth also attended the speech lincoln gave from the white house , on april 11 , when he announced that he expected to let some africanamericans vote that simple determination enraged him , and precipitated the final act it would take a full century to get from these earliest words about africanamerican voting rights , spoken by lincoln in march and april 1865 , to the struggles in selma in march 1965 if booth had not intervened , we might have gotten there more quickly but it is easy to put too much weight on lincoln s shoulders when the voting rights act passed , in august 1965 , it was approved in the same building lincoln stood before on march 4 , 1865 a century and a half later , the capitol has again been renovated , but looks much the way it did that day the old engineering has held up well in a poem , herman melville wrote of the iron dome , stronger for stress and strain it has survived a great deal since 1865 , including the hoopla of this week s visit by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who said this capitol dome helped build our iron dome , a reference to israel s antimissile shield the civil war continues to be rewritten , one book at a time it will never be a simple fact to memorize for a history class it remains fundamental and astounding but it helps that its first historian rejected the temptation of an easy speech , to ponder the deeper meaning of why the war had come in so doing , he gave a parting gift to his audience , a vision of a better country than the one that had come before , and in a sense , had ended lincoln wrote to the republican publisher and politician thurlow weed , after the fact , men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them yet these public rituals , as old as democracy itself , are essential acts of faith in a form of government that depends

twenty years ago next week , the artist ray johnson a low bridge in sag harbor , ny , and backstroked placidly out to sea two teenage girls saw him plunge into the frigid water and tried to alert the police , but when they found the station closed they went to see a movie instead , a detail many of mr johnson s friends said would have delighted him why he took his life at the age of 67 when he was healthy , had money in the bank for the first time and was one of the most revered underground artists of the last half of the 20th century is a question none of those friends have been able to answer \( the poet diane di prima i ca n't imagine what you thought you were doing what was the point of jumping off that bridge after so many years of playing it cool \) but in many ways mr johnson conducted his death exactly as he had conducted his life and his work enigmatically , defiantly on his own terms and with an intense privacy that somehow coexisted with a compulsively public persona mr johnson heralded several art movements , almost simultaneously he was making work that looked like pop in the 1950s , years before his friend and sometime rival andy warhol did he was a performance artist before there was a term for such a thing he mined ground later occupied by conceptual art \( whose pretensions he loved to razz oh dat consept art , in one of his collages \) and he was the father of , spreading his collages and delphic text works through a vast web of fellow artists , friends and complete strangers , making him a oneman socialmedia platform for a preinternet age but every time mainstream recognition approached , mr johnson who lived as frugally as a monk and played the art world s holy fool seemed to dance away courted in the 1990s by the pinnacle of commercial acceptance , the gagosian gallery , he turned even that courtship into farce by demanding a million dollars each for collages then selling in the fourfigure range they 've since advanced only into five figures he was a guerrilla fighter against materialism and fame , and in a sense he s still fighting today , said frances f l beatty , president of richard l feigen co , the gallery that represents mr johnson s estate but the art world may be finally starting to conquer mr johnson s will to resist it a spate of , and museum acquisitions has come along in recent months , as his work has been discovered , yet again , by a generation of younger artists , like matt connors , hanna liden , adam mcewen and harmony korine this time , as money and power loom ever more powerfully in art circles , it seems to be mr johnson s role as a heroiccomic bartleby that makes him particularly attractive to younger artists but the shapeshifting ways in which he operated outside art s normal channels through the post office , street performances and artist s books also resonate for 21stcentury artists whose work fits uneasily into the conventions of museums and galleries performa , the performanceart biennial , is organizing a tribute to mr johnson for its 2015 iteration , which takes place in november one aspect will be the dissemination through ads , mailings and websites of johnson material , like a that he mailed out during his lifetime and asked people to alter and send on the idea , said roselee goldberg , performa s founder and director , is to stimulate a similar kind of freeform exchange now , online , on paper , and through other means , with mr johnson as presiding spirit we want to start it very early , so it will have time to grow extra arms and legs and heads , she said as correspondent and collagist , mr johnson was manically prolific even now , bins , binders and file folders full of unseen and largely unstudied material reside in closets and an unused bathroom at the east 69th street townhouse of the feigen gallery , the ali baba s cave of ray s archive , as ms beatty calls it \( some of that work is on display in a show at the gallery through jan 16 , ray johnson s art world \) waiting recently for a visit from curators from the metropolitan museum of art , who were interested in seeing some johnson works for acquisition , ms beatty flipped on a closet light to show floortoceiling stacks of lightblue archival boxes you could happily , as far as i'm concerned , spend the rest of your life right in here , she said \( a small army of is indeed at work now sorting through his vast output \) raised in a workingclass family in detroit , mr johnson hit the ground running as an artist before he was out of his teens in 1945 , he ended up at black mountain college , the modernist hothouse near asheville , nc , where he studied with joseph albers and robert motherwell and began friendships with , jasper johns and the sculptor with whom he was romantically involved for many years after moving to new york and working as a studio assistant to the painter ad reinhardt , he began making works that he called moticos possibly an anagram of the word osmotic filled to overflowing with the popculture imagery from magazines , advertising and television that was starting to saturate society and surfaced repeatedly , like twin deities , and mr johnson often took this work to the streets , displaying it on sidewalks and in grand central terminal to generally perplexed passersby some people just did n't get it , and other people like me thought he was an absolute genius , said the painter , with whom mr johnson corresponded for years , often asking him to forward mailed artworks on to willem de kooning sometimes i did what he asked and sometimes i just could n't part with them , mr rosenquist said , adding i really miss him because i accumulate all these strange things that i 'd like to mail him , but i ca n't because he s not there influenced by ideas of chance and zen buddhism , mr johnson came to develop a hieroglyphiclike language in which image and word melted into each other , a language so complex it cried out not for curators but military codebreakers william s wilson , one of mr johnson s closest friends and a leading scholar of his work , recalled the almost religious gravity with which mr johnson viewed not only making art but also putting it into the world mr wilson once drove mr johnson to see the publisher harry abrams , who was interested in buying work mr johnson emerged from mr abrams s office in a fury with his briefcase of collages , mr wilson said , and flung himself on my lap crying because abrams had asked him to throw in a 13th collage for free if he bought a dozen , as if ray was selling eggs of course , such a stance meant that developing a market for mr johnson s work during his lifetime was next to impossible , and in many ways his critical stature still suffers because of this he kind of landed by default in the book and ephemera world , and to a large extent that s really where his work has been living , said brendan dugan , owner of the noho bookstore and gallery karma , which organized an of late johnson work last fall mr dugan said he had been drawn to mr johnson in part because of his avid following among younger , punkinfluenced artists but also those whose work seems to have little affinity with mr johnson s , like mr connors , an abstract painter who is featured in the forever now contemporary painting in an atemporal world on view now at the museum of modern art in an email , mr connors said i am always very excited by artists who create their own very specific codes , languages and grammars he s speaking his own language and talking to and about specific people , but he also loves to share it with you the effect is kind of like a queer and gossipy downtown joseph beuys for the show at karma , mr dugan was allowed to pore over reams of paper works in the feigen archive , made by mr johnson mostly in the last decade of his life , and what i saw was a total discovery to me , because a lot of it was very raw and very punk , he said here was this guy in his 60s , and he s still up to it , to the very end , pulling in new material from the culture and making this very weird stuff that feels very contemporary now ms beatty , who struggled for years to get mr johnson to agree to a major exhibition at the feigen gallery , remembered that he called her three days before he died and he said , listen , frances , i'm planning to do something big and after that , you 'll finally be able to do your show' and i had no idea what he was talking about , but i thought maybe he was actually giving in , after playing cat and mouse for so long well , of course , little did i know , and that s how it always was with ray how little did we know , ms beatty said , adding , it was a livedforart life , 100 percent , all the way to the end
gov scott walker of wisconsin , whose early glow as a republican presidential contender was snuffed out with the rise of antiestablishment rivals , announced monday that he was quitting the race and urged some of his 15 rivals to do the same so the party could unite against the leading candidate , donald j trump mr walker s pointed rebuke of mr trump gave powerful voice to the private fears of many republicans that the party risked alienating large parts of the electorate hispanics , women , immigrants , veterans , and most recently , muslims if mr trump continued vilifying or mocking them as part of his overtures to angry and disaffected voters still , mr walker s exit was not a selfless sacrifice he was running low on campaign cash , sliding sharply in opinion polls , losing potential donors to rivals and unnerving supporters with a stream of gaffes , like saying he would consider building a wall along the canadian border appearing ashen and drained at a brief news conference late monday in madison , mr walker said the republican presidential field was too focused on how bad things are rather than on how we can make them better for everyone without naming mr trump , mr walker issued a plea to fellow candidates to coalesce around a different republican who could offer a more optimistic vision and guide the party to a victory next year that , he admitted with sadness in his voice , he could not achieve himself today i believe that i am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive , conservative message can rise to the top of the field , mr walker said with this in mind , i will suspend my campaign immediately i encourage other republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same , he said , so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive , conservative alternative to the current frontrunner none of mr walker s rivals appeared poised to take him up on the suggestion of bowing out , though they expressed surprise he was withdrawing so soon holy cow , senator ted cruz of texas said on fox news mr trump , in a twitter post , was magnanimous i got to know scottwalker well he s a very nice person and has a great future mr walker s departure is likely to have little impact given the sprawling field he was competing most aggressively in iowa , which he deemed a mustwin state , but he had fallen from first place to 10th in a recent poll and mr walker s message a tale of conservative triumph over labor unions and other entrenched democratic interests in a midwestern swing state plainly failed to connect he drew support from less than onehalf of 1 percent of republican primary voters in a recent cnn national poll  and while mr walker had built a loyal but small network of major donors , including wealthy republicans like todd ricketts whose father founded td ameritrade he was never a force in the republican race for money , running far behind rivals like former gov jeb bush of florida and mr cruz if the demise of mr walker s campaign emphasizes anything , it is the intense pressure that candidates are under to raise enormous sums of money not only for their political operations but also for their super pacs mr bush raised more than 100 million in the first half of 2015 , providing him with enormous resources to compete in a potentially long and costly nomination fight mr walker helped raise about 20 million for his super pac and 6 million more for a related campaign committee , but walker advisers were believed to be burning through cash \( his campaign finances will not be made public until midoctober \) the need to raise money has had the effect of turning the traditional statebystate nomination fights into national contests , in which candidates need to prove themselves to donors across the country rather than merely win over voters in the handful of states that hold the earliest caucuses and primaries mr walker increasingly tailored his message for iowans , taking some sharply conservative stands on issues like immigration and samesex marriage that posed problems with moderates in a different era , governor walker could have won the nomination if all he had to worry about was trying to win iowa , new hampshire , south carolina , and nevada , said matt moore , the chairman of the south carolina republican party but now that the presidential race has become so nationalized , so early , a candidate can run into big trouble if they peak too early and can t show donors and voters everywhere that they can recapture momentum as recently as this weekend , mr walker was telling supporters like mr ricketts that he was committed to the race and looking for ways to save money and jumpstart his campaign after a middling performance in wednesday s republican debate but advisers said that several factors had been weighing on him for weeks and contributed to his decision to quit mr walker was particularly anxious about accumulating a huge campaign debt that he would struggle for years to pay off unless he won the republican nomination compared with mr trump , carly fiorina and mr bush , mr walker is a man of modest means his father was a preacher and his mother was a parttime secretary , and he has earned government salaries for most of his adult life he was not in a strong position to lend money to his own campaign , advisers said , nor inclined to do so yet campaign bills were piling up , with some vendors complaining that they had not been paid on time jeff kaufmann , chairman of the iowa republican party , said that mr walker was at a disadvantage in a large field of wealthy republicans who had personal , family or business connections to wealthy contributors scott walker was a lot like the typical american in terms of personal finances he couldn t write himself a big check , mr kaufmann said nothing eats away at a candidate from average means like anxieties about massive campaign debts some advisers and donors also complained that mr walker s campaign manager , rick wiley , had built up a sizable organization in madison but had devoted too little money and staffing to crucial field operations mr wiley did not respond to requests for comment mr walker did start off as a particular favorite of prominent republicans like the billionaire industrialists charles g and david h koch , who both believed that mr walker was a tough , committed conservative who not only took on fights but also won them , as shown in his success cutting taxes and hobbling labor unions in wisconsin yet if mr walker s record was inspiring , his abilities as a presidential candidate were ultimately limited he had verbal slipups almost from the start , like saying he could defeat the islamic state because he had won the battle against union leaders at home and he came across as flat and lacking in sophistication in the televised debates scott , for whatever reason , didn t connect

a british trader , navinder singh sarao , is facing extradition to the united states federal prosecutors accuse him of having significantly contributed to the flash crash of may 6 , 2010 , in which major american stock markets plunged dramatically in a matter of minutes prosecutors also say that he manipulated prices on the chicago mercantile exchange for years by spoofing , or placing orders that he intended to cancel before they were filled in fact , this is a common activity in equities markets today the prosecution of mr sarao is arbitrary , and his contribution to the flash crash was negligible regulators should direct their attention instead to far more damaging practices for example , highspeed strategies that exploit the of our trading systems to make profits purely on timing and speed the market that mr sarao stands accused of manipulating is among the world s most liquid traders can buy and sell contracts that are bets on the future value of the standard poor s 500 stockprice index how exactly did mr sarao manage to singlehandedly manipulate a market with tens of thousands of participants and billions in daily trading volume \? according to the complaint , filed in federal court in the northern district of illinois , he placed multiple large orders to sell contracts at prices slightly above the best prevailing offer the goal was to create an impression of considerable selling pressure , in the hope that this would drive prices down mr sarao could then buy at prices that he had himself played a role in depressing , only to sell moments later once he had canceled his initial orders and prices had recovered in describing this activity , the complaint refers to bogus orders designed to trick other market participants by creating a false appearance of increased supply and preventing legitimate forces of supply and demand from operating properly this language reflects a na ve understanding of modern finance our markets are full of bogus orders that create a false appearance of demand or supply and that cannot be traded against by ordinary investors most of these are placed not by traders like mr sarao but by highfrequency traders using algorithms to implement complex strategies their strategies combine traditional marketmaking functions \( such as the posting of buy and sell orders at a small spread \) with speculation based on shortterm price forecasts they rely on the timely acquisition and rapid processing of incoming market data by selectively altering this data , mr sarao was attempting to trigger behavior that would net him a quick profit investors buying or selling securities based on their prices in relation to economic fundamentals will not generally be affected by this kind of manipulation it is only strategies that seek to extract information from market data itself that are vulnerable to spoofing and in today s sp futures market , highfrequency traders are for about half of total trading volume and appear on one or both sides of around threequarters of contracts traded it is the automated response of these traders to the placement of orders , both legitimate and bogus , that precipitated the flash crash the growth of highfrequency trading has been fueled in large measure by the fact that our equities markets are fragmented individual stocks can be bought and sold at more than under a rule known as , all orders must be communicated and consolidated in a manner that allows each new order to trade at the best available price in the market as a whole but this process of consolidation is not instantaneous , and highfrequency traders have invested huge sums to receive and react to information at individual exchanges a few milliseconds before it has been aggregated and made available to others as a result , orders are not always fully processed in the sequence in which they arrive at the market in the time it takes for a partially filled order to reach a second destination , firms can modify orders and make trades at multiple venues and they can insert themselves between buyers and sellers with compatible orders that have yet to be matched , thus providing liquidity where none is needed these practices reduce the incentives to analyze fundamental information about securities they also involve the placement of orders that are not intended to result in trades which , in the case of mr sarao , is allegedly a criminal act so why was mr sarao singled out \? probably because his strategy was transparent , and his account relatively small larger firms that combine many strategies with evolving algorithms will not display so clear a signature mr sarao made no pretense at market making and no attempt to disguise his strategy but the strategy itself was not new if regulators and prosecutors are serious about enforcement of securities laws , they should focus on the largest players in the fragmented markets for stocks and not on an individual , acting alone , who managed to fool an algorithm
i not only watched television pundits discuss the shooting of walter scott in north charleston , sc , last week , i participated in some of those discussions and the most disturbing thread that emerged for me was people who said up front that they saw no justification for scott being killed , but nevertheless stalked around for a back door that would allow them to surreptitiously blame the victim for his own death some formulation of if only he had n't run was the way this dark door was eased open i find it particularly disturbing the way that we try to find excuses for killings , the way that we seek to deprecate a person when they have been killed rather than insisting that they deserved to remain among the living for me , there is only one issue in the walter scott case he is dead , and that cannot be undone and not only was he killed , but he was killed in a most dishonorable way shot in the back as he fled so , for me there is only one question should the dead man be dead \? is there anything , under american jurisprudence and universal moral law , that justifies the taking of this man s life \? all else wanders into the weeds the judicial system could have easily dealt with any misdeed scott is accused of failure to pay child support , failure to present proper documentation for a car he was driving , resisting arrest , fleeing and none of those offenses , if he were found guilty of any or all , would have carried the death sentence unfortunately , police officers encounter lawbreakers on a regular basis unfortunately , some resist arrest some flee these are simply occupational conditions of being an officer an admittedly tough job that few of us would sign up to do but none of those offenses grant a license to gun a man down a life is the most precious , most valuable thing in creation it cannot be casually ended it cannot be callously taken it must always be honored and protected , and the person living it need n't be perfect he or she is human the bar of justification for extrajudicial killings is high , and necessarily so , even among suspects accused of crimes killing sanctioned by courts in the form of executions are problematic enough , as evidenced by recent exonerations of men who spent decades on death row how much more problematic could killings be of people who do n't live to get a trial \? it is tragic to somehow try to falsely equate what appear to be bad decisions made by scott and those made by the officer who killed him there is no moral equivalency between running and killing , and anyone who argues this obdurate absurdity reveals a deficiency in their own humanity death is not the appropriate punishment for disobedience being entrusted with power does not shield imprudent use of power and one of the saddest and most frustrating features of our current debate about police use of force , in communities of color in particular , is the degree to which justice itself has been in this country social justice , equal treatment and violence exerted by structures of power against a vulnerable population should n't become a sprocket in our political machines this is about right and wrong , not right and left neither should we have such widely differing racial perceptions about whether use of force is appropriate and to what degree for instance , as the associated press seven of 10 whites polled , or 70 percent , said they can imagine a situation in which they would approve of a police officer striking a man most blacks and hispanics did not agree the article continued the poll results do n't surprise experts on american attitudes toward police , who say experiences and history with law enforcement shape opinions about the use of violence by officers furthermore , we as a nation simply must do a better job of collecting data about these kinds of cases so that we can all discuss them from a point of mutually accepted fact rather that as an outgrowth of tribal narratives as the fbi director , james b comey ,  how can we address concerns about use of force , ' how can we address concerns about officerinvolved shootings if we do not have a reliable grasp on the demographics and circumstances of those incidents \? we simply must improve the way we collect and analyze data to see the true nature of what s happening in all of our communities there will be an investigation and a trial in this case evidence will be examined and presented it is proper to wait for that but any exculpatory evidence must justify this use of force , not simply seek to excuse it that will most likely be a high bar the video that has now been made public is incredibly disturbing and may prove incontrovertible we will wait and see but it is important to remember that waiting is a luxury of time afforded to the living time has ceased for mr scott
cam talbot , thrust into the role of the rangers' starting goaltender after an injury to henrik lundqvist , was passed over by a premier junior hockey league , was overlooked by the biggest ncaa division i programs and was not drafted by any nhl team despite the long odds of his journey to the top of his profession , one need not look far from his native caledonia , ontario , to find the next cam talbot it says so right on two players' hockey sweaters the back of the uniforms for the junior c team in nearby glanbrook fittingly named the rangers is the domain of sponsors like o'neil s farm equipment and mitchell abbott insurance but talbot is personally defraying the expenses of the two teenage goaltenders playing for his old coaching staff , so their jerseys bear his name on the back , while other players' show the team sponsors it is a token of appreciation from a growing star to his hometown talbot gave a lot of young players something to look up to , said michigan tech goaltender jamie phillips , who is also from caledonia , a town of about 10 , 000 outside hamilton it s nice to see when you turn on the tv and hear the name caledonia , ontario , ' phillips added you feel proud that it s where you 're from lundqvist is expected to miss at least two more weeks as he convalesces after  as a rookie last season , talbot had a 941 save percentage , leading all nhl goaltenders who appeared in at least 20 games this season he has a 918 save percentage he has started the last six games , with the rangers going 411 , and the team is set to visit the metropolitan divisionleading islanders on monday night the organization is very confident in him , said jeff gorton , assistant general manager for the rangers he added there s no way to do it until he does it , right \? it s just a matter of gaining the experience and getting the opportunity and seeing what he does with it talbot , 27 , started playing hockey around age 8 , late by canadian standards , and played goalie because no one else wanted to try he broke his elbow and his foot and sustained a bad highankle sprain that slowed his development none of the ontario hockey league teams drafted talbot , so when he was 16 , he tried out for the hamilton junior red wings , a junior a team , and was cut a year later , in 2004 , talbot again went to training camp , planning to audition for the new coach , john mcdonald but the club had already added two new goalies , and talbot was shown the door again a short while later , though , a residency issue arose for one of the goalies who had made the team so i actually had released him , and then i had to call him and eat crow , mcdonald said thank god i did by midseason , talbot had established himself , and his team traded away his counterpart and installed talbot full time around that time , in 2005 , gorton said , rangers scouts in ontario began recognizing talbot s longterm potential they filed reports recommending that the team keep track of his development but not draft him there was no interest , no matter what level he played at , or did n't appear to be , his father , mark , said by talbot s third season with the junior red wings , colleges started taking an interest but only one , alabamahuntsville , was a division i team , so that was where he went a few other division i programs contacted talbot late in the process , after he started for the silvermedalwinning canada east team in the world junior a championships and was later named the most valuable player of the ontario provincial junior hockey league s western conference he stuck with his commitment because he thought that was the right thing to do , mark talbot said in hindsight , it paid off in spades for him one can hardly start a conversation with one of cam talbot s former coaches without the adjectives big and athletic bandied about regularly to describe the 6foot3inch , 195pound talbot it just looked like there was a goalie there somewhere , the former alabamahuntsville coach danton cole said while all goalies in their late teens are unfinished products , talbot was further from a professional track than most although talbot had always been quick with lateral movements , cole said he needed to improve his office work and trim down , which he did in short order determination was never an issue mcdonald said talbot had a steadfast work ethic and was the rare teenager to watch game film talbot delayed his entry to alabamahuntsville to finish some business administration classes he had started at nearby mohawk college even during blizzards , he would drag his goaltending coach , pat dipronio , to the rink he would spend hours on the ice after practice facing shots from the team s top scorer , spencer abbott , a future hockey east player of the year at maine who now plays for the maple leafs' ahl affiliate mcdonald said that if talbot gave up a goal in practice , he wanted the scorer to go back to his starting position and take the same route to the net so he could analyze how he beat him the first time so he would never beat him again on that not much has changed phillips works out with talbot at hamilton s on ice goaltending school in the offseason and said he often heard talbot tell shooters , do it again , do it again as a junior in the 200910 season , talbot led alabamahuntsville to an overtime victory over niagara for the college hockey america conference title , leading to the program s second ncaa tournament appearance , where the chargers played the nation s no 1 team , miami of ohio , in the first round talbot made 36 saves , but uah lost , 21 , after miami scored two powerplay goals they gave them a really good run , and it was all cam , gorton said they were on his back after that playoff run , the rangers' scouting staff gave the team s goaltending coach , benoit allaire , tapes of talbot allaire saw a player he could work with , which persuaded the rangers to give talbot a freeagent contract talbot played three full seasons with the rangers' ahl affiliate in hartford and improved each season , ascending from backup goalie to a shared role and then the clear starter when he was with us , he earned his position , hartford coach ken gernander said every opportunity he was given , he rose to the challenge in lundqvist s absence , talbot is again showing he belongs he took the long way around , right \? mark talbot said by telephone from pepsi center in denver , where he watched from a luxury suite as his son made 26 saves in a 63 rangers win on thursday i'm still kind of pinching myself and now here i am , right \?
paris a secondary school in northeastern has sent a 15yearold student home twice in the last two weeks for wearing a long skirt that the principal judged was an ostentatious sign of the girl s muslim faith the case has lit up social networks in and infuriated many of the country s muslims , who see the school system s censure of the girl as discriminatory a law forbids elementary and secondary school students to wear visible signs of their religious affiliation to school , including skullcaps for jews , noticeable crosses for christians and head scarves for muslims school officials , though , are increasingly construing the ban to apply to articles of clothing like long skirts and headbands , in ways that appear to vary from school to school it s a huge problem , said elsa ray , a spokeswoman for the collective against islamophobia in france the principal at the l o lagrange school in charlevillem zi res decided that the black maxiskirt the girl wore ran afoul of the rules and wrote to the girl s parents that their daughter had been sent home to change into more appropriate attire ms ray called it really an excessive interpretation of the law the collective has documented 130 similar cases across france since january 2014 , and ms ray said they were becoming more frequent the cases often involve skirt length , she said , but schools have also objected to sweaters or to headbands that they say are too broad and are meant to evoke head scarves because the girl in charlevillem zi res is a minor , she has been identified in french news reports by only her given name and initial , sarah k her case points to the difficulty in enforcing the french policy of la cit roughly , secularism which strives to keep religion strictly out of government and the public sector it has been invoked in recent years to restrict the places where muslim women can wear clothing concealing their bodies or faces the case also illustrates the gap between the ways french officials and muslims have understood the secularism rules sarah s mother in an interview posted online wednesday that although the family is observant , the parents never asked sarah to wear a head scarf , and that several of her five older sisters did not wear one about a year ago , she started to wear a veil , as i do , the magazine quoted the mother as saying but every morning when she gets to school , she takes it off because she knows it s forbidden the french use the word veil to refer both to head scarves and to garments such as the niqab sarah wore a head scarf muslims see removing their head scarves before going to school as demonstrating their willingness to abide by the rules but french officials linked the remainder of sarah s modest outfit to the head scarf she had been wearing before she entered the school building and concluded that the long skirt still signified that she was a muslim it is a sign of identity , said patrick dutot , the education director for the ardennes , the french department that includes charlevillem zi res the question is n't how long the skirt is , mr dutot said they come with an outfit that shows an affiliation that we respect but once at school , you have to return to a republican and secular space but they only remove the veil he said that several other girls had gone to the school similarly clothed and had been sent home to change without incident and that only sarah and her family had made a fuss sarah told a local newspaper , l'ardennais , on tuesday that the long skirt , one of two she and her mother bought at kiabi , a wellknown discount clothing chain , was not a religious symbol or a backdoor attempt to get around the ban the skirt was really nothing special , the paper quoted her as saying it was very simple there was nothing ostentatious about it a , the national daily , shows a warmly smiling girl in a black and white head scarf , a long black skirt that does not cover her shoes , a closefitting white shirt and a pale pink sweater over it without the head scarf , it would be hard to pinpoint her attire as typically muslim , and even less so if the skirt were the gray model rather than the black the school was having none of it , though the note that the principal wrote to sarah s parents included an implied threat of expulsion , telling them to rectify her clothes if you want her to continue her schooling as the matter attracted wider attention in the news media on wednesday , mr dutot and the higher education authorities for the region said there had been no talk of expelling sarah the authorities said in a statement that they expected to resolve the issue through mutual understanding with her and her family still , the collective against islamophobia in france said it was asking the minister of education to put a stop to what is happening and to make sure to provide concrete directives to the schools on how to properly and fairly interpret the ban
yosemite national park , calif afternoon gave way to evening , and the parade of restless clouds and the occasional bursts of rain had moved on from yosemite valley in their wake was the empty quiet of taft point , 3 , 000 feet above a famous green valley going gray in lateday shadow there were no tourists , only a raven , black and unhurried , circling at the edge of the cliff it spiraled upward , a silent signal of rising air a good sign for base jumping and wingsuit flying dean potter , a 43yearold professional climber and jumper , considered one of the world s best in a wing suit , stood a few feet from graham hunt , 29 , his apprentice and flying partner about 20 feet to their right was jen rapp , potter s longtime girlfriend , and the couple s dog , whisper rapp held a camera she framed the photos so that el capitan , across the valley toward the setting sun , was in the background base jumping is illegal in the national parks but that did not keep people from surreptitiously doing it , at the risk of being caught , especially in yosemite , where the sheer cliffs make it the best place on the planet to do it , some believe anywhere else you go is a compromise , potter would say the men had jumped from dozens of spots around yosemite valley , but they knew this route well at the end of a 11mile downhill trail from a small parking lot on glacier point road , taft point is marked by a railing meant to keep tourists from falling potter and hunt preferred jumping from an edge about 100 yards left , to the west they would drop hundreds of feet with their arms and legs spread , the webbing between their limbs and the baffles inside their suits filling with air until falling turned to soaring they would fly right , toward the heart of the valley there is a sloping rib of a ridge there , a relatively unremarkable feature called lost brother it is not marked on the park maps handed to visitors it juts downward into the valley before it ends abruptly into a vertical wall known mostly to climbers in that ridge is a notch , a v like a rifle sight potter and hunt had made the jump many times , sometimes together , sometimes not hunt had done it without potter several days before he would usually steer himself through the notch potter had been through the notch a couple of times , but he usually went around the ridge to the left it depended on how well they maintained altitude once they began to fly the men were zipped into their suits they did not wait for the full cloak of dusk a breeze from behind caught their attention but did not send a strong enough warning to pause it was 7 25 on may 16 i do n't mind if i'm on the record , potter wrote in an email in march , discussing the decadeslong fight to legalize base jumping within national park service sites , and especially at yosemite , with its unique valley of sheer cliffs i 've been flying in the park since 2003 and the nps knows it , but they have n't been able to catch me or prove anything , he added potter offered a tour of the basejumping culture at yosemite , allowing himself to be captured on video leaping , illegally , from the cliffs at dusk or dawn and landing before being detected there are at least 10 local guys who are regularly base jumping in yosemite and probably 50 to 100 others annually traveling to yosemite from around the world to experience the birthplace of bigwall base , he wrote potter knew the long history of enforcement at yosemite robin heid was arrested and charged with jumping off el capitan in 1979 , which helped lead to a midsummer trial run for legal parachuting there in 1980 , aborted after six weeks of unruliness base jumping took hold in the global extremesports culture of the 1990s , and stories of yosemite rangers hiding in trees and using nightvision goggles became legend in 1999 , frank gambalie drowned in the merced river after trying to escape rangers months later , in a protest of park policy and enforcement , jan davis fell to her death from el capitan she wore a borrowed rig , not wanting her own gear confiscated in 2010 , ammon mcneely was caught and subdued with a  in between , dozens have been arrested , jailed and subjected to thousands of dollars in fines and have had their gear confiscated several have gone to court to challenge the national park service rules banning the activity , ultimately to no avail it made no sense to potter , and plenty of others , that climbing was legal , and that falling was legal , but that stopping a fall with a lifesaving parachute was illegal , a result of the application of an arcane law banning the delivery or retrieval of a person or object by parachute , helicopter or other airborne means but it was 2015 potter was hopeful he believed he could be both renegade and diplomat the nps and the law enforcement have changed a lot in the past year or two , potter wrote in march most all of the lead positions in the park service are now held by people who either do n't have a huge problem with base or are quite lenient when it comes to catching and prosecuting jumpers for sure the rangers enforce the law if they see us , they pursue , but for the most part , they are not hunting us as before and there seems to be a lot more respect on both sides a sport that began as a rebel offshoot of sky diving had evolved into a popular and respected derivative of rock climbing places in switzerland , norway and italy welcomed base jumpers and yosemite , the best place maybe the safest place , with its vertical cliffs and grassy landing areas had only six known basejumping deaths in its history , and none since 1999 , despite thousands of jumps since potter jumped hunt followed , like a shadow rapp clicked photographs the men fell out of the frame before her lens caught them falling away , soaring with wings spread hunt quickly passed potter his suit was made for speed potter had set records for long flights and preferred loft he had been in canada working on a design to allow him to land on his belly on glacial ice , no parachute necessary he s low , rapp thought to herself why is he going toward the notch \? she saw hunt veer left , as if to go around the ridge , then quickly back to the right potter held his line for the notch they disappeared into the hole that led to the dusky valley rapp heard a thwap her mind tried to tell her that it was the familiar sound of a parachute deploying it was followed almost immediately by a duller , heavier sound rapp waited alone on the cliff s edge for more clues from below none came she clicked through her camera to retrace the flight paths in the photos in two dimensions , without depth perception , it was hard to tell what happened to the shrinking specks in the frames there was hunt , who disappeared into the grayness of the rocks there was potter , who made it through the leading edge of the notch , a downward halfpipe , and fell out of sight somewhere far below was rebecca haynie , hunt s girlfriend of a few months she had been on a hike when hunt called saying that he and potter planned to jump at taft point meet at the meadow at 7 30 , hunt said she aborted her hike and went to the lodge area in yosemite valley to get a drink and pass the time she did not see a text message that hunt sent at 6 55 until about 7 25 because of spotty cellular service in yosemite he had asked her to turn on her twoway radio so they could communicate she quickly texted back that she would in a few minutes she drove around the darkening , forested roads for 90 minutes , waiting to hear from hunt again i was putting my faith in a lot of irrational places , she said in a phone interview even though i knew what probably happened in the dwindling light , rapp rushed back up the trail to the parking lot she drove her car the 13 miles or so back to wawona road , made a right and headed the 10 miles down to the floor of the valley she went to el capitan meadow , but there was no one there her phone had no text messages unsure of what to do or where to go , she drove to the rented house that she and potter shared in yosemite west , a cluster of homes back up wawona road , past the glacier point turnoff the couple recently bought 31 acres nearby and had plans to build their own home that day , rainy and cool , had been spent clearing trees and brush , and hunt was there to help , until the clearing skies led to the idea of making an evening jump off taft point the house was dark and empty mind racing , rapp studied the photos and scrolled through various outcomes in her head maybe the sounds she heard were hunt crashing maybe potter saw it happen and was searching for his friend maybe potter crashed and was hurt maybe they were both ok but were hiding from rangers maybe they had been arrested her mind was a tug of war with hope maybe they would pull up to the house any minute a car came at 9 30 out stepped haynie she was alone a little more than a year earlier , in march 2014 , one of potter s best friends and flying partners , it was only the second known basejumping death at zion , but the first had come just over a month earlier leary , alone , had apparently jumped off a sandstone tower called west temple and tried to fly through a gap in the three marys , a set of statuelike formations resembling chess pieces leary was missing for days , and potter was among those who rushed to zion to help find him potter and a few other climbers reached leary s body , but the park service would not allow them to bring it down rangers packaged the body , and a helicopter , borrowed from grand canyon national park , lifted it out there are places within the united states that one can base jump , but not in zion , the park s thensuperintendent said in a news release there are many reasons for this , from resource protection , to visitor and employee safety , to wilderness mandates base jumping is not congruent with the founding purpose of this park ray o'neal , a longtime ranger at zion , said that the problem with base jumping in national parks was not necessarily one of safety or rescue costs , as many jumpers presume the reason we would like to discourage it is not so much because of the danger of it , but the spectacle of it , o'neal said during an interview at the park s emergency operations center we like to think that people come here to enjoy the scenery , and not the spectacle of people jumping scott gediman , a yosemite park spokesman , agreed on average , 14 yosemite visitors die each year from falls or drownings , car accidents or natural causes rarely are they base jumpers we 're not against base jumping as a sport , gediman said while sitting on a bench at yosemite , where a rappelling accident had killed a climber the day before but we have to look at the big picture and its appropriateness in the park the frustration for potter and other base advocates has been the apparent lack of consistency in park policies it is generally legal to catch a fish but not to pick flowers horses are allowed on many trails , but mountain bikers are not the merced river is a jumble of colorful rafts carrying tourists el capitan is a dottodot slate of climbers and ropes and yosemite even allows hang gliding on a limited basis off glacier point , not far from taft point potter was allowed to string tightropes between formations but if he fell , it was illegal , in theory , to prevent his own death with a parachute in 2006 , the last time the national park service updated its management policies , individual park superintendents were allowed the discretion to pursue approval of base jumping none have \( the exception in the national park system is the annual bridge day at new river gorge , in west virginia , where hundreds take part in a oneday jumping celebration that dates back nearly 40 years \) potter thought times were changing he pondered ways to devise a permit system , to limit the number of base jumpers and to ensure that only welltrained jumpers would leap into the valley he did not have that part figured out yet but it was his goal he wanted nothing more than to base jump and fly wing suits legally in yosemite , the place that he loved more than anywhere else the women drove back into the black valley they looked for people they knew climbers camping or hanging around the village and the bar there were no familiar faces at about 10 30 , they showed up at the door of mike gauthier , yosemite s chief of staff , a conduit between park bureaucracy and the climbing community a call to the yosemite dispatcher quickly deflated hope that potter and hunt were in custody there were no reports of base jumpers caught by park rangers a latenight search was called rangers and volunteers from yosemite search and rescue were told that a pair of base jumpers were missing off taft point it was not until they saw rapp that they realized that one of the men missing was dean potter everyone knew him i hoped he was just hurt , rapp said maybe he had two broken femurs maybe he was bleeding to death we just needed to get up there she tried to leave the searching to the experts but at 4 am , helplessly waiting , she took binoculars and headed to the base of the canyon below lost brother she scanned the darkness for movement or color she screamed into the black void above her she got no response there were still no answers from above by daybreak a helicopter took off and headed over the top of lost brother two bodies were quickly spotted neither man had deployed a parachute hunt had cleared the base of the notch , but having most likely entered the downward funnel on a diagonal path , he had crashed into the right wall turns out the sounds i heard , i think , were the sounds of graham hitting a tree and then the wall , rapp said potter was found several hundred feet farther into the notch speculation began immediately that maybe the sight of hunt , or the air disturbance caused by his maneuvers , had affected potter s concentration or control neither man was wearing a gopro video recorder , contrary to some news reports , but potter had jumped with a smartphone strapped to his head it was heavily damaged , but park service investigators have it , along with rapp s photos , hoping to mine them for clues rapp returned to taft point three days after the accident by then , there was a memorial at the cliff s edge , where potter and hunt had made their final jump el capitan sits across the valley a little to the left yosemite falls can be seen a little to the right , over the top of the brown , downsloping ridge with the notch the memorial included feathers , a beer can , tibetan prayer flags and a photograph of potter rapp sat alone on a rock a raven appeared unflinchingly , it approached and patiently ate a piece of salami out of her hand it had never happened to her before the way the raven looked at me , so intently , so , rapp said , the thought drifting , unfinished yeah , it was dean

every news broadcaster , commentator and writer has proclaimed the massacre of the french satirical cartoonists and editorialists to be a tragedy and perhaps it was but then , so we are told , was the death of michael brown in ferguson , mo broadcasters and reporters daily proclaim as tragic the fatalities that result when , say , a family car spins out of control on an icy street and crashes just as , every spring , drunken high school students die tragically when they drive off the road it s a staple of the prom season the critic george steiner declared the death of tragedy in 1961 , but tragedy thrives today indeed , these days , any event that causes suffering or distress earns tragedy s mournful title but if everything that is avoidable , stupid and simply untoward is tragic , then nothing really is not if we insist on its description of a specific kind of human sorrow in devaluing the word , we devalue what it is meant to express we trivialize what we wish to make truly important since the greeks first coined the word , tragedy has required not only a calamitous event but one that can be judged as meaningful it has to matter in some greater manner that is , ideally , instructive tragedy is , then , a representation of an action that is heroic and complete , and of a certain magnitude it is never trivial for an event to qualify as tragedy , its telling demands some kind of emotional catharsis , a resolution to the losses it details this month s je suis charlie march in paris qualifies but more important , to be worthy of its name , tragedy must instruct you emerge from tragedy equipped against lies , wrote the playwright howard baker in 1989 after the musical , you 're anybody s fool has the paris massacre made us more aware , more sensitive to lies \? reports suggest that it has merely made us afraid , angry and militant in our responses that s something different in the old days , tragedy was the exclusive province of the great and powerful with marlowe s doctor faustus or shakespeare s hamlet , their tragic flaws , enacted , became the definition of tragedy it may be angst \( hamlet \) , or hubris \( faustus \) , but it s there and we know , watching , that the ruinous end will be of their own making when tragedy became a common ill , the tragic flaw went republican no better example exists than arthur miller s death of a salesman and its truly tragic hero , willy loman , a salesman with nothing to sell as audience members , we want to say , no , willie , do n't , but we know that his inevitable suicide will be the result not of his failure but of ours , the fault of a society in which employment is a happenstance that can be withdrawn from even the hardest worker if tragedy is , as nietzsche believed , about the terrors of reality , then miller s tragedy is about not a flaw of character but of our world and here is the essence of modern tragedies like the deaths of michael brown , 12yearold tamir rice , who took a toy gun into a cleveland park , and trayvon martin at the hands of the selfappointed neighborhood watchman george zimmerman individually , they are sad , senseless , stupid events in their deaths alone , there is no catharsis , no relief in the telling , nothing instructive and certainly no insurance against either falsehoods or future , similar events the tragedy resides in the larger context , the greater issues that each suggests but none completes together , they appear as inevitable deaths that result from a series of truly tragic american flaws a system of justice that does not serve populations in need of protection law enforcement that allows police officers to be a threat to those they are sworn to protect and inequalities of education and opportunity that ensure the racial divide will continue the same is true of the charlie hebdo murders there is something sadly comical about the fact that islamist extremists targeted not essayists or politicians but cartoonists , the court jesters of modern public debate the tragedy lies not in the simple fact of their murder but in the decades of military encroachment and colonial expansion that helped to radicalize a religious sect it lies , too , in our culture s failure to integrate new members in an ethos that is inclusive and assures a political space for legitimate complaint that s modern tragedy for you in that sense , tragedy is everywhere lurking , waiting for the next opportunity to show its power our tragedy is this collective , fatal flaw , which insists on demonizing those we disagree with and turning them into mortal enemies the question is whether we will react tragically , breeding more terror in our responses , or , instructed in its causes , search for resolution
death is nothing at all , the english theologian henry scott holland wrote a century ago in a reflection that is often quoted at funerals death is but life extended , holland said i have only slipped away to the next room nothing has happened everything remains exactly as it was the words are as haunting today as they must have been in 1910 when holland delivered them in a sermon but in the realms of politics , medical ethics , religion and technological innovation , the reality is that death is far , very far , from nothing at all it is the source of challenging legal and moral questions , perhaps none more searing than whether doctors ought to be permitted to usher incurably ill patients into that next room should they be able to help sufferers end their lives by supplying medication that would make looming death come faster \? five states , in various forms , countenance doctorassisted dying others are considering it in california , is scheduled to receive a hearing this week a in new york that seeks a similar result was filed in state supreme court last month by a group of doctors and dying patients the emotional wallop of these issues is selfevident , and it is captured in the latest installment of , a series of video documentaries that explore major news stories of the past looking back at where we have been to see where we may be headed where better to start than with dr , the michigan pathologist who came to be known as doctor death \? he claimed to have helped end the lives of at least 130 ailing people few americans were neutral about dr kevorkian , who to some , he was a force for good , a doctor who grabbed the country by the lapels and made it think hard about how to deal with the severe pain that many people endure as the end approaches to others , though , he was a selfpromoting merchant of death , ghoulishly interested in the mechanics of killing more than in palliative care for those in need of it to the authorities in michigan , he was , ultimately , a criminal he spent on a seconddegree murder conviction after he had erased the thin , yet legally indelible , line separating assisted suicide from no longer content with merely providing patients with the means to take their own lives , the doctor did the deed himself , no less euthanasia is not permitted anywhere in the united states direct action by a doctor to take a life is deemed a step too far even by states that have no problem with indirect action letting physicians prescribe pills that patients themselves then swallow are these distinctions without significant difference \? dr kevorkian believed so it is the sort of question that lawmakers and judges , too , are called on to answer those who brought the new york lawsuit argue that equalprotection rights are violated by an existing state ban on doctorassisted suicide \( or aid in dying , as its advocates prefer \) how is it , the plaintiffs effectively ask , that doctors in new york are allowed to hasten death for some terminally ill patients by removing life support but are prohibited from hastening it for others by way of a prescription \? arguments , pro and con , have not changed much over the years assisted dying was and is anathema to many religious leaders , notably in the roman catholic church for the american medical association , it remains fundamentally incompatible with the physician s role as healer some opponents express slipperyslope concerns that certain patients might feel they owe it to their overburdened families to call it quits that the poor and the uninsured , disproportionately , will have their lives cut short that medication might be prescribed for the mentally incompetent that doctors might move too readily to bring an end to those in the throes of we should address what would give them purpose , not give them a handful of pills , , a prominent oncologist and medical ethicist , told retro report but to those in the other camp , the slipperyslope arguments are overwrought citing available information from the few jurisdictions where assisted dying is permitted , supporters of dying with dignity laws say that those looking for an early exit tend to be relatively well off and well educated there is no evidence , they say , to suggest that such laws have been used promiscuously by either patients or their doctors as for the medical association s ethical judgment , it focuses too much on the physician , and not enough on the patient , said dr marcia angell , a former executive editor of the new england journal of medicine in 2012 , dr angell asked , why should anyone the state , the medical profession , or anyone else presume to tell someone else how much suffering they must endure as their life is ending \? in this country , oregon has the most experience with this issue its voters endorsed doctorassisted death in a 1994 referendum and again in late 1997 after the united states supreme court ruled unanimously that year that there is no constitutional right to die and that this is a matter for the states to decide washington state voters followed oregon s lead in 2008 a year later , assisted dying was made possible in montana by a state supreme court decision in 2013 , the vermont legislature gave its blessing , and last year so did a district court judge in new mexico , a ruling now under appeal the oregon model is widely invoked to obtain deathinducing medication , a patient must have a terminal illness , with no expectation of living beyond six more months two doctors have to attest to that the patient must also be judged mentally competent , must be able to swallow the drugs and must be the one to ask for them twice verbally , with each request separated by at least 15 days any physician unwilling to take part in this does not have to in oregon s 17 years of experience with these procedures , starting in 1998 , the numbers have steadily risen there were 24 prescriptions for lethal drugs in 1998 the 2014 figure was 155 , according to the state s many people who ask for the medication typically , onethird do not use it , for whatever reason of the 155 who received prescriptions last year , only 105 died from ingesting the drugs presumably , many of the other 50 died as well , just not from medication in all , across the 17 years , 1 , 327 oregonians received these drugs , and 859 died from taking them that toll amounts to less than twotenths of 1 percent of the nearly 530 , 000 people who died in oregon during that period it hardly suggests that assisted death is rampant but numbers go only so far in the ethical , religious and legal anguishing inherent in so grave a matter those advocating a statesanctioned right to die , like the group , say momentum is on their side , but it may be too soon to tell and , stirring though they are , are unlikely to be much of a guide life means all that it ever meant , he said it is the same as it ever was in america s juridical and political precincts , it is uncertain if that sentiment still holds true
no , i don t think he will not the nomination , not the presidency but since that s what just about everyone thinks , let s play around a little and try to imagine how cruz could at least imitate barry goldwater and become the gop nominee here s the federalist s ben domenech with three reasons why the conventional wisdom on cruz might be wrong first ted cruz matches up with the activist base better than any other significant candidate in a long time i don t think people outside of that base really understand how powerful cruz s appeal is to the populist energized conservative voter , which is of course just a faction of the right , but is a sizable faction and he doesn t just match up with them on policy , he matches up with their brashness , their yearning for someone who loves the taste of blood in his mouth second to the degree that this is a nomination battle about who has done the most to fight the obama administration about two key issues amnesty and obamacare ted cruz can claim that mantle and beat his opponents over the head with their stances on these topics we underestimate how going soft on both of these issues is going to play in the gop primary this cycle , particularly in the early going as i ve noted before , most of the candidates this time around are in roughly the same position on immigration either full throatedly in favor of reform or tepidly in favor of it but there is no indication that the position of the party base is at all moderated compared to 2012 , and obama s approach to executive amnesty has made the issue all the more toxic cruz can argue that his only fault is boldness that when the party balked about doing its utmost to stop obamacare , he went to the mattresses , and it led to sweeping wins at the ballot box and when it comes to immigration , he will attack jeb , rubio , christie , huckabee , walker , and others as being soft on the issue or tacitly in favor of what obama did by executive action and third while the purest conservative candidate rarely wins , that assumes a divided right cruz may end up running in a field where the other candidates are scrabbling over support from the chamber of commerce , wall street , and establishment dollars while he could corner the populist talk radio base cruz s critics need to hope that rick perry , bobby jindal , rand paul and others horn in on this area of the right because if the election includes a crowded field outside of that faction including bush , christie , huckabee , walker , rubio , and say kasich that only serves to help cruz s case i think the second point is the most important one here in a deep and crowded field , cruz isn t going to rise to the top on affect alone he needs a wedge , a club , a forcing mechanism and one reason among many to discount his chances at the nomination is that most of the leading candidates \( bush , rubio , walker , maybe even paul \) are in better positions relative to nate silver s pareto frontier meaning they re both more electable than the texas senator and , if not quite as conservative , sufficiently conservative to put them up toward the upper righthand quadrant of an electability ideology axis i don t think cruz is going to base his primary pitch on selling his electability \( his recurring promise that if we nominate a conservative , we win ! doesn t count \) , so he needs a way to make his rivals seem a lot more ideologically suspect to primary voters than they look right now and there s no better place to start than immigration it s the issue that mitt romney mitt romney ! used most effectively against both rick perry and newt gingrich in the last cycle s debates , obama s executive amnesty has if anything raised the pressure since then , and as domenech notes the leading 2016 candidates are all out of step with the base to varying degrees \( depending on how walker s flipflop ultimately plays \) so cruz s pitch on immigration can be genuinely substantive , not just stylistic it s an issue where his claim to speak for the base against the establishment is largely vindicated by the actual records of his rivals , and where his chances of getting traction as the voice of true conservatism seem by far the strongest unfortunately for him i don t think a singleissue strategy is going to carry cruz to the nomination \( and not even mickey kaus can persuade me otherwise \) so then , having gotten traction on one issue , he would need to find a way to do it again , and again , and again picking as many fights , dragging his rivals into as many fights , and flatout inventing as many fights as time and media attention permit , and turning any kind of tepidity and trimming by his opponents whether it s over common core , obamacare repeal , the tax code , the supreme court s likely samesex marriage ruling , or whatever unexpected issues the campaign throws up into a sign of their ideological untrustworthiness , their secret rino spirit he needs to be like romney in his debate with perry over tuition for illegal immigrants , crossed with , well , himself during the government shutdown debate and he needs to always be like that , on multiple fronts against multiple rivals , until everyone he s running against seems much , much more moderate and cryptoliberal than their records would suggest , and he rises , howard deanlike , as the only possible candidate for the republican wing of the gop so that s basically the path crowd out jindal and carson and perry , redefine walker and rubio and maybe even huckabee as squishes and cast paul as a libertarian kook , have a bunch of great debate moments , and fight your way to a showdown with jeb but not too fast , because cruz would want the centerright portion of the field to stay divided and for various candidates stay in long enough to divide the moderateconservative vote , enabling him to win a number of primaries the way john mccain won south carolina 2008 , on 33 percent and a prayer he would need rubio and jeb \( or , less , plausibly , christie and jeb or kasich and jeb \) to fight scorchedearth and ruinouslyexpensive battles over new hampshire and florida , and he would probably need two centerright candidates still in the race when it moved to the midwest , so that he could hope to win some states by just putting together the votes that santorum and gingrich won against romney in michigan and ohio then he would hope to dominate the south and the high plains , win big in texas , and thanks to winnertakeall rules make the numbers all add up and then boom , ted cruz is your 2016 nominee on paper , i d give this scenario very slim odds on strict party decides lines insurgents rarely win nominations when they win they usually come in \( as obama did \) with real institutional advantages and support within the party apparatus , none of which cruz will have \( quite the reverse , in fact \) and the party simply has too many more electableseeming options who are also ideologically acceptable but every historical pattern alters at some point , every system breaks down , and sometimes the swan is black so the people arguing that cruz could , in theory , be the nominee do have a case but i would just add this even allowing for the black swan possibility , i think cruz is a poorer candidate than some of his admirers think to be a bird of that dark hue i wrote my column on sunday about how voters often oscillate between candidates they really want to vote for and candidates they feel like they ought to vote for , with the ought candidate usually prevailing in the end cruz clearly is not an ought candidate , so he needs to be the rare want candidate who wins but even there , i am skeptical that enough actual human beings , watching him on television and listening to him speak , will feel that kind of pull not because of his political positions , but because of his looks and mien and affect , his appearance and selfpresentation , which i think are real obstacles to the kind of identification that the most successful insurgent candidates and populist dark horses usually inspire this is just a personal impression , without reams of data behind it \( well , except for cruz s notsogreat poll numbers \) but i think the two different conservative writers who both  reached for the word oleaginous to describe cruz are getting at the core problem with his candidacy as smart and accomplished as he is , as much as he s done to play to what domenech calls the populist energized conservative voter , there just isn t enough there for people to really relate to , identify with , and like and that isn t a problem you can solve by having ivy league degrees , by being more conservative than your rivals , or by outdebating them on points which is why , in the end , i look at cruz and see someone who might have less in common with ronald reagan and barack obama than he has with another harvard graduate and expert debater who once competed well in the iowa caucuses i speak , of course , of alan keyes
chicago adolfo davis admits he was a swaggering thug by the age of 14 as he roamed and dealt drugs with a south side gang he also describes a childhood of emotional and physical deprivation a mother fixated on crack , an absent father , a grandmother s overflowing and chaotic apartment from the age of 6 or 7 , he often had to buy his own food or go hungry , so he collected cans , pumped gas for tips and shoplifted at 10 , he went to juvenile hall for wresting 3 worth of food stamps and 75 cents from a girl at 12 , he fell in with the gangster disciples i loved them , they protected me , they were my family , mr davis said in a recent interview at 14 , in 1990 , he was out with two gang members when they robbed a rival drug house and shot the occupants , leaving two dead now 38 , he has spent the last 24 years in prison on a mandatory sentence of life without parole but his future will be reconsidered in a new sentencing hearing here on monday it is one of the first such proceedings in illinois to result from the supreme court s landmark ruling in that juvenile murderers should not be subject to mandatory life without parole the exact role of mr davis , then known as spooncake , is disputed he said he had stood guard at the doorway and had not pulled a trigger prosecutors suggested otherwise but did not prove it in any case , he shared culpability for what were essentially executions tried and convicted as an adult , he received the automatic penalty at the time for a double murder , a term of natural life without parole in the 2012 ruling , the supreme court did not say life terms were never appropriate but , building on earlier rulings that , and citing research on brain development , the court said sentencing must take account of mitigating factors like the offender s background and age , and consider the potential for change mr davis was one of about 2 , 500 prisoners across the country at the time who were serving life without parole for juvenile murders , most of them as a result of mandatory sentences that gave judges no leeway , according to the , an advocacy group the 2012 decision did not say whether the new rules should apply retroactively , to cases long closed since then , state and lower federal courts have disagreed , creating drastic differences for prisoners depending on where they live ten states , including illinois , are applying the standard to pre2012 cases and have started the process of resentencing four states louisiana , michigan , minnesota and pennsylvania , with about 1 , 130 prisoners who could be affected have declined to make the ruling retroactive the supreme court is expected to clarify the issue next fall , when it hears the appeal of a convict in louisiana in illinois , mr davis s suit was one of several that led the illinois supreme court to rule in favor of retroactive application to the roughly 80 state prisoners who received mandatory life for crimes committed as juveniles the state attorney general disagreed and appealed to the federal supreme court , but in december , the court declined to take the case here and around the country , victim rights groups have strongly opposed the reopening of past sentences the families of the victims will suffer the most , said jennifer bishopjenkins , a cofounder and board member of the  she became a champion of victim rights 25 years ago when her pregnant sister and her sister s husband were murdered in winnetka , ill , by a 16yearold who received a mandatory life sentence when i started thinking of the possibility that we 'd have to go back to court , i could n't sleep for four months , she said our mother was devastated a new sentencing hearing in that case is scheduled for this month while ms bishopjenkins feels confident that the killer , because of the particulars of his acts , will have the life sentence renewed , she noted that the transcript of his original sentencing hearing was missing and that key witnesses were dead or gone recreating a fair sentencing process is often impossible in old cases , she said , and there are ample existing ways to pursue what seem to be unwarranted life sentences , such as executive clemency or other petitions mr davis s supporters said they had not been able to find any relatives of the two murder victims in his case none have come forward to comment on his resentencing in the interview at the cook county jail , mr davis spoke of his childhood and what he describes as a profound personal breakthrough that occurred during a fouryear stay in a maximumsecurity prison , sitting in a cell for 23 hours a day his story suggests multiple failures of his family , of the childwelfare system , of the juvenilejustice system and , he admits now , of a boy who valued toughness over empathy his life sentence put him in a succession of juvenile and adult prisons where gang rivalries festered he continued to lash out , getting into fights and committing other violations that led the authorities to send him , in 1998 , to the supermax prison , now closed , in tamms , ill mr davis and his supporters in his new appeal , including a priest who has known him for 24 years and a therapist who treated him at tamms , describe a changed man a claim that cook county prosecutors challenged when they successfully opposed his clemency bid in 2012 the solitude at tamms was almost unbearable , mr davis said he spent hours playing games of fourhanded spades but the unaccustomed quiet time also led to insight , he said , and his first appreciation of human contact and trust when i got out and got hugs from my family , i cried , he said i had n't realized how important that was i understood why women say they like to cuddle , he said sheepishly as part of his therapy in the supermax , mr davis started to write poetry , much of it , initially , outpourings of rage toward his absent parents how could you bring me into this world when you knew you was n't ready \? one of his first poems asked by 2003 , his writings , which circulated in prison magazines , focused more on the daily horrors of prison and offered warnings to others young blood , you think it s cool , he wrote , but you 'll end up dead or in the pen in 2005 , he even started to forgive his mother , though she never visited him in prison , writing , i never felt your pain , because i was dealing with my own pain before the hearing on monday , mr davis s lawyers patricia soung of the loyola law school in los angeles and rachel steinback , a lawyer with the civil rights law firm loevy loevy in chicago prepared a sentencing memo calling for his release because of his remorse , his growth and his mentoring of others while in prison the cook county prosecutors have not prepared a written statement , but they are expected to argue for a new life sentence opposing the 2012 clemency bid , the prosecutors said young adolfo had been an active and willing participant in the murders and was not simply a na ve child being led astray by older friends though it was never established in court , the prosecutors said there was evidence that he had fired a gun that night and that he did not dispute that he had carried one to the scene they cited his lengthy juvenile record and disputed the claim that he had become an exemplary prisoner , noting that he was caught receiving marijuana from a visitor in 2006 mr davis called that a stupid decision petitioner may have been 14 years of age at the time of the murders but packed a lifetime of experience as a criminal and gang member in that short amount of time , they wrote the two sides will present their cases orally before judge angela petrone of the cook county circuit court during or after the hearing , the judge could order anything from a new life term to an immediate release for time served after emerging from the supermax , mr davis signed up for a correspondence course and earned a high school diploma he became a teacher s aide in basic education classes , and started mentoring troubled young men , some in prison and some outside , by telephone , working through the rev david kelly of the

how can you rely on someone s opinion of a book if you don t know what that person reads , and what else she likes \? that s become the monthly instigation for the shelf , ipad , bed table column books inspire a number of posts on motherlode , and my appreciation for those books is worth more to you as readers if you have a sense of what else clicks for me so in the spirit of nick hornby s stuff i ve been reading column in the believer , every month i share not only what i ve been loving , but also what i ve been reading , in total , including the books i thought i would read and the books i read part of and the books that really just turned out to be aspirational \( there is a reasonably complete list at the end of this column \) i read a lot this month , partly because i accompanied my husband to his college reunion , with our children , and they were all on a reading kick \( something i thought would never , ever happen in the case of my youngest son in particular \) they ve been reading more , and i ve been reading more \( wondering what caught their attention \? in the case of my 13yearold , i ve forgotten for the others , it was the warriors series for my formerly reluctant reader 9yearold son , who now no longer hears us when we speak to him the name of this book is secret for my almost 11yearold daughter and nuts to you for my 9yearold daughter \) i bought a lot of books , too , for the same reason duke has a wonderful independent bookstore on campus , one that s both extremely small and extremely well curated the gothic bookshop what i read , with the greatest enthusiasm , were memoirs rebecca barry s recipes for a beautiful life , jillian lauren s everything you ever wanted , jane borden s i totally meant to do that , and paul daugherty s an uncomplicated life i also finished ron suskind s wonderful life , animated \( and had to stare out the window of the plane really hard and blink away tears \) once i start a memoir that i like , i tend to finish it right away , unless i m savoring it , or unless it s on my kindle , which for whatever reason makes it easier for me to set things aside and forget about them \( that was the case with life , animated \) i think i need that book , sitting there , inviting me in and i don t need my email , facebook and twitter accounts doing the same recipes for a beautiful life a memoir in stories just barely edged out everything you ever wanted for the title of the book i most enjoyed spending time with this month both the story of one family s move to upstate new york , with all the accompanying city mouse drama , and the story of the journey from the creative young adult nurturing a career to a creative regular adult trying to nurture that career while supporting a family , it reminded me in some ways of shirley jackson s great life among the savages \( which , by the way , has just been reissued by penguin books \) recipes is anecdotal , funny and telling , with the kinds of momentary glimpses of ordinary days that reflect something larger and funny did i mention funny \? and as optimistic as the title is , it s also a story about failure failure , and notexactlythesuccessyou dimagined , and then picking up and getting on with it and it s about hating your family once in a while i always like that everything you ever wanted is really wonderful it s just not an entirely easy book broadreaching as well as introspective \( more like the glass castle than life among the savages \) , it chronicles a series of events that s only partially within the writer s control jillian lauren \( who also wrote some girls \) tells her story of infertility , of adoption , and of moving past a history of drug use \( and a stint in a harem \) while watching other friends who are unable to escape that past she is disowned by her parents after her first memoir comes out her newly adopted son has the kinds of challenges that often come with children adopted after infancy , and her marriage \( to the weezer bassist scott shriner \) struggles through it all , she writes , and she doesn t sugarcoat a thing it s not as easy a book to curl up with casually on the couch as recipes for a beautiful life , but i loved it , too it s a rewarding read as for the rest , none of the fiction i m reading is of the can t put it down can t pick it up because i won t put it down variety this month i like alexander mccall smith s emma , but it s hard to get emotionally wrapped up in it , because it s hard to stop watching the technique of rewriting a classic and trying to remember what he has changed and what happened in the original i did finish after birth but without as much enthusiasm as i d hoped it started off strong , but carried on in the same key being a trapped new mother in a town with no identity of your own , watching other people change and grow around you , is indeed frustratingly , intensely claustrophobic reading about it was unfortunately a little claustrophobic for me too i suspect i would have liked it more a decade ago the book read in some ways like a memoir \( meaning it s that honest and accurate , not that the author is fictionalizing her life \) without the eventual change and selfdiscovery that a memoirist nearly always needs \( see everything i always wanted above \) that may be why i like memoir so that s what i read in april , and how i read it but if you re going to buy only one book this month , make it life among the savages when it comes to just sheer honest , wry , frustrated , findingwaystoappreciateit writing about family life , we all sit at shirley jackson s feet \( noting , as we do so , that she was also the master of writing creepy horror short stories , which figures \) if you haven t read it , you must if you have , read it again i will and if i mentioned reading something here , and you want to know more , ask and i ll answer in the comments there s just not room for them all books i bought maggie shipstead astonish me mary norris between you and me alexander mccall smith emma mohsin hamid discontent and its civilizations jane borden i totally meant to do that julia rothman farm anatomy laura overdeck and jim paillot bedtime math the truth comes out books i bought and finished jane borden i totally meant to do that ron suskind life , animated books i was given that i finished rebecca barry recipes for a beautiful life josh levs all in \( i ll write about this later in the month \) jillian lauren everything you ever wanted paul daugherty an uncomplicated life laura vanderkam i know how she does it \( i wrote a little about this earlier and will probably write more later because it s just such a different take on worklife balance \) elisa albert after birth books i read part of mary norris between you and me \( i ll finish this \) alexander mccall smith emma \( i know how it ends but i ll probably finish it \) mohsin hamid discontent and its civilizations \( unsure \) lm montgomery anne of green gables \( i already finished this many times but i also read part of it this month \) books people sent me that i read part of lior zoref mindsharing \( i ll finish this \) ylonda gault caviness child , please \( i ll finish this \) books people sent me that i kept with the intention of reading elisabeth egan a window opens christine breen her name is rose amy seek god and jetfire jillian lauren everything you always wanted tracy slater the good shufu deanna fei girl in glass elena and clare b dunkle elena vanishing jen hatmaker for the love kay wyma i m happy for you jessica peillmeininghaus the gnome project
chicago an exuberant crowd that included publicschool teachers , union bus drivers and nursing home workers packed into new mount pilgrim missionary baptist church on this city s west side on saturday afternoon as karen lewis , the president of the chicago teachers union , issued an urgent plea i am asking you , i am begging you , and in my teacher voice i am telling you , go vote , ms lewis , who wore a chuy button on each lapel , called out , as a cheer rose through the highceilinged church go vote ! she called out again go vote ! at the heart of the campaign that has threatened to topple mayor are labor unions amalgamated transit union locals , the service employees international union s illinois state council and , perhaps above all , the chicago teachers union jesus g garcia , the candidate known as chuy , built his campaign on the backing of teachers , has received his strongest financial support from unions and was talked into running by ms lewis herself and the crowd inside this echoing church followed orders , scores of people streaming out together and marching down madison street to a polling location with less than an hour remaining for early voting in advance of tuesday s election for decades , this city s elections were dominated by a democratic political machine armies of patronage government workers who could be counted on to get their neighbors out to vote but a series of legal decrees and anticorruption investigations as recently as a decade ago have dismantled that reliable political muscle in many wards , raising a question that rarely had to be asked around here how exactly do you win an election in chicago anymore \? mr emanuel , who has raised more than 18 million , far more than his opponent , has blitzed the airwaves , which may help explain a chicago tribune poll last week that suggested he had opened a substantive lead and mr emanuel s campaign is running a sophisticated field organization in the neighborhoods , including ontheground help , office space and phone calls by supportive aldermen some aides say the operation has ramped up significantly since six weeks ago , when it was not enough to capture more than 50 percent of the vote , forcing the city s first runoff election since it began holding nonpartisan mayor s contests 16 years ago mr garcia has turned to a handful of independent progressive groups , but mainly to organized labor , which was out in force across the city over the weekend knocking on doors , holding phone banks , gathering lists of volunteers for election day and arranging rides to the polls this being the first runoff we 've ever had , there is no model to go on , said ricardo mu oz , a city alderman who backed mr garcia and said he saw labor as an important piece of a larger puzzle for winning votes here now we 're trying to invent the wheel here less understood , though , is that labor is by no means speaking with one voice in this race mr emanuel has his own cast of union backers , more than 70 locals among 15 unions , which he proudly listed in an interview among them firefighters , hospitality workers , carpenters , painters , laborers , pipe fitters and plumbers in a postmachine world , they matter a lot , a top emanuel campaign strategist said of unions they 're a huge piece of our campaign strategy notably , the tribune poll found mr emanuel with 47 percent support of union households and mr garcia with 39 percent although the difference lies within the poll s margin of sampling error the split in labor has come as a shock to some of mr emanuel s sharpest critics , who view him as an antiunion mayor whose clashes with teachers were so intense that they called the city s first schools strike in a quartercentury , and whose efforts to require some city workers to pay more for pension benefits and to reduce the size of benefit increases were seen as a shot across the bow mr emanuel s history did not help union leaders here frequently recall his role in helping win approval for the north american free trade agreement in the 1990s jim sweeney , the president of local 150 of the international union of operating engineers , said his group was among those that endorsed mr emanuel s opponent when he first ran for mayor in 2011 over the weekend , though , his union was working on behalf of mr emanuel , holding phone banks and getoutthevote canvasses in an effort to reach 147 , 000 voters in union households it really just is about how he evolved over the last four years , said mr sweeney , who four years ago sharply criticized mr emanuel over his part in nafta he said mr emanuel had negotiated with his union over proposed pension changes and , at another point , agreed to standards for cranes that suited his workers' safety concerns for us , the discussion just came back to the economy is doing good in the city , and the mayor s done the right things several other prominent union groups , including the chicago federation of labor and the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , have stayed neutral and the election led to a split among service employees international union groups , with leaders of one local filing a complaint against another after it provided help to mr garcia though the union s state council had , at the time , chosen to stay neutral after the election in february and meetings with both candidates , the state council changed its mind and threw its official backing to mr garcia , though not every local agreed patronage was a system that really gave politicians a builtin political operation , said tom balanoff , the president of the state council as well as the union s local 1 , which includes janitors , food service workers and security officers in that sense , none of the politicians have an operation anymore who fills that void \? there s not many institutions that can we can yet without a unified voice , strategists here said , labor s role may go only so far on tuesday with getoutthevote efforts from progarcia unions potentially canceled out by similar efforts from proemanuel unions labor is never stronger than when it s unified , said anders lindall , a spokesman for afscme council 31 in a largely latino neighborhood on the city s southwest side , canvassers from the service employees international union walked door to door through a bitter wind on friday afternoon , urging voters they had identified as likely to support mr garcia to vote early by the end of early voting , more than 140 , 000 ballots had been cast across the city , nearly 50 , 000 more than in the february election and nearly twice as many as four years ago along a quiet , bungalowlined street , the conversations were mostly warm and enthusiastic chuy signs already dotted windows and lawns we can make history in chicago , daisy navar , a member of the union , told a resident in spanish , who promised to go to the polls and try to bring friends to elect the city s first latino mayor another union member called out to a man as he passed , inquiring if he , too , would help mr garcia i'm voting for rahm , the man called back , for standing up to the teachers union they have too much power
st petersburg , fla jacoby ellsbury stood outside the cage , waiting for his turn during batting practice and bouncing a baseball off the head of his bat over and over ellsbury s juggling act , which continued until he reached 100 , was so effortless it looked almost as if the two objects were attached with an elastic strand consistent contact in the batter s box has proved much more elusive for ellsbury the are locked in a playoff race , but they are forging along with little help from their 153 million leadoff man his troubles continued tuesday in a 63 loss to the , leaving him hitless in his last 25 atbats and with only five hits in his last 56 atbats ellsbury was spared the indignity of making the final out when his ninthinning grounder got under the glove of first baseman james loney for an error but brandon gomes retired brett gardner , the potential tying run , to seal the loss that prevented the yankees from gaining ground on toronto , which lost to atlanta but still maintains a threegame lead in the american league east the yankees , after being nohit for seven innings by erasmo ramirez on monday , managed a home run from and another from greg bird , but little else against jake odorizzi , who beat them for the sixth time in seven decisions rodriguez played despite having learned earlier in the day that he had sustained a bone bruise when he slid into home on sunday nick franklin erased the yankees' 32 lead with a tworun , sixthinning homer off nick rumbelow , who had come on to strike out stephen souza jr and evan longoria to end the fifth with the tying run at third the rays added two more off bryan mitchell in the eighth when rico noel just missed making a diving catch on j p arencibia s single there were plenty of other whatifs for the yankees didi gregorius being thrown out at the plate when he tried to score on a grounder back to odorizzi , and kevin kiermaier hauling in gardner s potential gametying drive in the seventh just before crashing into the centerfield wall another whatif might have been the decision to keep riding ellsbury , who is batting 210 since returning from the disabled list july 8 you could think about that , but it s a pretty hard guy to take out of your lineup , manager joe girardi said before the game ellsbury dismissed the idea that a day off would do him good i'm an everyday player , he said you just need to find a way to have success , and that s what i 've done throughout my career you 're going to go through spells , but you continue to work hard and put in the time it would have been easier to sit ellsbury on tuesday as slade heathcott perhaps as good a defensive center fielder as ellsbury was coming off his heroic turn in monday s game , in which he lashed a threerun gamewinning home run in the ninth then again , this may be a circumstance in which the yankees are so deeply committed to a player in the second year of a sevenyear deal that they must ride with him for as long as possible he s a guy that s signed here for seven years , so he s the guy , right fielder carlos beltran said girardi said one of his reasons for keeping ellsbury in the lineup was that he appeared to be sorting out some mechanical problems with his swing if so , they were not apparent tuesday after popping up and grounding out , ellsbury came to the plate in the fifth with runners at first and second , none out and the yankees trying to build on a 32 lead girardi disdains the sacrifice bunt in all but the rarest circumstances especially for someone he considers a homerun hitter but ellsbury bunted the runners up , earning the first sacrifice hit in his two seasons with the yankees in his next atbat , ellsbury took a pair of strikes with the tying run at first , then waved meekly at enny romero s 98mileanhour fastball over the outside corner gardner said the four days he did not start after injuring his shoulder earlier this month helped him get out of a slump when he hit three home runs in last weekend s series with toronto when you do n't play for a few days , it helps rejuvenate everything else , gardner said i was struggling at the plate , in a funk physically and mentally and it kind of allows you to step back and press the reset button it was kind of a blessing in disguise , if you will rodriguez has acknowledged benefiting from the forced rest he has received this season when the yankees play in national league parks , where the designated hitter is removed after hitting two home runs in the previous five weeks , rodriguez has hit six since being out of the lineup for three days against atlanta at the end of august the great thing about this time of year is that numbers do n't matter , it s the moments , rodriguez said you can be 0 for 5 in a situation and come up and get a big hit and everything s forgotten right now , the only stat that matters is winning nobody cares about what any individual does or does not do rodriguez added that in many ways , the overriding importance of the game s result removes much of the pressure from players but with some particularly those with a contract as substantial as ellsbury s losses surely magnify the attention on tuesday , it became harder not to notice
jackson , miss only three people who had ever met this man , robert gray , knew that he was running in the primary for governor of mississippi there were the two volunteers who took his 300 filing fee and qualifying papers several months ago at the state office and the candidate for agriculture commissioner who happened to be in the headquarters at the same time otherwise , no one not even mr gray s mother , with whom he lives at least she voted for him when she saw his name on the aug 4 ballot mr gray , 46 , a roundfaced , softspoken longhaul truck driver who lives on a quiet country road south of jackson , was too busy working on his rig to vote himself he would , nonetheless , , taking 79 out of mississippi s 82 counties mr gray beat two other candidates , who unlike him spent money and campaigned officials were stunned the news media was stunned mr gray , now mississippi s democratic nominee for governor , gave some interviews and then set off with a truck full of sweet potatoes for a potato chip factory in pennsylvania the victory of mr gray like the bizarre primary wins of , south carolina s 2010 democratic nominee for the senate , and charlie brown , the 2014 democratic candidate for governor in tennessee illustrates to some degree the forlorn state of affairs for democrats in the south the party that was once the alpha and omega of southern politics is now having to explain that its headline candidate in mississippi was elected on the following grounds he was the first name on the ballot , and he was a man , said jacqueline amos , the executive field director for the state democratic party both of mr gray s primary opponents were women mr gray is mississippi s second black democratic nominee for governor in a row none of the candidates were expected to beat the incumbent , phil bryant , a republican for mississippi democrats , who have to pick their battles , the focus this year has been on regaining control of the state s house of representatives a curiosity candidate who kept a low profile would not complicate that , but to the exasperation of some party officials , mr gray has been granting interviews to most any news outlet that tracks him down , from msnbc to roadking , a magazine for professional truckers state democratic parties can accomplish only so much in a part of the country that votes overwhelmingly republican in statewide races and where partisan identity falls ever more precisely along racial lines the party s previous dominance may even be a reason for mr gray s victory , said jake mcgraw , the public policy coordinator at the william winter institute for racial reconciliation in mississippi the democratic primary was once the de facto general election in mississippi even now , after decades of extensive partisan realignment , the majority of candidates running for coroner , tax assessor and other local offices in many rural counties are likely to be running as democrats , out of tradition if nothing else but people do not register by party in mississippi , so while the democratic primary may still draw the most activity in those counties , a large number of those primary voters are reliable republicans in statewide and national elections so much of the democratic primary is composed of people who are not democrats , mr mcgraw said and that is how you end up with mr gray , a genuine unknown even in the tiny town of terry , where he lives dorothy jones at the laundromat , who is said to know everyone , had a vague memory that he dropped off some clothes once , though she did not recall mr gray ever coming back to pick them up at the terry barber shop , sam anderson called out to the crowd , asking if anyone knew the black fellow running for governor no one there had met mr gray , but gary downing , who was getting a little off the ears , offered a thought on the state of politics ca n't do no worse than what we 've got this may be the central plank of the gray campaign , such as it is his campaign staff for now consists mostly of his sister , angela gray , 45 , who works in real estate in georgia , and dwight utz , 57 , an engineer who moved here three years ago from idaho mr utz , who is white , sees the campaign as the stirrings of a new civil rights movement mr gray does not talk much about race he cites no specific issue that prompted him to run for governor he emphasizes a more general conviction that the state has been foundering for too long and that it could be thriving if only the governor would expand and spend more on infrastructure and education say there was a racecar available and the person driving it did n't know what to do with it , mr gray said over a plate of ribs with mr utz at bully s restaurant , a wellloved soul food place in jackson if you want change , somebody s got to do it voters are intent on keeping money away from the poor and working class , mr gray continued , but in doing so they are only hurting themselves he acknowledged that other candidates had found this a hard sell in conservative southern states but he said he had simplified his pitch people complain about our governor , he said i'm basically going to do the opposite of what he s doing this appears to be true , though somewhat to mr gray s detriment mr bryant s campaign reported 28 million on hand in its latest filing , and he is talking up his record to groups around the state mr gray , by his own admission , is not much of a campaigner he is hesitant to approach strangers because , he says , he does not want to interrupt them you have one of the best free publicity deals going , and you 're not capitalizing on it , said jerry moore , a county constable who met mr gray after his meal at bully s mr moore took a minute to explain how it all works , saying he runs one of the largest backtoschool giveaways in jackson and tells everyone he sees his name and what he is running for mr moore then pushed a reluctant mr gray to speak to two young women who had just sat down for lunch mr gray gave the women his brief pitch there are two people running for governor , and he is the one who is not the incumbent the women did not seem moved but who are you \? one asked john brown , one of mr moore s fellow constables , handed some cash to mr utz and wished the campaign luck afterward , in his pickup truck , mr gray acknowledged that he had a lot to learn about gladhanding he spends most of his time behind a wheel , he said truckers do not make great communicators but he still has two months to adjust it s going to take a minute to get used to it , he said
i don t want to live in a different house i want to live in this house with this family my 3yearold foster son , whom we call bluejay , has just returned from a visit with his birth family he has lived with us all summer it isn t clear what will happen for him next , or when these are among the first words he says to me , his eyes wide and bright , his mouth quivering i take a deep breath and nod , desperately and rapidly searching for the right response i suspect his parents have told him , once again , that he will be going to live with them soon in a new home perhaps they have told him again about the party they will give in celebration when he moves home perhaps his mom has told him again that he can help select the party menu , that she will cook anything he wants i know how much bluejay s parents love him , and i know how badly they want their family back together i am sure they mean these words as reassurances to their children they want them to know they love them , they want them , they are trying but i don t think they understand how much these words confuse bluejay week after week the fact is , it has been so long since his birth family lived together as one unit that bluejay is simply too young to remember it telling him he will leave the home he has become comfortable in to move to one he has never seen and can t imagine doesn t feel like a reassurance to him right now it has the exact opposite effect it leaves him worrying that at any moment , someone may knock on the door to collect him and his box of belongings yet again his birth parents don t see the way bluejay has suddenly become apprehensive of going to new places , the same way he was during the first couple of weeks we had him , because he is afraid we will leave him somewhere or the way he has become wary of new people coming into our home because he is afraid he will have to leave with them they don t see the fear in his eyes after he throws a tantrum , as if it has occurred to him that maybe this time he has gone too far they don t see the way he apologizes profusely and tells me repeatedly how much he loves me they don t feel the way his heart still races , no matter how many times i hug him and reassure him that it s ok for him to have a rough day or to feel angry or sad and that nothing he does will change the fact that i love him the only constant in his life so far has been instability and that instability has conditioned him to always be looking over his shoulder the list of places he has lived so many of them and each one vastly different from the one before it runs on a loop through my head our home , at the end of the list , is among the places he has been the longest he senses this he is preparing himself for the moment he will be forced to move on , while simultaneously grasping at a chance for the kind of stability he has never had i want to assure him that he will find that stability soon , whether it is here or someplace else , but these assurances are not mine to give they are assurances no one should be giving they are assurances none of us have the only thing i can tell him for certain is this we love having you here , too you are not going anywhere tonight you are safe and you are loved it s not enough , i know but it is the only truth i have to offer him
washington david daleiden would only reluctantly talk about himself i do n't think i'm the story , he said by phone on tuesday but he is the man behind the story and the hidden camera the antiabortion activist who has provoked a storm with his video stings alleging that clinics are selling tissue from aborted fetuses for profit , a charge the group denies on tuesday , for a , a video appeared online showing a planned parenthood official in california discussing over lunch the price of providing fetal parts to a man and woman who are never shown on camera , but who are posing as buyers from a firm that procures tissue for medical researchers once again , planned parenthood condemned the scam for deceptively characterizing its handling fees to cover expenses , which are legal , as illegal profiteering the man off camera , just as in the first video , is mr daleiden and , he said in the interview , more episodes are coming planned parenthood s that he must have thousands of hours of videotape from infiltrating its clinics for two and a half years is probably an accurate estimate , mr daleiden , 26 , said he guessed he had enough recordings for perhaps a dozen videos that he can release at the rate of one a week for the next few months the time frame all but ensures political tumult ahead the videos will coincide with the republicancontrolled congress s final weeks of work on spending bills needed to finance the government after the oct 1 start of the next fiscal year the first videos have already given impetus to conservatives' push to hold those bills hostage unless they are amended to eliminate money for planned parenthood and other family planning programs the risk , as in past years , is a government shutdown the videos are also arriving as the large field of republicans seeking their party s 2016 presidential nomination takes final shape , and televised debates begin next month already , the rivals are competing to denounce planned parenthood as they seek to appeal to antiabortion conservatives in the party s base i'm going to do everything i can to stop it , senator rand paul of kentucky vowed on fox news we should stop all funding for planned parenthood one house committee , with encouragement from speaker john a boehner , republican of ohio , has opened an investigation of the alleged criminal trafficking in fetal tissue , and the republican leaders from two other committees have written to the justice department asking for investigations as well seven states are pressing their own inquiries , including two investigations ordered by gov bobby jindal of louisiana and gov scott walker of wisconsin , both republican presidential candidates the white house and congressional democrats , who are allies of planned parenthood and protective of women s abortion and reproductive rights , have been mostly silent they say that planned parenthood has done a good job in its own defense , and that they do not want to give the story any more oxygen than it already has especially since some video stings of the past came to be discredited without democrats' help also , democrats said they were counting on republicans to overreach with their attacks inciting a backlash from women , younger voters and political independents who support planned parenthood and then retreat , as has happened before by boehner and the republicans leaping into the middle of this , i think they further demonstrate the political nature of the attack , said geoff garin , a democratic pollster and as someone who s done a lot of polling about planned parenthood , i feel reasonably confident that americans , particularly american women , will see this as about politics , not about health care but mr daleiden expressed confidence that this time is different , and that his videos will change minds he wanted to start releasing them a year ago but said he needed to get more material against what he called the whole world of selling baby parts when you know that you have something powerful , that s going to shock a lot of consciences , mr daleiden said , it is natural not to want to keep that under wraps he rejected a question about the potential benefits of research using fetal tissue for curing and treating diseases , saying , most fetal tissue work is real frankenstein stuff he also dismissed critics of his undercover methods , which included forming a fake company and mysterious taxexempt advocacy group , saying that only planned parenthood or its supporters would object mr daleiden said he had been an antiabortion activist for more than a decade he formed an antiabortion group at his high school in sacramento , a period when he met another young activist named lila rose until now , ms rose had been better known to planned parenthood and other abortionrights advocates for video stings by her group , live action lila and i have been friends for many , many years , mr daleiden said he continued his antiabortion work as a student at claremont mckenna college , in claremont , calif , where , he said , he got a degree in government and befriended the conservative activist charles johnson mr johnson is a selfdescribed citizen journalist whose confrontational posts on twitter in particular one that solicited donations to take out a civil rights activist recently got him banned from the website mr daleiden worked for live action in college and became director of research in 2008 according to a biography retrieved from an archived live action web page , mr daleiden participated in a genocide awareness project , displaying in public large images said to be of aborted fetuses , and he was banned for a time from visiting pomona college after videotaping a planned parenthood official there for proof that the group was covering up statutory rape some liberal websites have suggested that mr daleiden is also a friend and ally of james o'keefe , who , like ms rose , is a wellknown video provocateur , for his campaign that brought down the liberal community organizing group acorn i would consider james a friend , mr daleiden said but in reality , i 've literally met him once in my life none of the other prominent activists have been involved in his recent 30month project to uncover evidence of illegal trafficking in aborted fetuses , he said in his live action biography , mr daleiden attributed his antiabortion militancy to seeing images of aborted fetuses as a teenager but in the interview , he also said , i am the child of a crisis pregnancy mr daleiden said his parents , who are now divorced , were juniors in college when his mother became pregnant he said he had grown up culturally catholic , that is , not particularly religious yet he now calls pope francis my inspiration , although mr daleiden s activism long predates the pope s ascension , and he points to francis' emphasis on just being active , on going outside of yourself to accomplish things in 2013 , mr daleiden not only formed an antiabortion group , the sacramentobased center for medical progress , but also filed state papers to create a norwalk , califbased company , biomax procurement services , as part of his undercover ruse biomax was described as a company that provides tissue and specimen procurement for academic and private bioscience researchers , and that is committed to helping facilitate worldchanging discoveries the internal revenue service granted the center for medical progress taxexempt status , allowing donors to deduct contributions , as a nonprofit under the agency s category for diseases , disorders , medical disciplines biomedicine , bioengineering a separate category applies to antiabortion groups mr daleiden said he had received a total 120 , 000 over three years from 12 to 15 very resourceful , committed individuals who believed in the mission and wanted to see it done he would not name them , and there is no record that the center filed federal 990 tax forms that might identify donors the center s mission is not the one claimed for biomax of spurring medical discoveries instead , the website defines mr daleiden s human capital project as a 30month effort at documenting planned parenthood s illegal sale of body parts from aborted fetuses mr daleiden also would not name the women who went undercover with him he said he had worked with five to seven women , some of whom were also antiabortion activists others , he said , were hired to fill the role a lawyer for planned parenthood has raised questions about whether mr daleiden violated state or federal laws by fraudulent corporate and tax filings on monday , mr daleiden issued a statement in response the center for medical progress follows all applicable laws in the course of our

beijing the last gold medal went to the united states as the veteran ran another poised and powerful anchor leg to clinch victory in a tight 4x400meter relay but if the final scene was very familiar , these track and field world championships did not follow the standard script the americans , long the sport s superpower , could not do better than third in the gold medal count , their lowest world championships ranking ever with six golds , they finished behind the kenyan and jamaican teams , which each had seven russia , rocked by suspensions and doping investigations , faded from prominence at the last world championships , in moscow in 2013 , the host nation finished with seven gold medals and 17 medals over all russia s figures here \? two golds , one silver and one bronze , with the four medals representing russia s lowest total at a world championships by far it does n't entirely surprise me , given the transition that federation is in , said sebastian coe , the presidentelect of the sport s world governing body , the international association of athletics federations china , reinforced by the wall of noise generated by the big crowds that turned up day and night at the bird s nest stadium , made inroads in domains usually ruled by western nations it put , and the bronze won by 18yearold wang jianan was china s first major championships medal in the event china also recorded its highest finish in the men s high jump a silver medal on sunday night from zhang guowei , a showman who celebrated his clearances by making kung fu poses on the mat but nothing resonated in china quite like the country s unprecedented silver medal on saturday night in , an event that continued to be heavily replayed on chinese television on sunday china will play a huge part in the development of our sport going forward , coe said the united states team did again have the highest overall medal count , with 18 , ahead of kenya \( 16 \) , jamaica \( 12 \) and china \( nine \) but the americans' total was quite a drop from their 25 in moscow and represented their lowest mark in a world championships since 2003 the united states the nation that produced jesse owens , carl lewis and michael johnson failed to win a men s individual running or hurdling event for the first time at the championships , which date to 1983 , and the americans had just one winner in the women s individual track events in the 400 the rest of the world is getting more and more competitive , and that is something we do n't take lightly , said jill geer , a spokeswoman for usa track and field as far as we 're concerned , staying the no 1 track and field team is not guaranteed , and none of our medals are guaranteed so it proved again on the final night in the women s 4x400 relay , a powerful united states team that included the reigning olympic 400 champion , sanya richardsross , and felix finished second behind who else \? jamaica richardsross put the team in trouble early , finishing sixth on the opening leg but felix , running the third leg , took the lead with one of the great runs in the event s history , timed in 4772 seconds still , her handoff to francena mccorory could have been quicker , and although mccorory held the lead against novlene williamsmills of jamaica for most of the tight final lap , williamsmills surged and passed her in the final 10 meters mccorory did have the three fastest times in the 400 this season entering the meet , but it was hard not wondering what might have happened if felix had been running the anchor leg that s not my decision , felix said it was the second night in a row that the americans chose not to use their top performer in an event as the anchor on saturday night , ran the second leg \( and first straightaway \) of the men s 4x100 , handing off to tyson gay gay was then unable to make a legal exchange with the anchor runner , mike rodgers , who took control of the baton outside the passing zone jamaica and usain bolt stormed to their latest gold medal , and the united states relay team was eventually disqualified the strategy with the men really was to give mike the baton with at least a threemeter lead , geer said we set the lineup to do that , and coach mitchell was very happy with where the team was heading into that last handoff geer was referring to dennis mitchell , a former sprinter who is now the team s head relay coach michael just got hyped up and left too early , geer said of rodgers , adding that usa track and field had no plans to replace mitchell as it prepared to finalize roles for the olympic year there is clearly a generational shift at work in the sport , on and off the track on sunday , lamine diack , 82 , finished his 16year run as iaaf president coe , a former middledistance star for britain who was the head of the organizing committee for the successful london olympics in 2012 , was to assume his post officially on monday the challenges will be manifold , including his intent to remain a paid adviser to nike but the first question posed to him at a news conference on sunday was no surprise mr coe , congratulations could track and field become a clean sport in the future \? coe s response it is ostensibly a clean sport we have our challenges nobody sitting at this table or in the body of the hall would deny that and it s a challenge that every global sport faces , but there is nobody of significance in my sport who does not have a nonnegotiable view about maintaining a clean sport can it be cleaner \? i hope so are there things we can do differently in the future \? i dare say so coe then defended the sport s efforts to date , later explaining that he would explore the idea of a new integrity unit for track and field it could contain an antidoping operation with greater independence with access to a new independent tribunal we need to make sure we do everything in our sport to give maximum confidence , he said clean athletes have to absolutely know we are in their corner and words are simply not enough in a separate interview , coe also said he intended to make an official visit to russia soon to meet with track and field officials there and encourage them to maintain momentum as they continue addressing the doping problem but coe said of his sport in general , we are more than a discussion about test tubes , blood and urine while russia slumped at the world championships , kenya , another recent target of doping allegations and investigations , prospered it got one more gold on sunday as asbel kiprop roared from behind on the final lap to win his third consecutive world title in the men s 1 , 500 meters but it was an even better final day for kenya s east african rival ethiopia , with mare dibaba winning the women s marathon in the morning in 2 hours 27 minutes 35 seconds in the evening , the ethiopians swept the medals in the women s 5 , 000 , with almaz ayana posting a championshipsrecord time of 14 2683 that was all the more impressive because she ran unaccompanied down the stretch senbere teferi was second in 14 4407 and genzebe dibaba \( no relation to mare \) third in 14 4414 there would be no golden double for genzebe dibaba , who had won the 1 , 500 but there were doubles from familiar figures like mo farah , the briton who won the men s 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 at a second straight world championships , and bolt , who again swept the 100 and 200 in a sport with new leadership and plenty of new faces , they represented the old guard in beijing , as did merritt and the american 4x400 relay team , which was the last to celebrate and the last to climb the podium at the bird s nest it was important for people to remember that we 're still here , merritt said in light of some of the strange twists and mishaps that affected the american bottom line in beijing , a significant uptick at the rio de janeiro games next year is hardly out of the question but at this stage , with the medal threats increasingly global , there are no guarantees
casey harris is the keyboard player for the indie rock band whose song has been no 1 on billboard s alternative chart for the past 11 weeks i have a genetic thing called that affects both my kidneys and vision unfortunately , i ca n't read anything on paper on a computer screen , it has to be like an inch tall , really bold and superhigh contrast so i listen to audiobooks the way other people watch tv the reader is crucial , though an amazing book can be absolutely ruined by a bad narrator and a fairly boring book can be made pretty good by an exceptional narrator like , for example , ron mclarty , william dufris and stephen thorne most recently , i really enjoyed by andy weir and narrated by r c bray it s about this guy who gets left behind on mars it s almost like one of those wilderness survival stories except he s on mars i'm a big science buff , and the science in the story is rocksolid and as realistic as possible i also liked by donna tartt , read by david pittu she describes the main character doing things like what i did in my early 20s loafing and moping around the house , drinking during the day and she somehow makes it riveting she so gets into the vibe and you think , god , he needs to break that loop , but you sympathize with him i actually have n't listened to that much music recently i guess because , being on tour , i hear a lot of music without even trying in recent days though , i 've been delving back into jazz , , , and also been dabbling a bit in some older , bigbandstyle recordings with all the modern rapid change of camera angles and quick cuts in tv and movies these days , i have no idea what s going on visually but i still enjoy a good comedy like and or a good dramatic show like or where there is enough dialogue that i can pretty much follow it but i admit i sometimes cheat and afterward go online and read a description to make sure i did n't miss any crucial details i have so much other stuff in my life i need to do i just do n't have time for it other members of the band are more heavily present online but none of us are hardcore social media socialites i had a kidney transplant when i was 23 it s been almost six years i just had an appointment a week ago and everything checked out all right i'm pretty lucky my mom donated her kidney yeah , my mom is the best 100 percent i ca n't say enough good things about that woman i just got a keyboard it s a brand i 've been using for a long time i use them mainly because of my vision it s one of the few modern digital keyboard brands where you do n't have to look at a menu on a screen to program it there s a knob or button for pretty much every function on the keyboard nords are also famous for having really good quality keyboards and vintage synth sounds i have to give full credit to my girlfriend she ordered an american tourister quad suitcase for me for the tour and it s amazing you do n't have to tilt it , you just give it a kick and it will scoot along in the tsa line
vail , colo the vail festival spoils dancegoers we start to feel that every theater should be surrounded by pineclad mountains and approached by a path featuring a rushing river \( and at least one hummingbird \) such a setting seems right for several ballets , but none more so than george balanchine s apollo , a work whose original setting is the base of parnassus , with the young god ending the ballet by leading his three muses up the slope apollo was a theme ballet at this year s festival here on sunday it was the centerpiece of \( behind the stage , the top of a mountain was still lit by the sun as the performance began \) , with a prestigious cast herman cornejo and isabella boylston , principals of american ballet theater in peak form , made their debuts as apollo and calliope terpsichore was new york city ballet s tiler peck polyhymnia was boston ballet s misa kuranaga mr cornejo , a superb dancer and a vail regular , reminded me at moments of the brilliantly dynamic and yet some quality of momentum was missing , as much psychological as physical i do n't doubt that mr cornejo could be a marvelous interpreter of this role one problem in this performance was surely that it was to taped music another is that ms peck , while dancing terpsichore with complete intelligence , as if giving a master class , does n't seem to possess the role from within she , dignified , and the more vital mr cornejo stayed in different orbits the bach classic concerto barocco \( 1941 \) , which opened the program , worked marvelously ashley laracey stepped up into the central role \( replacing sara mearns , who had altitude sickness \) , partnered by russell janzen and replaced ms laracey \( all three are members of city ballet ms laracey and mr janzen are soloists , ms phelan is in the corps the eight corps dancers for this performance , glowingly devout , were from colorado ballet \) one pleasure was how well matched ms laracey and ms phelan are , with their vivid elegance of both proportions and manners theirs was a spruce , coolasamountainstream barocco , with mr janzen conferring unusually heroic grace upon certain details in the central movement this is ms phelan s largest role to date she registers beautifully the ballet s architecture was ideally lucid at every moment this was followed by the 1960 tschaikovsky pas de deux , danced by misty copeland and joseph gordon though ms copeland s engaging stage manners and musicality were welcome , it was the young mr gordon , still in city ballet s corps , whose exceptional elegance and lan illumined this number his remarkable jump , line and floppyhaired good looks are known in new york but what this performance \( and the balanchine stars and stripes pas de deux the previous evening \) demonstrated was the exhilarating momentum his dancing exhibits during a solo variation the evening continued after the intermission with the 1982 stravinsky l gie , danced , on the previous evening , by carla k rbes with moving purity even by the high standards of the stars assembled in vail each festival , ms k rbes is a paragon , one of those rare dance creatures who truly seem like an apparition from an ideal realm it was marvelous to have this on the same program as apollo \( 1928 \) they 're the last and first of his surviving creations omega and alpha connections have long been made between apollo \( a ballet whose jazzy rhythms are often overlooked \) and balanchine s 1970 gershwin ballet who cares \? , which ended sunday s program but those parallels lie most clearly in the central format of one man and three women , whereas sunday s version of who cares \? was a concert arrangement of its solos and duets for three men and five women , with no corps de ballet in the i got rhythm finale , three ballerinas briefly joined mr gordon in a twinkling but faint echo of apollo otherwise and usefully this rendition of the gershwin classic served to show yet other facets of balanchine his work always combine high and low art , but nowhere else did he so perfectly combine high classicism with casually vernacular grace apollo the ballet in which balanchine first defined many aspects of his artistic character was the four nights before at the vilar performing arts center in beaver creek with mr cornejo and other dancers , the festival s director , damian woetzel , and his wife , heather watts both former city ballet dancers enterprisingly showed many aspects of apollo , some of which were new to me \( who knew that balanchine characterized one step in terpsichore s variation as if throwing flowers \? \) we were shown the way apollo has begun and ended since 1980 the prologue that balanchine excised in 1979 and the pre1979 staircasetoparnassus finale that he changed and the solo that he restored in 1980 with great good humor , ms watts \( the first terpsichore of both the 1979 and the 1980 revisions \) related what balanchine said on each occasion they chose to close this event with the pre1979 ending , in which not only apollo and the muses ascend the steps to full divinity but in which apollo s mother , leto \( who in the prologue gave birth to him \) , returns and gestures up to her son , as if in awe of the luminary she begot nothing could have demonstrated better why the old apollo surpasses the abbreviated and diminished version danced at city ballet today \( without prologue , it s nicknamed pollo \) , with its fantail arabesque finale giving the ballet a look ma , i'm a choreographer ending apollo is the first of many balanchine ballets that ends with the protagonist departing to discover a new world and what makes its prologue so moving is that leto s birth pangs , her travail , her radiant opening of the legs , and the first artistic education of the boy god \( in which her handmaidens give him his lute and help him play his first notes \) , all set the scene for the labors and gleaming discoveries of the ballet s main drama apollo and his muses are all artists the process they go through is a form of childbirth , again and again
is a neighborhood park in brooklyn worth a halfbillion dollars \? that may be the ultimate cost of bushwick inlet park , which you 've probably never heard of this time of year , it s full of children from around the city playing soccer but it s not much to look at abutting the waterfront in williamsburg , it consists of a fiveacre playing field on what used to be a lot for rental trucks in the shadow of a big , ugly citistorage warehouse the warehouse and a defunct oil fuel depot next door were to have been bought , knocked down and turned into parkland , 28 acres in all in 2005 , the promised the entire park to the neighborhood in exchange for massive , highend rezoning in williamsburg and greenpoint at that time , city officials imagined a price tag of around 60 million to 90 million but through a combination of factors , the city has spent some 225 million and still has not acquired all the property that figure already surpasses the high line s cost to taxpayers , and the whole park threatens to approach the amount paid for hudson river park , which covers 550 acres and is four miles long now the de blasio administration faces an unenviable dilemma break the agreement the made or pay through the nose while money is needed for more affordable housing , safer streets , improved schools and libraries and other parks what happened here \? bushwick inlet is a textbook study in civic entropy and how public developments go awry , with little that neighborhoods and government can do about it there s no easy solution just hard choices unsurprisingly , the first turn toward the absurd involved a lawsuit through eminent domain , the city offered 12 million for the rental truck lot when the owner found a sympathetic judge , the price leapt into the stratosphere , to more than 90 million the owner of , next door , norman brodsky , naturally assumed he had also hit the jackpot crain s reported recently that he now wants 500 million for his 11acre site if the city wo n't pony up , his site will cleave the prospective park in two back here on planet earth , the city will not , and should never , pay that kind of ransom the good news is that the site is zoned for industrial use , meaning it s unlikely that mr brodsky will find a private buyer who logically crunches the numbers and offers half the asking price but whatever the property finally costs , it wo n't include the millions needed to decontaminate that land and also the fuel oil depot , which the city is still trying to acquire for a little less than 69 million , a bargain in retrospect let s put aside how eminent domain proceedings ended up provoking a settlement that cost taxpayers more than 90 million for a truck rental lot on a decrepit industrial site the bottom line is that the system is capricious , promotes extortion and often acts against the public interest while private developers quietly accrue properties to assemble big projects , keeping their intentions secret and upfront costs down , government must act openly , as it should , the upshot often being that landlords can have city hall over a barrel the rezoning process invariably opens the door to speculators , like the ones now in east new york , where for months the de blasio administration has been publicly mulling over a plan to encourage subsidized housing speculators have been buying properties there , escalating housing prices , creating instability for poor tenants in the neighborhood before a single new subsidized apartment is built exactly the opposite outcome intended by the prospective rezoning the mayor s latest budget strengthens legal services for endangered residents in districts slated for rezoning and puts aside 1 billion as a kind of rainyday slush fund for unanticipated costs associated with those rezonings , the example of bushwick inlet park being a prime cautionary tale both good moves but last week mayor s parks commissioner , mitchell j silver , told the city council that there was no money in the budget to acquire citistorage for bushwick inlet , which , despite its name , lies at the heart of williamsburg hipsterdom , in the midst of brooklyn bowl , the music hall , brooklyn flea and smorgasburg east river state park is next door mccarren park is a few blocks away the city has also poured millions into fixing it up spending millions more on a park in this affluent neighborhood is not priority , even though he voted for the rezoning in 2005 the mayor has said he wants to fix a few dozen neglected community parks in underserved areas of new york at the same time , he wants to cut parks funding drastically from what it was under michael r bloomberg a big disappointment and a missed opportunity to spread social equity and environmental justice meanwhile , that sympathetic judge , abraham gerges , a former city councilman for williamsburg , no longer sits on the bench so here s one scenario the city could test its luck again in court over citistorage eventually , mr brodsky may come to his senses and negotiate for his site with the city , or find some buyer who will need to approach city hall with a proposal the mayor might then try to grab a chunk of the site to meet his affordable housing commitment his argument would be that rezoning the site for some mixeduse development would throw off money to defray park costs but what kind of development \? how big \? and how would the neighborhood be compensated \? stephen levin , the councilman for the district , told me last week that he would vote against any rezoning more and more people in the community have come together around this issue , he said we have a robust capital budget in the city now , and that 1 billion is being budgeted for other areas this administration wants to rezone , he added in my personal life , i try not to take on new debts before i pay off my old ones our community has been waiting years he asked how city hall can again be relied on to fulfill its commitments if it reneges on this one i wondered whether there were other nearby sites to which development rights for the citistorage property could be transferred mr levin said there are none that would n't cost the public a fortune i mentioned a large cityowned waterfront plot near the brooklyn navy yard , south of division avenue , which could be turned into a new park might that sweeten some deal , extending an already evolving network of green space along the williamsburg waterfront \? it s too far away from bushwick inlet , mr levin said he added , we only have one opportunity to get this right , and i 'd rather wait than get it wrong in its rush to rezone , the bloomberg administration clearly failed to anticipate events so at this point maybe patience is the only answer adrian benepe , a former city parks commissioner , reminded me of the chelsea recreation center in 1964 , mayor john v lindsay s administration decided to tear down an ancient public bathhouse on west 28th street to make way for a mailsorting facility , with the promise that a recreation center would be built construction was delayed until the mid70s , when the fiscal crisis hit and the project halted a quartercentury more passed chelsea transformed then mayor rudolph w giuliani picked up the gauntlet and mr bloomberg cut the ribbon in 2004 born in an era that envisioned a home economics room for girls , the new recreation center opened in an age of stairclimbing machines forty years is a very long time but bushwick inlet could be a great park someday
the conservative mood is angry , frustrated , fed up people have had enough , they 're tired of making excuses , they 're ready to really let their party have it i'm not talking about the voters , though i'm talking about pundits and political professionals over the last month , as donald trump expanded his polling lead , prominent conservatives passed from a mild bemusement to a weary patience to a slowburning fury with the voters the , as national review s jonah goldberg memorably dubbed them who support him the fedup columnists have reasonable questions for trumpsupporting republicans but if you 're looking for the candidate whose polling surge looks most like a march of voter folly , the donald and his trumpistas would n't be the place i 'd start instead , i would pick the ben carson phenomenon , and the evangelical christians who the core of his support though carson is running and rising nationally , he s attracted a fraction of the scrutiny , and his supporters have earned a fraction of the political class s scorn to some extent this is understandable , since carson is temperamentally nonflamboyant , with none of trump s insultcomic style he s decent , modest , softspoken , devout , with an astonishing biography and an admirable character but the growing evangelical embrace of carson is arguably a greater folly than trumpmania that s because the donald , for all his proud ignorance about policy detail , is actually running he s a populist and nationalist , a critic of open immigration and free trade and a backer of social security and progressive taxation , and he s drawing support from who tend to share those views the trump phenomenon , then , is n't just a study in celebritybesotted conservative delusion , or a case of evangelicals betraying their faith to chase a shiny object \( despite what you may have read , trump with religious voters \) it s a class revolt , driven by a sadlyjustifiable sense that republican elites do n't have workingclass interests close enough to heart and it s already won some \( very \) modest victories for populism by prodding scott walker to make an economic case against lowskilled immigration , for instance , or by encouraging jeb bush to go after hedge fund managers in his tax plan carson , on the other hand , is running a more contentfree campaign like trump , he s underinformed and prone to , but unlike the donald he does n't have a distinctive platform he s offering a collection of pieties and crankery mostly , his candidacy is just about the man himself and unfortunately evangelical voters have a weakness for this kind of pitch from pat robertson in 1988 through thinonpolicy figures like mike huckabee , sarah palin , even michele bachmann briefly in 2012 , the evangelical tendency has been to look for , a christian leader who could win the white house and undo every culturewar defeat \( the resilience of evangelical support for george w bush as his presidency went sour reflected a persistent hope that bush might be this hero in the flesh \) such unrealistic ideas are hardly unique to the religious right but evangelical culture , as james davison hunter notes in , his magisterial account of recent christian engagement with american politics , has a particular fondness for the idea of the historyaltering individual , the hope that one person can stand at the crossroads and change things for good as hunter s book points out , neither political nor cultural change usually happens like this instead , it comes from networks , institutions , interest groups , and it requires strategy , alliancebuilding and steady pressure this is part of why evangelical christians , notwithstanding their numbers , tend to have less influence over actual republican governance than fiscal conservatives or foreignpolicy hawks they 're always looking for a hero \( or heroine \) , while the party s other factions focus on staffing decisions and policy commitments , where the real work of politics takes place in this election cycle , though , the evangelical hero quest is particularly selfdefeating with samesex marriage established nationwide and social liberalism ascendant , religious conservatives have a clear policy ask they should be pressing every major republican contender to embrace they need guarantees that the next gop administration will move proactively through something like senator mike lee s evolving to protect religious schools and charities from losing grants or accreditation or even taxexempt status because they maintain a traditional position on sexual ethics i'm sure that a president ben carson would deliver these protections i'm equally sure that the longer the fantasy of a carson presidency persists , the less likely it becomes that religious conservatives will get them
sometimes british mysteries take us to places we have n't been before chasing shadows takes us straight to familiar places , and i'm not talking about the seedier parts of england the fourepisode itv series , which goes online weekly at is a missingpersons procedural with echoes of the british series waking the dead and american shows like without a trace and cold case but what s tired in chasing shadows is its detective , sean stone \( reece shearsmith \) , an antisocial , truthtelling genius who should be attending a support group along with and all the other fictional sleuths who are just a tic away from sociopathy stone , as written by rob williams \( dci banks \) , is so uncooperative that he would n't last a day on an actual police force every monk needs his natalie , and stone finds his in ruth hattersley \( \) , the civilian who becomes his partner when he s busted down from homicide to the missingpersons unit a single mom living with her meddling mother and serialkillerobsessed son , she has all the empathy he lacks and more chasing shadows does do one thing a little differently it pushes its depiction of the needy male and nurturing female partners well into motherandson territory stone is a child , constantly storming off when he does n't get his way \( and doing it with an infantilizing charlie chaplin waddle \) hattersley spends most of her time cleaning up after him , but when the killers are finally confronted , she s the one who steps in front and saves the day christopher menaul and jim o'hanlon direct the episodes briskly and efficiently and mr shearsmith , best known for the sketchcomedy show the league of gentlemen , and ms kingston , whose sexy , intelligent presence has graced er and doctor who , do their best but none of them can overcome the staleness and inconsistencies of mr williams s scripts hattersley is meant to be na ve and untutored in investigations , but at one point she does something so dumb with her phone that you immediately assume it has to be a clever ploy to fool a suspect gradually you realize that no , it was just dumb , and your sense of disappointment does n't go away
studied the itinerary for the ' last road trip and noticed a common theme the mets would be playing at camden yards in baltimore , coors field in denver and citizens bank park in philadelphia all are home run havens you 've got a chance to do some big damage , and we did , collins said , home again friday at citi field we 're back to the bigboy parks now the mets thumped 23 home runs across the nine road games , but the boston red sox were the big boys in flushing on friday , using three homers to beat the mets , 64 , in 10 innings the mets hit none for historical purposes , though , they have already made august the most prolific power month in team history with 43 home runs , the mets have eclipsed the previous mark of 40 from june 2006 , the last year they made the playoffs the mets , friday notwithstanding , also seem to have solved citi field , where they have 70 homers this season that is a singleseason home run record for the ballpark , which opened in 2009 while the mets marveled at the upgrades from shea stadium , they soon struggled with the distant fences the dimensions have been altered twice since then , and now the park has largely normalized i do n't think anybody is thinking about this ballpark being too big nobody , said kevin long , the mets' hitting coach they used to say it all the time when i was with the yankees the ballpark is homerfriendly , ' and i 'd say , but these are really good hitters' so we 've got to give them some credit as well there are simply more legitimate major leaguers in long s batting cages than there were in the season s first half yoenis cespedes , juan uribe and kelly johnson arrived in trades travis d'arnaud and david wright returned from the disabled list michael conforto came up from the minors the cumulative effect has been staggering what flo has done since the nontrade , to me , you watch him go about his business and he s so relaxed , johnson said , referring to shortstop wilmer flores , who was nearly traded to milwaukee in late july travis is that way , too there s that easiness everybody is so good about staying calm and poised , all the way down to conforto , who s just been here for a month no one s squeezing the bat hard a deep , confident lineup has not been a staple of the mets in recent seasons neither have victories , of course , and the two are related the mets are winning with dynamic young pitching , yes , but their surge to a comfortable lead in the national league east has coincided with homers johnson ended last season with the baltimore orioles , who led the majors in homers and swept their division series against the detroit tigers , who started three cy young award winners against them the orioles had power throughout their order , and now the mets do , too everybody in our lineup s really capable of doing some damage , johnson said you have depth like that , you 're going to have a pitcher wear down mentally and , eventually , physically we 've had a lot of pitchers get their pitch counts into the 60s or 70s by the fourth or fifth inning it makes a big difference the mets entered friday s game tied for third in the nl in homers , with 132 this will almost certainly be their first season since 2008 with more home runs than the major league average long , who spent the last eight seasons as the yankees' hitting coach , has been encouraged by the adjustments he has seen curtis granderson rediscovered his shorter stroke d'arnaud has stopped tinkering so much and found a consistent swing daniel murphy pulls the ball with authority then there is  he s one of the best hitters i 've ever seen , long said first of all , his strength it s bigtime strength the ball jumps off his bat he s got a very compact , repeatable swing there s not a whole lot of moving parts long continued he does n't miss a whole lot he s really a contact guy , and if he gets the barrel to the ball , which he does quite frequently , it s got an extra gear to it i do n't know what his average exit velo is , but he s got to be one of the top guys in all of baseball it comes off hot according to , the average speed of the ball off cespedes s bat was 932 miles per hour through thursday for hitters with at least 150 atbats of available data , only five had a higher exit velocity miguel cabrera , mike trout , paul goldschmidt , david ortiz and jose bautista those are franchise players , and though the mets' willingness to keep cespedes for the long term is clearly a concern , that matter is best left for another day so is the quality of pitching these hitters have faced the rockies and the phillies are far outside the pennant race the hard questions come later for now the mets can savor a joyous month , and hope for a speedy return of the quickstrike lineup that fueled it
the supreme court s decision affirming the right to samesex marriage across the united states is a joyous moment for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender americans recognition of our equal dignity , and of our right to the same legal protections straight couples enjoy , is a civil rights milestone but it could also be the swan song for the movement for gay freedom that began after world war ii it is unfortunate that the movement s two great victories of the last decade the right to serve openly in the military and the right to be married have come as progress has stalled or reversed in so many other areas of civil rights equal pay and reproductive choice for women housing and school segregation police violence against minorities and the prospects of a decent wage and a modicum of job and retirement security for all it is no accident that the one civil rights law that would likely apply to the greatest numbers of gays a ban on discrimination in employment and housing on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity continues to elude us an antidiscrimination law creates substantial costs not only for the government , which must enforce it , but also for corporations , which must comply with it letting gays into military service and into the institution of marriage does not indeed , 379 employers , including many of the nation s largest airlines , banks , health insurers and manufacturers , filed a brief in support of samesex marriage , arguing that inconsistency in marriage laws created an onerous regulatory and financial burden and hurt their efforts to recruit talent after massachusetts became the first state to legalize samesex marriage , in 2003 , a backlash of ballot initiatives and referendums banning such unions swept much of the country in response , many lesbians and gay men who were uninterested in marrying put aside their doubts for the cause but such unity of purpose comes at a price freedom to marry , the advocacy group that has led the marriage equality movement , was in 2013 the largest recipient of money from foundations that focus on gay causes will even a fraction of the energy and money that have been poured into the marriage fight be available to transgender people , homeless teenagers , victims of job discrimination , lesbian and gay refugees and asylum seekers , isolated gay elderly or other vulnerable members of our community \? around the same time new york state legalized samesex marriage , in 2011 , it was slashing funds for services to homeless youth , who are disproportionately gay or transgender the movement for gay rights that began after world war ii was waged from society s margins its most outspoken proponents sought to overturn social convention , not join it it was not at all inevitable that the movement would one day coalesce around marriage in 1953 , the first year of its publication , the national gay magazine one dismissed the idea that gays might one day be allowed to marry rebels such as we , demand freedom ! one article declared but actually we have a greater freedom now \( sub rosa as it may be \) than do heterosexuals and any change will be to lose some of it in return for respectability of course , this freedom was precarious the following year the los angeles postmaster refused to deliver an issue of the magazine on the grounds that it contained obscenity though the supreme court ruled in the magazine s favor , many gay publications , businesses and bars were forced to close in the 1950s and 1960s after the 1969 stonewall uprising in manhattan a response to a police raid on a gay bar the movement quickly built on the demands of feminists and black radicals in 1972 , one activist wrote in a lesbian newspaper that she and her comrades stand as the greatest threat to this society , far more than guncarrying revolutionaries or bombscare groups blowing up the white house or the chase manhattan bank coming out back then was itself a radical act those whose sexual identities were revealed paid dearly for it in 1975 , a vietnam veteran , oliver w sipple , thwarted an attempted assassination of president gerald r ford , yet his life was destroyed when the press found out that he was gay when the tennis champion billie jean king was outed as a lesbian in 1981 , she lost many of her commercial sponsors the aids crisis of the 1980s devastated the gay community , but also mobilized it activists found solidarity with other victims of the epidemic including intravenous drug users , sex workers and homeless people to demand federal funding for drug research and approval , and to protest the reagan administration s cuts to the social safety net in 1991 , the activist organization act up demonstrated at a meeting of the american medical association to demand universal health care the crisis revealed , in matters like child custody , hospital visitation and endoflife care , the impact of excluding gays from marriage but even as aids renewed longstanding fear of gays , it also propelled them into the political mainstream aids service organizations became part of a growing nonprofit sector in the two decades since pharmaceutical advances made aids less lethal in the united states , the gay rights movement has increasingly made alliances with government and even corporations to press its demands until very recently , most gay victories were won at the local or state level the federal government lagged prodded by activists , president obama changed this dynamic he joined democratic lawmakers to repeal the ban on gays' openly serving in the military , a legacy of president bill clinton s administration mr obama s justice department refused to defend a key provision of the defense of marriage act \( another clintonera legacy \) , before the supreme court struck that provision down two years ago this gay pride month wo n't soon be forgotten many of us are thinking of friends and lovers who did not live to see this day cake will be eaten , flowers strewn brooms will be jumped over , and glasses smashed some of us would not have chosen to put the marriage fight ahead of others , but none can deny that there has been a widespread hunger for this right there will be pockets of backlash resistance by a few local clerks , and socalled religious liberty laws to exempt businesses from having to comply but the graver danger comes not from the religious right , but from the risk that our newfound clout will blind some of us to the struggles of others more gays are insiders than ever before a gay man leads apple , one of america s most valuable corporations a lesbian , tammy baldwin , democrat of wisconsin , was elected to the senate in 2012 prominent republicans , libertarians , financiers and chief executives have given their names , time and money to the cause of samesex marriage but many more gay and transgender americans are permanent outsiders some churches are doubling down on antigay rhetoric , which fuels family rejection and contributes to youth homelessness violence against transgender americans is on the rise gay people in prison remain subject to rape and abuse rates of new hiv infections are rising among young black men just as feminists learned after the 19th amendment was ratified in 1920 , a social movement that throws most of its weight in pursuit of a single policy may falter and stagnate when it achieves a resounding victory gays must now devote to the fight for protection from discrimination the same resourcefulness and energy with which we fought for the right to marry we should keep in mind that our struggle began as a fight against police harassment , and black lives matter is our cause , too befitting its status as the 20th , not the first , country to legalize samesex marriage , america should preach equality abroad humbly , acknowledging that it does so with the zeal of a convert the gay movement has stood for valuing all families including those led by single parents , those with adopted children , and other configurations it has stood for other ideas , too , that risk being lost in this moment s profamily turn that intimacy , domesticity and caretaking do not always come packaged together that marriage should not be the only way to protect one s children , property and health that having a family should n't be a requirement for full citizenship and that conventional respectability should n't be the only route to social acceptance many of the undergraduates at the college where i teach cannot remember a time when samesex marriage was unthinkable but for most americans alive today , to come out as gay meant accepting that we would never wed it meant that we who decided to come out had little choice but to empathize with the excluded we were not , for obvious reasons , the marrying kind that was part of what made us special for some of us , marriage will be a ticket out of the margins but it would be a tragedy if , vindicated by the supreme court , many of us proclaim a premature victory , overlooking those of us who are still left out , and many more people around the world for whom the quest for basic recognition is much in doubt betraying our history forgetting what it has meant to be gay would be a price too high to pay

there s an adage in my business that it s not news when a dog bites a man , only when a man bites a dog by that reasoning , the political story of the year so far is paul ryan s announcement that he will not run for president seemingly everyone else in his party will rick santorum s back george pataki s back mike huckabee s back , with an alliterative new book \( god , guns , grits and gravy \) that sounds like an agenda hijacked by a denny s menu , or maybe a sequel to fried green tomatoes starring mel gibson and a howitzer even rick perry s back i 'd tick off three reasons that he s crazy to try again except that i can remember only two he s a whole new candidate , at least on the accessories front it s been said that americans give you 10 additional iq points if you have a british accent he s betting on an extra five for eyeglasses and now the heart quickens and the flesh quivers mitt romney s back that s the word this week that he s inching ever closer to another presidential bid , which we know because he s articulated as much to donors does n't it pretty much say everything about our political process right now that candidates flag their intentions first to the people they 'll be hitting up for money \? and that the way they attempt to clear the field is n't with a surge in polls but with a fortune in the bank \? i bet some of them form pacs before they bother to tell their spouses what s up it s called priorities by that i just came across , there are 25 republicans of some standing who have signaled at least a flickering interest in the 2016 race this certainly explains the dip in unemployment thousands of republican presidential strategists and advisers have been added to payrolls it also explains the difference between the parties democrats want to expand government republicans want to expand auditions for it a romney candidacy would be curious in the extreme in 2000 , al gore beat george w bush in the popular vote and lost the presidency by dint of a supreme court ruling he nonetheless let someone else carry the democratic banner in 2004 that person was john kerry , who came closer to winning than romney did , and yet he , too , did n't circle back four years later for more punishment from what i hear , romney began mulling a third bid for the presidency months ago , when the republican establishment remained skeptical of chris christie and when it was n't at all certain that jeb bush would join the race romney was poised to rush in like a cinematically coifed superhero and save the party from the deliriums of rand paul and the diatribes of ted cruz by the time bush began all the maneuvering of the last four weeks , romney had developed the itch he also apparently believes that bush s support for common core educational standards and immigration reform will cripple him in the primaries if bush formalizes a candidacy and romney follows suit , he 'd run to bush s right but bush is the one with the truly conservative record as a governor , in florida , while romney is the one with a moderate record from massachusetts he 'd be flipping the script , and if his political orientation was confusing last time around , it would be only more so this time he s that bush s financial dealings will make him acutely vulnerable to attacks so the solution is romney \? his campaign would be predicated on buyer s remorse voters could have had him and now get a doover but the buyers may be growing less remorseful romney had promised them that by the end of his first term , unemployment would be at or under 6 percent it s there already , in half the time romney , perry and others forget that when they 're not candidates , they 're well loved when they are , they 're well trashed today s fascination is tomorrow s flop on meet the press , a hapless porterhouse for the panel to carve up some republicans \( and democrats \) are simply chasing higher speaking fees , maybe a book like huckabee s , hold the gravy but there s a cost to us an overcrowded field of candidates does n't mean a more spirited exchange of ideas it means so many voices that none get properly heard \( or vetted \) remember those early republican debates during the last cycle , when so many contenders fanned out across the stage that they looked like misbegotten rockettes \? we could have twice that number in 2016 we could have a crowd scene in cats so i 'd say to romney to the times s ashley parker when she asked him early last year about one more campaign oh , no , no , no no , no , no , no , no no , no , no
beijing intends to project naval power in the open ocean in coming years , and not just defend the country s coastal waters , according to a released on tuesday the paper , the first policy document issued by the chinese military in two years , comes at a time of growing chinese assertiveness in the south china sea s efforts to enforce its disputed claims to vast stretches of the sea by building up artificial islands and structures on reefs and outcroppings have drawn the philippines and its ally the united states into a test of wills in the region the last week when an american military surveillance plane flew near fiery cross reef , a contested atoll in the spratly islands that has been the site of frenetic dredging work in recent months chinese forces repeatedly ordered the american plane to leave the area , and a foreign ministry spokesman later called the flight irresponsible and dangerous the pentagon said earlier this month that it was weighing whether to send warships and aircraft into what it says are international waters , but china says are within its zone of control on tuesday , in an act of defiance likely to further inflame tensions in the region , china s state news media announced that construction work had begun on two lighthouses in the spratlys , adding to a growing array of chinesebuilt structures that have been identified in satellite photos , including radar facilities and a runway capable of handling military aircraft the policy document , released by the state council , lays out china s military ambitions , a central element of what its leaders call a national rejuvenation , as beijing moves to counter what it sees as american efforts to contain its rise it extends beyond naval policy to emphasize the continued modernization of the chinese military in general , and it describes as a grave security threat that requires the development of a cybermilitary force but western analysts said the document s emphasis on improving naval capabilities and projecting force far from china s coastline was the most striking facet of the paper col steve warren , a defense department spokesman , said that the chinese government had informed the united states about the strategic paper almost a year ago we have repeatedly called on the chinese for transparency , and frankly , this is an example of transparency , colonel warren told reporters on tuesday their strategy is their strategy , he added what we want to focus on is the fact that they released the strategy publicly , which is exactly the type of thing that we 've been calling for jeff rathke , a state department spokesman , said on tuesday that the obama administration would continue to monitor china s military developments carefully dennis j blasko , an asia analyst at cna corporation who studies china s armed forces , said the paper formally enunciated a transformation that the military had been going through for some time , and that had gained pace in recent years this basically confirms everything that the vast majority of analysts have seen developing the trends toward a greater maritime force , a stronger air force and improved missile forces , said mr blasko , a former army attach at the united states embassy in beijing still , even if it s something we 've been expecting , it s a new statement and a big statement although the strategy paper mentions the united states only in passing , it leaves little doubt about whom china perceives as its opponent , blaming some external countries for meddling in affairs at a news conference discussing the strategy paper , yang yujun , a defense ministry spokesman , made clear that china regards those affairs as no one s business but its own looking from the angle of sovereignty , china s development of construction on its islands is no different at all from all the other types of construction going on around the country , he said chinese military strategists have long signaled their intention to improve the nation s naval strength and reduce its reliance on its land forces , which have been dominant since the 1940s in recent years , the people s liberation army , which takes in all branches of the military including the navy , has invested in new submarines , and announced plans to restructure the armed forces , although it has released few details according to mr blasko , the navy accounts for about 10 percent of the pla s 23 million members , while about 17 percent serve in the air force nearly all the rest are in the army analysts said the tensions in the south china sea were one factor accelerating beijing s efforts to build up its naval and air strength but events elsewhere have also played a role , prompting chinese leaders to abandon longheld policies discouraging overseas military engagement in 2008 , during the height of somali piracy in the gulf of aden , china sent two destroyers and a supply ship to the region , the first time it had dispatched battleready warships beyond the pacific in april , it sent three naval vessels to yemen , where it evacuated hundreds of chinese and other foreign nationals from the conflicttorn country the traditional mentality that land outweighs sea must be abandoned , and great importance has to be attached to managing the seas and oceans and protecting maritime rights and interests , the strategy paper said it is necessary for china to develop a modern maritime military force structure commensurate with its national security and development interests xu guangyu , a retired major general who is now a senior counselor with the china arms control and disarmament association , said the emphasis on open sea protection was a sign of china s spreading economic and diplomatic footprint abroad as china continues to rise , it has enormous interests around the globe that need protection , he said , including investments , trade , energy , imports and the surging presence of chinese living abroad still , he noted that the document stressed beijing s resolve to deter foreign aggression and to win a war started by others china will actively build up its military capability and deterrence , just to make sure no one dares fight with us , said general xu , whose institute advises the chinese foreign ministry the united states cannot expect china to back off under pressure it needs to know that the consequences would be unthinkable if it pushes china into a corner the united states has not taken a position on the overlapping territorial claims in the south china sea , parts of which are claimed by the philippines , vietnam , malaysia and brunei as well as by china washington says the disputes should be resolved through diplomacy but the obama administration says none of the claimants should interfere with international navigation in the area , and in recent days , pentagon officials have said they have no intention of halting american reconnaissance flights near the contested islets bernard d cole , a professor at the national war college in washington , said the strategy paper suggested that there was little chance that china would relinquish its territorial ambitions in the south china sea , which is rich in oil , gas and fishing resources i think china has been feeling pretty confident as it pushed ahead , trying to feel the threshold where the us reaction would be , dr cole said we may be seeing that threshold now , but i see absolutely no evidence that china is going to stop its island construction
after a rocky start , the luxury condominiums at one museum mile , the 19story , robert a m sterndesigned tower anchoring the northeast corner of central park , are  but six years after , the building s most prominent space , the new home for the africa center , remains little more than bare concrete walls , and the institution s blueprint for the future also remains unfinished to remedy this , the center has hired an africa expert , michelle d gavin , to lead an organization that has been transformed by and stymied by fundraising obstacles ms gavin , the new managing director , served as the united states ambassador to botswana from 2011 to 2014 and previously worked as a special assistant to president obama and senior director for africa on the national security council the dexterity and discretion honed in such roles were on display when she was asked in an interview when the center , whose launch has been postponed six times , might finally open at this point , she said , the timing is unclear the reason i do n't want to pluck dates from the calendar goes back to this i do n't want to make promises i ca n't keep , she said that s the first way to lose credibility , especially when you 're new but the tasks ahead seem likely to tax even ms gavin s considerable diplomatic skills the africa center , whose last projected construction budget neared 100 million , must raise a considerable amount in a competitive environment for cultural institutions , in a city in which costs have escalated since the institution last put its construction work out for bid ms gavin must also flesh out the new vision for what was created more than 30 years ago as the museum for african art and is now remaking itself as a hybrid organization part cultural outpost , part public policy institute and part international business forum and she will have to accomplish this while repairing a frayed relationship with some leaders in the community who say the institution , once touted by the city as the cultural gateway to harlem , has had little interaction with the neighborhood from a community point of view , it s a broken promise , a dream deferred , said state senator bill perkins , whose harlem district encompasses the africa center matthew s washington , chairman of community board 11 , said he had yet to hear from anyone at the africa center about its vision an email here , an email there , a phone call it s not a lot to ask , he said last year , for reasons of efficiency , the center reduced its board of trustees to five members from 25 , leaving none from the surrounding neighborhood or the world of african art ms gavin said she is setting off on a listening tour to hear such concerns and to help her finetune and weave together the component parts of the institution s mission , which resembles , in part , that of the asia society let s stress test our ideas , bounce them off others , including those who are skeptical , she said her appointment is the latest twist in the life of the museum the brainchild of the art historian and curator susan mullin vogel , it opened in 1984 as the museum for african art in two upper east side townhouses , then later relocated to soho and long island city , queens though the museum has organized a number of critically acclaimed traveling shows over the years , it currently is not presenting any exhibitions in 1997 , elsie mccabe thompson , a lawyer who had served as chief of staff for mayor david dinkins , assumed the presidency , and the ambitions grew she began pushing for the museum to build a grand headquarters and eventually settled on a soaring space inside the proposed building at the northeast corner of fifth avenue and 110th street a museum is very much an edifice , and you ca n't attract a loyal and dedicated audience if you 're constantly on the move , ms thompson said but she resigned in 2012 , and financial realities intruded despite the commitment of more than 32 million in public funds unable to meet its 135 million construction budget , the center last year scaled back its design and said it hoped to raise the final 20 million needed to finish the project by the fall but only 95 million was raised now , to help with fundraising and strategy , the center has enlisted pamela puchalski , an urban planner , as a consultant it has also named fab 5 freddy , an artist , filmmaker and hiphop pioneer , to be chief creative consultant ms gavin traces her interest in africa to her days at georgetown s school of foreign service , during which she lived in cameroon to help her pass a foreignlanguage proficiency test it was 1994 , a year of contrast on the continent nelson mandela dancing to celebrate a new , apartheidfree south africa even as some 800 , 000 people were slaughtered by ethnic hutu extremists in rwanda if you were n't captivated by the stakes of what was happening in africa in 1994 , then you were n't paying attention , she said returning last spring from her service in botswana , she had planned to take a year off but she cut short her sabbatical after receiving an entreaty last fall from hadeel ibrahim , the cochairwoman of the board alongside chelsea clinton \( and the daughter of the sudaneseborn billionaire and philanthropist mo ibrahim \) the big idea of the africa center , ms gavin said , which is helping america better understand and engage with contemporary africa , that is a really good reason to go to work every morning she said american impressions of africa are typically imprecise either it s the death , despair , disease narrative , where it s all one undifferentiated mass of disaster , she said or else it s the africa rising narrative , which is equally undifferentiated , where everything is awesome in the first three to five years , she said , the center will focus on three subject areas urbanization in africa , managing diversity , and youth engagement and empowerment ms gavin said her experience running an embassy with about 350 employees taught her to recognize what she does n't know i'm not an african art expert , she said i'm not going to pretend to be we 're going to get the right people who are steeped in that expertise and have the curatorial skill to help realize the vision of the center the institution s collection consists of about 550 objects from africa or the african diaspora , including a bronze benin head , carved wood figures , and masks and paintings by the sudanese artist  ms thompson said she wishes her successor the best and is hopeful that the populist vision for the museum , symbolized by the soaring trapezoidshaped windows looking out to central park , comes through when the africa center opens its doors the brilliant robert am stern architecture literally opens its walls to the community , she said all they need to do programmatically is invite them in the curiosity appears to exist one blustery day in february , a visitor wandered into the lobby of the

the climb took decades , but the fall was swift less than a year removed from his reign as speaker of the rhode island house , gordon d fox pleaded guilty on tuesday to taking bribes , wire fraud and filing a false tax return mr fox , 53 , took 52 , 500 in bribes to help a bar and restaurant get a liquor license and illegally diverted 108 , 000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses he made the admissions in federal district court in providence as part of a plea agreement that calls for a threeyear prison sentence though a judge will ultimately decide the penalty and will almost certainly cost him his law license outside the courthouse , when asked by reporters whether he felt remorse , mr fox said , absolutely , absolutely , without question last march , state and federal agents raided his offices and home , and mr fox , one of the most powerful figures in state politics , quickly the leadership post and announced that he would not seek reelection in november peter f neronha , the united states attorney for rhode island , and peter f kilmartin , the state attorney general , said at a news conference that the investigation had begun as a look into campaign finance abuses over a sixyear period , mr neronha said , mr fox used campaign funds to pay the mortgage on his home , the loan payment on his car and his personal american express card , covering charges ranging from shopping at tiffany company to paying the bill at an animal hospital the paperwork seized in the raids turned up evidence of another crime bribes that mr fox accepted in 2008 , when he was vice chairman of providence s board of licenses , to help the shark bar grille , in the affluent college hill neighborhood , obtain a liquor license not surprisingly , he reported none of the personal income from repeatedly stealing from his campaign accounts or taking bribes , mr neronha said citing the state s long history of misdeeds by its political leaders , mr neronha said , as rhode islanders , we need to lose our political corruption amnesia prosecutors would not say whether anyone connected to the shark bar grille had helped in the investigation , or might also face charges calls to the restaurant on tuesday went unanswered , but the owner , raymond hugh , told the associated press that the bribery allegation against mr fox was news to me mr fox , a democrat , was the first openly gay person and the first mixedrace person to lead either of the state s legislative chambers , and he led the drive to legalize in 2013 he grew up as one of six children in a bluecollar family , with a black mother and a white father , and he liked to recall how he had worked in an ice cream shop to help pay his way through law school he became a lawyer and part owner of a nightclub , and in 1992 he was elected to the house he became the majority leader in 2002 and the speaker in 2010 rhode island has had more than its share of scandalscarred politicians over the years , notably buddy cianci , a former mayor of providence mr cianci resigned that post in 1984 and was convicted on an assault charge he made a political comeback to be elected mayor again , then resigned again and was convicted of racketeering in 2002 , serving a prison sentence former gov edward d diprete pleaded guilty to bribery and extortion in 1998 and also served time two consecutive chief justices of the state supreme court resigned in the face of corruption investigations , joseph a bevilacqua in 1986 , and thomas f fay in 1993 john harwood resigned as house speaker in 2002 , and william v irons stepped down as senate president in 2004 , amid other scandals
july is to internships what march is to college basketball tens of thousands of interns have descended on new york , washington , los angeles and other internship capitals with the hope of showing off the talent needed to land a job and in some fields , one s chances are about as high as getting picked in the  in the last few years , interns have been organizing against an exploitative system in which colleges encourage or even require students to join in a race to the bottom , working for free under the guise of training and recruitment lawsuits more than 30 filed , and counting have been a vital strategy for interns asserting their right to at least minimum wage the most highprofile suit was brought by eric glatt and alexander footman , who as unpaid interns for fox searchlight pictures did work like drawing up purchase orders and making spreadsheets for the movie black swan , which went on to make over 300 million two years ago , a federal judge in manhattan in their favor , and it seemed to signal the beginning of the end of the unpaid internship some colleges and employers began privately voicing their unease about a pay to play system that drives entrylevel jobs to the brink of extinction and excludes those unable to work for free since a 1947 supreme court , the united states department of labor has used a sixfactor checklist to determine whether an internship is legal the internship must be similar to the training that would be given in an educational environment it must be done for the intern s benefit it ca n't displace regular employees it ca n't provide immediate advantage to the employer and the intern must understand that no wages are being received and that no job is waiting at the end of the internship the judge , william h pauley iii , found that fox searchlight had failed to meet this test sadly , on thursday , a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit eviscerated the and replaced it with , in essence , a new legal theory of what internships are all about the appeals judges , among other things , that an internship can be legal even if it does n't meet the traditional sixprong test , especially if it is tied to the receipt of school credit and helps the student fulfill academic commitments even worse , the judges declared that the proper question is whether the intern or the employer is the primary beneficiary of the relationship they ignored the legal standard and ethical principle that work merits pay the judges stressed that internships may be legal merely because they are supposedly being overseen by the interns' schools but these very same institutions have been complicit in the internship boom by ignoring abuses , requiring internships for graduation and charging students for academic credit when they go off campus to do unpaid work the primary beneficiary approach leads to the atomizing result that interns cannot unite to protect themselves the judges write that the question of an intern s employment status is a highly individualized inquiry , ignoring the low or nonexistent pay and shabby work conditions common to interns in many offices and industries thursday s ruling all but destroys the basis for collective action through classaction lawsuits at oral arguments in january i had filed an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs it was evident that the three judges had no firsthand experience of what they call the modern internship focusing on what the intern receives in exchange for his work , the judges completely ignore the significant benefits that employers derive from their interns yes , the best internships pay a living wage , teach real skills and can lead to permanent jobs , but the majority do none of the above without pay , interns lack the most basic workplace protections the new ruling makes it all the more imperative that states follow the recent lead of oregon , connecticut and new york , which have passed laws extending to interns safeguards from workplace discrimination and harassment legislation on intern pay should be next on the agenda organizing efforts on college campuses and in workplaces should intensify the legal route alone is insufficient for the black swan interns , the battle is far from over the next step may be to go before the second circuit en banc \( all of the court s judges , not just a threejudge panel \) or eventually even before the supreme court , which has not delivered a major ruling relevant to interns since 1947 despite its liberal recent term , this supreme court has been characterized by deference toward corporations and hostility toward workers still , surprises are possible the careers of millions of young people may hang on the result

lausanne , switzerland the united states and its negotiating partners on tuesday extended their deadline for reaching a preliminary accord with on its until wednesday but that oneday extension came with a white house warning that the obama administration was prepared to step back from its diplomatic efforts if it concluded that the initial accord could not be reached i actually would say that if we 're not able to reach a political agreement in the timeline that we 've described that we would walk away from the negotiating table , said josh earnest , the white house spokesman the obama administration has approached the talks as a twophase process the preliminary accord it is trying to negotiate as a first step is intended to lay the foundation for a more detailed accord that would be fleshed out by the end of june the nations involved in the talks with iran are britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states there have been signs that some of the most will be deferred for a final agreement in three months but even getting that preliminary accord has been hard the thorny issues have included disputes over what limits would be placed on the development of new types of centrifuges to enrich uranium and the pace for removing sanctions and on monday the state department acknowledged that a key question also remained a subject of debate the bottom line is that we do n't have agreement with the iranians on the stockpile issue , said marie harf , a state department spokeswoman but the talks have also been burdened by clashing negotiating strategies the obama administration wants to nail down specific limits on iran s nuclear program as soon as possible so that it can better resist moves in congress to impose additional sanctions it also wants any sanctions relief to be gradual in order to ensure that that it does not come before iran meets its obligations under a nuclear accord but the iranians want most of their sanctions relief up front and have been resisted accepting stringent limits before they receive it tuesday appeared to begin auspiciously when sergey v lavrov , russia s foreign minister , said in moscow that there was a high chance of an accord and that he was flying to back to switzerland , after leaving the day before , to rejoin the talks the odds for a deal are probably not 100 percent , but you can never be 100 percent certain of anything , mr lavrov said the odds are quite doable' if none of the parties raise the stakes at the last minute frankwalter steinmeier , the german foreign minister , reinforced the sense of progress when he said friday morning that the talks had been in something of a crisis but that negotiators seemed to have settled on a bit of a new approach as the day dragged on , however , a european official said that the talks were difficult by early evening , the tuesday deadline had been extended we 've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until wednesday , ms harf said there are several difficult issues still remaining american officials said that no ultimatums had been issued but with lawmakers set to return in midapril after a congressional recess , mr earnest signaled that there was only so long that the white house was prepared to wait if we are making progress toward the finish line , then we should keep going , he said if we 're not able to reach a political agreement , then we 're not going to wait all the way until june 30th to walk away
wroclaw , poland with her right hand on her hip , agata zubel stood in front of a large black music stand , listening intently to the conversation between the members of eighth blackbird , a sixpiece chicagobased ensemble working on the contemporary classical piece madrigal , by the french composer christophe bertrand as the musicians discussed whether to use a metronome in the form of an app on the smartphone of their pianist , lisa kaplan ms zubel made notes on her sheet music the group was rehearsing for the wratislavia cantans , an international festival of oratorio and cantata music held each september in wroclaw , poland as the musicians began playing without metronome ms zubel started singing a highpitched vocal line , in french the cacophony of sounds from cello , flute , piano , clarinet , violin and percussion resembled a musical version of spring gone awry , with shifting quick high notes and booming sporadic percussion as the last note reverberated across the rehearsal room , the musicians relaxed and smiled at one another ms zubel laughed so much work for such a short piece , she said the 37yearold ms zubel has , in a relatively short career so far , become one of europe s most accomplished and internationally successful contemporary classical composers and vocalists in 2013 her composition not i for chamber ensemble , electronic instruments and voice was deemed the best of the year by the international music council s international rostrum of composers the recorded performance of that piece , with austria s , was listed as one of the new yorker s  she has been commissioned to write pieces for global festivals and orchestras from seattle to tel aviv her discography includes over a dozen albums , including dream lake , with the finnish pianist joonas ahonen , and stories nowhere from , an album of experimental electronic music with the pianist and composer cezary duchnowski that will be released nov 6 the duo , who have worked together for years , perform as elettrovoce in october , ms zubel , who is married to a fellow polish composer , michal moc , began a threemonth fellowship in austria , where she will be composing an opera for the klangforum wien the group will also perform not i at the huddersfield contemporary music festival in england in november in january , she will perform at new york s ferus festival , and the will premiere her commissioned work chapter 13 , based on antoine de saintexup ry s the little prince next may the in paris will premiere a new instrumental electronic piece by her , and in october the will perform an orchestral piece she is writing for the company she will do everything possible to bring the music to life and she is such an incredible stage animal , just to be on stage with her is an experience , said mikhail shmidt , a violinist with both the seattle chamber players and the seattle symphony , and a longtime friend one of her bestknown pieces was a work for the entitled cascando the piece , written a decade ago , has become something of a calling card for her and has been performed by groups across the globe since then , ms zubel has become a very good friend of the chamber players sometimes , mr shmidt said with a laugh , i feel like we almost subconsciously are creating our seasons with some kind of possibilities that she would come here jeffrey zeigler , a cellist formerly with the who performed with ms zubel at the ferus festival last spring , said that as a performer , ms zubel had that thing , ' that it , ' that quality where you walk in a room and go , wow , that was good' i do n't care if you like a completely different style of music , you , too , would be engaged by her artistry , he added though ms zubel did not come from a musical family her mother works in nanotechnology she was drawn to music from an early age she recalled that in her kindergarten in wroclaw there was a piano that none of the children were allowed to touch during class but in the afternoons , when many of her classmates had gone home , she and fellow students were allowed to play on it i remember other children would ask their parents to pick them up early , she recalled , i always begged my mom to come very , very late , as it was the only time i could play the piano music lessons began when she was about 7 , and though she started on the violin , her teacher noticed she had a good sense of rhythm and switched her to percussion unlike a piano or a violin , which is limited to specific sounds it can make , percussion music , she said , can be anything whatever you want can be an instrument , she said it can really open your mind and your imagination for the world of sound having won a children s competition for composition when she was 10 , ms zubel was inspired to take her musical writing seriously later , while studying composition at the karol lipinski academy of music in wroclaw , she discovered her voice as a singer asked to write a piece for a contemporary female vocalist who was coming to wroclaw to perform , ms zubel composed the experimental electronic piece parlando later , in an academy musical showcase , she could not find anyone else to perform the piece and so decided to sing it herself it was a very nice and strange moment after this concert my composer colleagues went crazy , they started writing pieces for me to sing , she recalled recently over tea in a caf near wroclaw s new national forum of music that experience , she said , made her think that it might be important to train her voice an idea that , as a percussionist , intrigued her this is a very small and very tiny instrument which is here to produce thousands of different beautiful sounds , she said , even if they are somehow strange and even if you are not used to it as a musical sound the combination of being a composer and a vocalist is not only rare in classical contemporary music , but it also makes ms zubel interesting to work with , fellow musicians say she is like a virtuosa performer , mr zeigler , the cellist , said in classical music , to actually have classical composers writing compositions on paper , that is a very unusual thing , and she does everything at such a high level she is a special talent , for sure matthew duvall , the percussionist of eighth blackbird , agreed he first saw ms zubel perform in chicago a few years ago during the contempo festival , where she will perform again in february a lot of vocalists have really remarkable instruments and really great stage presence , but she has a deeper sense of musicianship , he said the reason i was excited about working with her , regardless of what she does be it violin , piano , harmonica or voice is she was clearly an intuitive chamber musician that intuition also comes across in her composing , which she does from her home office with a pencil and paper she has a doctoral degree in composition and teaches the discipline at her alma mater in wroclaw she acknowledged that contemporary classical music did not have broad appeal , but that it was music that reflected the here and now not unlike classical music from previous centuries this is art of my time , she said
havana a minibus of americans rumbled through a city in transformation , past the rundown housing and roundtheclock construction , the sparsely stocked bodegas and chic new restaurants , to a reception at the residence of the american charg s d'affaires the hint of change teased the november night a few guests wore golf shirts embroidered with the brand names of sodas and snacks and auto parts but the business of these men arriving by bus , all in dark suits or blazers , was of a different order to have a major league team s minor league affiliate based in havana , perhaps as early as 2017 their plan was freighted with history it would restore the professional baseball bond once shared by two countries long at odds , but it would be possible only in accordance with united states law and , these men insisted , with the full participation of cuba in other words , when the time was right but , as the common sight of a driver talking on a cellphone while in a 1950sera chevy suggests , time moves differently here more than half a century has passed since the havana sugar kings , a cincinnati reds affiliate , played in the class aaa international league since the giddy gunfire of followers of the revolutionary fidel castro grazed a shortstop and a thirdbase coach at a game against the rochester red wings since havana won the 1959 little world series against the minneapolis millers here at home the notion of returning to those days , absent the gunfire , may sound like pie in the sky , given the longstanding american embargo against cuba but president obama and the cuban president , ra l castro , announced plans last december to a first hesitant step toward normalizing relations and some see a chance for an exemption from the embargo a baseball carveout what s more , this group s enthusiastic leader , a veteran minor league executive named lou schwechheimer , has spent the last dozen years preparing for just such a moment he has secured the exclusive rights from minor league baseball to return professional baseball to havana he has assembled this group , called the caribbean baseball initiative , which includes two highly regarded former american ambassadors he has obtained the necessary licensing from the treasury department s office of foreign assets control he has raised considerable capital and , very quietly , he has built a baseball empire as of this month , the caribbean baseball initiative owns controlling interests in the new orleans zephyrs , a miami marlins franchise in the class aaa pacific coast league , and the charlotte stone crabs , a tampa bay rays franchise in the class a florida state league the group also holds a minority interest in the scranton wilkesbarre railriders , a yankees franchise in the international league none of these teams will be moved to cuba , schwechheimer said , although they may figure in various goodwill initiatives he has in mind , including playing a class aaa allstar game in havana , providing muchneeded baseball equipment , and sponsoring seminars on training and conditioning but he also said , we have the financial resources to acquire additional minor league teams , one of which may ultimately wind up in havana but only at the appropriate time until that appropriate time , schwechheimer and his associates plan to continue their minibus missions to cuba , listening , explaining and seeking a partner in a joint baseball venture but only thoughtfully , respectfully and when cuba is willing , he said we 're not going to be the ugly americans schwechheimer s cuban mission sprang from a longago gathering of baseball lifers , swapping stories over drinks a particularly informed hot stove league , you might say it was at professional baseball s 2002 fall gathering in tampa , fla , and schwechheimer , then a 45yearold executive and part owner of the pawtucket red sox , found himself with , among others , frank verdi , the thirdbase coach once winged by a bullet , and harold cooper , a onetime president of the international league , who began his career during the depression , wiping the mold from a ballpark s hot dogs with a vinegar rag as they recalled the days when havana was part of minor league baseball the high level of play , the passion of the fans , the sugar kings one of the men , george steinbrenner , challenged the young schwechheimer to return havana to the fold schwechheimer accepted soon he was sharing his vision with advisers at the kennedy school of government at harvard , where he was studying soon he was the keynote speaker at a conference in havana , delivering a paper titled your baseball stadium a front porch to havana and an economic development opportunity for cuba since then , he has dedicated himself to having the international league once again live up to its name a goal made all the more possible with obama s surprise and daring announcement last december to begin a new chapter with cuba this is the moment in time , schwechheimer said and we 're closing in on it but schwechheimer faces a few daunting obstacles , said juan a triana , a professor of economics at the university of havana for one , the vertical permission structure of cuban bureaucracy can be exhausting , he said for another , some hardliners here have little interest in restoring ties with the united states it must be done step by step , triana said it could take one year , two years , three years this was schwechheimer s fifth trip to cuba , and many others are planned , including one next month his patient confidence , he said , comes from believing that baseball is the common denominator in the cubanamerican equation , as well as from the directive he has received in meetings with state department officials be bold and engage for five days , the men on the minibus kept to a crowded schedule of meetings with toplevel american and cuban officials , interrupted here and there with arranged moments of baseball good will they spent a good part of their time peering through tinted glass at the evolving havana panorama the new world utilitarian building blocks and crumbling old world structures , the che guevara silhouettes and the restaurants with valet service , the northward view of the sea along the boulevard called the malec n , toward florida , 90 miles away all the while , their mantra was respectful engagement , with a side of tranquilo with schwechheimer were a rhode island financier , a university professor of sports management , a veteran minor league executive , and three members of the cohen group , a highvoltage consultancy firm in washington tommy goodman , a spanishfluent lawyer who handled the trip s every detail , and two legendary american statesmen one , marc grossman , a former ambassador to turkey , retired in 2005 as the state department s thirdranking official , serving as the undersecretary of state for political affairs in 2011 , obama called the retired grossman into temporary service as a special representative for afghanistan and pakistan he roots for the los angeles dodgers the other , jeffrey davidow , has been the ambassador to mexico , venezuela and zambia , as well as the assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs he retired in 2003 as career ambassador , the foreign service s highest position , which , by law , can be held by no more than five people at a time he follows the boston red sox the two foreign service veterans had learned long ago how to hear what was not being said , how to deconstruct a handshake , how to deftly use the tool of time they understood the value of patience for example , on the group s first night in havana , schwechheimer treated several cuban friends to dinner he mentioned in passing that he would someday like to share his baseball plans with antonio castro , an orthopedic surgeon , one of the country s most prominent baseball officials and a son of fidel it was quickly intimated that such a meeting was possible the next night , one of schwechheimer s dinner guests , a former cuban legislator , invited the americans to the historic hotel nacional de cuba there they were introduced with some pomp to the hotel s manager , who said he would provide a private room for the meeting on the day it happened then the american entourage was led into a small theater to watch a long cabaret performance that seemed lifted from a 1940s mgm musical every so often the legislator would raise his hand , and bottles of cristal beer , bowls of olives and trays of cured ham would appear for the rest of the fiveday trip , a meeting with antonio castro seemed imminent there were periodic cellphone calls to goodman to stand by , prompting the american visitors to change out of casual clothes and into suits and ties all the while , the two former ambassadors kept their expectations low the meeting never took place , further underscoring the sense that not all is what it seems in cuba but schwechheimer was unperturbed a chat with castro was never part of the original schedule besides , the group was already making headway in substantive meetings with cuban officials in the ministries of culture and sports as well as with the cuban baseball federation , which governs the sport and this would not be its last trip tranquilo , schwechheimer said we 'll be back besides , the visitors had more than enough to do in trying to navigate the decadesold distrust between the two countries , even in the limited sphere of baseball there is the cuban resentment over the continuing and often risky defections of its ballplayers , including some of the top stars many believe this baseball drain has led to a decline in the quality of play in their country s amateur games and on the national team there is also the thorny matter of compensation given the embargo , cuba receives nothing when a defecting ballplayer , like yoenis cespedes or yasiel puig , signs a multimilliondollar contract with a major league team , which is not the case when a cuban plays in , say , japan or south korea the two countries , along with major league baseball , have been working to resolve the matter antonio castro told espn last year that the current arrangement , which effectively forces cuban ballplayers to sever ties with their native country , was crazy , but he also allowed that cuba has to budge on the matter once these issues are resolved perhaps through an exemption to the embargo schwechheimer expects to be at the front of the line , offering affordable family entertainment , as well as jobs , to havana and , yes , cuban ballplayers would be welcome to play in these minor league games if they made the roster schwechheimer said his group was not lobbying to change cuban or american law its mission , he said , is to present its motives as honorable should cuba someday say yes to the possibility of a minor league franchise , and to celebrate , through gestures of good will , the commonality found through a game what lou s trying to do makes sense , davidow said it more than makes sense it s a good thing to that end , the group gravitated toward various baseballcentric places in and around havana this is not difficult , given the game s hold on the country , where baseball souvenirs are for sale at an open market in old havana , and blackandwhite photographs of legendary cuban ballplayers hang in a highend , museumlike restaurant called san cristobal paladar still , the growing popularity of soccer in cuba was evident everywhere , especially on television at one point , the minibus passed a soccer game being played on a baseball field , and someone halfjoked , the enemy in addition , baseball remains intertwined with the complex diplomatic and political realities of cuba , as evidenced by the reluctance of cuban and american officials to discuss it a state department official said in an email that the american embassy in havana was aware of the efforts by private institutions like the caribbean baseball initiative to increase ties between the two countries , and described baseball as an excellent avenue for sports diplomacy and creating good will between our peoples the official wrote , the connections that our countries already have in baseball create a common bond , and the increased flow of players and friendly competition furthers the us goal of enhancing opportunities for the cuban people officials for the cuban baseball federation declined to speak on the record , and a request for comment from the cuban embassy was not answered it was left , then , to a cuban ballplayer to speak the player , carlos tabares , 41 , is a star veteran for the havana industriales , the traditionsteeped yankees of cuban baseball the stocky tabares was found one day working out with a group of aspiring young players , his shirt sweatsoaked and grassflecked after a series of sprints he has had many teammates in his 24year career , including two defectors who played in the 2015 world series cespedes , of the mets , and kendrys morales of the kansas city royals tabares said he was happy for both men although sad to see his good friend cespedes leave , he said he rejoiced in hearing of his former teammate s success at the major league level i had many proposals myself when i was in my 20s , tabares said , perspiration beading on his shaved head but i would never do that to my family what i would have lost for the major leagues as for the prospect of minor league baseball one day returning to havana , tabares said he welcomed it , of course it has to be that way , he said one day the american baseball ambassadors were given a tour of estadio latinoamericano , home to the industriales in the bowels of that worn 70yearold stadium were pieces of cuba s baseball past a marble tablet engraved with the names of inmortales del baseball the busts of two legends , mart n dihigo and adolfo luque a wallsize painting of fidel castro , in military fatigues , standing at the plate , bat in hand the cuban baseball officials leading the tour allowed that they would one day like to build a hall of fame well , schwechheimer responded , perhaps the caribbean baseball initiative could help with that another day , the minibus of americans made a pilgrimage to finca vig a , the hilltop house where ernest hemingway lived and wrote and carved a crude baseball field among mango trees , so that his two sons and children from the area could play the game he loved often he would pitch to the boys , who were called the gigi allstars some new allstars , young members of a local little league team , were taking batting practice while waiting for their american visitors schwechheimer bounded out of the bus , grabbed a glove and assumed the role of catcher for a little while , other matters were set aside the logistics for the next trip the plans for more meetings with top officials , including antonio castro the challenge of getting past the diplomatic impediments , the bureaucratic obstacles , the more than halfcentury of mutual suspicion for a little while , before the rains came and the minibus of americans left for the next appointment , the scrawny minnie minosos and tony olivas and yasiel puigs of the future smacked balls into the mango trees , and the former ambassador davidow caught a foul ball in his straw hat , and schwechheimer presented the boys with dozens of muchneeded baseballs they said bueno and gracias , but the shared language was this game
fredrikstad , norway the real trouble started when they stopped causing trouble torleif sanchez hammer and his friends all residents of the same small cluster of clapboard houses in southern had been having runins with the police for years but then suddenly halted their marijuanafueled gatherings in the basement apartment of mr hammer s widowed mother police officers in this placid norwegian town had busted their marijuana parties so regularly that we knew them all on a firstname basis , recalled ragnar foss , head of a local police unit responsible for youth crime but , two years ago , they cleaned up their act we wondered what had happened but were glad when they dropped off our radar , mr foss said one by one over the following months , mr hammer and at least seven other young men who lived on or around just one street , lislebyveien , made their way to to wage jihad alongside the islamic state and other militant groups as europe tries to fathom such journeys by its young muslims , politicians and scholars have variously blamed the influence of the internet and radical mosques , or sources of despair like discrimination and unemployment but the subterranean currents that pushed so many young men to syria from lisleby , a fredrikstad district of just 6 , 000 , stand out as an example of a phenomenon none of those theories can explain why it is that certain towns , and even small areas within them , generate a disproportionate number of jihadists \? it is a big puzzle , said jon fitje hoffman , director of strategic analysis at norway s domestic intelligence agency , the police security service , known as pst it is also one that has flummoxed security services from denmark to germany to france in interviews , the families of those who traveled to syria , other residents and local officials described an unsettling and relatively sudden turn for a clutch of youths , apparently impressed by the example of a popular local soccer player , abdullah chaib beneath an alluring image as a personable and handsome local hero , he harbored a deep commitment to jihad and was among the first to go aside from living just a short walk from one another , all those who followed from fredrikstad had little in common , coming from different ethnic , socioeconomic and even religious backgrounds with its pleasant rows of wooden houses on green lawns behind neat fences and hedges , the town is orderly , clean and safe , fronted by a picturesque harbor while not prosperous by norwegian standards , it is no landscape of urban blight not all of the young men came from troubled families or were disadvantaged perhaps the most determining factor in their decisions to go to syria was their influence on one another the soccer player , mr chaib , was the central figure , recalled yousef bartho assidiq , a native norwegian convert to islam who visited fredrikstad several times along with members of prophet s umma , a radical group from oslo that openly supports the islamic state everybody loved him , he added he was the cool guy everyone wanted to be mr assidiq , who has since broken with prophet s umma and runs a small organization that works to counter radicalization , recalled that he had been really shocked when mr chaib started talking to him in private about jihad in chechnya , afghanistan and syria he was a real fanatic , he added he talked about jihad all the time in november 2012 , mr chaib , who was of algerian descent and then 23 , traveled to syria , ostensibly for humanitarian work , and was killed the following month tributes flooded a memorial page on facebook and youths in the fredrikstad district of lisleby , six of whom went to mr chaib s old high school , began making their way to syria rest in peace our beautiful angel , abdullah chaib , read one facebook tribute mr chaib s death , according to a fellow soccer player who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution from radicals , only enhanced his reputation and set an example of heroic sacrifice that others wanted to follow it was contagious , he said , comparing mr chaib s support for jihad to the skill of a strong soccer player who does something good on the field and makes all the other players want to do even better a spokesman for norway s police security service , trond hugubakken , said investigators were looking into what or who prompted the abrupt embrace of militant islam , focusing on the possibility of recruiters from outside the neighborhood he said it was not yet known exactly who these might have been in fredrikstad but added that the prophet s umma outfit had long been on the security service radar mr foss , the local police officer , said he first noticed prophet s umma when a fredrikstad mother filed a complaint that activists from the group were pestering her mentally disturbed son , trying to persuade him to go to syria he did not go and is now in a mental hospital those who did go , he added , had shown no previous interest in islam none of them ever even mentioned religion when we knew them , said mr foss , sitting in an office piled with confiscated water pipes and other drug paraphernalia the only thing they had in common is that they did not function in society , he added but they wanted to be able to do something , to be good at something radical islam , he said , offers a whole package it is ready and all you have to do is accept it , mr foss said out of place and searching for purpose , mr hammer and his friends did so with gusto he converted to islam after being raised roman catholic and changed his first name from torleif to abdul he was reading , reading , reading all the time , his mother , rebecca , an immigrant from the philippines , said , waving a copy of the quran she found in her son s bedroom , along with his prayer beads , a knitted skull cap and an electronic device that recites islamic prayers he said he wanted to fix himself after too much disco , too many girlfriends and too much smoking , she said mr hammer first popped up in police reports when he started stealing mercedesbenz hood ornaments as a young teenager in his zeal to change course , he suddenly started spending hours each day at lisleby s only mosque , annoying worshipers , mostly immigrants from somalia , with selfrighteous lectures on how to pray properly the mosque leadership finally asked him to leave he has only been a muslim for two years and i have been a muslim my whole life , warsame mohamed saleban , a director of the lisleby mosque , said also attracted by the certainties and a sense of superiority offered by radical islam was samiulla khan , who lived just down the road from mr hammer and often attended his basement parties he also went to the school attended by the soccer star , mr chaib , a mixed vocational and regular high school called greaker the son of immigrants from pakistan , mr khan , according to people who knew the family , felt out of place not only among norwegians but also among fellow pakistanis his father , a convicted murderer , brought further shame on the family after his release from jail by killing a woman while driving drunk the father declined to comment another schoolmate of mr chaib s was abu edelbijev , whose family had emigrated to norway to escape the war in chechnya in 2002 a keen athlete and bodybuilder , mr edelbijev complained a lot about russian brutality in chechnya and israeli treatment of but he liked and felt loyal to norway , whose military he wanted to serve but was unable to join because of a bad eye , according to family members he used to pray regularly at the local mosque but , after mr chaib s death , mostly avoided the mosque and began spending more and more time in oslo , they said where he went in oslo is not known , but the city has a number of mosques and meeting places frequented by activists from prophet s umma and other radical groups after one of his visits there in 2013 , his mother discovered three new iphones stashed in his bedroom she did not make much of this at the time but now thinks the phones were part of preparations for travel by himself and others to syria he also borrowed money to buy a mercedes , the car he would later use to drive across europe into turkey and then to the border with syria in august 2013 , while his parents were on vacation in tunisia , he sent them a text message please do n't try to find me i have made my choice he was on his way to syria before his departure , mr edelbijev hectored mr hammer , who lived a short walk away , and his friends about their marijuana habit and their failure to observe the teachings of islam mr foss , the police officer , said the lectures seemed to have an impact as mr hammer stopped hosting drug parties he said he picked up reports that mr hammer and his dropout friends were suddenly showing a curious enthusiasm for religion and reported this to the pst , the security agency their sudden fervor , he said , struck him as odd but did not stir great concern when they disappeared from our radar we thought oh , that s good' like mr edelbijev , mr hammer also started taking trips to oslo , telling his mother that he was going to learn more about islam she did not understand his sudden zeal but was happy that it seemed to calm his wilder side in december 2013 , mr hammer informed his mother that he was going on vacation in greece i have to take a vacation , mama i have no friends , no job , nothing , his mother recalled him saying he then disappeared

in addition to the inevitable  abortion politicking , the murderous rampage of robert dear at a planned parenthood facility in colorado has inspired a number of writers to contrast the stiff upper lip with which many americans seem to handle the general prevalence of gun violence on our shores with the highlypoliticized anxiety surrounding the acts that we decide to call terrorism this contrast is widely invoked as evidence of american xenophobia we fear attacks from a nebulous or specificallyislamic other more than we fear violence by angry white men , it s alleged , even if the other isn t likely to hurt us nearly as much as a bunch of heavilyarmed heartlanders , because americans still identify with whiteness maleness christianity too closely to fully imagine white christian terrorism as something to be feared this is a mostly leftwing argument but even as evenhanded an observer of our politics as tyler cowen basically comes around to the conclusion that the public s distinctive fear of terrorism as opposed to a fear of violent death in all its varied forms is a mixture of dubious foreign policy reasoning \( in which vulnerability to parisstyle attacks is seen as a proxy for general weakness \) and , well , deeplyrooted xenophobia due to our heritage as african primates , we are programmed to fear violent attacks by outsiders more than we actually need to today now i too think that westerners and americans have a somewhat exaggerated fear of terrorism , and there s no doubt that a certain kind of xenophobia enters into that equation somewhere but there s also something important missing in the comparison between a lot of the highly individual cases \( dear s included , it would seem \) that people want to label rightwing domestic terrorism these days and the kind of cases that involve an organized conspiracy \( whether foreign or domestic \) to commit mass murder for political ends part of that difference rests on the obvious point that a conspiracy can , if allowed to spread and plot unchecked , do far more damage than any individual killer with a rifle , whatever his motivations \( you don t have to go all the way with dick cheney s 1 percent doctrine to see that it would only take one suitcase nuke to overshadow every spree killer that ever lived \) but there s a less obvious explanation as well , having to do with the role and purpose and claims of government , for why terrorist conspiracies might really deserve greater scrutiny , greater anxiety , greater fear namely , whatever the body count involved , by its very nature a terrorist group doesn t only threaten individual lives it also challenges the government s monopoly on organized force , which is the state s most basic \( at least in socialcontract theory \) claim and guarantee which is not to say that the government isn t also responsible for preventing and prosecuting spree killing , or any other form of murder but it isn t unreasonable for people to feel less safe , at some level , in a society in which organized factions and networks seem to be plotting murder with impunity than in a society that just has a variable crime rate yes , high crime rates eventually degrade public authority and public trust as well but everyone understands that the government s monopoly on force doesn t enable it to protect you from every wouldbe killer whereas many people think of organized violence as the first thing that the state is supposed to prevent , preempt , forestall \( and here the oftcited fact that more people are killed in furniture accidents than die at the hands of terrorists is entirely offpoint , since nobody well , almost nobody thinks that government exists primarily to protect people from poorlysecured bookcases \) it s for this reason , this particular fear of conspiracies against the public good , that the mafia in all its varied forms is understandably seen as an important law enforcement target even though a neighborhood managed by mobsters might technically have a lower murder rate than certain innercity districts or appalachian counties it s for this reason that people understandably worry about isisabetted radicalization among recent muslim immigrants even though natives will probably commit murder at higher rates no matter what and it s for this reason \( to pick a case where my fellow conservatives can be inclined to miss the point \) that people in heavilypoliced communities understandably regard lawless violence dealt out by police officers as a distinctive problem even though far more of their neighbors are killed by ordinary criminals because cops are vested with the authority of the state , which makes their corruption and conspiratorial selfprotection far more insidious than everyday street crime even if it leave fewer people dead none of this means , again , that the public s specific anxieties about conspiracies and terrorism are necessarily rational \( they call them conspiracy theories for a reason \) but there is often a certain kind of rationality , at least , behind the various scares that political violence \( or the fear of political violence \) can provoke they tend to peak when there seems to be a clear danger that the violence is actually organized , as opposed to just random people popping off , and then diminish once the conspiracy in question is either broken up or proven to be less terrifying and pervasive than once thought the brown scare over rightwing militias after oklahoma city and waco and ruby ridge , for instance , was premised not just on the feared existence of many more potential timothy mcveighs the great fear was that he was somehow representative of the militia movement as a whole , and that these groups as groups were all homegrown insurrectionists in the making but by the time this anxiety got the hollywood treatment , the militia movement was in steep decline , and as it declined so did the public s anxiety until obama s first term , that is , when a surge of farright organizing led to a miniature brown scare on the centerleft , which petered out in turn once it became clear that cases like a hanged census worker did not , in fact , reflect any kind of organized rightwing plot \( and likewise in political reverse the spasm of rightwing anxiety in 2008 about the new black panthers was basically a brief flashback to a 1970sera past when leftwing violence wasn t just the sporadic work of disturbed loners \) similarly with islamic terrorism public anxiety over islamist terror peaked after 9 11 , declined as al qaeda s capabilities seemed to decline or be degraded , and now has spiked again with the rise of isis and it s hard to miss the crucial role being played by the public s perceptions of jihadist organization the paris massacres have produced a very different reaction than , say , nidal hasan s murderous rampage or even the boston marathon bombing not only because they were largerscale but because they were more directly connected to a group , a network , a largescale conspiracy with resources and reach and whether that reaction leads to sound policy or not , it s not just a generalized fear of the other at work the public clearly regards the threat from islamist individuals like the tsarnaevs very differently than it does the threat from a terrorist conspiracy or network or \( in the case of isis \) quasistate and so , finally , to the colorado clinic attacks and the prolife movement there was a time , in the late 1980s and 1990s the era of aggressive operation rescue tactics , prolife despair over planned parenthood v casey , and the army of god s defensive action statement justifying the murder of abortionists when the antiabortion movement seemed to be acquiring an organized violent fringe \( not coincidentally , this was an era when support for the prolife position hit a post roe low \) but thanks in so small part to the efforts of prolife leaders , this fringe was pushed out of the movement and ceased to be a meaningful or influential force , and after the 1990s organized violence against abortion clinics went into clear decline and unless there s something unexpected to be revealed about robert dear , he looks like proof of this trend , not an exception however much some sort of prolife idea played into his motivations , he seems to have been a classic disturbed killer , representing nothing larger than his own demons , his madnesshaunted self which doesn t mean there won t be political fallout from his wickedness , or that it won t redound in some sense to planned parenthood s benefit but i m skeptical that it will change the politics of abortion very much , or that a leftwing push to make prolife terrorism an issue will get all that far , as long as it remains clear that no prolife organization is actually connected to his actions and that will be reasonable on the terms that most people understand , because when americans say they re worried about terrorism they don t have in mind either disturbed gunmen with idiosyncratic grievances or the frightening foreigner in some very generalized xenophobic sense they re worried very specifically about terrorist conspiracies , foreign and domestic about a wellorganized and agendadriven violence that the government seems powerless against how much weight this fear deserves relative to others is a matter for debate but the fact that it s not likely to fasten permanently on today s prolife movement is an entirely reasonable thing
in \( sunday review , feb 22 \) , david cole shows that the report on cia interrogations released by senate democrats in december contained serious flaws , such as overstating the case that torture does not work , and that the cia systemically lied about the program s efficacy but mr cole s bigger point that by blaming the cia for all misdeeds relating to america s interrogation policies after 9 11 , the report lets former bush administration officials off the hook falls into the same trap of oversimplifying culpability while it is true that president bush and his national security team developed the interrogation programs \( among other aggressive post9 11 initiatives \) , none could have existed without buyin \( and funding \) from congress , whose bipartisan leadership was briefed on these programs dozens of times in the months and years after 9 11 mr cole says the senate report s unwillingness to hold the entire leadership of the bush administration accountable for illegality was a mistake as a matter of historical accuracy and of moral principle however , america s response to the 9 11 attacks was not just about one agency , administration or party if this country is to have an honest debate about the merits of its post9 11 counterterrorism policies , it needs to begin with that in mind stuart gottlieb new york the headline of david cole s essay asks , did the torture report give the cia a bum rap \? we should recall that the senate intelligence committee s torture report , which rebutted cia claims that torture worked , was based on original cia documents mirabile dictu , mr cole gives the cia s rebuttal equal weight when one places the cia s accounts of the 20 cases side by side with the committee s accounts , however , the truth is far from clear as a former army intelligence officer , i was proud when the army s deputy chief of intelligence , lt gen john kimmons , said at a 2006 pentagon news conference no good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices i think history tells us that i think the empirical evidence of the last five years , hard years , tells us that general kimmons s gutsy words were meant as a preemptive rebuttal of claims by president bush just hours later that his alternative set of procedures yielded good intelligence ray mcgovern arlington , va in a laudable attempt to steer the focus on the cia s torture of detainees away from the question of its efficaciousness and back to its illegality , david cole unfairly criticizes the senate s torture report attacking the report s finding that the cia s use of torture was not an effective means of acquiring evidence , he ultimately admits that it is impossible to confirm or refute cia claims of effectiveness without looking at the full unreleased report and underlying documents this is hardly an exoneration of the cia but rather an argument for release of the full report and related documents whether torture ever elicits useful information is irrelevant to its immorality and illegality the cia tortured detainees \( including detainees erroneously detained \) , lied about it , hid the extent of its brutality and destroyed evidence of the interrogations so , no , the agency did not get a bum rap michael curry austin , tex
re \( front page , oct 4 \) james alan fox , a criminologist , is correct in saying , we ca n't round up all the people who scare us but we can do a lot more to sever the link between them and easy access to guns most mass killers obtained guns legally , because of the sievelike national background check system unlike the system in new york to receive my pistol permit , i was asked about my employment and other history , and i submitted the names of four character references who completed multipage questionnaires probing the kind of person i was , including my demeanor or behavior all this information and more was submitted to law enforcement and a county judge \( i was also interviewed \) they could decline my application if the information suggested that i was troubled too bad most states do n't conduct real background checks robert j spitzer cortland , ny i congratulate and thank the times for the courage to expose the wellcrafted scapegoat that people with mental illness are responsible for the american epidemic of largescale gun carnage it is a myth perpetuated by the national rifle association with the oftparroted phrase , it s people , not guns the prevalence of mental illness is essentially the same worldwide the obscene scale of gun ownership is unique to the united states , including personal stockpiles of militarystyle weapons during a 50year career as a psychiatrist practicing in the inner city , i treated dozens of psychotic individuals with delusions that included plans to harm themselves or people known to them , but none fit the profile of the indiscriminate killers you describe the only sane cure for our nation s malaise will be to rescind the second amendment and ban the personal possession of all guns not designed exclusively for the hunting of animals , not humans barry blackwell milwaukee re , by frank bruni \( column , oct 4 \) by now we should have learned that trying to take guns away from lawful gun owners is madness the more crazed the calls to take away their guns , the more they dig in we are at an impasse and must try a different approach we should , instead , appeal to gun owners most are experts in the gun licensing process , which can be quite laborious , and about the safeguards required to make sure that guns are not used illegally and or dangerously they have a vested interest in reducing not only gun crimes but also unintended deaths from gun accidents a campaign for public gun safety is much more likely to win supporters if responsible gun owners could make everyone as safe as they are around guns , we 'd all benefit andrea economos scarsdale , ny re , by nicholas kristof \( column , oct 4 \) a public health approach to curb gun deaths is critical while work is done to vastly reduce the number of guns in the country to coexist with guns we should provide a homicide prevention hotline an anonymous outlet for potential killers would encourage reflection of the consequences \( moral and legal \) for those planning murders , offer a crucial delay for those turning to guns in crimes of passion , and provide advance warning for victims when callers include details about the crimes they intend to commit trained specialists could try to persuade prospective murderers to seek help and to refrain from taking lives making guns safer is important so is providing resources to prevent deaths while unsafe guns are abundant and easily accessible jacob ginsberg providence , ri
ponte vedra beach , fla the cheese on the burgers served in the clubhouse was sharper than s game tuesday playing tpc sawgrass for the first time since winning the players championship , woods found two fairways and three water hazards in nine practice holes he acknowledged afterward that he was tired woods does not sleep well in the best of circumstances , and this week has been , in some respects , the worst of occasions sunday marked the ninth anniversary of the death of his father and lodestar , earl , who introduced him to golf and was his primary adviser to the end anyone who has buried a parent knows well the tidal currents of grief , and how the sadness crests every year on the anniversary of the death this time of year is really , really hard on me , woods said it was extra hard this year because sunday spelled the end of another cherished relationship woods and the champion skier lindsey vonn announced they had dissolved their romantic relationship , which they took public in march 2013 that they described the breakup as amicable does not mean it was painless obviously it does affect me , woods said it is tough there s no doubt i'm not going to lie about that since earning the fourth of his five pga tour victories of the 2013 season here , woods has armwrestled adversity and lost in 2014 , he twice was sidelined by back surgery , for a total of seven months this season , he tied for last , the hero world challenge , shot to miss the cut at the phoenix open and of the farmers insurance open at torrey pines he then took two months off to shore up his short game , once his strength that is a lot of misery for someone who once went a record 142 starts without missing a cut , and who averaged five tour victories a season from 1997 through 2009 until recently , woods has always been able to find solace in golf , his safe place you go out there , and for me , i focus , i get into my little world , my little zone , and do the best i possibly can , woods said so imagine how disconcerting this year has been for woods , seeing his game , his refuge , become his main source of distraction i 've made some huge , huge strides since what i was at torrey and what i was at phoenix , woods said huge in the weeks since woods extended to 10 years , the major most people once expected him to dominate like none other , the news has served up reminders that adversity is all relative two players who blazed the path for woods , 39 , recently died , the first africanamerican to win a pga tour event , and , the first africanamerican to win this tournament they are gone , but their stories should not be forgotten to watch woods dominate amateur golf and star in college before turning pro is to perhaps overlook that before woods was born the main avenue into the game for members of minorities was caddying to see woods open golf courses like the one he designed in cabo san lucas , mexico , is to perhaps overlook that there were courses and tournaments , including the masters , once closed to minority players i did n't have those struggles when i was trying to get out on tour , woods said , but i certainly can relate to when i was a kid and the things that i had to endure just to try and play golf , and i was n't allowed to play at certain places that part i can understand i can relate to peete was 23 when he took up the game by the time woods turned 23 , he had seven tour victories , including the 1997 masters peete did not earn his pga tour card until he was 32 but won 12 times before retiring from competition in 1993 , three years before woods turned pro their paths never crossed even though peete was a regular presence at this event i never really got a chance to spend any time with him , woods said it s unfortunate woods described peete as one of the guys i looked up to , certainly , a person of color , being able to do it , especially at the time when there were n't that many out here he marveled at peete s accuracy off the tee there is a stat not too many people know about and that is at muirfield village he did n't miss a fairway for two years , woods said , referring to the memorial tournament site i mean , over 10 rounds without missing a fairway ok , you 're going to hit one bad shot somewhere in two and a half years that would be pretty good with a 7iron off the tee woods may not have taken peete s circuitous path to the pga tour , but peete did not envy woods s fishbowl life in a 2012 interview with the newspress in fort myers , fla , peete said i did not want to be tiger woods i wanted to take care of my kids and make a living in 1976 , when woods began mimicking his father s swing from his crib , there were a handful of africanamerican golfers playing on the tour in 2015 , woods is the only one with full tour playing privileges , but that does not mean he has not inspired a minority group to take up golf last month woods traveled to china and japan to spread the gospel of golf according to nike , his main sponsor like brown and peete , woods is growing the game , sometimes at a high personal cost in separate statements issued sunday , woods and vonn mentioned hectic schedules that made it difficult to spend time together as the main factor in their breakup may 3rd through the 5th is just brutal on me , woods said , referring to the anniversary of his father s death , and then with obviously what happened on sunday , it just adds to it

finally , up at the wall two spokes of said wheel , jon snow and stannis baratheon , are subtly entering into a faceoff that figures to intensify this season jon , torn , as ever , between worlds and allegiances , is called upon to broker a kneebending from mance rayder that everyone involved knows is not going to happen the penalty for refusing being burned alive , which , for an icenative wildling like mance , has to be especially galling i don t want people to remember me like that , scorched and screaming , he tells jon , but it s better than betraying everything i believe jon ultimately brings a speedy end to mance s execution with an arrow to the heart , an undermining act that foreshadows a rift between snow and stannis one possible flash point melisandre the red priestess has taken an uncommon interest in jon since she arrived at the wall , perhaps for weird redmagical carnal reasons and perhaps for others that might dovetail with certain popular theories about him \( i m reluctant to get into too much of that here , but this potentially spoilery video is a good primer , if you re interested \) at any rate , stannis seems likely to frown upon any sort of perceived competition or threat of course , he ll have plenty on his plate even without jon mance promised as much in his last words to stannis , which echoed varys s earlier comment , but with a crucial tweak because mance night s watch veteran , kingbeyondthewall , uniter of hornfoots and thenns has seen enough to know that stannis s plans for a speedy campaign through the north and ultimately to the iron throne and lasting power will hardly be the quick trip he seems to expect i wish you good fortune in the wars to come , mance tells him as in wars , plural as in check the episode title as in there may be a power vacuum drawing everyone inexorably toward king s landing , but the road ahead is longer than anyone thinks a few thoughts while we peer into the fan theory abyss about that cersei prophecy some cursory research suggests that the witch was a woman named maggy the frog and that the prince young cersei was promised to was rhaegar targaryen , dany s brother and a figure who casts an enormous shadow over this entire story if you re tempted to go down that particular online rabbit hole , i advise you to set aside a few weeks and some nonperishable foodstuffs , and tell your family you love them \( and as always , there s no guarantee the series will line up exactly with the books \) i laughed at the former suckling robin s flailing attempts at swordfighting \( shields up , people why is that so difficult \? \) but frankly i enjoy him more as a disturbing little lord \( i want to see the bad man fly !

season 4 , episode 10 election night recently , as a washington political reporter , i began fielding a certain type of pop culture question which of the new spate of political shows netflix s house of cards , abc s scandal or hbo s veep best captures life inside the the nation s capital \? and from the earliest episodes of the first season , i have always answered veep aides and operatives may flock to washington for lofty ideals , but their days quickly begin to resemble an episode of the show largely powerless people basking in the shadow of power , scrambling and bumbling about , trying to stave off crises and grow their personal brand , while , yes , occasionally , accomplishing what they came here to do but this season , veep has really hit its stride perhaps because president selina meyer found herself elevated to the oval office , the show has found itself elevated as well we ve watched as the president s families first bill has moved through the various stages of how a bill \( almost \) becomes a law , from conception to public relations pitch to capitol hill lobbying effort we ve seen the fallout from a data breach unfold , from the washington phenomenon of settling on a suitable scapegoat to a hearing before a house committee and against the reallife backdrop of hillary clinton s ramping up her own campaign to become the first female president , we ve watched selina and her team struggle with what it means to be a trailblazer amy and selina s relationship has grown especially close and fraught as amy has intuited , as her male colleagues have not , that , fairly or unfairly , every misstep by selina represents a potential setback for women this past weekend , i found myself in park city , utah , where mitt romney had convened a gathering of republican 2016 hopefuls and wealthy donors there , over a highaltitude lunch one day , the conversation naturally turned to everyone s favorite veep characters in a testament to the show s rich ensemble cast , everyone had a different favorite , including many of the usual suspects dan , amy , jonah but some new antiheroes emerged , as well tom james , of course , who , as selina s running mate , outshines her at every turn and richard , jonah s sidekick , whose wideeyed earnestness makes him the perfect comedic foil in a white house full of cynics then there is worldweary ben , exhausted and ambienaddled \( in one episode , at least \) , trudging along in an unfair city , just trying to save himself and his boss and my personal favorite , catherine , the first daughter , who has come into her own this season , forced by her mother to take on a bigger role and displaying all of selina s awkwardness with none of the buoying charisma last season s veep ended with a surprise promotion vice president meyer rising , finally and unexpectedly , to president sunday s season finale ends on election night with a potential demotion , but with an equally surprising twist president meyer and her rival , o brien , finish the night in a dead electoral tie which means , through a quirk of election law , that congress helps select the next president and could choose senator tom james , selina s running mate , who could leapfrog over her right into the oval office the episode opens with selina , sitting ramrod straight on a hotel bed , her election night dress and deep \( almost yogic \) breathing offering a tense calm betrayed by her face , which is contorted into a grimace so begins selina s long night the polls close , the results trickle in as things briefly begin to look up , tom james pulls selina aside to say he doesn t want to be relegated , as so many vice presidents are , to token status in her administration selina says she understands , and begins to promise him the concessions many reallife presidents promise , when he cuts her off with a much bigger \( and unexpected \) request no , i want to be treasury secretary , he says , before pausing as well as veep you want to run my economy \? bank of tom james , says selina , as soon as she s able to process the audacity of his wish tom points out that during the congressional hearings , her administration was coming apart at the seams and it was he charismatic , charming , adult tom james who stuck it back together with six rolls of magic tape but the damage is already done meanwhile , dan and amy have been spending their election night on cnn with a smug data guru but when the data whiz kid s picks begin unraveling , dan finds himself in a position to help selina more than he ever could have while still in her employ with the returns looking increasingly grim , selina calls o brien , ready to concede mike has just stepped out to buy a few cokes from the vending machine when dan calls him to whisper that they made the wrong call on pennsylvania , and the state is going to go to selina after all mike drops the sodas and races back to the hotel suite , just in time to intercept selina , who is a breath away from officially conceding the scene feels ripped from the 2000 bushversusgore election , in which the vote was so close that al gore famously called george w bush shortly after 2 am to concede , only to call him back 45 minutes later to rescind his concession selina s night is not yet over suddenly the polls start rushing in washington for selina , ohio for o brien florida for selina still outstanding \? virginia amid a roomful of pollsters and operatives and politicians , it is sue , the president s unflappable executive assistant , who quickly and calmly calculates that if virginia goes to o brien , then he wins but if virginia falls selina s way , the nation has a tie a quick round of googling ensues , as team selina discovers just how zany a tie would be in the case of an electoral college tie , the house of representatives chooses the president , and the senate chooses the vice president which means not only could there be a president from one party and a vice president from the other , but , more immediately troubling to selina , tom james could end up as president back on the cnn set , amy has been looking increasingly uncomfortable \( watching her , sue observed that she seemed off her game , before a friend of sue s noted in perhaps the best line of the episode i only really know amy as the woman who rushed everywhere clutching her phone , like it contained her frozen embryos \) and it soon becomes clear that amy , humming with nervous energy , feels adrift on the glossy set she should be with selina , she says , finishing what she started , and she finally flees the tv studio to spend the night at her former boss s side here we see yet again the depth of selina and amy s relationship when selina learns that tom james could replace her as president , gary stands to offer a hug but selina , in tears , turns past him and his outstretched arms , past her daughter , catherine and collapses into amy amy looks utterly uncomfortable with the sudden display of emotion but , in her own way , offers the encouragement that selina needs , telling her that with all due respect , she needs to get her act together ma am up , says amy you re still the leader of the free world , hmmm \? and these are the words that transform selina back into the striving , climbing , ambitious , spotlighthungry politician we recognize realizing that during her minimeltdown , tom james has taken the stage in an effort to provide the increasingly restless crowd a hit of political meth , selina springs to action onstage she physically places her body between tom james and the crowd , introducing her daughter and some of the people who lift me up in an attempt to keep the limelight off of him it is while she is standing onstage , struggling for attention , that selina along with the rest of the nation learns her fate this election is a tie ! booms dan , coming in on an oversize projection screen to announce the news that will rock the political world we did it , says selina , lifting one finger of one hand , in a meek display of victory , before pressing ahead and offering a mashup of famous speeches we have one more hurdle to overcome , and we shall overcome ! one more river to cross one more mountain to climb , but i have been the mountaintop thank you !
philadelphia hugh scott , the pennsylvania republican who served as senate minority leader during the watergate era , was known for his everpresent pipe and his determination to evade taking a position until he was good and ready the story goes that once , when asked what his favorite color was , mr scott replied , plaid it s a joke , but there is truth to it because mr scott represented a plaid state , not as liberal as massachusetts , not as conservative as indiana in mr scott s day , pennsylvania trended republican today , pennsylvania trends democratic seen from 30 , 000 feet , it looks blue the last republican presidential candidate to win here was george h w bush in 1988 this is mostly because of the populous southeastern part of the state , where 42 percent of all pennsylvania voters live , which has become increasingly democratic , especially in the philadelphia suburbs closer to the ground , though , the plaid is plain to see where the urban and suburban blue is mixed with a vivid red in the counties outside the big cities voters in these more rural areas have been sending increasingly conservative republicans to the legislature the state s centrist political culture is no more the sharp partisan divisions so evident in congress have trickled down to pennsylvania the new democratic governor , tom wolf , learned that recently when he arrived in harrisburg with an ambitious plan to fund education by raising some taxes \( the personal and sales tax \) and lowering others \( the corporate net income tax and local property taxes \) mr wolf , a millionaire businessman from york county , could be forgiven if he believed he had a mandate for change in november 2014 , he defeated the unpopular incumbent , tom corbett , by a 10point margin mr corbett was a resolute antitaxer who took the knife to state funding for education and social welfare programs he discovered an interesting political fact people tend not to list education as one of their top items of concern unless they feel it is imperiled it was the no 1 issue in the campaign mr corbett became a oneterm governor mr wolf is an expert on political theory he has a phd from mit in political science after recent experience , he may be eligible for an equivalency degree in practical politics this is not about politics or ideology , mr wolf said in his budget address in early march , when he proposed his roughly 30 billion state budget boy , was he wrong halloween has passed thanksgiving has come and gone , christmas is on its way and pennsylvania still does not have a state budget , one of two states in the nation in this predicament \( illinois is the other \) the new fiscal year began way back on july 1 school districts that rely heavily on state aid have taken to borrowing money to keep operating some social welfare agencies that are state contractors have furloughed employees counties have had to pick up the cost of what are usually statesubsidized social welfare and health services the situation gets more dire every month while pennsylvania trends democratic in national elections , sorry , reapportionment has secured many districts as either exclusively r or exclusively d the republicans , who control the state s house and senate today , are a far cry from the moderate republican tradition embodied by mr scott , the former senators john heinz and richard s schweiker , or the former governor dick thornburgh the current republicans are , as a group , a rabid , or dedicated , group of antitaxers who would bring tears of joy to the eyes of grover norquist and his club for growth this tilt to the right has been in the works for years it culminated this year when republicans in the state senate ousted dominic pileggi , a suburban philadelphia moderate , from his leadership position for being an accommodationist \( read mr pileggi would sometimes forge compromises to keep government functioning \) that was a bad omen mr pileggi was replaced by senator jake corman , whose district includes penn state mr corman is not known as a hardliner , but other members of his caucus are , and he keeps having to look over his shoulder lest he anger them and they stage another putsch in the house , the conservative but mildmannered house speaker sam smith retired and was replaced this year by mike turzai , an ultraconservative who favors a takenoprisoners approach ted cruz without the charm until recent weeks , the republicans had dug in and vowed not to pass a budget with any tax increases but 72 cents of every state tax dollar is returned to local governments and school districts , so the pressure is building from the folks at home for someone in harrisburg to do something the day is coming when schools and agencies will have to close down mr wolf and republican leaders had a deal at one point that did involve smaller tax increases then none another deal then none a third deal and then none the most recent deal collapsed last week after the house republicans scotched it and proceeded to pass their own version of the budget , which neither the senate nor mr wolf support there are some house and senate republicans ready to supply votes for some tax increases as part of a budget settlement , but there is no organizing force at the top to move things along settling for half a loaf , once a necessary condition of governance in this state , has become anathema in those caucuses these republicans would rather see government blow up than compromise they may get their wish plaid is so yesterday
kabul , afghanistan when a suicide bomber infiltrated a play being staged in a high school attached to the french cultural institute here , it was not clear at first who the target was the audience was packed with diplomats and prominent afghans , and the bomber made his way to the front row , where he next to a german spectator , killing him a few seats away was ahmad naser sarmast , the head of the school , the mr sarmast was badly injured in the blast , and statements soon made it clear that he had been the target the taliban were also angry about a student play performed as part of the concert that denounced suicide bombings , and sent a child as their bomber a year later , mr sarmast has still not fully recovered when a bomb goes off nearby , survivors' hearing is often destroyed mr sarmast was rendered nearly deaf , a potentially careerending injury for a musician he plays and teaches the trumpet and piano , in addition to running the school shrapnel lodged in his brain an operation restored the hearing in his right ear , but he has only 20 to 30 percent hearing in the left doctors are waiting for that ear to heal naturally if it does not , mr sarmast expects to have another operation in the spring in australia , where he has residency privileges none of this affected the school s busy schedule of performances in 2015 , and mr sarmast was back at work within weeks of the attack he had already built the music institute into a renowned organization with appearances by its student ensembles all over the world , from in new york to the sydney film festival this year , despite the bombing , the school won a unesco award for innovation in education on a recent sunday during term break , mr sarmast was in his office after most of his staff had left , the time when i really get to work , as he put it he gestured at piles of paperwork on his desk fundraising , planning , thinking endofterm exams had just finished , so there were no students around , and an empty campus can be a melancholy place the playground is normally full , since classes and sessions are staggered head scarves on girls are optional at the institute some wear them , some do not the school is thoroughly coeducational it may be the only one in with entirely mixed classrooms and musical ensembles it is also not an expensive private school it is a ministry of education institution , and most of the students are on scholarships in fact , the poorest are paid by the school to attend one of mr sarmast s innovations he hands out weekly stipends that are just high enough to make it uneconomical for the children s families to put them to work in the fields or begging in the streets mr sarmast conceded , it s been a pretty rough year after the suicide bombing , the taliban said they had intended to assassinate mr sarmast and would try again then information came from the national directorate of security , s intelligence agency , that a squad of four taliban attackers was getting ready to storm the school later , the australian embassy warned mr sarmast of credible threats to either the school or himself , and urged him to leave afghanistan as soon as possible he declined they did n't know if the threat was against me or against the school , he said how could i leave and let the school take all the risk , all my students and staff \? instead , he stayed and threw his energies into making the school safe , an effort he described with as much brio as if talking about his next concert he rattled off improvements there are watchtowers now , as well as other security measures that he asked not be detailed what was most important to him , though , was making these changes in a way that did not arouse anxieties among students or their families , but made them feel safer in a society where bomb blasts are a regular feature of life the taliban attack , though it killed one person and wounded more than a dozen others , also had a tremendously uplifting effect , as mr sarmast described it when he regained consciousness the day after the bombing , he was lying in a bed at emergency , an italianrun trauma hospital here , and the staff told him that 200 or 300 people were waiting outside to see him they all came wanting to know if they could give blood or something , anything , he said it was very amazing , very moving and touching that inspired him , he said the school s winter music academy had just begun , and the evening concert that was bombed had been a key part of it the concerts were held once a week for eight weeks , with everyone in town invited those widely distributed invitations had apparently leaked out and reached the taliban , so such events would no longer be wise mr sarmast had an idea he would make the evening concerts lunchtime affairs instead , and rather than inviting diplomats and socialites , the school would invite orphans and children from refugee camps to come to campus for concerts tailored to them what could be better \? he said these are the most musicdeprived people in our society and they loved it he figures the taliban did him and the students a favor back when the insurgents were in power , they completely banned all but religious music it is why they were determined to kill mr sarmast instead , the school prospered after the attack not only did he lose none of his expatriate music teachers , but he gained even more for eight positions he had been unable to fill , he was suddenly deluged with applications from all over the world for two years , our cello position had been vacant , he said overnight , i had 10 applications another winter music academy , sponsored by the american embassy and the ministry of education , will begin jan 9 and run through the end of february again , mr sarmast said , the institute will hold its concerts for the poor , the orphaned , the deprived and the musicless
if s new apology for her private email server fails to reassure jittery supporters , it could amplify the chatter among some democrats who have been casting about for a potential white knight to rescue the party from a beleaguered clinton candidacy vice president , secretary of state , senator , former vice president each has been discussed among party officials in recent weeks as an alternative to mrs clinton if she does not regain her oncedominant standing in the 2016 presidential field and instead remains mired in the longrunning email controversy , with its attendant investigations on monday , mr biden , who has spoken publicly of pondering a run , looked very much like a candidate at a pittsburgh union gathering and labor day parade and some democrats were intrigued by word that mr kerry , the 2004 democratic nominee , had met recently in nantucket , mass , with david m rubenstein , a billionaire cofounder of the carlyle group and the sort of washington wise man mr kerry might consult if he were mulling another run \( friends say he is n't \) it is not just mrs clinton s weakness in the polls that has generated talk of other alternatives , but also the strength of senator bernie sanders of vermont , who is routinely drawing huge crowds at campaign events that has been disconcerting to democratic officials who believe that mr sanders , a socialist , is so liberal that his presence at the top of the party s ticket in 2016 would be disastrous if party leaders see a scenario next winter where bernie sanders has a real chance at the democratic nomination , i think there s no question that leaders will reach out to vice president biden or secretary of state kerry or even gore about entering the primaries , said garnet f coleman , a texas state lawmaker and democratic national committeeman even if none of those democrats were to announce candidacies this fall , some party officials and strategists suggested that mr biden could be laying the groundwork for an 11thhour rescue mission during the winter primaries if mrs clinton s campaign began to implode similarly , mr kerry s friends say they believe he would hear out party leaders if mr sanders appeared likely to capture the nomination and they implored mr kerry , who would have to resign as secretary of state , to try to block him the interest in senior statesmen and stateswomen is partly a reflection of the thin democratic bench after widespread losses in races for governor , senate and other offices in 2010 and 2014 , which has left the party with relatively few experienced , credible presidential contenders , let alone ones willing to take on mrs clinton \( the paucity of fresh faces even gave rise to a joking twitter hashtag dukakis2016 , offering up the party s 1988 nominee , former massachusetts gov michael s dukakis \) still , mr biden , mr kerry and mr gore have lost presidential bids before and are hardly guaranteed party saviors or more popular than mrs clinton among important demographic groups like women , africanamericans and hispanics indeed , for all of the talk about 2016 fallback plans , mrs clinton remains the frontrunner for the nomination , and her comments on tuesday in an interview with abc news and in a followup message to supporters saying i'm sorry for relying on private email for government business as secretary of state and calling that practice a mistake may help assuage concerns among some democrats about her candidacy but the chatter could continue if mrs clinton does not quickly regain her footing you have democrats beginning to panic about the one thing that a lot of them never worried about , which was clinton s electability in the general election , said robert shrum , a veteran strategist who was a senior adviser to mr gore and mr kerry during their presidential runs you still have to think of her as the oddson favorite for the democratic nomination but the challenge she faces in the general election is both the trust problem and the likability problem mr shrum recalled how mr gore s likability suffered in the 2000 campaign , most memorably when he was ridiculed for supposedly having claimed he invented the internet but not his fundamental trustworthiness , because there s an assumption that all politicians exaggerate several democrats said that mr biden and mr kerry were especially well positioned to enter the race late , given their experience , party support , fundraising networks and name recognition biden is the kind of highly respected , wellknown figure that , if he were to jump in the race during the primaries in an emergency kind of way , he could attract a lot of voters very quickly , said jaime harrison , the chairman of the south carolina  democrats close to mr kerry said he would not consider the whiteknight scenario unless drafted and , indeed , add that he would probably laugh at it in 2003 , they recalled , when mr kerry was struggling in the polls , there was chatter that gen wesley clark would ride to the rescue so former vermont gov howard dean would not capture the nomination \( general clark never became a strong contender \) by all accounts , mr kerry loves his current job and is focused on the iran nuclear agreement now before congress , which his admirers suggest could make him a candidate for the nobel peace prize next month but his state department tenure could also make him a strong presidential candidate , if it came to that , they say he has strengths he knows the country he has world stature he has handled the job of secretary of state extremely well he beat george bush in three debates he prepared obama for three debates , said john sasso , a longtime democratic operative and friend of mr kerry s who was a senior adviser to his 2004 campaign i have no indication secretary kerry would ever run again , but i do n't think anyone else has more experience in preparing and running for the presidency than kerry \( mr kerry has said recently that he has no plans to run for president , but he also said in february that nobody ever says never \) tad devine , a senior adviser to mr sanders , said he believed democratic restiveness would subside as people learned more about mr sanders through campaign events and the televised democratic debates this fall and winter as officials see bernie sanders s mounting strength with voters , i think they will begin to better understand that he will not only be a strong nominee who can help democrats all across the country win elections , but he actually will be the white knight if they need one , said mr devine , who was a past adviser to mr kerry and mr gore \( a spokeswoman for mr gore declined to comment , but democrats close to him said he was devoted to fighting climate change mrs warren , of massachusetts , has said repeatedly that she is not running \) several supporters of mrs clinton said they were confident that her hard work on the campaign trail would ultimately unite the party behind her the media notwithstanding , i think hillary is in very strong shape she s going to win iowa and then the nomination and the presidency , said jerry crawford , an influential iowa democrat who worked on behalf of mr kerry in 2004 and is now backing mrs clinton democrats who are ornery and cantankerous as a rule are inclined to say they are

london despite 10 complaints against him , and a reputation as a sex pest , , the british television personality , had freewheeling access in a hospital where he sexually abused 60 people over more than two decades , according to a report released thursday the document adds shocking detail to the , who used his celebrity status and charity work to gain access to potential victims in more than a dozen hospitals and on the premises of the british broadcasting corporation , where he worked for 30 years his after he died in 2011 , at the age of 84 , prompting deep soulsearching and setting off a number of criminal investigations into other cases of sexual abuse from decades ago mr savile is now thought to have had more than 500 victims , the majority of whom were girls under 18 the report , which focused on mr savile s relationship with the stoke mandeville hospital in buckinghamshire , was one of several released thursday a celebrity fundraiser , and one of the country s bestknown and most popular television presenters , the cigarchomping mr savile was granted almost unfettered access to the hospital suspicions were not acted on and patients and staff were ignored , the health secretary , jeremy hunt , told parliament people were either too dazzled or too intimidated by the nation s favorite celebrity to confront the evil predator we now know he was the report is from an independent inquiry into mr saville s behavior conducted at the behest of buckinghamshire healthcare nhs trust , which oversees stoke mandeville hospital the report said mr savile abused 60 people at stoke mandeville from around 1968 to 1992 , ranging in age from 8 to 40 ten were younger than 12 the victims were patients , staff , visitors , volunteers and charity fundraisers , the report said the sexual abuse ranged from inappropriate touching to rape this systematic abuse continued , the report noted , even though it appeared to be an open secret that mr savile was a sex pest , and despite one formal and nine informal complaints about him from 1972 to 1985 the investigation found that none of the informal complaints were either taken seriously or escalated to senior management , the document said the one formal complaint was dropped by the complainant s father due to her serious ill health that formal protest , made in 1977 , should have led to savile s suspension from the hospital and a formal police report being made , the report concluded the document described how , first as a volunteer porter , then as fundraiser , mr savile , who was once invited to lunch with prime minister margaret thatcher , built up his status at stoke mandeville savile s access as a voluntary porter in the 1970s and his position of authority in the 1980s established him as a powerful and influential figure at stoke mandeville hospital , the inquiry s lead investigator , androulla johnstone , said in a statement , one who could abuse and one whose victims felt powerless to challenge or report one harrowing account was from a woman who said she was raped at the age of 12 by a man she later identified as mr savile when she complained to a nurse , she was told not to say anything , otherwise the nurse would get into trouble , the report said another victim , then 11 , from a family of practicing roman catholics was systematically abused by savile in the hospital chapel presbytery during services , the report said and the report quoted the comments of another of mr savile s victims , also 11 i did not understand what had happened , she said i knew it felt wrong and i felt dirty and i went to clean myself and , i just wanted to wash myself again and again mr savile had access to the hospital s mortuary , and two people told investigators that they had heard that he had inappropriate contact with corpses there though that allegation was not proved no witness when interviewed by the investigation could recount any direct experience of savile acting inappropriately with dead bodies in a sexual manner , the report said however , there was significant evidence to suggest that savile probably could , and did , access the mortuary on his own after hours though it acknowledged many failings by the british health department and the hospital , the document also suggested that mr savile s offenses were , to some extent , made possible by the social mores of the time it is evident from what many witnesses told us that staff accepted higher levels of sexual harassment in the workplace during the 1970s than would be accepted today , the report said

like many people taking part in the on sunday , susanna phillips huntington has never run an entire marathon before as a competitive runner , she makes an excellent soprano , which happens to be her day job i think they help each other , she said recently of running and opera singing , both of which involve long hours of intense exertion in taxing conditions and an intimate awareness of the body s many fluctuations you always have to be doing a fullbody scan you think how does this feel \? are your shoulders relaxed \? are you going too fast , are you going too slow , are you breathing \? are you going to have a heart attack \? runners enter the for many reasons , mental , physical and fanciful to try to win , to try to finish , to try to raise money for charity , to try to raise their own flagging spirits , to support their friends , to impress their spouses , to revel in the singular charms of the city s five boroughs , to see if they can , to say they did phillips huntington , 34 , is doing it for the challenge , but also , as a useful ancillary goal , to improve her physical conditioning and build on the stamina and breath control that are so crucial to her singing it s not just your voice it s your body , she said you 're physically and mentally on for four and a half hours and so , as she trains for the marathon , she s also training , in a way , for , this winter at the metropolitan opera musetta in la boh me and rosalinde in die fledermaus \( more urgently , she will also be singing the national anthem before the race starts on sunday \) like baseball starting pitchers , opera stars have to rest for several days between performances like runners , they have to know how to breathe properly the goal in both pursuits , phillips huntington said , is to breathe in an energetic , controlled , clean way it s like a good barbecue , low and slow , she said you know when you 're stacking your breath \? she went on , describing something akin to hyperventilation , but without the panic you breathe in too quickly , before you 've finished breathing out it s very bad and you ca n't perform properly if you do that while some runners prefer a rhythm of breathing in for two counts and out for three , i pretty much stick to an even intake and exhalation of air , she continued two counts in , two counts out , or three in , three out , varying it every few minutes so as not to favor one foot over the other phillips huntington has always been athletic growing up in huntsville , ala , she played the usual sports basketball , softball , soccer , tennis she did not know that she wanted to be a singer opera star is not a common career choice among the population of huntsville but applied to music programs at the suggestion of her high school guidance counselor , who knew she enjoyed performing in the choir \( the choir had seven people in it it was a small school \) she enrolled in the juilliard school and moved to new york she took up running as a pursuit in itself when she discovered that the available schoolsponsored athletic opportunities had dwindled to , basically , none as great as their orchestra is , they do n't have any sports teams , she said of juilliard because singers have to stay healthy and avoid respiratory infections , and because she feels that it s weird to breathe in cold air , she keeps indoors during the winter i make friends with the treadmill , she said she is an independent singer , meaning she is not employed by any one opera company , and spends about six months of the year on the road , for jobs that can last a few days or a few months this year , for instance , phillips huntington sang in boston , frankfurt , santa fe and san francisco most recently she performed in beethoven s missa solemnis with the at the sydney opera house in australia all that traveling makes for an erratic and sometimes lonely training schedule , requiring a lot of selfmotivation luckily , there is the internet phillips huntington , who in the last few years has been running about 15 to 20 miles a week on her own , is following the new york road runners each week , she gets an email with daybyday instructions generally shorter , faster runs on weekdays longer runs on weekends hills , intervals i 've done about 85 percent of it , she said , running 18 miles at her longest , as per the online recommendations though she runs faster over shorter distances , for the marathon she is aiming at a pace of 10 40to11minute miles slow and steady , she said my goal is under five hours cynthia hoffmann , phillips huntington s longtime voice teacher , said that she had seen improvements in her pupil s breathing , stamina and body awareness as a result of her training her ability to sing longer phrases has increased , and her overall energy is stronger , hoffmann said using alexander technique principles , phillips huntington is also paying attention to balance in her body as she runs to the way her spine interacts with her head , neck and torso this helps both running and singing even the sense of stepping onto the center of the foot , not just the outside , can affect the muscles of the inner thigh , which can influence the diaphragm s descent , hoffmann said good physical conditioning is essential for opera as well as for marathons while the best marathon runners are often sinewy and whittled down , all bone and muscle for maximum bodily efficiency , opera singers depend on larger frames to sustain the volume and resonance their voices need we tend to be taller , broader , bigboned people , phillips huntington said we use our body as a resonator and support that s why most opera singers are not small , though the old cartoon clich the enormous lady in the massive steelgirded gown who belts out arias while being hauled around stage by a smaller , slightly alarmedlooking man is now outdated , especially with performers emphasizing the dramatic elements of the performance as well as the singing so phillips huntington is not interested in being overweight as part of her training , she avoids bread , pasta and the like in favor of lean protein , fruits , vegetables and nuts a kind of paleotype menu , she said at 5 feet 10 inches , she has lost about 30 pounds in the past year , but says the number is irrelevant i 've never really been obsessed with weight , she said i do n't think i 'll ever be considered thin , ' but i would n't be as good a singer if i could n't physically sustain what i needed to do it s not about a number it s about feeling good in your body and yourself , finding the good place for you a few years ago , she consulted a personal trainer i was hyped up to be able to do pushups , she said but then i started to develop muscles in my shoulders and neck , and it started to affect my singing i got tight and could n't relax in that area opera singers , she went on , cannot be like sprinters or ballet dancers , with their supertight cores they need to be able to relax and expand , not tighten and compress i'm not going to sacrifice my musical body in order to do this , she said of the race recently , and on nov 1 will be running with her husband , david huntington , a lawyer and marathon veteran she does n't sing while she runs , unless you count occasionally humming along with her ipod , but her husband belts out songs like he s not a trained opera singer , she said , but he stays on key but then , of course , she is not a trained marathon runner let s be clear , she said there s no danger the elite runners do n't need to fear me i want to do the best that i can , which for me means crossing the finish line

for years , the played cat and mouse with the city of los angeles every so often a team in , say , minnesota , would threaten to move to la in an effort to crowbar concessions out of its government leaders back home once the team got public financing , it stayed put to move the ball , aeg , the sports and entertainment group , and majestic realty group , a big real estate developer , promised to if a team would commit to moving for years , none did but the roulette wheel has spun a lot faster this year in january , the owner of the , stan kroenke , said he in inglewood , 10 miles south of downtown los angeles last week , the inglewood city council voted unanimously to give the project the green light the rams switched to a yeartoyear lease at the edward jones dome in st louis , giving them the flexibility to move alarmed by the possibility that the rams could move back to los angeles , the and the last month said they would , about 15 miles farther south the move was viewed as a way for the teams to maintain leverage in stadium negotiations with their home cities and potentially forestall the rams in the blink of an eye , the nfl went from shadow boxing to boxing in los angeles faced with the possibility of three teams rushing to the city at once , the nfl established an to oversee the process but the process appears to be a work in a progress aeg , which secured environmental approvals and sold naming rights for its proposed stadium next to staples center in downtown los angeles , and which perhaps fears being shut out of the nfl stadium sweepstakes , reentered the fray the company commissioned a report by tom ridge , a former secretary of the department of homeland security , who outlined several safety and operational risks of locating a stadium in inglewood just a few miles from the runways at los angeles international airport in the post 9 11 world , the threat of terrorism is a permanent condition , ridge wrote as both a former governor and secretary of homeland security , it is my opinion that the peril of placing a national football league stadium in the direct flight path of lax layering risk outweigh any benefits over the decadeslong life span of the facility ridge urged a public debate on the interconnected security , safety and economic risks well before a shovel touches the ground ridge s report , though , neglected to note that other nfl stadiums are near airports , including metlife stadium , the home of the jets and the giants , which is a few miles from teterboro airport and newark liberty international airport \( planes have also banked around citi field on their final approach to la guardia airport \) nevertheless , aeg paid mark rosenker , a former chairman of the national transportation safety board , to write another report on the potential of accidental threats from laser pointers , drones , stadium lights and even equipment falling off planes the blimps and small planes pulling banners around stadiums on game days could also be affected by the wake from widebody planes heading in and out of the airport , he said why potentially site an 80 , 000person stadium right near the third or fourthbusiest airport and not expect there to be some risks \? rosenker said in an interview is it the only place in the los angeles metropolitan area where you could build such a building \? eric grubman , who has worked closely on developing the los angeles market for the nfl , said that the league had a lot of experience with overflight risk , ingress and egress , and design and construction of stadiums , but that it would most likely rely on outside experts if the project in inglewood progressed the rams , as well as the raiders and the chargers , have been in contact with the league about their plans , but the league will begin a formal review of their proposals only if one or more of the teams applies to relocate we 're spending time on any site which could conceivably host a team , but we spend more time as the probability increases , grubman said now that the inglewood site is entitled and carson is along that process , we 're spending more time looking at them russ stanton , a spokesman for kroenke and stockbridge capital group , which proposed the stadium in inglewood , declined to comment on the findings of the reports michael roth , a spokesman for aeg , declined to comment on why the company commissioned the reports with potentially billions of dollars at stake , it is no surprise that developers are using sharp elbows to nudge out rivals all s fair in love and war , and this is war when you 're dealing with a stadium that could cost upwards of a 1 billion and generate billions of dollars over many years , said jordan kobritz , who teaches sports management at the state university of new york at cortland i think they 're desperate , and in my view they should be , given what s going on lately david carter , who teaches sports business at the university of southern california , said the reaction from aeg was part of a larger and somewhat inevitable process when stadium proposals are first announced , their advocates have the first say then critics mobilize in opposition and try to derail the progress for many years , the southern california market was a carrot , said carter , who previously advised a developer as well as los angeles and several other cities that tried to lure an nfl team these days , there are a bunch of people running around with sticks
chicago when asked for his position on the pressing issues facing chicago , jesus g garcia , the man trying to unseat mayor , often has an answer and sometimes more than one when mr garcia was recently asked what he would do about the redlight cameras that endlessly irk chicagoans , he said he would keep some of them but almost two weeks ago , he had said he would get rid of them all on the nearly 50 public schools that mr emanuel closed during his first term , mr garcia initially said he would reopen some of them later , he said he had not committed to such a move as recently as january , mr garcia said he opposed using public parkland for an obama presidential library then this month , he reversed course , saying he would support using parkland for a library chicagoans are getting used to seeing mr garcia bounding around the city with a wide smile and peppy good cheer he presents himself as a warm , inclusive alternative to mr emanuel , nicknamed rahmbo and mayor one percent by critics who say he is abrasive and insensitive to the needs of the poor what voters are not getting is a clear sense of where mr garcia , 58 , stands on many major issues , particularly what his plans are to improve the city s precarious financial condition mr garcia , known as chuy , is counting on disaffection with mr emanuel , particularly among black voters , to give him enough support to win the runoff vote on april 7 you want to be mayor of the thirdlargest city in the country , your positions should be thought out and they should n't be that difficult to explain , said bob fioretti , an alderman who also ran for mayor this year and has yet to endorse a candidate in the runoff i 've heard people say that because of his flipflops , they ca n't trust him mr emanuel has wasted no time attacking mr garcia as a candidate with only vague plans in an ad released last week , mr emanuel s campaign seized on mr garcia s lack of a budget plan with that opened with images from the soap opera days of our lives , as a narrator intones like sand through the hourglass , so are the days since chuy garcia has promised to unveil his budget the ad includes clips of mr garcia hedging on the details of his budget plan stung by those attacks , outlining his approach to chicago s budget , saying the city could save money by making government agencies more efficient , by consolidating costs and reducing investment fees , and by revamping the way the city pays for economic development programs in an interview , mr garcia said mr emanuel was trying to blame him for the mayor s own failures when he ran four years ago , he promised to make neighborhoods safer and he promised to improve schools , mr garcia said and he promised to put the city s finances in order none of that has happened defeating mr emanuel will be a tall order for mr garcia , a county commissioner and former alderman who came to the united states as a child , speaking no english , and got his start in politics as a community organizer in a heavily hispanic neighborhood on the west side by capturing 34 percent of the vote in february , to mr emanuel s 45 percent adding to his underdog status , mr garcia entered the race late , after karen lewis , who is the president of the chicago teachers union and was considered mr emanuel s strongest challenger , announced in october that she had a brain tumor mr garcia s campaign office , in a former greek restaurant in the west loop , has the bare feel of an insurgent s headquarters , with a dozen staffers hunched over laptops at communal tables hanging on a wall is a newspaper clipping with the headline the man who shook chicago we had to do all of this in a real hurry , said mr garcia , dressed in a pinstriped suit and paisley tie we were a day late and a dollar short from the beginning in a largely democratic city , mr garcia has attempted to move to the left of mr emanuel , who served in washington as a top aide to the last two democratic presidents mr garcia has garnered the support of the chicago teachers union , and received a coveted endorsement from the state council of the service employees international union he has spoken in favor of replacing the appointed school board with an elected one , a move that he said would give the school system back to the people , and promised to put 1 , 000 new police officers on the streets to stem the gang violence that has torn through neighborhoods on the south and west sides on the city s pension crisis , mr garcia has said that there s no easy solution it took more than 30 years to get to this crisis , he said there s good reasons for how it happened , and bad reasons too it s going to take quite some time to fix it , 51 percent of voters said they supported mr emanuel to 37 percent for mr garcia rosa alfaro , 74 , said she was not sure how mr garcia would fix the pension crisis , or pay for the new police officers he has promised to hire , or improve the struggling public schools but she is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt i'm still waiting to find out about that , ms alfaro said , in between bites of a hot dog lunch at her senior center on a recent afternoon i'm voting for him anyway mr garcia immigrated with his family his father was a farm laborer and his mother a factory worker from mexico to chicago s pilsen neighborhood on the west side when he was only 9 years old there were white kids , ethnic kids , who were probably polish and czech , he said there were africanamerican kids at the school i had never seen africanamericans before , africanamerican kids so it was like entering a new world , where you had , you know , that type of diversity in high school , he became interested in civil rights and social justice , hanging out with other kids at school who were talking about racism and prejudice and the importance of standing up against these things one of his first tastes of community organizing came when he and other students became disgusted by the condition of a local movie theater , where carpets were sticky with gum and soda , the restrooms were filthy and rats roamed freely that angered me , he said we had printed a flier , and we asked people not to go into the theater , to boycott the theater people responded , like , big time the manager spoke with mr garcia and agreed to the protesters' demands to clean up the theater we felt pretty good about it and i think were inspired to continue organizing efforts , he said he studied at the university of illinois at chicago and , in the early 1980s , delved into local politics , meeting harold washington , the first africanamerican mayor of chicago david s schaffer , mr garcia s largest individual donor , said he and mr garcia worked together on mr washington s campaign in 1983 he was very dynamic , very energetic , very principled , very idealistic , mr schaffer said i think that the more voters get to know chuy , the more they 'll like him they 'll trust him they 'll believe in him after serving on the chicago city council and in the illinois senate , mr garcia went back to community organizing , founding a nonprofit organization , and in 2010 won a seat on the cook county board of commissioners in october , when ms lewis told him about her illness and encouraged him to run in her place , he was stunned i asked her , karen , why do you want to ruin my life \?

' so he got to work building a better tuxedo shirt his first model , called the gershwin , has a wing collar and pleats but is made of flexible , moisturewicking fabric like that used in athletic shirts \( he calls the fabric fortissimo \) its raglan sleeves extend to the neck without shoulder seams , like some baseball jerseys , to make it less restrictive for musicians who wield a bow , extend trombone slides or beat kettle drums a few friends and colleagues were given prototypes to test , including david itkin , who conducts the abilene philharmonic in texas and summerfest in mccall , idaho , and who has conducted mr yu mr itkin said that it felt like something between your running shirt and your jammies and that it did not need to be drycleaned , which makes its 120 price a bit more affordable i probably have , i do n't know , eight or 10 formal wear shirts , mr itkin said in an interview i have n't worn one of them since he gave me that shirt it does n't cling to skin you do n't feel soaking wet and clammy an hour into a mahler symphony or an opera several top violinists tried it out as well nathan olson , the coconcertmaster of the dallas symphony orchestra , said the shirt filled a need you kind of wonder why it did n't exist in the marketplace to begin with , he said a lot of us just took it for granted that that s the way it had to be because that s the way it always was frank huang , of the new york philharmonic in september , said that playing the violin could be an athletic endeavor , and that it had been good to test out a shirt that had been designed for flexibility and comfort you can move around as a musician , said mr huang , who has been the  mr yu sold out his first run of 300 shirts in nine days , and the that we have depleted our inventory a close inspection of the shirt while , say , dining t te t te or dancing cheek to cheek would reveal that the fabric s weave looks more like something from a cycling catalog than from brooks brothers but even from the best seats in a concert hall , it would probably be difficult to detect the difference onstage , especially if the musician is wearing a jacket the real test will come in the next few weeks when the first customers are supposed to receive their shirts in time for the new season mr yu had hoped for a soft introduction , to give himself time to iron out any problems with his noiron shirts i really wanted to be in stealth mode for as long as i can , and make as many mistakes as i can quietly , mr yu said but after about his hightech tux shirt appeared on , the idea spread on social media , and the number of visitors to his website jumped to 29 , 000 from 3 , 000 soon he had more orders than he could fill , so he began accepting preorders for a second batch he hopes to have ready in the fall his inbox soon filled up with suggestions from musicians with their own wish lists for more comfortable clothes players in orchestra pits wanted black shirts , church choirs wanted breathable gowns , marching bands wanted shirts without pleats and although women in orchestras do not generally have to wear tuxedos , they expressed a desire for more comfortable clothes as well mr yu said that he had already created a prototype of a new tuxedo shirt with a point collar instead of a wing collar , and that he hoped to have black shirts available by next year he has been talking to his designer about putting out a women s line in 2016 , as well soon , he said , he would like to turn his attention to the pretied bow tie from its fastener to its fabric the bow tie should not be made out of satin , he said it s luxurious , but it does n't stretch , it does n't give so why would you wear something like that around your neck \?
hong kong in a meeting with s prodemocratic legislators a few weeks ago , a group of european diplomats urged them to support something they had campaigned against for months a plan , backed by beijing , to let the public elect hong kong s top official even though those elections would be restricted to candidates approved by a probeijing committee a poison pill for the prodemocracy leaders several of the diplomats , through pointed questions to the lawmakers , argued that some democracy was better than none , according to people who were there i phrased the question in such a way as they could understand that they should vote for it , said a western diplomat who attended the june 3 meeting , and who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk freely without seeking higher approval some of us were advocating that it may be better to vote yes and take it but the lawmakers stuck to their guns , buoyed by the that erupted last year after beijing announced its election guidelines the lawmakers' rejection of the proposal on june 18 , leaving hong kong with the longtime status quo under which its leader is appointed by a beijingfriendly committee , with the public having no vote now , hong kong s political evolution is in limbo , and in the week since the vote , people on both sides of the issue have been caught up in the question of what happens next a prodemocratic lawmaker resigned and announced a plan to start a centrist party beijing s loyalists in the hong kong legislature , meanwhile , have been trying to explain a parliamentary blunder that left the election plan with just eight votes in support under the miniconstitution that governs hong kong , which was negotiated with britain before the former colony was , beijing agreed to eventually allow voters to choose their top official , known as the chief executive but any such system must get the imprimatur of the central government , and there is no indication that beijing is in a hurry to make it a reality after the defeat of its plan , which had been intended to go into effect in 2017 , when the next chief executive will be chosen voters will probably have to wait until at least 2022 for the chance to expand the electorate , and even then , there is no sign beijing will soften its stance it is very unlikely that the hong kong government or the central government will relaunch the political reform again within this government term , said , a vice chairman of the biggest probeijing party , the democratic alliance for the betterment and progress of hong kong like the european diplomats , mr chow said the bloc of lawmakers who voted against the measure collectively called the pandemocrats lost their best chance to improve the system even candidates screened by beijing would have had to woo the pandemocrats' legions of supporters to win election as chief executive , introducing a new dynamic in hong kong politics , the argument goes moreover , they said , the system could have been improved for subsequent elections for some hong kong politicians , one way forward is to turn to other issues lawmakers from across the political spectrum , as well as chief executive leung chunying , have said that they now want to focus on socalled livelihood issues , like free kindergarten and better care for the elderly , to show the city s 72 million people that their government can still function the pandemocrats insist that the fight for true democracy must go on but they have yet to articulate a clear strategy as they face the seemingly unmovable resolve of the chinese communist party , which in mainland is against western notions of democracy and civil liberties for now , the pandemocrats' approach seems to be grim resolve , hoping for a future government in beijing that is more sympathetic to their desire for elections with a broader range of candidates i speak for lots of democrats , said martin lee , the founder of hong kong s democratic party , who helped put together hong kong s miniconstitution , called the basic law the reason why we wanted to vote it down is not because we wanted the status quo no , that was never our intention the intention was to vote it down to force beijing to have a better deal , he added mr lee said beijing was paying a price for setting such strict election guidelines for hong kong the one country , two systems formula under which hong kong was returned to china in 1997 , while retaining its own laws and liberties until 2047 , is also the system that beijing wants to use to eventually lure taiwan , ruled separately since 1949 , back under its control beijing s heavyhanded tactics , which set off the hong kong street protests last year , have made the possibility of reunification with taiwan even more remote , mr lee said to some , the failure to pass an election law is a result of the immovability not only of beijing but also of the pandemocrats ronny tong , a pandemocratic lawmaker who voted against the election proposal , announced his resignation from the legislative council after the vote he said he was as dismayed by his allies' inflexibility as he was with beijing s mistrust of the pandemocrats he said he wanted to change the dynamic , eventually building a new centrist political party that pushes for democratization but strives to maintain cordial ties with china s leaders the impression i get is that they regarded the pandemocrats as being far too intransigent , not willing to give way in any form , mr tong said by telephone , referring to officials in beijing with whom he met this year the pandemocrats unfortunately also see beijing in the same light they see beijing as unwilling to give any concession at all one confidencebuilding measure , mr tong said , could be a pledge from beijing to agree to abolish the unusual power structure in hong kong , left over from british rule , under which many electors and lawmakers represent industries or social groups rather than voting districts mr tong said patching up ties with beijing and achieving real change in hong kong s elections were not a pieinthesky ideas under the previous chief executive , donald tsang , hong kong was able to at least wrest from beijing the promise that the public could choose their leaders by 2017 , though the plan finally put forward fell short of expectations , sparking the widespread protests the idea of a new centrist party opens the possibility however remote that mr tong could field enough successful candidates for next year s legislative council elections to become a power broker , giving the government a chance to pass an election law if it can make enough changes to win his party s support you must produce some representatives that they deem as friends , said michael tien , a probeijing lawmaker , referring to the central government obviously someone like ronny tong who just resigned a day or two ago fits into that category
there was almost no discussion of the economy in last night s debate , which is actually weird if you consider the republican selfimage these guys portray themselves as high priests of growth , the people who know how to bring prosperity and remember all the crowing about how obama was presiding over the worst recovery ever \? but now , not so much the chart shows privatesector job gains after two recessions the 2001 recession , and the 20072009 great recession ended , in thousands you can argue that the economy should have bounced back more strongly from the deeper slump on the other hand , 2008 was a huge financial crisis , which tends to leave a bad hangover anyway , once the right is arguing that obama s better recovery wasn t really his doing , it has already lost the argument now , am i claiming that obama caused all that job creation \? no policy was pretty much hamstrung from 2010 on but the right confidently predicted that obama s policies , especially his jobkilling health reform , would , well , kill jobs as matt o brien notes , the donald confidently predicted that unemployment would go above 9 percent none of that happened nor did any of the other predicted obama disasters recovery should have been much faster , and i believe that there is still more slack than the unemployment rate suggests but if president romney were presiding over this economy , republicans would be hailing it as the second coming of ronald reagan instead , they re trying to talk about something else

kabul , afghanistan the hospital was among the most brightly lit buildings in kunduz on the night a circling american gunship destroyed it the rest of the northern afghan city was mostly dark after days of fighting between the security forces and militants but the hospital was keeping its lights on as doctors there were working , according to the group s general director , christopher stokes spread across the hospital roof was a large white and red flag reading , the group s french name on the afternoon before the strike , the fighting in the neighborhood had quieted enough for staff members to safely climb to the roof and lay out the markers identifying the building to any military aircraft flying over the group had also sent the longitude and latitude coordinates of the hospital , for years the most important trauma center in that part of northern , to the united states military to remind it where not to attack during the fighting despite all that , and the protection afforded to warzone hospitals by the , the hospital was in the early hours of oct 3 the strikes occurred over an hour and 15 minutes and killed 30 people , including patients on operating tables and the wounded in their beds and wheelchairs at a news conference in kabul on thursday , the international medical organization said that more than a month after the attack the united states military had yet to offer an explanation for why a clearly marked hospital was struck , other than to say it had been hit by mistake a mistake is quite hard to understand and believe at this stage , mr stokes said at the news conference the organization and renewed its call for an independent investigation , which both the united states and afghanistan have resisted so far from what we are seeing now , this action is illegal in the laws of war you cannot do this you cannot bomb a hospital as details continue to emerge that suggest that the military struck the target it intended to hit that day , a troubling question hangs over the various investigations into the attack did someone intentionally decide to fire on the hospital , whether because of the presence of wounded fighters there or for some other reason \? as mr stokes put it , did our hospital lose its protected status in the eyes of the military forces engaged in this attack , and if so , why \? the main hospital building , the most clearly marked in the medical complex , received the brunt of the bombardment on oct 3 the perimeter of the hospital was mostly spared , suggesting that the main hospital building was the specific target of the various aerial passes by the american special operations ac130 , a gunship used by the military because of its ability to deliver precise strikes on one spot over an extended period of time so far , the united states military has offered few details to explain how the strikes happened after the airstrike , the military initially claimed the hospital had been collateral damage in a bombardment intended to protect american forces later , offering little detail , the top american commander in afghanistan , he said the bombardment came in response to a request from afghan forces for an airstrike , claiming that they had come under attack by taliban fighters in the area doctors without borders has repeatedly denied those claims since the attack on the hospital , afghan officials have suggested that it was justified , claiming that the complex had become a taliban stronghold in kunduz after the militants seized the city in september but hospital officials have said that is untrue as a neutral hospital , the organization said that it treats wounded patients without regard to which side they fight on it enforces a strict noweapons policy within the hospital at the news conference , mr stokes described how the organization received an email from an american military official in washington two days before the bombing inquiring about a large number of taliban holed up in the hospital and about the safety of the hospital s staff mr stokes and colleagues warned reporters against reading too much into the emailed question , however , saying that the organization simply responded that the hospital was full of patients , including civilians , members of the security forces and wounded taliban combatants two of those taliban patients might have been highranking insurgents , based on the number of fighters who had escorted them to the hospital as well as the intense interest shown in their health by visitors , according to the group s report released on thursday , detailing what the organization had learned from interviews with staff members the organization said that none of the taliban or government security forces were armed when they entered the hospital and , additionally , were no longer considered combatants and were protected as a matter of international law because of their wounds and subsequent hospitalization military officials in kabul have declined to answer questions about the airstrike , saying answers will have to wait while the military conducts its own investigations one is a joint natoafghan inquiry , and the other is being conducted by the united states military one section of the new doctors without borders report detailed frantic efforts during the airstrikes by the group s staff members in kunduz , kabul , and new york to call and text their contacts in the united states military and nato to try to get the attack halted the staff at the hospital could hear the propellers of the gunship circling above , firing on the hospital in roughly 15 minute intervals , a total of five passes some staff members said several people fleeing the central hospital during the attack came under fire as they tried to reach different areas of the compound the first call to military contacts occurred at 2 19 am , and the calls and texts continued for an hour , more than a dozen in all they seemed to accomplish little , according to a log of the calls released by the group in one response , a military official with the americanled coalition texted back , i 'll do my best , praying for you all
ca n't act slightly bald also dances that s what a studio executive supposedly wrote about fred astaire after an early screen test and even if apocryphal , that famous line is something to keep in mind while of the late late show on cbs sometimes star power is n't obvious mr corden s was not evident even after a , an elaborately produced video with cameos by jay leno , shia labeouf , arnold schwarzenegger and meryl streep an interview with mila kunis and an antic bit alongside tom hanks mr corden , a portly british performer , was energetic , amiable and cheerfully selfassured , but not particularly special so it s still not clear why cbs chose him to replace and , soon enough , to follow show , which will replace david letterman s this fall most of monday night s show was devoted to addressing that question , not by providing an answer but by making a preemptive joke about it the posited that cbs had chosen its new host in a willy wonkaesque lottery , slipping the winning ticket for the job inside a chocolate bar comedians like chris rock and joel mchale unwrap bars and pretend to be crestfallen to find no ticket the piece also alluded to complaints that networks pick only white males for these kinds of jobs chelsea handler , whose latenight talk show on e ! ended last year and who would have been a likely candidate , buys the golden ticketholding candy bar at a newsstand but then drops it as she goes to put it in her purse mr corden comes along and scoops it up in his opening monologue , mr corden made fun of his obscurity i know what you 're thinking , he told the audience oh look andy richter s got his own show' he does look a little like mr richter , and like mr richter , who is conan o'brien s talk show sidekick , mr corden seems suited to playing second fiddle his conversations with ms kunis and mr hanks were pleasant , but not particularly witty or outr he did challenge ms kunis for being coy about whether she is married to ashton kutcher , the father of her child he would n't accept her maybe as an answer and grabbed her hand to show a ring he also did , a quickchange montage of scenes from mr hanks s most famous movies that allowed mr corden to wear a blond wig to impersonate meg ryan \( crossdressing is in the british comedy bill of rights \) cbs recruited some very talented writers and producers to back mr corden , as well as reggie watts , the musiciancomedian \( late of comedy bang bang \) who is his bandleader and announcer at the close of the show , mr corden sang a solo ditty , perhaps to signal to viewers that besides appearing in the movie into the woods , he is also a for his role in one man , two guvnors mr corden s first night was fine and it s to be expected that he will improve in the next weeks but it only deepened one of the more enduring mysteries of latenight television there is no good explanation for why top executives at the major networks would bet on a littleknown british performer who resembles every other white male talk show host already on the air rather than take a chance on a more familiar , more charismatic star who , by just being female or noncaucasian , breaks the mold when he took over the late late show 10 years ago , mr ferguson was n't well known to american audiences , either his ratings suggest that his appeal had limits , but it was apparent right off the bat in standups , mr ferguson delivered offthewall , multivoiced streamofconsciousness riffs that made him seem almost like a scottish robin williams mr corden s look and accent make him seem a little like ricky gervais , but he has none of that comedian s cruel and wickedly provocative humor as he has in interviews promoting his new venture , mr corden speaks fondly of his wife and children , and makes rather banal carsonera jokes about los angeles traffic and hollywood vanity on monday , he said that since arriving in hollywood , his mother had taken to eating kale and planned to have her breasts done perhaps mystery is the point maybe cbs hopes that by keeping mr corden s charm elusive , viewers will continue tuning in to learn more believe me , however shocked you are that i am doing this job , mr corden said , you will never be as shocked as i am
sterling , va imam mohamed magid tries to stay in regular contact with the teenager who came to him a few months ago , at his family s urging , to discuss how he was being wooed by online recruiters working for the islamic state , the extremist group in syria and iraq but the imam , a scholar bursting with charm and authority , has struggled to compete though he has successfully intervened in the cases of five other young men , persuading them to abandon plans to fight overseas , the islamic state s recruiting efforts have become even more disturbing , he said , and nonstop the recruiters would n't leave him alone , imam magid said of the young man he met with recently they were on social media with him at all hours , they tweet him at night , first thing in the morning if i talk to him for an hour , they undo him in two hours president obama on wednesday described the fight against violent extremism as a generational challenge that would require the cooperation of governments , religious leaders , educators and law enforcement but even before he called on more than 60 nations to join the effort , the rise of the islamic state and the attacks by homegrown terrorists in paris , ottawa , copenhagen and sydney , australia , had jolted american muslims into action muslim leaders here and elsewhere have already started organizing or expanding prevention programs and discussions on countering violent extremism , often with assistance from law enforcement officials and trained counterrecruiters who emphasize that the internet s dangers for young muslims now go far beyond pornography with the islamic state in particular deploying savvy online appeals to adolescents alongside videos of , the sense of urgency has grown though some muslim leaders still resist cooperating with the government , fearing that they would be contributing to religious profiling and antimuslim bigotry , many have been spurred to respond as they have come into contact with religiously ardent youths who feel alienated by life in the west and admit that they have been vulnerable to the islamic state s invitation to help build a puritanical utopia the number is small , but one person who gets radicalized is one too many , said rizwan jaka , a father of six and the board chairman of the , where imam magid is the spiritual leader it s a balancing act we have to make sure our youth are not stereotyped in any way , but we 're still dealing with the real issue of insulating them from any potential threat of radicalization in practice , it often means oneonone conversations with muslims like amir , a 22yearold computer programmer in virginia who said he was drawn to extremist videos from the islamic state , also known as isis or isil , because he was a new convert struggling with how to live out his faith in the united states he said he chafed at having to work in an office with muslim women who covered their heads but wore clothing he considered too tight he also did not like seeing photographs of people on the walls , or advertisements for credit cards , which he said islam strictly forbids every time i mentioned it , no one heard me out , he said i definitely felt like a stranger he said his disenchantment with the islamic state began when the group beheaded , who reports said was a muslim convert , and later executed a amir then had some long talks with imam magid , who pointed him to passages in the quran that forbid killing other muslims , innocent women and children amir concluded that the islamic state was only sowing chaos and hatred , which the prophet muhammad abhorred the islamic state once looked like eye candy to me , said amir , who was willing to be identified only by his first name because he did not want to attract the attention of extremists but now i think they are deviants imam magid described amir as the kind of person who is vulnerable to an alienated young muslim with a blackandwhite worldview , looking for purpose and adventure but , he added , it is often hard to identify which people are most at risk here in suburban virginia where muslim parents tend to be professionals whose children are enmeshed in american culture and are more likely to spend time at the mall than watching extremist videos the threat still feels remote , especially for those who are active in mosques many homegrown extremists in the west were converts who had little exposure to the faith , or education in it many parents and religious leaders are struggling with where to focus their efforts imam magid , who is in regular communication with the fbi and other law enforcement agencies , said the young men he had counseled came from a variety of family backgrounds humera khan , the founder of , a think tank based in washington that focuses on countering violent extremism , said that increasingly , there is no consistent profile of those who are targeted for recruitment or drawn to islamic extremists there are no patterns , and that s making it harder for everyone , she said in an interview in virginia late last month they can come from every ethnic , socioeconomic group , any geographic area but they are more often men than women , and they 're getting younger officials estimate that about 150 americans have traveled , or tried to travel , to fight in syria that is fewer than in france , where 1 , 000 people are estimated to have gone to syria , or england , which has counted about 600 , not including those who were in touch with extremists online and decided not to join imam magid said that in addition to those he had talked out of going , he knew of one young muslim from virginia who recently left to join the islamic state in syria \( he said he had never met this man or had a chance to dissuade him \) in chicago in october , two brothers , ages 19 and 16 , and their 17yearold sister were to join the islamic state three girls from denver , one as young as 15 , were stopped at an airport in germany the same month on their way to join militants in syria all were reportedly recruited over the internet and that has provoked new levels of introspection , both private and public , among american muslims of all ages at a forum for muslim millennials in washington sponsored by the last year , college students and muslim leaders speculated about why a group as barbaric as the islamic state had successfully attracted any muslims at all from the west isis says come here we 've got ripped warriors , ' said imam , a popular muslim leader who moved from boston to the washington area last month it s a very simplistic response , but it s somewhat effective he said that in more than 15 years as an imam , he had encountered only five muslims considering whether they should join violent militant groups , and that none of them had actually left the united states to fight they were all males , said imam webb , and they all had daddy issues he added , they were not really drawn to this on theological grounds ms khan , who has four degrees from mit , left lucrative consulting work to develop a prevention program that addresses extremism and the way that technology can be used for manipulation at one of her events last year , about 30 young muslims , both high school and middle school students , gathered at the in avon , conn , for what was billed as a cybersafety workshop , with ms khan moving swiftly from how to detect online pedophiles to how to detect islamist extremists they are telling you , let s go fight' they are asking you to share gruesome images , said ms khan , who wore a blue floralprint head scarf be very careful these people are not your friends she told the students , who were quick to raise their hands and ask questions , to avoid contact with strangers online , or with anyone who demanded secrecy the sexual predators are usually male , she told them , but the extremist recruiters can be male or female , and some of them can be , or can pretend to be , teenagers , too her presentation included a picture of a wolf zipped into a sheep s skin have you guys heard of grooming \? she asked them , using a term more often used in relation to sexual predators they will try to be your friend they will be nice to you , spend lots of time with you some of them will be sending you gifts programs like this have not been embraced as a widespread priority by american muslims , at least until recently , in part because the problem seemed to be overseas , not here , muslim leaders say and since many american muslims are immigrants or africanamericans , there is substantial fear and suspicion of law enforcement officials , along with simple defensiveness and denial the family says , it s not going to happen to me , ' said , a pulmonologist and the first muslim to be elected as a mayor in connecticut , where he serves south windsor imam magid , speaking upstairs at his muslim center while a team of muslim girls

london the art market is a notoriously opaque business and over the past couple of years the highly speculative trade in emerging artists has given off plenty of heat in 2014 , recently made works by like oscar murillo , lucien smith , alex israel , mark flood and christian rosa were being at auction for eyewatering multiples of the artists' original gallery prices but in the past six months or so , this volatile sector of the market , where insiders continually scour facebook and instagram for the next damien hirst , has undergone a correction the global economic outlook has become less certain , and so have buyers of emerging contemporary art in february 2014 , a 2012 rain painting by lucien smith , 26 , one of about 200 made by the new york artist by spraying paint on a canvas with a fire extinguisher , was sold at a sotheby s auction in london for 224 , 500 pounds , about 372 , 000 , more than 30 times its original purchase price this may , at phillips in new york , a smith rain painting of the same size and year was auctioned for 62 , 500 people with foresight have stopped buying this kind of art , said kenny schachter , a collector , dealer and writer in london who has been buying emerging contemporary works for more than 25 years there was a bubble of fashionable artists people made a lot of money , and people lost a lot artists in their 20s just should n't be selling for almost 400 , 000 according to research by the salesroom result database artnet , contemporary works created within the preceding three years generated 2174 million of auction sales in the first half of 2014 sales of such works declined 23 percent , to 1675 million , during the equivalent period this year that market shift is reflected in a midseason auction that will debut at phillips in new york on sept 17 the house s previous series of sales , aptly branded under the influence and heavily weighted with abstract paintings by ontrend names like mr smith , has given way to what phillips is calling the new now , a format that combines both emerging and established artists the first of four annual sales , divided between new york and london , will include about 250 lots that phillips estimates could raise 44 million to 65 million there seems to have been a bit of a cooling and hopefully that means we 're heading toward a market that s more sustainable , said rebekah bowling , who is organizing the sale she added that the format was a response to new and seasoned collectors' increasing desire to look for value among neglected artists at later stages of their careers for example , the new now sale will include a 2001 pink neon web sculpture , spiders from mars , by the american gonzo minimalist sculptor blair thurman \( who was born in 1961 \) , estimated at 12 , 000 to 18 , 000 \( gagosian held a show of new works by mr thurman at its madison avenue gallery from nov 1 , 2014 , to jan 10 this year \) but the auction will also include plenty of the younger , ofthemoment names that have been phillips s recent trademark ibrahim mahama of ghana \( born in 1987 \) became one of the most talkedabout artists at this year s after creating a monumental 300meter installation lined with jute bags that runs through the event s main all the world s futures exhibition another mahama jute bag sacks used to transport coal is included in the new now sale presented on a stretcher to resemble a painting , and signed and dated 2014 , it is estimated at 12 , 000 to 18 , 000 mr mahama s works evoke colonial exploitation , but interestingly , as artnews reported on aug 25 , he has become embroiled in a that raises issues of exploitation within the art market itself , and exposes its brutally commercial dynamics on june 15 , the los angeles collector and dealer stefan simchowitz and the dublin gallerist jonathan ellis king \( who presented an exhibition of mr mahama s work last december and january \) , filed a in us district court in california against the artist the suit claims the artist broke a contract with the dealers by declaring in may that none of the 294 individual signed jutebag pieces he had supplied to the dealers was his work , and by saying that he had not agreed to the commercialization of his artworks according to the suit , mr simchowitz and mr ellis king paid mr mahama 90 , 000 for the sacking material and a fabricator 67 , 000 to mount the individual bags on wooden stretchers the suit claims that 27 of the works \( similar to the one at phillips , which the auction house said by phone has no connection with this case \) , had been sold for an average of 16 , 700 each , making the remaining unsold inventory valued at 445 million he delivered and then after venice took this crazy position of claiming signed works were somehow not authentic , mr simchowitz said in an email it was outrageous and left me with no choice but to sue as i had sold works to clients the south africanborn mr simchowitz is a figure in the contemporary art world respected as an astute and passionate collector he was an early supporter of mr murillo \( born in 1986 \) , buying dozens of works for himself and clients when they were priced at less than 10 , 000 he has also been criticized for his aggressive management and marketing of young artists , like mr rosa , kour pour and mr mahama i am not a philanthropist , mr simchowitz said by phone the intention from the beginning was to subdivide some of the jute sacks and turn them into paintings i need to have paintings on walls to sell to clients mr simchowitz said that he has a client base of more than 200 collectors neither mr mahama , nor the artist s current dealer , a palazzo gallery in bescia , italy , responded to emails requesting a comment on the case whatever the outcome of the suit \( mr simchowitz did not know when it might be resolved \) , the case reveals how dealers and artists can be tempted to massproduce works to feed the market s insatiable hunger for instantly recognizable brand art there are dealers and artists who confuse the market for a career they 're not the same thing , and that is a problem , said vanessa carlos , cofounder of the east london gallery carlos ishakawa , which has been exhibiting mr murillo since 2011 the colombian artist , who lives in london , is one of the few heavily speculated 20somethings who has successfully made the transition into the top tier of the gallery system in october , mr murillo will have his first oneman show at the mayfair gallery of the new york dealer david zwirner , where new works will be priced as high as 250 , 000 meanwhile , galleries continue to introduce emerging artists to the market , and collectors continue to buy them , albeit at more modest price levels on friday , the london dealer pippy houldsworth opened a solo show of works by the new york artist luke diiorio \( born in 1983 \) at an early stage of his career , and yet to be successfully flipped at auction , mr diiorio makes austere minimalist canvases out of geometrically folded linen an artist s career should be built gradually , with prices kept stable until institutional support has been built , ms houldsworth said she added that all seven of the diiorio canvases in the show , priced at 12 , 000 each , have been sold to trusted collectors , each of whom has agreed to offer the work back to the gallery if they were to sell in the future mr diiorio is yet another artist who has benefited from the patronage of mr simchowitz though ms houldsworth confirmed mr diiorio has been working with stefan simchowitz for a few years , she said he is now represented internationally by the gallery still , sales might also have been helped by recent works by mr diiorio \( and dozens of other emerging artists like mr mahama \) being shown on mr simchowitz s instagram account , where he has 73 , 000 followers
london at six minutes after three o'clock on wednesday afternoon , a packed anfield stadium in liverpool will fall silent as it has at this precise time every april 15 for the past 25 years and when the silence is over , the more than 40 , 000 people will burst into the anthem you 'll never walk alone this is how liverpool pays its respects to the sons and daughters , the mothers and fathers , the cousins and friends who were among the 96 fans who died in the crush of a chronically overcrowded standing area behind one of the goal boxes six minutes into the fa cup semifinal between liverpool and nottingham forest , played at the neutral venue of hillsborough , sheffield time has not been allowed to ease the bereavement for the families , nor to prevent the tremor in the pulse for any of us who were in that stadium in 1989 we were drawn for sport , but barely had the game begun when the horror unraveled before us this weekend , as fate would have it , liverpool plays another fa cup semifinal , this time against aston villa at london s wembley stadium that makes five times the reds have reached this penultimate stage of the world s oldest tournament , following the tragedy the semis of 1990 , 1992 , 1996 , 2001 , 2006 and 2012 so the love of this competition continues to compel liverpudlians among them relatives of the dead and the hundreds more fans injured at hillsborough some , but not all say it would only make more futile their loss if they turned their backs on the cause their loved ones died following if you get the chance , watch wednesday s hillsborough memorial service at anfield you will witness a remarkable bond between the survivors , the relatives and the former players who come back to share this ceremony at each anniversary for those of us who were mere bystanders in 1989 , the worst thing was seeing the tragedy build up , watching helplessly from the adjacent main stand the calamity resulting when 2 , 000 extra fans were allowed to enter that crowded section of the ground the excitement of a liverpool attack on the goal at the far end of the field caused people at the back of the leppings lane stand to surge forward , trapping and crushing those at the front into the impenetrable steel fencing as the ablestbodied fans climbed those high barriers , or were hauled bodily up to the concrete second tier above them , life was crushed out of the spectators , many of them youngsters , trapped by the fencing there was no aggression sheer weight of numbers caused the suffocation but we all knew why those ugly , immovable barriers had been erected it was the illconsidered response of authority to keep hooligans from encroaching on the field and as inexcusable as it seems , such fences still remain in parts of the world , including france , germany and italy the government ordered that all of the country s stadiums , most of them crumbling relics back in the 1980s , become safer , modern structures in the ensuing years standing was made illegal at soccer games in the top divisions of england and scotland , and though the prices have rocketed , the legacy of the hillsborough tragedy is that every fan has a designated seat inside the arena german soccer fans might argue that with proper crowd control and well behaved spectators , people need not be deprived of the right to stand if they choose to many thousands do every time the giant teams like borussia dortmund play , and the atmosphere they create is second to none however , all is not laid to rest , and may never be , regarding liverpool if anything could be worse than the accident , it was the blame game that is still going on after more than a quarter of a century right now , in a makeshift courtroom at warrington on the outskirts of liverpool , there is a harrowing reexamination of the evidence , while simultaneously the independent police complaints commission is attempting the biggest criminal and disciplinary investigation in its history at stake is the accusation by senior police officials and by the editor of the sun newspaper that the fans were responsible for causing their own deaths those accounts were worse than erroneous the fans were either victims or , often , heroes who ran to the fallen , trying to give the kiss of life or breaking up advertising boards to cart the injured to ambulances outside the stadium the family support group , led by parents who lost children , have made it their life s purpose to demand truth and justice some , alas , have died with the passage of time , but others are beginning to see and hear the truth under oath last month in warrington , david duckenfield , the police chief who was the match commander at hillsborough , admitted under crossexamination that he had ordered the gate to be opened , allowing the 2 , 000 fans to pour through he further admitted he had been part of the attempt to cover up police culpability and blame the fans duckenfield cut a pitiable , and self pitying figure now 70 , he was pensioned off by the police force two years after hillsborough like other officers , he took early retirement because of depression no doubt the police suffered , but it is living pain duckenfield testified that he panicked , having been given the hillsborough command only three weeks before but others should be in the dock alongside him who appointed him \? who chose the venue , who decided liverpool , with thousands more supporters than nottingham , should be given the smaller end of the stadium \? who was responsible for building a fence of steel with insufficient safety gates that left so many with no escape from asphyxiation \? no amount of compensation , no apology , can replace their loss but on every hillsborough anniversary , the sadness deepens that there remain stadiums in the world that cage in fans just as unforgivably as hillsborough did fifa and its federations should pay some of their riches to ensure the arenas are safe places to watch the beautiful game
indianapolis the owner jim irsay laid the foundation for a new beginning for the on april 26 , 2012 having released one franchise cornerstone seven weeks earlier irsay set about acquiring another , when the team selected stanford quarterback andrew luck with the first overall pick in the nfl draft luck , irsay believed , would lead his franchise out of the abyss created by its 214 record in 2011 and subsequent roster purge fast forward to last sunday and the visitors' locker room at sports authority field at mile high in denver the colts were in full celebratory mode after quieting a sellout crowd and stunning the heavily favored , 2413 , in an afc divisional playoff game irsay interrupted coach chuck pagano in midsentence he had a message for his quarterback , who contributed 265 passing yards and 2 touchdowns where s andrew \? irsay asked , scanning the room for luck what a job , man you can take us anywhere , andrew , and we will follow as the colts head to gillette stadium in foxborough , mass , on sunday for a showdown with tom brady and the for the afc championship , credit a defense that has regained its swagger and a specialteams unit that features the allpro tandem of placekicker adam vinatieri and punter pat mcafee but also credit luck , who was given the enormous task of picking up where manning left off and , so far , has not faltered there have been disappointments , none greater than luck s colts being 03 against brady s patriots , including last january in an afc divisionalround game in those three games , luck passed for 968 yards and 6 touchdowns but also threw 8 interceptions , 2 of which were returned for touchdowns the colts have been on the receiving end of 22 , 21 and 35point drubbings but following luck s lead , the colts have advanced to the postseason in each of the past three years with identical 115 records and they have gone deeper each year a wildcard loss at baltimore in 2012 , a dramatic firstround win over kansas city followed by the loss to the patriots in 2013 , and wins the past two weeks against the cincinnati bengals and denver that have delivered them to their fifth afc title game since their relocation to indianapolis in 1984 luck is 32 as a starter in the postseason manning opened his career with three oneanddone playoff experiences before winning his first postseason game in his sixth season ultimately , we 're all judged at the end of the day by one thing , and that s probably how many rings you won , pagano said so winning is really important because it will get you to the final game , which is his goal and which is our goal he continued all the numbers , all the stats , all the wins , this , that and the other , they look good and they may get you into something at the end of the day but we 're here to win championships , multiple championships when we got together in 2012 , we wanted to build a program for sustained success , so he s obviously a huge , huge part of that luck prefers the spotlight to be elsewhere he credits his offensive line , his running backs , his tight ends , his receivers he credits the offensive coordinator pep hamilton , with whom he began working at stanford luck was asked if finally getting the better of brady would serve as a benchmark but he would not bite in my mind , that s not a benchmark , he said it s about the colts hopefully beating the patriots it is a team game i 've never viewed it as quarterback versus quarterback he continued obviously , he s a stud i have the utmost respect for what he does , what he s done and what he still does he s a great role model for any quarterback at any level but it s a team game it s as simple as that yet there is no denying luck s effect on the successes reaped by his team he has passed for 12 , 957 yards in the regular season , the most by a quarterback in his first three seasons he has thrown for 1 , 703 yards in the postseason , the most by a quarterback in his first five games luck has orchestrated 12 gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime , including the secondlargest comeback in postseason history the colts trailed the chiefs , 3810 , in the third quarter during last year s wildcard round , but followed luck s lead to a 4544 victory the patriots have been able to handle luck , but they realize the task at hand the passes he throws , the way he runs the offense , kind of looks like peyton manning all over again , new england cornerback darrelle revis said patriots coach bill belichick added he was pretty good when he came in , and he s even better now he s a great player he s got strengths , no weaknesses new england defensive end chandler jones described luck as a phenomenal player no one has a better grasp of luck than hamilton he worked with luck during luck s final two seasons at stanford and has been his coordinator the past two seasons with the colts he was a dominant college football player , hamilton said now i think he s evolving to the point where he s consistently controlling football games and making plays that a lot of quarterbacks ca n't make i would say he s gotten better as he s gained experience in this league hamilton continued i think the expectations for andrew once he was drafted by the colts and he became the starter day one was that he would be a special player in this league i think you 've got to think he s ahead of schedule he has n't realized his full potential just yet
edward thurlow , an english lord chancellor in the 18th century , reputedly said that it s difficult to punish a corporation because there is  but there is , in fact , a way to punish corporations for their misdeeds bar their officers from government work so why do n't we \? few outside the legal community are familiar with the concept of exclusion , which permits many federal agencies including the , the and the department of health and human services to temporarily or permanently block corporations that violate their rules from doing business with them importantly , it can also be applied to individual corporate officers , such as chief executives and lowerlevel executives , and is especially effective in the finance and health care industries since most big banks are federally insured , and many large health care companies do business with or , barring an executive from that work can be a professional death sentence for example , the fdic can for life from any federally insured bank by demonstrating in an administrative hearing that the person violated federal banking regulations or failed to correct any to exclude a health care executive from federal health programs , the department of health and human services can also conduct an administrative hearing to show that the executive engaged in fraud and the sec can bar a financial services executive by filing a civil case in federal court , showing that the person is unfit of a public company and proving that the executive knew about or recklessly ignored the improper activity it s much easier to exclude someone than to convict him of a crime none of these agencies need to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt or convince a jury that the executive knew her company was violating the law although executives are entitled to due process and can appeal the decisions in federal court , judges largely defer to the agencies' expertise despite the availability of such strong medicine , there are only a handful of instances in which senior executives have been excluded after their companies committed fraud angelo mozilo , the former ceo of countrywide financial , was hit with a 675 million fine for his role in the financial crisis , and the from serving as an officer of any public company because he deliberately misled investors as the mortgage crisis emerged others have also been barred from any federally regulated bank over the past 15 years , including the former ceo of the nowdefunct and an executive of louisiana s first guaranty bank in addition , the bear stearns executives who were acquitted of criminal charges after the financial crisis were later for several years but instead of using these tools , most federal prosecutors focus solely on bringing criminal charges against corporate executives and if those are unavailable , they look no further sally q yates , the deputy attorney general , recently that the justice department would try to squeeze the names of bad actors out of corporate defendants as a condition of any settlement negotiation but justice department lawyers concede that in many cases it s practically impossible to secure criminal convictions this singleminded focus on criminal convictions is misguided too often , corporate fraud goes unpunished jpmorgan chase paid 13 billion in 2013 for its role in the mortgage crisis but what happened to its executives that year \? none were adequately punished , the stock price and its ceo , jamie dimon , got a  similarly , fraud against medicare and medicaid has been building for over a decade from 2000 to 2004 , the hospital corporation of america paid to settle charges of fraud against federal health programs pfizer paid 23 billion in 2009 and 491 million in 2013 for fraud and illegal drug marketing davita healthcare partners was fined in 2014 to settle charges that it paid kickbacks to doctors to refer patients to its clinics this year , it agreed to pay to settle claims that it charged the government for unused drugs but what happened to the leaders of these companies , which paid some of the largest fines in history for defrauding taxpayers \? the head of hca became the governor of florida pfizer s chief executive retired in 2010 with a golden parachute worth and davita s ceo remains one of the highestpaid health care executives in the nation we need to use better methods to deter corporate misbehavior exclusion needs to be dusted off , modernized and used more frequently criminal remedies will never be a realistic option , except in the most egregious cases the best way to make sure the rankandfile are turning square corners when dealing with the government is to give them , and their bosses , strong incentives to do the right thing we no longer punish malefactors by damning their souls but we need to start kicking their bodies out of the executive suite
philadelphia there came a point tuesday night , as the clanked jumpers and missed defensive assignments so completely as to appear to be defensive mimes , that a thought bubbled into your consciousness this was almost unfair the were playing poorly enough to extend their legendary 18game losing streak and so set the nba record for ineptitude to start a season but the los angeles lakers , with their clueless performance , matched the sixers play for execrable play it was as if kobe bryant , with his autumnofthepatriarch insistence on shooting and shooting and missing and missing , was willing the sixers to victory bryant finished 7 of 26 from the floor , and the 76ers won for the first time this season , 10391 you took the trip two hours south from new york city in hopes of examining this laboratory experiment there are losing teams , like the knicks , who this season linger a couple of games under 500 and show flickers of genuine promise then there is the overwhelming , catastrophic state of loss that suggests a team so far removed from winning that its players and coaches appear nigh to being struck deaf and blind that team is the philadelphia 76ers \( note to connoisseurs of failure the 76ers actually initiated their losing streak in march last season they picked up that baton this fall , reaching 28 total losses in a row before the lakers ruined matters \) it s gonna be beautiful , bryant said of his final return home to philadelphia it really was n't what sets the 76ers apart is that loss is wrapped in the tinfoil of high hoop theory , known here as the process the owner of the sixers , the private equity investor josh harris , and the team president , sam hinkie , have turned losing into a cult , arguing that the seeds of a championship can be sown only in earth fertilized by the ashes of loss fail to win for long enough , goes this theory , trade enough veterans and collect enough young players and draft picks , and someday you will cultivate a transcendent player like kevin durant , lebron james or russell westbrook and he will lift the 76ers into the stratosphere of championship contention to this end , hinkie has sold off assets like cheap suits in 2014 , michael carterwilliams was awarded rookie of the year hinkie traded him for draft picks a center seemed handy please have him pick up his severance package analysts bow cautiously toward this cracked brilliance zach lowe , an incisive nba scribe , the sixers may be taking the first baby steps toward semirespectability he wrote that in december 2014 , and added that this uptick was driven by the development of three young players soon after , hinkie traded two of them soon after that , the 76ers commenced their epic losing streak harris , the owner , is a thoroughly modern plunger he has yet to build anything of value on the nba earth the team s television ratings are near flatlined most nights , wells fargo center is 70 percent full , the worst percentage among the league s arenas clumps of fans sit in the upper seats , like forlorn shepherds in their mountain fastness yet harris has more than doubled the value of his investment he and his fellow investors bought the team for about 280 million in 2011 four years later , the nba is thriving , and the team is worth 700 million , according to forbes life really is grand the sixers' kids have their moments their roster is chockablock with 21 and 22yearolds , and they are athletic \( forward robert covington , a genuine development league find , is 25 and the grand old man of this smoothcheeked crowd \) forward jerami grant , brother of the knicks guard jerian , was named the 76ers' player of the month for november he shot 41 percent in the month , and advanced metrics show he contributed less than a league average player whatever mazel tov hinkie s strategy could work , eventually , maybe find enough young , talented players and they might cohere their coach , brett brown , previously worked for the san antonio spurs , the harvard of the nba , and he is by all accounts an excellent teacher and strategist who relies on biometrics and science \( before the game , his assistants sat with players and pored over analytics on computer screens \) but more than half the roster has turned over since last year , and brown s threeyear record is 38 wins and 145 losses he carries the hard vowels of his native maine , and he speaks of his team s prospects with the honesty of a lobsterman steering into a nor'easter how long will it take to build a winner \? we 'd all be fooling ourselves if we did n't say this is going to take time , brown said after tuesday s win as far as putting a number and how many years does that mean , i do n't know hinkie has perhaps not helped his coach by pursuing his fixation with drafting exceptionally large players , preferably when coming off serious injuries in 2013 , he obtained nerlens noel , a 6foot11 young man with great athleticism and the wingspan of a pterodactyl noel missed his first year with a torn knee ligament he is an energetic shot blocker and rebounder , and not much of a shooter he spent the summer working on his touch so far this season , he is putting up the same 10 points and 8 rebounds and his shooting percentage has dropped precipitously in 2014 , hinkie drafted joel embiid , a 7foot cameroonian wunderkind embiid had already had surgery on his right foot , which caused him to miss his first season then he broke the same foot again his career has entered the shadow land of doubt in last summer s draft , hinkie again passed on young point guards his team has none worth the name and drafted his third very big man , taking the 6foot10 jahlil okafor okafor spent a year matriculating at duke coach mike krzyzewski s finishing school for insanely talented young men he has silken moves and a powerful body , and is averaging 17 points and 8 rebounds a game unfortunately , the 20yearold s offcourt growth has turned painful in october , he got into an argument outside a nightclub and had a gun stuck in his face last week , outside a bar in boston , according to video , he pushed a couple of people to the ground and threw a roundhouse punch he was also caught driving more than 100 miles per hour and used a fake id to cadge a drink these are not terminal problems those of us who did not act stupidly at age 19 should now raise our hands but the sixers lack a veteran presence who might sidle over to okafor , sling an arm around his shoulders and say yo , fool grow up so wednesday , the 76ers suspended okafor for two games and , without him , proceeded to lose to the knicks , 9987 , at madison square garden \( the 76ers have also assigned security to accompany okafor him on his nocturnal wanderings \) for philadelphia , there is also the problem of melding its collection of big men at a time when the nba is trending smaller and speedier and more athletic i'm tormented daily trying to make jahlil and nerlens coexist and make it work , brown acknowledged it s a challenge as it turned out , the game tuesday was entertaining after an ugly fashion , like a fifa soccer playin in which mediocre teams audition for the grownup league bryant began by sinking 3pointers and hitting a floater then his body reminded us that it was a 1975 buick with a balky transmission , and shut down passes went flying in errant directions shots were blocked big men kept finding themselves wide open under the basket in the second half , lakers center roy hibbert began shoving one , two , three 76ers players out of the lane he even gave a shove to a referee the referees conferred and , to the surprise of more or less everyone in the arena , they allowed hibbert to stay in the game perhaps they decided that was the greater punishment
just after 7 am on a sunny wednesday in june , a 61yearold woman darted in front of taxis in columbus circle outside central park a few seconds later , she proclaimed to no one , to everyone how great it was to be alive the woman , gisela mandl , wore a bright green tshirt , gray running shorts and white kneehigh compression socks she had just finished a 35minute run through the park and was starting an eightminute jaunt back to her apartment on west 48th street , where she would stretch , do pushups and situps , and enjoy a breakfast of steamed vegetables doused with balsamic vinegar and olive oil she was smiling this routine was nothing new mandl , who moved to new york from west germany in 1967 , said she had run , biked or swum every day at 6 30 am for the past 30 years wait every single day \? yes , i have , absolutely , mandl said her voice was soft and enchanting , as if she were forever narrating a nursery rhyme i remember once having , she continued the park was frozen i had to sit down and scoot down a hill on my heinie in here because there was no way to walk it but i would get myself up and get myself out and then go right back to bed that was in 1998 she has not been sick since , she said , save for seasonal sniffles from spring pollen mandl , who competes in olympicdistance triathlons and runs few road races because the start times are too late for her , also said she had never been injured she almost always runs alone on this june morning , the city was awake men and women walked to work , and the sun peered through skyscrapers but for mandl , the day , like any other , had started earlier , when she woke up at 5 , checked her email and wrote in a journal next she drank some coffee , stretched and ran to the uss maine monument in columbus circle at 6 27 , on the steps of the monument , mandl conceded that on some mornings , the start time for her run was pushed back because of an extra glass of wine the night before i have to live , you know \? she said not just for this then she grew restless all right , we better go because i'm on a timed schedule , she said , explaining that she had to return in time to catch a train to long island , where she works in the home of the del vecchio family , which controls the clothing company brooks brothers she coordinates schedules , recruits employees for the domestic staff , and schedules meetings and appointments , among other tasks should i lead the pace \? she asked , and then she was off her customary route starts at the monument , crosses over to the east side of the park and up to the reservoir , and goes along the west side back to the start on this morning , though , she ran an abbreviated route that cut through the park she still recognized people and their pets that s a big puppy ! mandl said as she ran past a large st bernard the owner he trains him with his harmonica when he starts to play the harmonica , the dog comes to him and does n't move from his side her pace usually settles around nine minutes per mile i'm not speedy gonzales , but i'm having a good time , said mandl , who has never run a marathon and it s all about having a good time , you know \? early in the run , she described how she biked to school and swam for fun as she grew up in the rolling hills of bavaria when she was 13 , her family moved to long island , she said , where she was introduced to mayonnaise , peanut butter and soda at 21 , because of a boyfriend , she began her lifelong pursuit of fitness he used to tease me about not being fit enough , mandl said now , at 21 , how could you not be fit \? everyone s fit at 21 and that inspired me somehow i made a decision for myself that nobody was ever going to say that to me again so i 've been doing it ever since her 20s were sprinkled with short runs on the beach , but her everydayfor30years routine did not begin until her early 30s she started running seriously when she met heinz r egger , a marathoner from switzerland with whom she worked at the swiss bank ubs in new york r egger , consulting his training log recently , found that they had completed their first run together on april 25 , 1989 i knew nothing about it , other than that it felt good , mandl said of the onemile jog at the end of it exhausted and hungry , she stopped at a deli on the way home and ate pasta mandl improved quickly within a month , r egger said , she was running an hour at a time and she has not stopped since she learned to run in the mornings when she was a student at fordham , majoring in combined social sciences it was the only time of the day when she could exercise , she said now , the runs are as ingrained into the day s fabric as , well , eating broccoli and asparagus for breakfast \( for breakfast ! her longtime friend melissa weisstuch said , incredulously \) mandl said some mornings , you know , long after i'm on my way to work , i 'll have to pause and say , did i run this morning \?

my father , michael eggers , was an ncaa division i men s basketball official for 41 years few , if any , officials have been able to say the same , or ever will after having officiated more than 2 , 000 games , he worked his final one , southern california at ucla , on march 4 my family was in attendance , wearing black and white , of course in february 2008 , i joined my father on the road for an especially grueling stretch of games three states and three conferences in three days there was texas am at missouri , then arizona state at arizona and finally pepperdine at portland i secured press credentials and , with his permission , documented what happened away from the ball this trip was my attempt to understand what it was like to go from arena to arena the charge that comes on the court , the aches from sprinting with athletes 30 years younger , the composure required in the clutch of a call , and the long stretches of monotony in between the final buzzer and the next tipoff , from the showers to the airport shuttle to another city , again and again what i found is that there are long , lonely stretches punctuated by a few hours of high adrenaline after all , the best officials are invisible and they are independent contractors no one wonders how they got there , or where they are going next they have no home court it is easy to vilify referees as arrogant and unfeeling , brazenly screwing up calls and shining their shoes to a cavalier gleam but that is certainly not the dad i have from early november through late march , for my entire life , my father was on the road calling home to danville , calif , from spokane one night , san diego the next to him , officiating was the ultimate responsibility , and one he never took lightly as the game has changed over the years the introduction of a shot clock , the addition of a third official and the advent of instant replay , among other changes his approach stayed the same he felt strongly about maintaining the flow of the game , keeping the emotion on the court in check and doing his best on behalf of the studentathletes i once saw him pat a player s back on senior night and say , it was an honor to watch you play the time he made his most damaging wrong call , he could not sleep for months while there was nothing that could be done to fix it , his remorse was deep and sincere as a child of a referee , you know the many merits of a fox 40 whistle most of all , they are loud like a junior high jock , he would blow his in the house to announce he was home or surprise my sister and me when we were doing our homework my sister and i are identical twins , but he always treated us like two teams on the court , as if following an ncaa handbook we instinctively knew better than to ever say , that s not fair because it always was his games were a huge part of our lives in the days before etickets , we would wait to see which airplane ticket arrived in the mail the official sign of which ncaa tournament games he had been assigned \( when teams are being picked for march madness , officials , too , are going through the same heartbreaking selection \) whenever we were in the stands , we followed his strict instructions no wearing either team s colors and no cheering surrounded by a swell of collegiate pride , among rival mascots , dueling brass sections and explosive tshirt guns , we would sit unmoved we would spend the ride home repeating all the insults people yelled , and dad loved hearing them all he has been hanged in effigy at oregon in the late 1970s , his beloved brown datsun 240z was put on blocks the advent of the internet introduced a lazier and less creative outlet for meanspirited fans for a time , he received hate mail from an anonymous email account but none of that ever fazed him he knows the fastest route from the airport to the back entrance of each arena by heart , along with the personnel who line the concrete hallways outside locker rooms as well as longtime fans who line the courts if there is a best hamburger spot in town , he knows that , too from observing my father on the court , i have learned about tolerance and composure like how to use a little bit of humor to get someone \( like a disgruntled coach \) back on your side how to stay focused in the midst of distraction and how to acknowledge a bad moment and move past it throughout the years , especially after i moved across the country , i have watched countless games on tv just so i could catch a glimpse of my father and feel a little closer to home during our trip together , i wanted to capture his legacy and show my appreciation , too , for the example he set even when he did not know i was watching , i was one thing was apparent , though i could hardly keep up with him
vienna the united states warned on monday , in both english and persian , that reached two months ago in switzerland must remain the basis for a final nuclear deal the warning appeared to reflect concerns among american and european negotiators that iran s supreme leader , ayatollah , has been attempting to backtrack on some crucial elements of the april agreement that was forged in lausanne , the lakeside resort near geneva we do see a path forward to get a comprehensive agreement that meets our bottom lines , said a senior united states official , who could not be identified under the ground rules for briefing reporters this path forward has to be based on the lausanne parameters period to reinforce the message , the official turned to an aide who repeated the message in farsi the united states and its negotiating partners are no longer trying to meet the original tuesday deadline for wrapping up a final accord yet american officials hope to conclude the agreement so it can be submitted by july 9 to congress , which would then begin a 30day review period no one is talking about a longterm extension of the negotiating deadline , the official said no one the briefing came during a break in the talks during which iran s foreign minister , mohammad javad zarif , spent the day in tehran in what appeared to be an effort to reconcile the terms of the prospective agreement with in which he seemed to back away from crucial elements of the april understanding , including how long iran s stockpile of nuclear fuel would be frozen and how free international inspectors would be to demand access to iranian military sites believed related to its  european and american officials expect mr zarif to return on tuesday , but it is unclear whether his instructions will be to strike a deal or not in a sign that the talks will intensify in coming days , the iranian news media reported that ali akbar salehi , the head of iran s atomic energy organization who has been ailing , would be accompanying mr zarif when he returns to the negotiations here mr salehi and ernest j moniz , the united states energy secretary , who is in vienna , had productive talks during the lausanne round , and mr salehi s absence had been seen as a potential obstacle mr zarif will also be joined by hossein fereydoun , a younger brother of president hassan rouhani , who was also present in lausanne , the iranian news media said the remaining issues concern the scope of inspections , what arrangements might restrict the development of more efficient types of centrifuges after the first decade of the accord , the pace of sanctions relief and how to address suspicions that iran has engaged in covert work on nuclear designs in previous years the senior american official discounted reports that the united states was seeking to renegotiate arrangements it agreed to in lausanne that would allow iran to use the underground installation it has built at for research instead of shutting it those provisions allow iran to keep 1 , 000 centrifuges in that installation , but only a small portion can be operated in cascades to produce isotopes and none can be used to enrich uranium for at least 15 years we are where we were in lausanne , the official said , referring to the fordo installation but the official declined to say if the united states might agree to adjust some elements of the lausanne framework in return for new iranian concessions we are building this understanding on the lausanne parameters , and i am not going to go further than that , the official said in response to a question i am not going to negotiate here one major issue of crucial importance to the iranians is the timing to suspend or remove economic sanctions while details remain to be worked out , it appears iran may use the two or more months needed to get the accord through congress , and the additional time it would take to pass a new united nations security council resolution , to begin storing its centrifuges and ridding itself of more than nine tons of lowenriched uranium that would speed the time it would take iran to quality for sanctions relief previously , iranian officials had said they would never ship the material out of the country , but it now looks like they may have no other choice , officials say it is not known whom mr zarif met with in tehran and whether he consulted with ayatollah khamenei but iran has a special council on nuclear issues , made up of top security and foreign affairs figures that oversees the negotiations and reports to the ayatollah mansur haqiqatpur , a senior iranian member of parliament , said that an agreement was possible if the americans stopped their bullying attitude the goal , he said , was to reach an accord by july 8 , he added , indicating that iran , like the obama administration , also had the united states congress in mind if a deal occurs later in the summer , the congressional review period would double to 60 days because of the august congressional recess that would give critics more time to try to drum up opposition to the agreement and also delay the time when sanctions on iran might be eased if the accord is enacted ayatollah khamenei has said that sanctions must be lifted quickly american officials denied iranian newspaper reports that has recently sent a letter to ayatollah khamenei urging him to pursue an agreement

dubuque , iowa as 1 , 800 madashell supporters jumped out of their seats and pumped their fists last sunday , senator of vermont delivered the message they had come to hear we will give these guys an offer they ca n't refuse , he shouted in the jampacked gym , vowing to bust up the banks , bring down the billionaire class and smash the political establishment so i welcome you all , he said , to the political revolution of 2015 the presidential election is , of course , in 2016 , but mr sanders can be forgiven for living in the moment by overtaking hillary rodham clinton in new hampshire in some polls and drawing tens of thousands of people to his events on the west coast , as well as thousands in iowa and nevada , mr sanders , 73 , has recaptured the enthusiasm that fueled the 2008 obama campaign , with tshirts that say feel the bern and show an image of floppy white hair and glasses replacing the famous image in the obama hope poster by  unlike that of mr obama , mr sanders s appeal is less about oratorical lift and finding common ground than about the opportunity his campaign gives disaffected democrats to vent their anger at the list of national ills they believe are caused by big business and its conservative allies and have been left unaddressed by president obama if mrs clinton s pitch to voters is that she can make the system more effective , mr sanders is arguing that mr obama was na ve to even bother with a system that needs to be fundamentally changed it is not a new message for mr sanders , , but the response is something unfamiliar for someone who has always had a sweepingly macro , if not entirely marxist , critique of america , having the largest crowds of the election cheering each description of income inequality , and each proposal to eradicate it , amounts to the validation of a career spent in relative obscurity mr sanders s grumpy demeanor , and his suspicion of all things feel good , are part of the attraction he s feeling the weight of wow , people really need this , ' jane sanders said after one of the seven appearances her husband made last weekend in iowa she said mr sanders was humbled by the success , remained as focused on the issues as ever , and does n't believe in the cult of personality yet when asked why mr sanders was attracting so many people , she added because if not now , when \? and if not him , who \? anybody else appears to be the answer of the democratic establishment yet while the candidate s own staff sees the immense challenges before them with a professional eye , mr sanders admits to no doubts and he treats any trespassers to his circle of believers accordingly when a gaggle of reporters corporate media in sanders parlance mentioned mrs clinton here , he snarled , that s the sport you guys like , meaning their focus on the kind of political questions he disdains when asked to reconcile his antiestablishment status with being a career politician , mr sanders , who except for two years has held political office continually since 1981 , glared at the young reporter who asked the question career politician \? he said to her with a disdainful laugh other questions mr sanders is clearly a different sort of political animal if the tradition is to campaign in poetry and govern in prose , mr sanders does both with a long list of bullet points written on a yellow legal pad he looks at when he speaks we 're going to practice democracy how s that \? he exclaimed to huge applause at the start of the dubuque event , before launching into an hourlong speech that left no time for questions in front of crowds , mr sanders dispenses with his biography as quickly as possible , introducing his wife , who waves back or shoots video on her iphone , and mentioning that he has kids and grandkids and a father who immigrated to america from poland with nothing he seems to go through the motions of reaching for the emotional connection that other candidates try to seize , referring to the joy of childbirth as extraordinary , unbelievable , ok , before quickly shifting to the dearth of family leave time for working women but the people do n't come to hear mr sanders s story they come for his analysis of what s gone wrong americans , mr sanders says , live under an oligarchy of billionaires , the koch brothers and walmart owners and wall street chieftains who conspire to keep the workingman down their information is dumbed down by a news media that avoids the issues , treats campaigns like soap operas and begs him to beat up on hillary clinton in iowa , where he is inching up in polls , the crowds nodded passionately as he cited the real unemployment level and bemoaned institutional racism and the starvation wages hobbling american workers already handicapped by international trade deals there were also mentions of republican attempts at voter suppression , which profoundly disgusts me , the increased oceanic acidity and rising temperatures that threatened the globe , as well as the pharmaceutical companies and enemies of who prey on the sick and elderly what s wrong with that picture \? he asked at another iowa appearance , and then proceeded to describe what life would be like under a sanders administration he would invest in enormous infrastructure projects that he said would create more than 10 million jobs he would expand , not shrink , , and move the united states to a single payer health care system legislation that he intends to propose or already has would automatically register anyone older than 18 to vote , kick private corporations out of the prison business , make public college tuition free , guarantee sick and paid family leave and a couple of weeks paid vacation to workers he would break up the banks that are too big to fail , keep us out of any more wars and pay for much of his spending program with a tax on wall street trading the middle class and working class bailed you out , he bellowed now it s your turn as for the critique that none of these proposals is remotely plausible given the political realities in washington , the sanders campaign argues that the nightmare scenario of a democratic president with a republican congress would never happen it is an unlikely outcome to have bernie sanders elected president and to keep the congress in its current composition , said jeff weaver , his campaign manager , explaining a sort of fantasy scenario or , as mr sanders put it at a labor meeting in clinton , iowa without a revolution , forget about it , nothing s going to happen and that , he says , was the problem with mr obama while mr sanders offered congratulations to iowa for having the courage to vote for an africanamerican in 2008 , he said one of his mistakes that mr obama made after winning with a movement behind him was then saying , i 'll take it from here what obama should have known and what i know , mr sanders said , is that wealthy vested interests were too powerful for any one person to take on it was around then that fred bowes a 77yearold democrat , walked out of an event in boone everything he said is true , mr bowes said implementing what he says is next to impossible that is a dissenting view among the crowds at mr sanders s rallies and events , where he welcomes gushing comparisons to franklin delano roosevelt bernie , bernie , bernie , the crowd of sanders supporters chanted as the senator approached the entrance of iowa state fair as mr sanders made his way toward the fair s famous soapbox stage , mitchell wear , who had come from columbus to hear mr sanders speak , was able to shake his hand oh my god , that was awesome , mr wear said as the entourage made its way past pork chop , capreseonastick and fried cheese curd stands back in burlington after the weekend , mr sanders called his close friend richard sugarman , a university of vermont professor of jewish philosophy and selfdescribed biblical socialist mr sugarman said he grilled the candidate on whether he had eaten a pork chop \( i did n't , mr sanders , who is also jewish , assured him \) , listened to mr sanders confide that this celebrity stuff is strange , and discussed how far he s come his enthusiasm is growing mr sugarman said , because people are responsive to what he is saying in a larger venue than has ever been the case before , and probably because they agree with him
