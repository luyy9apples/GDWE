good king wenceslas looked out on the feast of stephen when the snow lay round about , deep and crisp and even feast of stephen \? those lines from a christmas carol exhaust what most of us know about the feast of st stephen in the church calendar followed by roman catholics , anglicans and some other branches of western christianity , the feast falls today , the day after christmas in the eastern orthodox churches , st stephen s day is tomorrow , dec 27 about stephen himself , it is easy to know a lot more his story is told in great detail in chapters 6 and 7 of the new testament s book of acts he is considered the first christian martyr , a follower of jesus who , like his departed master , was accused of blasphemy and in due course stoned to death but why celebrate his memory now , in conjunction with the story of the baby born in bethlehem \? it would be logical , if going by the account in acts , to place his feast sometime after pentecost , when the jewish followers of jesus first began to preach and organize the embryonic movement that would eventually break with the judaism of their day and form a distinct body of christian believers actually , the story of stephen is filled with lessons about the divisions that afflicted that body from the very first no sooner had the number of believers in jesus begun to grow than , acts reports , the hellenists complained against the hebrews the hellenists were jewish converts to the jesus movement who spoke greek and were attached to the wider hellenistic culture the hebrews were the aramaicspeaking majority the division was possibly theological as well as cultural , reflecting a division among jews at that time between those insisting on the temple as the sole place of jewish sacrifice and those challenging the temple s centrality and , as so often , the division was also practical and financial the hellenist christians did not think that their needy were getting a fair share of the new community s common goods in these circumstances , the community s leaders devised a creative solution rather than ejecting the complaining hellenist minority , they chose seven men of good standing , full of the spirit and of wisdom stephen most prominent among them to assure that the needs of the hellenist minority were met in other words , the first christians recognized that preserving a united community required admitting a legitimate pluralism cultural differences and even theological differences about temple worship could be subordinated to a more basic belief in jesus unfortunately , stephen s story illustrates another division that had a far less happy ending , the split between the incipient jesus movement and the jewish milieu from which it emerged on the one hand , stephen s aggressive preaching inflamed jewish ire , and the tolerance toward the new sect previously urged by the pharisee gamiliel gave way to active persecution on the other hand , stephen s demise contributed to christian antijudaism tragically , his dying prayer of forgiveness for those who stoned him , as recorded in acts , had less resonance in christian tradition than the earlier passages in which he echoed biblical rebukes of a stiffnecked people that had persecuted its own prophets rebukes stephen applied to the death of jesus but none of this explains why stephen s feast occurs today some people , of course , might latch on to the fact that in the middle ages , according to the oxford dictionary of saints , st stephen was invoked against headaches that explanation , alas , turns out to be circular was the healer of hangovers appropriately commemorated in the wake of christmas revelry \? or did the saint then commemorated become the help of the hung over \? the golden legend , a medieval compilation of lore , both factual and fanciful , about christian saints and feasts , had a lot to say not only about st stephen s martyrdom and miracles but also about the recovery of his body early in the fifth century , a priest near jerusalem claimed to have been directed by a vision to stephen s tomb , and the remains found there were ceremoniously transported to the city with remarkable precision , the compiler of the golden legend , jacobus de voragine , a 13thcentury dominican friar who became archbishop of genoa , recorded that st stephen was martyred on the morning of aug 3 in the year of jesus' death and that the saint s remains were recovered \( almost four centuries later \) on the very same day blessed jacobus , as he has been known since being beatified in 1816 by pope pius vii , offers several reasons that the church set the saint s feast in christmas week rather than on aug 3 , william granger ryan noted in his translation of the golden legend \( princeton university press , 1993 \) none are truly convincing but one is at least memorable it links st stephen s day with the two feast days that follow it , first of st john the evangelist and then of the holy innocents slain by king herod the key , jacobus says , is to be found in a line of the song of songs , my beloved is white and ruddy , chosen out of thousands in one of those imaginative interpretations of sacred texts that only medievals and french poststructuralists can fathom , jacobus explains that white refers to john the evangelist , whom tradition considered not only jesus' beloved apostle but also the only apostle not to die a martyr , while ruddy refers to the martyred stephen and thousands refers to the multitude of holy innocents ! by grouping these three feasts together and associating them with christ s birth , he continues , the church is marking three kinds of martyrdom those like stephen who choose to die for a cause and so meet their death , those like john who choose to die for a cause but never actually do so , and those like the holy innocents who die for a cause without a choice that grouping really does provoke reflection not only about religious martyrdom , very much a reality in today s world , but also about bravery and sacrifice of all sorts men and women who risk their lives for others and pay the ultimate price , men and women who risk their lives but fortunately survive , and men and women \( and children \) whose lives are risked and lost in the course of worthy struggles but without their own consent perhaps they should all come to mind as the world looks out on this strangely dated feast of stephen
cambridge , mass for 60 years a puzzling group of dingy terracotta sculptures lay around the fogg art museum at harvard university a few were displayed in an outoftheway gallery most were perched on storage shelves , even though they were connected to works by gian lorenzo bernini \( 15981680 \) , the great sculptor and architect of the roman baroque they were 18inchhigh sketches for bronze figures in st peter s basilica and for huge marble angels alighting on the ponte sant'angelo , the bridge over the tiber that leads to the vatican during decades of pareddown modernism , nothing could have been less fashionable than the swirling excess of these sculptures and they posed daunting questions what was their relation to bernini \? were they working sketches , presentation models or templates \? who made them , the master himself or any one of the many artists in his studio \? last year , anticipating the 400th anniversary of bernini s birth , ivan gaskell , the fogg s curator of paintings , sculpture and decorative arts , and colette czapski hemingway , an andrew w mellon intern at the museum , organized a seminar , confronting bernini , to investigate these little statues and reliefs the fogg s new installation , gian lorenzo bernini sketches in clay , grew from research and ideas generated at that seminar it was a collaborative effort we examined all aspects of these sketches , mr gaskell explained in a recent interview arthistorical issues , like attribution issues involving conservation and display we wanted to address questions of how we look at these 17thcentury objects at the end of the 20th century we look at them as works of art in their own right , it turns out , works that speak to our own time the sculptures retain all the roughness of process , an almost transparent working out of ideas viewed from the back , they become abstract compositions even their subject matter , angels , touches a findemillennium obsession during the 17th century , the catholic church reacted powerfully against protestantism , with its refutation of the eucharist , its anticlerical doctrines of unmediated prayer catholic theologians called upon angels , celestial intermediaries in art they flew into action everywhere , even targeting , literally , saints like st teresa her ecstatic vision of an angel piercing her breast with a flametipped arrow formed the subject for one of bernini s most brilliant and suggestive sculptural and architectual compositions bernini , a devout man of enormous physical appetites , embodied in his art the defensive , urgently dramatic and sensual imagery of the counter reformation he worked , supervising his enormous workshop \( saving parts of projects for himself \) until he was well into his 70 s , and his architecture and sculpture transformed and defined 17thcentury rome with noble families and popes as his patrons , bernini built fountains , churches , chapels within churches he painted he produced lavish entertainments , designing their sets and costumes , devising special effects and writing their texts but , above all , he considered himself a sculptor the exhibition begins with a fragment , a bozzetto , or clay sketch , for the head of st jerome bernini made it when he was in his 60 s for a chapel in the siena cathedral belonging to the family of the chigi pope alexander vi he carved the marble of st jerome himself , basing it on the laocoon , the classical sculpture that had been excavated in 1506 in rome and had come to emblemize suffering mr gaskell suggests that the head might be a selfportrait st jerome translated the bible into latin bernini portrays him repentant , atoning for the sin of intellectual pride , a sin the artist might have felt that he , too , had committed the head is placed on a partition that blocks the view of the rest of the gallery , which is painted a deep teal each statue is lighted theatrically , and at first the space is disorienting we wanted to produce a sense of bewilderment , mr gaskell explained , to convey the complexity of these sketches indeed , the exhibition suggests the devices bernini himself used to lure skeptical worshipers and reveal to them mysteries and miracles an inspired theatrical manipulation of scale and space , an unabashed range and intensity of emotion , a gale of faith to blow away doubt under the bright lights , the freshly cleaned clay surfaces glow like flesh adam , in hebrew , means earth or clay , and quotations from job and the greek historian hesiod silkscreened on the gallery s walls remind visitors of the ancient idea of divine artisans angels are displayed in groups of three and four , slightly above eye level , at the height of the pedestals they were placed on while they were being modeled most sketches and finished works were intended to be seen from below two of the statues have been gilded one bears traces of bronze paint these were modelli , works presented to patrons to give them a sense of the final product the exhibition also includes a newly acquired bronze presentation piece almost certainly cast from a lost clay modello
the big election issue in burgville was the meals tax would the people approve a tax on restaurant meals to help pay for building schools \? burgville s cry of no ! was resounding i knew it would be , so i voted for it voting to be taxed so burgville youth could get an education and amount to something made me feel not only like a good citizen , but also like a wonderful human being knowing the tax had n't a chance of passage doubled the satisfaction with which i cast the vote burgville elections are always rife with certainties everybody always knows for certain that congressman frank buckner will be reelected , as he was on tuesday he s republican nothing but republicans have been elected in burgville , or within a radius of 200 miles , since the weather bureau began keeping records i figured buckner a good bet to get 75 percent of the vote , and , being a student of history , i know that when a politician gets 75 percent of the vote it often goes to his head and , sooner or later , he starts behaving like lyndon johnson or caligula so , though buckner has actually been perfectly acceptable , as congressmen go , i voted against him as a matter of abstract principle some show of opposition was important , i thought , possibly to save burgville from the caprices of tyranny i remember reading that caligula made his horse a consul of rome or was it associate emperor \? it s not important what the office was it s the horse of the matter that interests me that s because burgville is surrounded by horses and all the paraphernalia that goes with them hounds , foxes , saddles , bourbon , chukkas of polo , people so devoted to their horses that they hitch horse carriers to their pickups and take them out for sunday drives in the country is it inconceivable that in this venue a tyrant hardened by incessantly winning 75 percent of the vote might make his horse mayor of burgville \? yes , i guess it is if we are talking of sedate frank buckner in his neatly pressed , but not ostentatiously customtailored , middleofthe roadrepublican , not rightwingnut , suits still , all this burgville certainty there s something unhealthy about it so i voted for the democrat , even though his campaign literature disclosed an alarming amount of time spent in divinity schools republicans are bad enough about confusing gospel and politics why encourage the habit in democrats \? if he had had a chance of winning , i might have reconsidered the wisdom of voting against buckner , and never mind the threat of tyranny since , however , nobody could recall a democrat ever winning anything in burgville , i felt safe in acting on my intellectual grasp of history , and voted democratic such is the comfort of political life in burgville here a person can always vote the way a good citizen ought to vote and be certain that the majority of the electorate will never let him suffer the consequences televised experts in faraway cities droned on far past 10 30 , when jock s exxon down the block closes for the night i nodded by the tube as the silence of downtown burgville s empty streets deepened outside and televised experts filled the house with expert talk about significance several experts , not the least grateful to have the 1998 ordeal behind them , launched into the politics of the year 2000 several were certain who the republican candidates would be no expert suggested the arresting possibility that their year 2000 nominees might forgo a crack at the white house rather than have their sex lives fully investigated , an ordeal that all presidential candidates will have to face for a while to come i thought certain that burgville s unbeatable frank buckner would have nothing to fear on the scandal front , but none of the experts seemed to think he was presidential timber newt gingrich and trent lott began appearing on various channels looking stunned and pretending to calmness about their unhappy day in burgville , all had been certainty for hours , for days , for years there would be no new tax on dinner at johnson s charcoal beef house at midnight i pushed the button that closed the turbulent story of democracy with its poisonous commercials and slimy millions squalor , squalor everywhere but in burgville , certainty
it s the law of the political jungle spin or be spun and throughout the 10 months of the lewinsky investigation , kenneth w starr s spin has been that he has none he has portrayed himself as the image of rectitude , comparing himself with joe friday in his devotion to just the facts yesterday viewers who knew him only as the man with the inappropriate grin walking to his car each day finally saw what those who have watched him in court had suggested he can calmly talk circles around his opponents and while that s not a bad quality in a lawyer , it makes for bland television , the primary arena in which the impeachment process is being played out mr starr s daylong televised testimony before the house judiciary committee forms a natural bookend to president clinton s fourhour videotaped deposition it was a battle between mr clinton , a master of image making , and mr starr , whose own supporters concede him to be one of the least adept practitioners of the art of spin after all , joe friday is a camp figure of fun , and choosing him as a role model reveals how outoftouch the starr approach to public relations has been far from abandoning his passiveaggressive approach to spin yesterday mr starr emphasized it in his prepared statement i am not a man of politics , of public relations , or of polls which i suppose is patently obvious by now , he said , reinforcing his image as a man of no glitz , yet ignoring some harsh facts he is , of course , caught up in a fierce political and public relations war as for polls , someone must have told him that in the drumbeat leading up to yesterday s meeting , commentators were wondering whether mr starr s appearance could boost his singledigit ratings , as the catchphrase for his approval numbers became we go to court and not on the talk show circuit , mr starr also said in his statement , though his spokesman , charles bakaly , was all over the talk show circuit the night before during the committee meeting , representative zoe lofgren , democrat of california , reminded mr starr that he himself had appeared on good morning america that day it s true , of course , that mr starr has largely avoided public comments , and the flaws in his nospin spin have been obvious in the pithy phrase of nbc news s lisa myers , mr starr s task yesterday was to prove he was not the sexcrazed , outofcontrol prosecutor and though no one really expected to see a red tail poking out from beneath the witness chair , mr starr s opponents probably took heart from the opening minutes of the session while the democrats complained about the fairness of the process , the cameras stayed on mr starr , who looked pale , almost spooky in his sternness that demonic impression passed quickly as he read his twohour statement , reiterating his original report to the house in a uninflected manner even when the language gave him an opportunity to create fireworks , he did n't that was untrue , he said of the president s statements several times , creating a refrain but in mr starr s quiet voice it came out singsongy , not commanding or dramatic \( imagine what a jesse jackson or even a henry hyde might have done with the same chant \) but if he did n't do himself much good , mr starr did not do himself serious damage , either when it was time for the committee members to question him , the meeting came nowhere near the brawl some commentators had predicted the limit of five minutes for each member s questions turned many of the democrats into speedtalkers even the most pointed hostile questions \( and most were alarmingly unfocused \) gave mr starr a chance to restate his evidence and conclusions you may disagree , and you may have another judgment , he politely said while defending his office and like a true politician sometimes answering a different question from the one that was asked why did your office violate the law \? representative jerrold nadler , democrat of manhattan , asked mr starr about the treatment of monica s lewinsky when she was first questioned ms lewinsky has said she was discouraged from calling a lawyer mr starr said she was not did anyone expect him to say anything else \? only at the end of the day , when mr starr was questioned by david e kendall , the president s personal lawyer , did the questions become pointed enough to challenge mr starr s unflappable demeanor the prediction that mr kendall and mr starr would be wellmatched legal adversaries was the one prediction that turned out to be true as mr kendall guestioned mr starr about matters like leaks to the press from his office and his legal firm s links to the paula jones case , mr starr often responded like a defendent rather than an unflappable witness their exchange proved there is still drama left in the impeachment inquiry , though it is usually obscured by political posturing the day before , in a statement about the committee process that quickly became a favorite soundbite , representative maxine waters , democrat of california , said , if it goes on the way it s going now , it will be great theater , but it will have nothing to do with a fair process of trying to get the truth it was n't great theater , and the choice is not either or , theater or fairness the theatrical component has become inescapable , however much mr starr pretends to ignore that what yesterday s largely uneventful day proved is that joe friday s days as a television hero have passed
auburn hills , mich , may 9 two days after announcing a merger with daimlerbenz ag , the chairman of the chrysler corporation predicted at a news conference today that the auto industry would continue its global consolidation and said that auto makers were engaged in half a dozen talks going on right now for further deals robert j eaton , chrysler s chairman and chief executive , declined to identify the companies involved , and indicated that many of the negotiations had already been reported you 've seen enough of them , you 've been reporting about a number of them i may know a little more than you , but not a lot , mr eaton said at chrysler s headquarters here in a northern suburb of detroit the daewoo corporation of south korea has said for months that it is trying to sell a large stake to general motors corporation kia motors corporation , also in south korea , is bankrupt and has been discussing mergers with other korean auto makers and has been seeking to persuade ford motor company to increase its 9 percent stake volkswagen reached a deal on thursday to buy rollsroyce plc , trumping a previous bid by bmw the number of truly independent auto makers in the world has been dropping for years , as big multinational corporations have bought all or part of such famous names as aston martin , rover , jaguar and mazda chrysler itself has been in negotiations with various auto makers in recent years , but mr eaton said that none of these talks ever involved a deal as broad as this week s planned merger with daimlerbenz , which makes mercedesbenz cars and trucks mr eaton will jointly run the merged company to be called daimlerchrysler with jurgen e schrempp , chairman of daimlerbenz in interviews this week , auto executives said that mediumsized auto makers like bmw , volvo , fiat and honda all might be involved in mergers in the coming months or years mr eaton also said today that mercedes would cancel its plans to introduce its own minivan , and that americanmade dodge ram fullsize pickup trucks would soon be sold through mercedes truck dealerships in south america and africa
with the city s strong economy providing an opportunity for largess , mayor rudolph w guiliani pledged yesterday that the city would contribute 65 million over the next three years to help pay for a major expansion project at the museum of modern art the money , part of the capital budget proposal the mayor will propose today for fiscal year 1999 , represents about 10 percent of the modern s 650 million capital campaign heralding the modern as one of new york city s greatest cultural resources , the mayor announced his financialaid plan in the musuem s sleek , sixthfloor boardroom , standing amid a series of colorful andy warhol prints of marilyn monroe the modern announced in december that it had hired yoshio taniguchi , a japanese architect , to design its expansion and renovation , which is scheduled to begin in 2000 and be completed in time for the museum s 75th anniversary in 2004 besides nearly doubling the modern s exhibition space to 650 , 000 square feet , the expansion will add new facilities for education , research , retail and storage facing a huge price tag , trustees from the museum s expansion committee , including david rockefeller , donald marron , the chairman of paine webber inc , and the real estate developer jerry speyer approached the giuliani administration mr rockefeller , whose mother , abby aldrich rockefeller , was a founder of the modern , said the city money was the financial cornerstone of the expansion of the remaining 585 million the museum must raise , he said that about 200 million had been pledged by the family and trustees then he quickly added a qualifier when i say family , i mean the museum family , not my family mr giuliani justified the city s contribution , saying that the museum expansion would provide its own economic benefits the reason for this investment is that the city makes its investment back in about two years , he said the rewards would come from the increased economic activity sparked by the modern s expansion although such indirect economic benefits are notoriously difficult to predict and are open to wide interpretation , the modern said that its expansion project would create between 1 , 800 and 1 , 900 permanent jobs at the museum and in the hotel , restaurant , retail and service industries the figures come from a study conducted for the modern by george wachtel of audience research and analysis the modern s expansion , which would also create construction jobs , is expected to increase museum attendance to 25 million a year from 15 million now , the study said many are tourists who , the modern s research shows , come to new york city expressly to visit the museum mr rockefeller said the city would gain in other ways of the benefits to the city , he said , none will be greater than the impact on education indeed , with the expansion , the modern said it would be able to serve every public school in the five boroughs with visits , gallery tours , lectures and other programs the modern now works with about 450 of the city s roughly 1 , 100 schools the mayor also cited benefits to schoolchildren as justification for the 65 million grant someone could say , 'why not spend this on schools \? ' he said for some young people , this could be even more important than school but city councilman herbert e berman , a democrat from brooklyn who is chairman of the council s finance committee , criticized the mayor for his generosity to a private institution when he was proposing a cut in the budget of cityrun cultural institutions the first draft of the mayor s budget included an 11 percent cut for the city s department of cultural affairs these are very important qualityoflife services run by the city of new york , he said , and it would seem to me that before we start giving money to noncity institutions , we should look to restore dollars to the cityoperated cultural institutions , libraries and parks and among private institutions , mr berman said he could see no reason for singling out the museum of modern art there is a peculiarity here that has to be dealt with , he said all of our cultural institutions also generate enormous revenues for the city of new york , also are major tourist attractions but schuyler g chapin , the city s commissioner of cultural affairs , said yesterday that this was not a cause for concern , and suggested that the final budget for fiscal 1999 would be more generous to the arts than the draft between the announcement of the mayor s budget and june , the department of cultural affairs will find itself in a pretty good condition , he predicted the capital grant to the modern is just a proposal , but mr guiliani said that by june , i'm sure it will be an absolute reality unlike the controversial idea of aiding a new baseball stadium with city money , which would divert tax money that has been going into the general operating budget , the mayor s pledge to the modern would use money from the city s capital budget that budget , which is generally for major longterm projects , is financed through borrowing mr chapin said the city similarly contributes to capital projects of other private cultural institutions like the brooklyn academy of music , usually providing about 10 percent of the cost for the modern , which has received such grants in the past , 65 million is the largest amount ever

with the smell of simmering collard greens in the air , thomas w bayley jr sat at the counter of a soul food diner in the south bronx on a recent morning and launched into a nonstop recitation of the history of black candidates in the republican party the republican party started as the party that was against slavery , said mr bayley , a 44yearold retired postal worker and a commanding figure , a hulking man dressed in a black leather jacket , brown leather boots and dark glasses i respect the history of the party and that s why i'm running mr bayley , who says he does no persontoperson street or subway campaigning but relies instead on the internet to get his message to voters , is the republican candidate for congress in the district represented by congressman jose e serrano , a democrat it is a district in which registered democrats outnumber republicans by a ratio of 13 to 1 and where mr serrano , an eightyear incumbent , beat his republican opponent two years ago with 96 percent of the vote , to 3 percent nonetheless , mr bayley insists that he will persevere , all the while staring in the face of almost certain defeat and he is by no means alone there are scores of candidates throughout the city in races that their most stalwart supporters acknowledge are the longest of shots and that more detached observers describe as utterly hopeless while there are a number of competitive races in the november general election throughout new york city , they tend to be the exception rather than the rule most local elections are effectively decided in the september primary in fact , when asked , many of the democratic incumbents in strongly democratic territories could not even name their republican opponent in the general election still , challengers abound , and their motives are varied some insist that , despite the history , demography and the politics of their respective district , they can actually win others say they have been prompted by a particular issue over which they differ passionately with the stronger opponent for some of these candidates , there is personal gratification from getting exposure , from people paying even a modest amount of attention , said john h mollenkopf , director of the center for urban research at the city university of new york s graduate center some people do it because some senior party official asks them to and some do it because surprising vulnerabilities can emerge in the campaign of the strong , longtime officials they run against terence d tolbert , a political consultant who works with democratic candidates , put it differently there are always some candidates out there who feel that , if they keep hitting their heads against the wall , the wall might actually give way one day , he said these candidates suggest , however , that they harbor no such ambitions instead , several say , they are motivated by ideology for example , on staten island , eugene v prisco , 55 , a public school teacher and counselor , said that he so deeply resented criticism of the teachers' union by representative vito j fossella jr , a republican , that he felt compelled to accept an invitation by staten island democratic leaders to run against the congressman he consistently bashes teachers and the teachers' union , said mr prisco , a whitehaired man with a goatee who speaks with the fervor of an evangelist

houston , dec 30 the 27yearold woman who gave birth to octuplets this month said today as she was about to be released from the hospital that she was not the least bit upset when doctors told her she was to have so many , many babies quite the contrary i was so thankful to god because it is what i had prayed for , the woman , nkem chukwu , said at st luke s episcopal hospital i was so excited i wanted to have as many babies as god would give me the giving began on dec 8 , when ms chukwu , a nigerianborn american citizen , gave birth to her first daughter , ebuku , and continued on dec 20 with the births of two sons and five more daughters the smallest of the babies , odera , just 103 ounces at birth , died of heart and lung failure on sunday shortly before she returned to her home in houston for further recuperation , ms chukwu had her first public appearance at the adjacent texas children s hospital , where the surviving seven babies remain listed in critical , but stable , condition at the same news conference , doctors said the babies continued to do well and were now expected not only to survive but also to be at home with their parents within three months , around the time of ms chukwu s original due date there were still dangers , the doctors warned , and reverses were possible three of the infants , ebuku , gorom and ikem , remain on a ventilator , doctors said , but the four others , echerem , chidi , chima and jioke , are breathing on their own and two took their first feedings of their mother s breast milk this morning the most important issue over the coming weeks and months will be getting all the babies off the ventilator and taking their mother s milk , probably with the help of a breast pump , said dr patti savrick , the babies' chief pediatrician an important milestone was reached on tuesday , when pediatricians examined all seven infants and found that none were suffering from cranial bleeding , a common condition among premature infants we 're feeling better and better about the babies as time goes on , dr savrick said right now , i think , we 're going to discharge seven pretty good babies seated in a wheelchair between her husband , iyke louis udobi , a respiratory therapist , and her mother , janet chukwu , a weary ms chukwu insisted that everyone in the room stand for a prayer before the news conference could begin and repeatedly said it was her faith in the bible and her trust in god that brought her through the long , difficult pregnancy it was n't easy , she said the birth of the chukwu octuplets , as well as other recent multiple births , has revived ethical concerns among many doctors over the proper use of the advanced fertility drugs used by ms chukwu and others , especially since so many of the babies in multiple births do not survive or suffer lifelong health problems a technique promoted by many doctors involves injecting some of the embryos in the womb with a drug to stop them from growing , allowing the remaining embryos a better chance of survival and good health this selective reduction option was offered to ms chukwu , when doctors first thought she was carrying six or perhaps seven embryos , but she rejected it and insisted on carrying all of her babies as long as she could today , she said she did not regret that decision i could not find such words in my bible , so i rejected it , she said i told them i was n't going to do it i was n't even going to give it a thought , not a second thought dr brian kirshon , her doctor , said he had advised ms chukwu to take it easy when she returned home i have advised slow integration back into normal life , dr kirshon said she s going to have to slowly walk greater distances , obviously no heavy lifting , limited activity each day she will be able to do a little more mr louis said the family had been talking to several prospective agents since the births , but had not yet decided which to hire only then , though , will the family decide on whether the babies will take part in television programs or commercial ventures , he said no photographs or videotapes of them have been released by the family photo nkem chukwu at her first public appearance yesterday since giving birth to octuplets this month ms chukwu appeared with her husband , iyke louis udobi , after being released from the hospital in houston \( f carter smith for the new york times \)
in 1997 , jakob dylan s band , the wallflowers , sold four million copies of its second album , bringing down the horse led by the hit single one headlight , it stayed in the top 10 for most of the year and , sustained by the single three marlenas , the album is still on the radio thirtyfive years after the release of his first album , bob dylan , jakob dylan s father , was all over the news deathscare headlines circled the globe in may when he was hospitalized for a heart infection in september , he performed for the pope in bologna , italy in october , he released time out of mind , his first album of original songs in seven years , to universal critical acclaim in december , he was honored at the kennedy center in washington this confluence of circumstances prompted a major metropolitan daily to send out calls to various theyshouldknows asking if in 35 years jakob dylan would loom as large as his father does today why should he \? it s a dumb question it s also irrelevant because so much money is at stake , pop music seems to be about careers but beneath the surface , perhaps on the level where the money is made , pop music is really about a social fact at any moment , anyone might have something to say that the whole country , even the whole world , might want to hear , and maybe only one such thing the ruling values of pop music might seem to be situated in the accumulation of fame and riches they might be found in the way a song can turn your day around and then disappear a singer reaches you with a song he or she has no responsibility to reach you with another one , and you have no responsibility to respond if he or she tries heard or overheard , a song on the radio , in a bar , hummed by someone standing next to you in line diverts you from the path your day has taken for an instant , it changes you but you can forget about it as surely as you may feel shadowed until you hear it again or , rather , you may try to forget about it you may not be allowed to a hit song you do n't like is an oppressive mystery granted that almost every female person of my acquaintance considers jakob dylan the cutest thing currently walking on two legs , what was he doing dully offering one headlight until spring turned into fall \? it was like watching someone do a jigsaw puzzle with four pieces , over and over again as omnipresent hit singles go , one headlight was too flat to be more than a mild headache , and of course you could always change the station it takes a great single , like hanson s mmmbop , the most ubiquitous record of last year , to produce a migraine you need a piece of music so deliriously catchy , so insidiously marvelous , that you ca n't change the station , a song you ca n't stop hearing even if you turn the radio off that was the story in a skit built around hanson s recent appearance on saturday night live the three teenage hanson brothers enter an elevator suddenly two terrorists \( the guest host helen hunt and the cast member will ferrell \) rush in , shut the door and hold the boys at gunpoint mmmbop has driven them insane , and they want nothing less for hanson earplugs in place , the terrorists stop the elevator between floors , put mmmbop on a cd player set to repeat , and wait it takes only an hour or so for the first hanson to crack his mouth jerks up in a horrible grin a few hours later a second hanson succumbs the third just keeps on happily tapping his feet mr ferrell takes out his earplugs a smile spreads over his face , and he too begins to move realizing he s gone over to the other side , ms hunt has no choice but to execute him on the spot that s one way to settle the mystery of a hit single but some singles , like the wallflowers' current three marlenas , are mysteries that intensify until they finally float off the airwaves and disappear into the air the song walks in and out of the struggles of people who have no money and expect none jakob dylan plays the simplest cadence on his guitar , never varying it a piping organ makes the people you 're hearing about seem bigger than their small lives , even heroic then all the orchestration falls away , and only the guitar is left , counting off the time the whole piece pauses , and the singer says the hell with it he s going to get a car and drive it , with the top down and the radio on the eavesdropping tone of his descriptions of other people is replaced by a bitterly casual james dean vehemence i'm going right out of state , mr dylan says now , i ai n't looking back until i'm going right through heaven s gate he stretches the word heaven as far as it will reach he bets all he has on that word and the next , but without tipping his hand though his face remains impassive , the phrase heaven s gate works as a magnet , pulling in metaphors from every direction , filling up the hole that has opened in the music the hole is filled with 39 members of heaven s gate , the seekers who killed themselves last march , well after three marlenas was recorded but before it reached the radio and stuck there it is filled with genesis 28 17 , where jacob , in terror , dreams his way up his ladder to the gate of heaven and with hark ! hark ! the lark at heaven s gate sings , from the seduction song in shakespeare s cymbeline mr dylan s song is filled with the slowly building disaster of the 1980 michael cimino movie about the johnson county war , where heaven s gate were words painted on a tented roller rink in sweetwater , wyo , in 1892 in that roller rink , for what it s worth , the musician tbone burnett , the onetime bob dylan accompanist who produced the wallflowers' bringing down the horse \( interscope \) , was the leader of the film s heaven s gate band merely working in culture , with all questions of intent moot , jakob dylan has called up these metaphors with his song weighted by events he could never have foreseen and analogues he may never have known , he creates the sense that wherever the singer in his song is going , he is n't coming back it s as if he expects to find heaven s gate closed and even hopes it will be , so he can drive right through it and break it down listening , you can almost see it happen , but the picture wo n't come into focus so you listen harder every time you come across the song , wanting nothing more than to go all the way into the mystery it has presented , until finally you just get tired of trying the day comes when you find the song playing and you hear nothing at all like so many singles , the record has gone back where it came from , wherever that is photo jakob dylan i'm going right through heaven s gate \( ebet roberts \)
st louis last summer , wall street feared trans world airlines was headed for yet another emergency landing in bankruptcy court its third since 1992 speculation about bankruptcy has evaporated , though , as twa scored impressive gains in efficiency and pulled off a string of refinancing deals that raised nearly 225 million memories of the stillunexplained explosion of flight 800 off long island in 1996 have faded and after twa reported thirdquarter earnings that were the best since 1989 , its stock soared more than 60 percent , and several analysts added it to their buy lists on monday , the shares were unchanged at 115625 but do n't mistake wall street s relief for longterm optimism the company is expected to report a fourthquarter loss this month moreover , it will end 1997 a year in which other airlines rode the strong economy and low fuel prices to record profits deeply in the red twa can survive , but will it prosper \? we still have to prove we can make money , acknowledged gerald l gitner , the lanky , balding 52yearold texan who has led the recovery since being named chairman and chief executive late in 1996 to gain financial altitude , twa will have to confound the industry experts once the nation s biggest airline , it is now no 7 , just ahead of southwest the common wisdom is that there is no such thing as a lucrative niche for a relatively small carrier like twa that is saddled with entrenched unions and the hubandspoke structure of the industry giants and in an industry where there is constant talk of mergers and of deals like last month s alliance of continental and northwest , twa s name is usually among the last mentioned indeed , most analysts and airline industry insiders see twa s recent rebound as little more than the latest evidence that it is almost impossible to kill an established airline when the economy is growing one industry joke , both a comment on twa s prospects and a backhanded compliment to its survival skills , has it that the airline business in the year 2025 will consist of three prospering giants created through mergers and financially strapped twa twa , not surprisingly , has a rosier vision , based on two core assumptions about the nature of the airline business the first is that the worst battles of the industry s civil war following its deregulation in 1978 are history , leaving twa and other established airlines organized around impregnable hubs there s not a whole lot anybody can do to compete but get a lot better where they are , said michael palumbo , twa s chief financial officer the second assumption is that twa is strategically blessed with its major st louis hub here in the heart of the nation and a strong presence at new york s chief international gateway , kennedy international airport profits will roll in , twa believes , if twa can beat other airlines at the fundamentals such as ontime service , getting the rightsize planes for each route and marketing plans that reward frequent , fullfare passengers put it together , and you end up early in the next century with a flourishing airline , according to mr palumbo revenues might be about 4 billion , not much larger than today and just a fourth the size of the giants like united airlines but if everything goes right , profit margins could top the industry , mr palumbo said even after twa s impressive strides the last year , such a rewarding scenario seems farfetched but , a gradual return to solid profitability at least seems possible twa s most startling gains have been in ontime service after starting 1997 as the worst performer among the nation s 10 biggest airlines , it vaulted to first by summer though bad weather , wildcat strikes and a breakdown in the federal airtrafficcontrol computer covering stlouis knocked it back into the pack the final two months of the year , it continued to outshine its own recent past , completing every scheduled flight on six days of november , for example , compared with none for all of 1996 it s so basic , said william compton , a longtime twa pilot whom mr gitner put in charge of operations and recently promoted to president as soon as the ontime figures began shooting up last february , so did all our measures of customer satisfaction one key to both more timely service and cutting costs was replacing widebody boeing 747 s and lockheed l1011 s with new 757 s and a mixture of new and almostnew md80 s , which have less than half the capacity twa is also phasing out its aging 727 s with fewer seats to sell , twa has experienced a 10 percent drop in operating revenue but operating profit in the third quarter jumped to 638 million from 26 million a year earlier , and the company is projecting a sharp narrowing of its loss during this year s slow winter period to 50 million from 150 million last year this is because the new planes are fuller and more efficient , requiring smaller crews and less fuel and maintenance
no matter how cynical you become , it s never enough to keep up that aphorism , a sage comment on the absurdities of 1980 s culture , was written by jane wagner for the actress lily tomlin , in their 1985 broadway hit , the search for signs of intelligent life in the universe but ms wagner and ms tomlin could just as well have applied that same observation to the trajectory of the 1990 s money and powerdrunk world of high technology , an industry that seems to be trying to oneup itself , almost daily , in the how cynical can we get \? department just how cynical indeed is becoming abundantly clear as the board room and courtroom dramas play out between the microsoft corporation and its archrivals the netscape communications corporation , america online inc and sun microsystems inc and , of course , the united states government hardcore cynics find honesty contemptible unless it serves a purpose the truth too often makes suckers out of those who practice it it is an attitude so embedded in our business culture that feigned ignorance is now an acceptable courtroom defense for example , we shake our heads and tuttut when we read about the videotaped deposition in which microsoft s chairman , william h gates , the most powerful and feared executive in all of technology , cannot recall a single negative email or its context , even when the wording suggests that he was articulating his ideas , plans , visions and strategies with great fervor yet few people , in or out of the industry , cried foul when one of mr gates s advisers a former justice department official , no less characterized the gates testimony as a success because he had refused to concede anything to his questioners , even when it appeared they had him dead to rights and how cynical is it for some industry executives who say they believe in an unfettered free market and who , not coincidentally , reap the secondary benefits of microsoft s success to argue that microsoft s dominance has been good for consumers \? most economists would argue that what is good for software buyers whether corporate or consumer is choice and quality microsoft asserts that the market domination of its windows operating system insures both , by providing a stable platform on which developers can build myriad application programs certainly true until one then considers that most of microsoft s vast revenues derive from its own windows applications few companies are brave enough to develop products that compete head on with microsoft s historically , the odds of winning that market battle are next to zero but choice spurs quality one could argue , for instance , that the very best software microsoft has produced in the last 10 years has been its browser , internet explorer coincidence \? not likely internet explorer is microsoft s only major consumer application that has had serious competition netscape s navigator , which once dominated its market niche at the 90 percent levels of microsoft s windows microsoft joined the battle with a huge advantage it could afford to give its browser away free , and did so when that failed , microsoft in what may someday be known as one of the greatest cynical acts in industry history effectively killed the entire market segment by declaring the browser to be not a browser but the html engine of windows , an inextricable component of its operating system but the deepest cynicism , set forth with great righteousness by microsoft and its defenders , is their assertion that , given the opportunity to do so , its competitors would act exactly as microsoft has unfortunately , this defense is absolutely true strongarm tactics and cutthroat behavior have long been considered not just acceptable business practices in technology , but de rigueur and all the industry aspires to the stock price and the market heft of microsoft although none want to be sued by the government , of course but the argument is specious no other company has the opportunity to act like microsoft it is too late not surprisingly , microsoft was quick to point to last week s announcement of america online s takeover of netscape as proof that there is plenty of healthy competition in the industry but while consolidation sometimes enhances competition , even a troika as apparently formidable as the america online , netscape and sun microsystems alliance lacks the muscle to nudge microsoft from its market dominance or to stem its hegemony in cyberspace even if the alliance were to conquer every new market they envision , the personal computer market is enormous and still growing , and most new and old machines will be powered by microsoft s operating system for many years to come but the merger announcement was a classic tactic for a cynical industry many such announcements have been made over the last decade or so , and despite the vast media coverage they engender , most do not work and are quietly dismantled later , when their public relations value has waned such cynicism is perfectly legal , of course , but it demeans everything it touches it demands that we take nothing at face value , because everyone has an agenda and everything has a price at some point , even principled people start to waver if they can do it , why should n't i get mine , too \? by most accounts , that is where the technology industry is today , a game with few rules and only brute moves jockeying for position , cutting the flanks of the competition whenever possible yet , that game , too , has a price but it is a price of a different , more personal sort as jane wagner put it so eloquently , the trouble with the rat race is that even if you win , you 're still a rat drawing \( tom bloom \)
like thousands of mexican immigrants before him , miguel lopez made his way to new york last fall hoping to find work that might pay more than the 15 he made each week as a bricklayer in puebla , his home state with six relatives depending on his meager income , mr lopez , 22 , says it was getting harder and harder to keep everyone s stomach full i did n't want to leave home , but if i stayed , my family would go hungry , he said so it came as a pleasant surprise when , a day after his arrival in the city , mr lopez was offered 250 a week to work at a grocery in the east village , wa fruit and vegetable market on 14th street near avenue a the job bundling flowers , shucking corn and arranging piles of apples requires minimal english and no special skills when i found this job , i thought , 'i am a lucky man , ' he said in spanish but it did not take long before mr lopez s enthusiasm for his new job waned while his salary is far more than he could ever make back home , it is earned by his working 13hour days , six days a week last winter , when he came down with the flu , he said , he had to show up for work anyway because his boss does not pay employees when they are out sick if i ever took off a few days , i would come back to find someone else in my job , he said with a laugh as he emptied sweet peas from their pods labor organizers say working conditions at the city s koreanowned markets , like the one that employs mr lopez , are among the worst in new york according to local 169 of unite , the union of needletrades , industrial and textile employees , the mexican men who stock shelves and keep the fruit meticulously displayed work an average of 72 hours a week and earn less than 350 an hour , well below the minimum wage of 515 an hour none enjoy benefits like health insurance or paid vacation these places are basically like sweatshops , but unlike garment factories , they 're right on the street for everyone to see , said mike donovan , the union s director of organizing in the northeast the shop owners , however , say they cannot afford to pay their employees more if they want to work eight hours a day , they can , said the manager of wa fruit and vegetable market , who declined to give his name but of course , they will make less it is illegal for employers to pay their workers less than 515 an hour , and violators can be fined up to 200 percent of the unpaid wages but because state labor officials do not keep detailed statistics it is impossible to know the extent of the problem among greengrocers long overlooked by organized labor , those who work at the city s greengrocers are finally drawing union attention last may , local 169 began a unionization drive with help from the lower east side community labor coalition and the mexicanamerican workers project so far , jerry dominguez , the project s fulltime organizer , has spoken to hundreds of workers throughout the city on one hand , they are afraid of the union because they think they will lose their jobs , but they are also excited that someone cares about them , said mr dominguez , 32 , a native of zacatecas , mexico , who said he spent years in the south working as a migrant farm hand , earning 25 to 30 a day although none of the grocers have yet to recognize the union , organizers are turning up the heat on sept 16 , they held a boisterous march that wound through the east village , stopping at a halfdozen produce stores along the way the crowd of 100 people , led by a rousing mariachi band , shouted no justice , no peas , and fresh fruit , rotten wages as they scolded shop owners or store managers , many of whom appeared not to understand what was being said many , like hae nim chun , the owner of super value , at 229 avenue b , simply smiled and thanked a protester who lectured him if the effort to negotiate higher wages and shorter hours fails , noah zatz of the community labor coalition said boycotts are not out of the question these stores depend on neighborhood support to survive , he said i think we have quite a bit of leverage here the group , which also offers free english classes to the workers , is trying to make the lower east side an area where every business complies with the law but jay shon , assistant director of the korean produce association of new york , which represents 2 , 000 shop owners , warned that unionization would destroy an industry that he says is already foundering government cutbacks to food stamp recipients , rising commercial rents and increasing competition from supermarkets and others have hurt the business , he said these are small stores , with two or three workers , and still there are places closing all the time , he said the owners work hard too , and they do n't have health insurance either union officials , however , say that stiff competition or declining profits is no excuse for exploitive labor practices we do n't want to drive anyone out of business , mr donovan said we just want them to obey the law he said that most customers would be willing to pay more if they knew that workers were receiving minimum wage that s the way american society works , he said , adding that the union s goal was to organize all the stores in a given neighborhood at the same time so no one shop gains an advantage over the others still , the unionizing effort has been hamstrung by widespread fear among the workers , most of whom arrived illegally some say they have been threatened with firing if they join others worry that employers might report them to immigration authorities the italian and jewish garment workers who organized earlier this century at least had the benefit of citizenship , said immanuel ness , a professor of political science at brooklyn college who is writing a book on lowwage immigrant labor he said many employers prefer to hire mexican immigrants , because they consider them hardworking and willing to accept low wages one store owner said he liked mexicans because they do n't make trouble as the weather turns cold , miguel lopez is bracing himself for the misery of working outdoors at the wa market the trick is to keep moving , he said although he chats amiably when mr dominguez stops by to talk up the union , he worries that joining it may bring him more harm than good by putting his job in jeopardy at least here i do n't get yelled at by my boss , he said , glancing warily over his shoulder he did , however , agree that his life would be better if he worked less and made more money one of his coworkers , a mexican who has been at the store for nearly five years , makes 400 a week if i could make that much , i would be very happy , he said photo a march in support of the workers stopped at half a dozen

let s start with the madness we can get to the real world in a moment on thursday fred wilpon , coowner of the mets , held a press conference to tell us about his dream a brand new stadium for his beloved mets that is modeled on ebbets field , the park that housed his beloved dodgers mr wilpon made no effort to hide his emotional connection to the project , saying , this is a stadium you can put your arms around , with memories of ebbets field the problem , of course , is that mr wilpon wants the rest of us to pay for his dream , which will cost about a halfbillion dollars when rich men start dreaming , ordinary working people have to look out george steinbrenner is dreaming , too he wants a billiondollar stadium on the west side of manhattan , and mayor rudolph giuliani wants to give it to him so let s see , a billion and a half dollars to start , add in some infrastructure improvements , some cost overruns we 're talking 2 billion or more for two ball parks are we crazy \? mayor giuliani says 600 million could be raised from the commercial rent tax where does the rest come from \? and after the city \( and no doubt the state \) mortgages its soul to pay for these parks , who will get the profits from the games that are played there \? guess this is an extraordinarily high level of madness now to the real world on friday the mayor unveiled a goodnews budget fueled by wall street profits that do n't even recognize the sky as a limit but even with a supposed 2 billion surplus , the mayor proposes to cut funding for , among other things , libraries , parks and municipal cultural organizations now listen closely just a day earlier the mayor pledged that the city would give 65 million to a private cultural institution , the museum of modern art if there is money for the yanks , the mets and moma , and an alleged 2 billion surplus to boot , not to mention tax cuts , then why in the name of anything that s fair are we cutting city support for libraries , parks and the city s own department of cultural affairs \? is it possible we 're looking at class distinctions \? another aspect of the real world in new york city is the public school system , which is heavily populated by kids from poor and workingclass families , most of them black or hispanic when asked recently about the physical condition of the schools , raymond horton , the outgoing president of the citizens budget commission and a frequent critic of mr giuliani , said it is fair to say that the schools are tremendously overcrowded , that a high percentage of them are in bad repair , and many are dangerous it is also fair to say that virtually none of them , or a very small percentage of them , are wired to be technologically smart a 16yearold schoolgirl was killed three months ago when she was hit in the head by a brick that fell from the roof of a brooklyn elementary school that was being repaired and just last week an elementary school in maspeth , queens , had to be closed when part of its brick facade collapsed if the mayor got half as excited over the schools as he does over the prospect of glittering new stadiums for multimillionaire team owners , the children of new york would be in much better shape another glimpse of the real world came in a statewide poll of registered voters released last week by the marist institute for public opinion when asked to assess their own financial situation , a majority of the respondents said they continue to have difficulty making ends meet and find themselves working harder to pay their bills these are the same kind of people who will be asked to finance new baseball parks so steinbrenner , wilpon et al can live in everincreasing luxury ordinary people have dreams , too the citizens committee for children recently listed some of the things , eminently affordable , that new york city parents would like for their children they would like schools kept open longer they would like classroom overcrowding eased they would like increased job opportunities for teenagers and an expansion of programs designed to reduce child abuse and neglect those kinds of things modest , practical dreams the kind of dreams that escape the attention of a mayor blinded by the power and the splendor of the very rich
the journey of four cuban baseball players and a coach who fled their country on a small boat and then seemed to vanish took a puzzling turn yesterday with a swirl of vague , unconfirmed reports that they had washed ashore in the dominican republic , weakened but alive after nine days at sea a miami television station reported that one of the players had called relatives in havana from the dominican republic to say he and the others had arrived there on thursday and a prominent cubanamerican sports agent who has helped several cuban baseball players defect to the united states said last night that he had spoken with a woman in the dominican republic who had seen the men a couple of them have been sunburned , said the agent , joe cubas all five are dehydrated but dominican officials said they had not been able to verify the reports and had no information about any group of men coming ashore on a boat from cuba at this moment there s no confirmation of this rumor , fausto pena peguero , a spokesman for the immigration department , said yesterday evening a state department spokeswoman also could not confirm that the men had been found , and us coast guard officials said a boat adrift in that area of the caribbean would more likely be borne north toward florida , not east toward the dominican republic the five , who are believed to have left cuba on march 10 , have been the object of repeated searches and growing worries for more than a week had they been heading to the united states , a mere 90 miles from the northern shore of cuba , the voyage should have taken anywhere from a few hours to a few days , depending on weather and currents but when the men did not turn up by march 12 , a group of cuban expatriates called brothers to the rescue began sending cessna 337 planes into the air to search the straits of florida for them the group sent a plane into the air on march 12 and again on march 14 , then could not do so for the next four days , as roiling seas and punishing winds stalled search efforts petty officer scott carr , a spokesman for the coast guard in miami , said it had not undertaken a specific search because none of the several people who telephoned about the men would identify themselves but he said coast guard cutters and aircraft had been told to keep a lookout for the boat rene guim , a spokesman for mr cubas , said the boat held three prominent members of the cuban national baseball team jorge luis toca , 23 , a first baseman jorge diaz , 23 , a second baseman , and angel lopez , 25 , a catcher in addition , michael jova , 17 , a shortstop , and enrique chinea , 41 , a coach , were on the boat , mr guim said there were conflicting or unspecific reports about what kind of boat it was , where it had left cuba and in what direction it was headed the five were banned from baseball in cuba last july precisely because the cuban authorities suspected that they were planning to defect in fleeing , they joined a steady exodus of talented cuban athletes attracted by the prospect of lucrative contracts in a wealthier and freer country more than 75 cuban athletes have defected since 1991 , in daring and sometimes ingenious ways when competing in other countries , some have sneaked out of hotel rooms or hurdled fences others have taken to the seas , braving unpredictable weather or the possibility that they will be caught and sent home orlando hernandez , who signed a multiyear , 66 million contract with the new york yankees earlier this month , set sail from cuba the day after christmas with seven companions , some bread , spam , sugar and drinking water the group was stranded briefly on anguilla cay , near the bahamas they were found and rescued by the coast guard after a few days wtvj television in miami , an nbc affiliate , reported yesterday that the five men who left around march 10 endured a more harrowing ordeal , traveling 300 miles east of holguin , cuba , to arrive on the northern coast of the dominican republic with no provisions but mr cubas said last night i have not heard they are in grave danger mr guim said one problem in confirming the men s arrival might be that they could be afraid of deportation and therefore in hiding it s been like swimming in mud , he said of efforts to ascertain what was happening he added that he believed that the men were in or near the town of monte cristi mr cubas said that the men had put themselves in extraordinary danger i 've been out there , and i know what those waters look like , he said when you have guys or a guy who is willing to risk or put themselves in god s hands , and it s a very , very difficult trip , you start realizing what a difficult situation they must be in in cuba dominican and american officials said the dominican republic does not have a simple , unwavering policy about returning cuban defectors or granting them amnesty , though it has recently improved relations with cuba and sent many boat people back home it makes the decisions case by case map of the dominican republic showing location of monte cristi four cuban players and a coach may be in or near monte cristi
william h gates , chairman of the microsoft corporation , and his wife , melinda , will announce a gift of 100 million today to speed the delivery of vaccines against four childhood diseases to developing countries the gift is believed to be among the largest single private donations for health care it will go to a nonprofit health organization in seattle to find better ways to distribute recently developed vaccines the donation , to be announced in new york city , is mr gates s second largest , and it comes as he is battling government antitrust charges in federal district court in washington but mr gates said in an interview that the donation was part of his expanding philanthropic effort , and that its timing with the trial was coincidental mr gates is the world s wealthiest person , with an estimated net worth of at least 60 billion mr gates , who has been criticized for not being more generous , said he and his wife had given 2 billion to create two foundations a spokeswoman for mr gates said 164 million had been distributed mr gates has also said he would eventually give away about 95 percent of his fortune asked why he waited to make such gifts , the 43yearold mr gates said in the interview you can always look back and say , 'hey , i could have sold all my microsoft stock when i was 30 years old , ' but that would have been worth a small fraction of what it is now , and that would have been all my philanthropy the donation today comes from one of his foundations , the 18 billion william h gates foundation , and is being made to the program for appropriate technology in health , or path , an organization based in seattle the group plans to focus on four recently developed or about to be marketed vaccines against respiratory , intestinal and liver diseases two vaccines prevent respiratory ailments caused by the bacteria haemophilus influenzae type b , or hib , and streptococcus pneumoniae the other two vaccines prevent rotavirus infection , which causes severe diarrhea , and hepatitis b , a viral liver disease the foundation said the four diseases account for 25 million childhood deaths a year , or about onethird of the world bank s estimate of annual childhood deaths from infectious diseases worldwide in the united states , illnesses caused by hib bacteria , which include ear infections and meningitis , have nearly disappeared as a result of vaccinations that begin at 2 months hepatitis b vaccine is recommended for routine infant immunization earlier this year the food and drug administration approved an oral vaccine against rotavirus it is recommended for infants beginning at the age of 6 weeks approval for an improved vaccine for use in infants under 2 years against streptococcus pneumonia is expected soon , a spokesman for mr gates said vaccines of this type generally must be given more than once , at intervals , to be effective none of the money will be used to buy the vaccines , however mr gates and path officials said the money , at least in the early stages , would be spent finding ways to make the vaccines widely available to children in developing countries in recent years pharmaceutical companies have used genetic engineering and other techniques to make more technologically complex but more expensive , vaccines although such vaccines usually become widely available for children in developed countries , they are out of reach in poor countries without intervention , mr gates said , it might be years before children in poor countries receive these vaccines path was founded to improve the health of women and children in the united states and abroad dr james maynard , a path official , said the organization received 750 , 000 from mr gates s foundation in 1995 and an additional 21 million this year to support family planning and related activities a web site \( www rho org \) is designed to keep the staff at family planning clinics , particularly those with few financial resources , current about aids , reproductive tract infections , female genital mutilation and other public health issues path has also focused on providing hepatitis b immunization and says it has grown increasingly concerned about the cost , distribution and other problems that developing countries face in buying the newer vaccines , dr maynard said donor fatigue is setting in , he added , and there is a growing concern that in some countries the money spent on costlier vaccines has been taken from funds earmarked for paying immunization workers and supporting health systems dr maynard said path intends to improve vaccine administration in as many as 18 countries in the next 10 years by developing partnerships with the world health organization , the united nations children s fund and other international groups aided by the gates donation , path intends to try to lower the cost of vaccines and maintain a steady supply of them through cooperative efforts of pharmaceutical companies , scientists , the world bank , who , unicef and international health organizations among the things that path said it intended to do were these conduct international meetings to develop agreements on the appropriate storage conditions for and uses of vaccines develop model immunization programs to establish the cheapest and most efficient ways to introduce new vaccines and to prove that they can be delivered as effectively as in developed countries determine the costeffectiveness of vaccine programs create web sites , publications , videos and other educational programs to speed up introduction and acceptance of new vaccines explore the use of vaccines on a regional basis to combat other conditions like japanese b encephalitis in parts of asia and yellow fever in africa and south america the four vaccines will complement six others already financed through a global program directed at curbing diphtheria , measles , whooping cough , polio , tetanus and tuberculosis the program , organized through united nations agencies , has raised the level of protection of the world s children to 80 percent from 5 percent in the early 1970 s mr gates said he and his wife would focus their philanthropy on a widespread distribution of the latest advances in medicine and information technology last year mr gates s library foundation , libraries online ! , gave 200 million to establish a fiveyear program to bring new computers and the internet into the nation s public libraries

washington , feb 12 members of the house banking committee put aside their normal concern for monetary policy and deposit insurance today and turned their attention instead to the plundering of art during world war ii and what to do about it now the unusual hearing , which included the rare appearance on capitol hill of the directors of four top art museums , marked a new stage in congressional efforts to help victims of the holocaust and their heirs win restitution for lost property until now , the efforts had focused primarily on gold , dormant bank accounts and insurance experts have estimated that hundreds to tens of thousands of works of art looted during the nazi reign in europe remain unidentified and in the hands of museums , dealers and collectors around the world in recent months , a handful of ownership claims have been lodged for art works in against american museums but james n wood , director of the art institute of chicago , told committee members that the problem was one of the most pressing and difficult questions facing american art museums today with the recent opening of wartime archives in the united states and europe and the publication of books on looted art , more claims are expected many will be difficult to assess , given the lack of records and the time gap since the third reich began its effort to eradicate jews in the 1930 s philippe de montebello , the director of the metropolitan museum of art , said that a new association of art museum directors' study group , which he leads , would establish guidelines and procedures to help museums deal with claims mr wood , mr de montebello and their colleagues from the museum of modern art in new york and the national gallery of art in washington all said that they were continuing to investigate the ownership of works in the collections of their museums although none of the witnesses who testified before the house banking committee saw a need for legislation , some suggested ways congress could help gilbert s edelson , the administrative vice president and counsel of the art dealers association of america , pleaded for the unification , or at the least , coordination of groups doing research on lost art , including the world jewish congress and the b'nai b'rith klutznick national jewish museum in washington we should do now what should have been done many years ago , he said there should be a central registry and database where claims for the recovery of looted works could be registered , kept on file and where the information would be made available to all interested parties representative charles e schumer of brooklyn said that he and his fellow democratic representative from new york , nita m lowey of rye , planned to introduce legislation to provide 5 million to private organizations helping families trace their losses and 5 million for checking the provenance of federal art holdings their bill would also require anyone who purchased art , including museums , to do a reasonable title search in written testimony , ronald s lauder , chairman of the world jewish congress s new commission for art recovery , called for the declassification of additional wartime archives we need to press other nations to do the same , he added several witnesses also said that international discussions of some type would be useful , largely because european law generally differs from american law in one crucial aspect in the united states , no one can purchase good title for a stolen piece of art , no matter how many times it changed hands after the theft in europe , goodfaith purchasers do obtain a clear title the purpose of the hearing was less to develop legislation than to raise public consciousness about the problem of stolen art , said representative jim leach , the iowa republican who heads the committee we need , it seems to me , new structures to come to grips with this problem , mr leach said new databases , new clusters of experts , new international covenants mr wood , mr de montebello and their colleagues from the museum of modern art in new york and the national gallery of art in washington all said they were continuing to investigate the ownership of works in the collections of their museums but despite a consensus in the hearing room to develop some mechanism to resolve ownership claims outside the court system , none of the witnesses had an answer to the major questions of the day , which were asked repeatedly by representative carolyn b maloney , democrat of manhattan who do you see deciding the standards of proof and who will determine whether those standards are met \? and who will be the adjudicator and how can we enforce a standard in other countries \?
recent heavy rain contributed to a roof collapse at a daycare center and preschool in queens early yesterday , about five hours before 65 children , many of them developmentally disabled , would have streamed through the door for the day city officials said the recent days of rain and problems with roof drainage caused the roof of a onestory classroom extension to collapse into an empty classroom , and the city ordered the extension building demolished officials of the school , the heartshare center at 118th street and 101st avenue in ozone park , said they were not sure how long it would take to rebuild the ruined extension it was just one of at least four buildings that collapsed in new york city in the last two days in a fifth case , two attached buildings were demolished after bricks and a parapet fell from the facade all the buildings were vacant and none of the collapses caused injuries city officials said a spell of 12 straight days of rain was at least partly responsible for the falling bricks and subsequent emergency demolitions they all have been not directly the result of the weather , but they definitely were weatherrelated , said ted birkhahn , a spokesman for the department of buildings in every case you had structures that were not maintained properly and the type of weather we 've been having was the last straw mr birkhahn said that in the case of the daycare center , the front half , which includes two apartment units on a second floor , was not affected by the roof collapse five residents were ordered to leave the apartments yesterday morning but were allowed to return after a few hours mr birkhahn said the drains on the roof of the classroom extension apparently were blocked by leaves or debris and with a square flat roof , water just filled up on it until it could n't take it anymore , he said when parents arrived with children at the heartshare center yesterday morning , they were sent to another heartshare location a block away the children , who range from infants to 5yearolds , will be transferred to that location indefinitely , the parents were told clement high , whose 3yearold grandson attends heartshare , said that if the roof had to collapse , it was fortunate that it happened when it did , at 3 or 4 am god forbid if it had been during school , mr high said as he picked up his grandson at the alternate school it s cause for some concern because when you think about it , it s a very dangerous situation two other buildings collapsed yesterday , one in queens and the other in the bronx over the weekend , buildings also came down in harlem in one case on saturday night and one on sunday morning in queens , the roof of the former st monica s roman catholic church , on the grounds of york college in jamaica , caved in at about 7 am yesterday , bringing its side walls down with it the church , where former gov mario m cuomo once served as an altar boy , was built in 1856 but had not been used since 1973 , school officials said the college had fenced off the building and built supports for the facade in hopes of some day turning it into a college visitors' center gov george e pataki had approved funding for the building in his recent budget after yesterday s collapse , city officials said the facade , which includes the church steeple , was probably the only part of the church that could be salvaged also yesterday , a vacant fourstory apartment building on eagle avenue in the south bronx caved in at about 9 am mr birkhahn said the roof fell into the fourth floor , leading to a complete interior collapse , as each floor crashed down to the next , in a pancake effect in harlem , two attached vacant buildings on park avenue at 126th street were demolished after bricks and a parapet fell from the facade late saturday no one was injured , but commuter traffic on the metronorth commuter railroad was disrupted for a few hours because engineers feared that vibrations from passing trains might cause further damage to the buildings , which were just 20 feet from the elevated tracks on sunday morning , the roof of a vacant sixstory building on west 146th street at lenox avenue collapsed , causing each floor to fall into the one beneath it mr birkhahn said that building also was being demolished photo debris from the collapsed roof and the exterior wall of the center on 101st avenue in ozone park is examined by nidia zapata , a neighbor \( chris maynard for the new york times \) map of queens showing location of heartshare center a school s 65 students were shifted to a site a block away
when patrons of the loudoun county , va , public library try to view sexually explicit material on any of nine computers newly connected to the internet , a software program responds with an unambiguous message violation ! ! violation ! ! violation ! ! access to this site has been blocked please click on your bookmark or go to some other web site the library s board had the filtering program installed in november and if the software had zapped only obscene material it probably would not have provoked debate the software program chosen by the county for its six library branches , xstop , says it can purify the internet but library users complain that xstop , produced by the logon data corporation of anaheim , calif , is imperfect at best library users complain that they have been denied access to information on sex education , breast cancer and gay and lesbian rights , among other things , because the software cannot discriminate between obscene materials and other information about sexual topics patrons say they have even been barred from a quaker site on the world wide web and from the home page of yale university s biology department at the same time , they say , graphic sexual images sometimes manage to evade the software charging that the library s policy is an unconstitutional form of government censorship , a group of citizens has filed a lawsuit the case is expected to serve as a litmus test of a library s first amendment obligation to its patrons in an age when its collection is no longer limited by budgets or shelf space the case is being closely watched as public libraries across the nation add cyberspace to their collections and confront its contradictions as a tool , the internet would seem to embody the traditional library s commitment to the free flow of ideas but the internet also strips libraries of their role as information arbiters with more than threequarters of the nation s public libraries connected to the internet , up from fewer than half in 1996 , many americans now count libraries as their sole source of internet access the library is a place where you should be able to get all different views , said jeri mcgiverin , a retired schoolteacher and president of mainstream loudoun , a local civil liberties organization involved in the lawsuit some software company in california should not be making the decisions about what we can and cannot see still , many loudoun county residents agree with the library s board that the occasional blackout of a worthwhile site is an acceptable price to pay to maintain the library s traditional community values under the policy , patrons have the option of submitting a written request that the library staff consider unblocking a particular web site a handful of petitions have succeeded i'm not going to be forced by some perceived new right to display pornography in our library , said john j nicholas jr , 49 , the chairman of the library board we never have , and we 're not going to start now last week a federal district court judge in alexandria , leonie m brinkema , heard arguments on a motion by the library board to dismiss the case the american civil liberties union has joined the suit on behalf of several nonprofit groups and a newspaper columnist whose internet material was rendered inaccessible by the software the case comes at a time when lawmakers are seeking new ways to regulate online sexual content last year , in a victory for the aclu , the supreme court overturned the communications decency act , a federal law that would have made it illegal to transmit indecent material to minors on line holding that the potential harm to constitutionally protected adult speech outweighed the government s interest in protecting children from inappropriate material , the court compared the web to a vast library including millions of readily available and indexed publications how those publications are packaged is at issue in the loudoun case because there is no direct precedent , legal experts say that a decision may hinge largely on what realworld metaphor for the electronic library the court accepts the library board likens clicking on a link to a web site to a book request via interlibrary loan , which a library is under no first amendment obligation to satisfy the plaintiffs argue that cordoning off certain parts of the internet is like purchasing an encyclopedia and cutting out the articles that do not meet with a librarian s approval it does raise novel issues , said ken bass , a lawyer representing the library s board the internet makes available at no increased marginal cost a realm of information once you have the technology to acquire part of it but that still does not mean you can require the library to be a transmission mechanism for that information aclu lawyers contend that the supreme court s concern for the hypothetical harm to adult speech in overturning the communications decency act should serve as a guide in the loudoun library case
it is tempting to regard the eight babies born to a houston mother as a holiday season miracle , the fruit of a woman s fervent desire to have children and of modern medicine s ability to assist reproduction in those otherwise unable to conceive who does not root strenuously for the survival of the world s only known living octuplets as they cling tenuously to life in a neonatal intensive care unit \? but this is not an event that should be overly sentimentalized or glamorized it is instead a mixed blessing , illustrating the limitations of hightech medicine as it strives to bring sound , healthy babies into the world without generating a crowd of fragile newborns the incidence of multiple births has been soaring , and one of the prime causes is greater use of fertility drugs and other technologies to assist reproduction although the vast majority of prospective parents are seeking only one healthy baby , or perhaps two , the drugs carry a risk that many more fertilized eggs will be produced , leading to such large broods as the septuplets born in iowa last year and the eight births in houston this month both sets of births attracted a flood of attention from the media and from companies eager to supply free groceries or baby supplies for a share of the publicity recordsetting multiple births are admittedly hard to ignore but this trend should not be encouraged such multiple births are dangerous to the babies , who are born so tiny and premature that they are at high risk of lifetime health complications even if the babies emerge healthy , the parents are faced with an enormous burden of care that few are prepared to meet without outside assistance moreover , the cost of multiple births is very high and can be greatly reduced if the number of babies is reduced experts say there are several ways to avoid such multiple births , none of them infallible one is to monitor the fertility drug treatments very closely and , if it becomes clear that too many eggs are maturing at once , terminate the treatment cycle immediately that amounts to a costly misfire for the patient but stops the process before an egg is fertilized to produce an embryo , making the termination morally acceptable to many patients a more controversial technique , employed after there are multiple embryos or fetuses , is selective reduction to remove some that gives the remaining embryos a better chance but is opposed by some women as tantamount to abortion some experts would limit the most aggressive use of fertility drugs to those women whose moral beliefs allow them to undertake selective reduction , whereas others urge more research on new means to prevent the maturing of too many eggs until scientists come up with a better way to limit multiple births , the only hope for improvement is the common sense of doctors and their patients that can best be brought to bear in an atmosphere that recognizes that these events , however wondrous they may seem , are really medical mishaps that few doctors or patients desire
where s ronald \? in art circles , that question has been in the air since yearend , when the news broke that the provenance of two paintings by egon schiele was clouded by nazi plundering ronald s lauder is the chairman of the museum of modern art , where the paintings , borrowed from the leopold foundation in vienna , were on view when two families claimed them he is well acquainted with dr rudolf leopold , whose vast art holdings are to be enshrined in a new museum in vienna mr lauder owns 20 schieles , helped bring the leopold collection to new york and paid half of its exhibition costs mr lauder is also a former american ambassador to austria , where the initial indignation over the claims turned to anger when the manhattan district attorney s office started a criminal investigation of the case and issued a subpoena preventing the return of the works to vienna and he is chairman of the world jewish congress s new commission for art recovery , which was created to help families reclaim stolen art as surely as all roads once led to rome , in this instance all roads led to ronald , as he is known to his friends yet while the art world has looked to him for leadership , mr lauder has been conspicuously absent , at least publicly i do n't believe in talking unless you know all the facts , he explained more than once during two recent interviews depending on the vantage point , either mr lauder has a titanic conflict of interest , being chairman of both the modern and the recovery commission , or he is the only one who knows all the players and can broker a resolution either way , his reticence has some skeptics questioning the credibility of his commission , though none would do so publicly normally , mr lauder , though not a publicity hound , is not shy about making things happen tall and squareshouldered , he long ago left the family cosmetics business to pursue his own interests and devote time to philanthropy and public policy , including republican politics in recent years he has championed term limits for new york city officials , pushed the presidential candidacy of colin l powell in 1995 and helped organize a 1996 auction of unclaimed objects that had been stolen by the nazis in austria , to cite just a few examples mr lauder , 53 , has the air and bearing of the very wealthy , yet he sometimes alternates between extreme selfconfidence and caution , between pugnaciousness and pliancy on the subject at hand , he chooses his words carefully , upholding the museum s position that the paintings should go back to austria then , he says , the matter will be settled to everyone s satisfaction ronald is in an almost impossible situation , declared his brother , leonard a lauder , the chairman of the whitney museum of american art on the one hand , he was trying to bring sense and sensibility to the restitution of works of art taken during the war on the other , he is chairman of the modern , which has a contract and on the bigger issue , american museums that depend on international loans are now going to be hard pressed to get them he added , this is an emotionally charged situation where the person in the middle risks getting knocked off for his part , ronald lauder said , people with claims want you to dive right in , but we have to make sure we know enough before we dive in nevertheless , he has not been inactive he has had one fairly amicable telephone conversation with dr leopold and had spoken with austrian officials he has met once with district attorney robert m morgenthau , who issued the subpoena , and he has urged constance lowenthal , whom he hired to direct the commission for art recovery , to look into the families' claims he has also consulted frequently with glenn d lowry , the modern s director mr lauder also seemed to exert a restraining hand in washington on jan 7 , senator alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york , wrote to the customs service urging it to seize the entire leopold collection as stolen property within hours , senator d'amato wrote again rescinding his missive a spokesman for the senator said the letter was withdrawn because it asserted criminal activity without sufficient information and denied that mr lauder had been an influence mr lauder , however , said that someone in his office had conveyed his opinion to someone in senator d'amato s office , adding , it was my strong view that the paintings should go back but mr lauder s intervention so far has dismayed those sympathetic to the claimants , who see his response as onesided if lauder wo n't take a stand on this case , then why have a commission for art recovery \? said willi korte , a stolenart investigator who has been retained by the family of lea bondi jaray , a jewish art dealer who fled vienna in 1938 without her beloved schiele , portrait of wally after the war , wally ended up in austria s national gallery , which traded it to dr leopold indeed , mr lauder has not spoken with either of the two parties in direct conflict the families and klaus a schroder , the leopold museum s managing director , who was installed by austria against dr leopold s wishes a frosty tone as ambassador this is not the first time ronald lauder , who as an heir to the estee lauder cosmetics empire is worth 24 billion , according to forbes magazine , has found himself in a sticky situation
philadelphia , aug 6 endless misfortune had cast marie noe as a martyr , the cheated mother who had endured the death of 10 sons and daughters , one by one it was a fate almost too cruel to be believed but today assistant district attorney jay feinschi argued that mrs noe was , instead , as much a mass murderer as ted bundy and said that the court should show her no mercy mrs noe , 69 , who was accused this week of murdering eight of her infant children from 1949 to 1968 , was denied bail in 1963 life magazine featured the woman who lives on north american street and her millworker husband , arthur , as emblems of misfortune , after six of their children had died the first baby was stillborn the second died hours after birth at the hospital the other eight infants went home healthy , but none lived longer than 14 months most of the mysteries were eventually attributed to crib death , now called sudden infant death syndrome , or sids this case involves a great american tragedy , district attorney lynne m abraham said ms abraham said mrs noe had confessed to the police to killing four of the children and had told the police that she could not recall the circumstances of the other deaths mr noe , 77 , was not charged the authorities had suspected foul play for years , but had not found proof , said halbert fillinger , the coroner of montgomery county , who worked in the philadelphia medical examiner s office in the 1960 s and helped conduct autopsies on some of the noe babies one sids death is a tragedy , mr fillinger said two is a mystery three is murder ms abraham said the eight children had been smothered with a pillow or another soft object the state cannot seek the death penalty because the deaths happened before the death penalty law was enacted officials said the noes had taken out nominal life insurance policies on some of the children , but that was not seen as a motive for the killings ms abraham said evidence of a motive would be shown at trial ms abraham said that when each of the eight children died , mrs noe was alone at home with the child she said mrs noe would sometimes call a neighbor for help , saying , something s wrong with the baby each of the children was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital abraham perlman , a pediatrician who treated one of the noe children , constance , in 1958 , had run extensive tests on the newborn because of the earlier unexplained deaths and found nothing abnormal , a police affidavit in the case said when dr perlman told mrs noe that she had a beautiful child , according to the police affidavit , mrs noe replied , she s not going to live just like the others in the noes' old workingclass neighborhood of row houses in the kensington section , most people interviewed expressed shock over the charges in the living room of the noe home , two doors away from the row house where they lived when the children died , is a framed photograph of one of their children , catherine ellen , a 10weekold who died in february 1966 david s rudenstein , a lawyer for mrs noe , told reporters on wednesday that the police had coerced the statement by questioning mrs noe , who is diabetic and was not feeling well , for 11 hours through the night i am appalled at the way this case has been handled , said mr rudenstein , who said that mrs noe had told police she wanted to call a lawyer , but that they ignored her they intimated that if you sign this , you can go he said he found it inconceivable that mrs noe would keep the killings a secret for nearly a halfcentury , then suddenly acknowledge committing murder to police officers mr rudenstein also accused the district attorney s office of looking for a big splash of a case he indicated that mrs noe would plead not guilty at her preliminary hearing the autopsies of the noe children were studied by dr stephen ludwig , a professor of pediatrics at children s hospital in philadelphia , who concluded that the deaths were caused by suffocation dr ludwig said medical authorities in the 1950 s and 1960 s were reluctant to make accusations against parents in cases of crib death but he said that the medical community has now acknowledged that one of the provable explanations for sids is really infanticide , the police affidavit said ms abraham said the case was a a wakeup call to police officers and health workers to be vigilant in such cases she said several factors had prompted her to pursue the investigation , including the book , the death of innocents \( 1997 \) , which examined the case of a new york state woman convicted of murder in 1994 for killing her five children two decades earlier the eight noe children all died at home when questioned after the death of 7monthold daughter , mary lee , in 1963 , mrs noe told the police that she had left the baby in the crib for a few minutes and returned to find the child gasping for breath and turning blue mr noe , who worked in textile mills and later became a democratic committeeman , told the philadelphia daily news , in an article published in january , that he was still burdened by the deaths the last thing we want to see is this thing brought up again , he said it brings up all the pain and troubles and heartaches maybe it s news to others , but it s pain to us photo marie noe , accused of killing eight of her children , was denied bail \(

it s not hard to figure out why , come mondays at 9 pm , annalucille calabrese can be found parked in front of buffy the vampire slayer like buffy , the heroine of the hip hourlong drama on wb about a girl who reluctantly takes on the task of ridding her high school of an infestation of the undead , annalucille , 13 , is bright , popular and tinged with teenage irony also like buffy , whose milieu is the lush environs of southern california , annalucille lives in a wealthy suburb in her case , montclair , nj her father , a publishing executive , drives a fast black porsche sports coupe she s smart and in control , says annalucille of buffy , whose blond hair and ivory girl looks are part of the joke but annalucille is hardly the neat little demographic package that television executives wish for in fact , during the hour before buffy , she does something that not only skews the precarious economics of the multibilliondollar entertainment industry but also adds a wrinkle to the national debate on race she flips the channel to watch martin reruns and in the house , shows with entirely black casts , on upn like a growing number of young white television viewers across the country , annalucille crosses the color line daily and barely notices she and her peers seem not to care much about race , at least when it comes to the small screen they 're funny , too , she says of the shows she watches they 're crazy , but they 're funny the crossover trend among young television viewers is remarkable because it directly contradicts the habits of older americans in fact , over all , there is astonishingly little overlap between the mostwatched shows among blacks and those among whites er is no 1 among whites but 18th with blacks seinfeld , a close no 2 with whites , is an astonishing 54th among black viewers between brothers is the most popular show among blacks , but it ranks 107th among whites in fact , not a single show is in both the top 10 for blacks and the top 10 for whites only 4 shows appear on both racial groups' top 20 lists the one with the highest ratings is monday night football not one is a comedy blacks generally watch black shows , and whites generally watch white shows , says dean valentine , a former disney executive who became president of upn last november it s a reflection of how fragmented our society has become children , however , increasingly seem to be bucking the trend kids are much more colorblind than adults in their television viewing , says douglas alligood , who has for the last decade tracked such trends for bbdo , the advertising agency and they 're becoming more so they make decisions based on the context of the show , not simply the racial content laura herrold , a white 11yearold from ridgewood , nj , who watches sister , sister and the smart guy , as well as sabrina the teenage witch , agrees my friends and i do n't even talk about whether the people on the shows are black or white , she says we watch those shows because they 're about people our age it s easy to see this news as the harbinger of a new age of racial harmony , led by the youth of america on one level , the trends mean that young people are more accepting of diversity than their parents but while some questions that the crossover brings to mind are sanguine , others may not be when today s teenagers grow into adults , will they continue this tolerance of diversity and pass it along to their children \? or will they , as their parents did , switch to segregated television are the series watched by white teenagers the best possible reflections of black culture they can find \? and will the young networks that present most of the black series continue to do so , once they 've established themselves \? the racial chasm in television viewing is relatively new that s because until the last several years there were n't enough shows with black casts to fragment the audience growing up , television was a white medium entirely , says sammart williams , a black playwright who has written for series like martin and good news we came of age watching 'father knows best' and 'the donna reed show' everyone did but fox , wb and upn have changed that with nbc , cbs and abc programming shows with largely allwhite casts aimed at a wide swath of middle america , the three upstart networks , each of which has its biggest affiliates in major urban areas , have in the last few years developed more than a dozen sitcoms with allblack core casts the result is a slew of new black media images , ranging from warm and fuzzy dads like robert townsend on the parent hood to the feisty 20something roommates on living single \( which was recently canceled after four and a half seasons \) but such shows have also polarized america s viewing habits , underscoring the depth of the nation s ambivalence about race and identity television dramas like er , nypd blue and chicago hope have gracefully integrated their casts \( if not , by and large , their audiences \) but the races rarely mix on sitcoms while a few black shows have white minor characters and some of the white shows trot out an occasional black person , primetime comedy is one of the last bastions of public segregation
washington , june 4 the supreme court delivered a swift rebuff today to kenneth w starr s effort to short circuit the ordinary appellate process and get a quick ruling from the justices on disputed claims of privilege for four grand jury witnesses the court said in two brief orders , issued without dissent , that it would not grant expedited hearings or indeed any hearings at all at this stage on the scope of the attorneyclient privilege for white house lawyers or on the existence of a previously unrecognized protective function privilege for secret service agents mr starr , the whitewater independent counsel , is seeking testimony from bruce lindsey , the deputy white house counsel and close presidential confidant , and from three secret service employees as part of his investigation into whether president clinton had a sexual relationship with monica s lewinsky , a former white house intern , and sought to have her cover it up chief judge norma holloway johnson of the federal district court here rejected both claims of privilege in separate rulings last month despite having won the two cases , mr starr asked for an immediate supreme court review to avoid , he said , any further delay in his investigation the court today denied both portions of mr starr s requests that it take jurisdiction of the two cases away from the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , and that it hear the cases on an expedited timetable it is assumed that the court of appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case , the court said in each of its two oneparagraph orders while the appeals court could schedule arguments as early as next month , even such an accelerated schedule would effectively preclude the justices , whose current term ends in a matter of weeks , from having a final say on the issues before the november congressional elections how that fact may affect mr starr s own timetable , either for seeking an indictment of ms lewinsky for perjury and other charges or for sending an impeachment report to the house of representatives , as he hinted in one of his supreme court briefs this week , is the most obvious question raised by the developments today the independent counsel made no reference to his longrange strategy in a statement he issued after the court s action in light of the supreme court s determination today , we will proceed to litigate these issues as quickly as the court of appeals' schedule will permit , mr starr said this office will continue to take every reasonable and practicable step to bring out the relevant facts as promptly as possible , so this investigation can be concluded in a thorough and expeditious manner charles f c ruff , the white house counsel , said , the supreme court acted appropriately today , rejecting mr starr s attempt to bypass the traditional appeals process michael d mccurry , the white house press secretary , pronounced the president pleased and then said , in answer to a question on whether the result would now be more delay , that it was day 1 , 400 of ken starr s tenure as an independent counsel at the rate of 30 , 000 a day of taxpayers' money mr mccurry added , now , if there s any delay , that s the delay right there both sides have asked the appeals court for a july hearing in the attorneyclient case , a request that the court is likely to grant in light of the supreme court s unusual statement that it expected the cases to move forward expeditiously arguments in the secret service privilege case are likely to be scheduled quickly as well in a brief filed with the supreme court this morning , the solicitor general s office , representing the secret service , said it would not oppose accelerated review , either in the court of appeals or directly in the supreme court while requests for immediate court review of a federal district court s decision are not particularly rare , such requests are rarely granted so mr starr faced a heavy burden in trying to persuade the justices that the current disputes posed crises on the order of watergate or the nationwide steel strike in 1952 , two of the handful of occasions on which the court has granted a request for certiorari before judgment , to use its terminology mr starr tried to make his case by drawing repeated analogies to united states v nixon , the 1974 ruling in which the court rejected president richard m nixon s claim of executive privilege and ordered incriminating white house tapes turned over to the watergate special prosecutor that effort was blunted by the white house decision on monday to drop from the case an executive privilege claim that judge johnson had rejected at the same time she rejected the claim of attorneyclient privilege for months , the white house had claimed executive privilege to shield both mr lindsey and sidney blumenthal , a senior aide , from having to testify since mr blumenthal is not a lawyer , the remaining claim of attorneyclient privilege did not apply to him , and he appeared before mr starr s grand jury today
islamabad , pakistan a decade after she led this impoverished nation from military rule to democracy , benazir bhutto is at the heart of a widening corruption inquiry that pakistani investigators say has traced more than 100 million to foreign bank accounts and properties controlled by ms bhutto s family starting from a cache of bhutto family documents bought for 1 million from a shadowy intermediary , the investigators have detailed a pattern of secret payments by foreign companies that sought favors during ms bhutto s two terms as prime minister the documents leave uncertain the degree of involvement by ms bhutto , a harvard graduate whose rise to power in 1988 made her the first woman to lead a muslim country but they trace the pervasive role of her husband , asif ali zardari , who turned his marriage to ms bhutto into a source of virtually unchallengeable power in 1995 , a leading french military contractor , dassault aviation , agreed to pay mr zardari and a pakistani partner 200 million for a 4 billion jet fighter deal that fell apart only when ms bhutto s government was dismissed in another deal , a leading swiss company hired to curb customs fraud in pakistan paid millions of dollars between 1994 and 1996 to offshore companies controlled by mr zardari and ms bhutto s widowed mother , nusrat in the largest single payment investigators have discovered , a gold bullion dealer in the middle east was shown to have deposited at least 10 million into an account controlled by mr zardari after the bhutto government gave him a monopoly on gold imports that sustained pakistan s jewelry industry the money was deposited into a citibank account in the united arab emirate of dubai , one of several citibank accounts for companies owned by mr zardari together , the documents provided an extraordinarily detailed look at highlevel corruption in pakistan , a nation so poor that perhaps 70 percent of its 130 million people are illiterate , and millions have no proper shelter , no schools , no hospitals , not even safe drinking water during ms bhutto s five years in power , the economy became so enfeebled that she spent much of her time negotiating new foreign loans to stave off default on 62 billion in public debt a worldwide search for properties secretly bought by the bhutto family is still in its early stages but the inquiry has already found that mr zardari went on a shopping spree in the mid1990 s , purchasing among other things a 4 million , 355acre estate south of london in 1994 and 1995 , he used a swiss bank account and an american express card to buy jewelry worth 660 , 000 including 246 , 000 at cartier inc and bulgari corp in beverly hills , calif , in barely a month in separate interviews in karachi , ms bhutto , 44 , and mr zardari , 42 , declined to address specific questions about the pakistani inquiry , which they dismissed as a political vendetta by ms bhutto s successor as prime minister , nawaz sharif in karachi central prison , where he has been held for 14 months on charges of murdering ms bhutto s brother , mr zardari described the corruption allegations as part of a meaningless game but he offered no challenge to the authenticity of the documents tracing some of his most lucrative deals ms bhutto originally kindled wild enthusiasms in pakistan with her populist politics , then suffered a heavy loss of support as the corruption allegations gained credence in an interview at her fortresslike home set back from karachi s arabian sea beachfront , she was by turns tearful and defiant most of those documents are fabricated , she said , and the stories that have been spun around them are absolutely wrong but she refused to discuss any of the specific deals outlined in the documents , and did not explain how her husband had paid for his property and jewelry lamenting what she described as the irreparable damage done to my standing in the world by the corruption inquiry , she said her family had inherited wealth , although not on the scale implied by tales of huge bank deposits and luxury properties overseas i mean , what is poor and what is rich \? ms bhutto asked if you mean , am i rich by european standards , do i have a billion dollars , or even a hundred million dollars , even half that , no , i do not but if you mean that i'm ordinary rich , yes , my father had three children studying at harvard as undergraduates at the same time but this wealth never meant anything to my brothers or me the student privileged learning , populist platitudes ms bhutto , a student at harvard and oxford for six years in the 1970 s , has always presented herself as a tribune of the dispossessed in a harvard commencement speech in 1989 , she said that avaricious politicans had looted developing countries and left them without the means to tackle their social problems since she was ousted as prime minister during her second term , on nov 5 , 1996 , on charges that included gross corruption , she has been the leader of pakistan s main opposition group , the pakistan people s party
wilmette , ill , dec 13 at the mention of president clinton s name , sean lewis can barely conceal his displeasure it s hard to have any respect for clinton , he said , and he certainly does n't deserve any pity but mr lewis , a 32yearold marketing director , fiercely opposes impeachment the question is not what s best for clinton , but what s best for the country , mr lewis said and it s not good for the country to go through an impeachment trial and maybe throw him out of office this congressional district north of chicago , with its lakefront mansions and elegant boutiques , leans heavily toward the country club of the republican party , more intent on a soaring stock market than on any socially conservative agenda representative john porter , a moderate in his 10th term , fits this district like his finely tailored suits he is among the handful of republicans who have not declared their intentions yet on the impeachment vote mr porter had initially spoken out against impeachment , but later said he would consider it after the house judiciary committee had concluded its work a spokesman for mr porter , dave kohn , said calls to the congressman s office have changed in tone a bit recently months ago , he said , calls were heavily in favor of impeachment in recent days , however , he said nearly as many people were calling to urge mr porter to vote against impeachment judging from the talk on the streets here , a vast majority of north shore residents appear to oppose impeachment , even among those who voted against mr clinton , like mr lewis some people said they dreaded the prospect of a sensational trial in the senate we 'll look like jackasses to the rest of the world , denice mason , 65 , said they 'll think we 're absolutely absurd a couple of her friends nodded do n't these politicians read the polls \? annette abrams , 67 , asked did n't they pay attention to the election results \? to be sure , it is not impossible to find people here who favor impeachment we have a constitution and it must apply , said peter anton , 67 , a project manager for a construction company how can we say that the commanderinchief does n't have to abide by the same rules as his generals \? all you get from the president is doubletalk he shook his head look , i do n't really like the idea of all this being on television , with little kids hearing all these details , he added but we can blame clinton for that jennifer merriam , a 23yearold psychologist , does not have fond regard for mr clinton but she believes an impeachment trial would mean chaos for the government clinton is immoral and irresponsible , but let s let the law deal with him after he gets out of office , ms merriam said think of the money all of this is costing the country virtually none of the voters said they believed mr clinton should go unpunished , although ms abrams said , so he had an affair in the white house did n't kennedy , too , and how many others \? censure seemed to be the most popular option the truth is , having clinton in office has been pretty good for this country , said mr lewis , the marketing manager times are booming for a lot of people right now and i do n't want the politicians doing something that s going to put that at risk photo illinois annette abrams , left , charlotte rogers and denice mason said they dread the prospect of a sensational impeachment trial though the congressional district north of chicago is heavily republican , the recent calls to representative john porter s office have been as much against impeachment as for it \( paul meredith for the new york times \)
santo domingo , dominican republic , may 15 in politics here , personalities have always mattered more than parties so it should surprise no one that the death earlier this week of jose francisco pena gomez , one of the country s most popular and charismatic figures , has replaced the debate over any single issue as the focal point of elections scheduled for saturday the main leader of the leftcenter dominican revolutionary party for the last 25 years and three times a candidate for president of this caribbean nation , most recently in 1996 , mr pena gomez , 61 , was leading comfortably in the race for mayor of the capital when he died on sunday night of cancer three days of official mourning appear merely to have intensified doubts about the outcome of the balloting the results of the congressional and municipal vote are regarded as crucial to the fortunes of president leonel fernandez reyna , who is 18 months into his fouryear term mr fernandez s dominican liberation party , which came to power promising economic reforms and an end to official corruption , controls just 1 of 30 senate seats and only 10 of 120 seats in the lower house dominican and american officials have recently expressed concern at what they describe as an influx of campaign funds to both opposition parties from cocaine cartels in colombia and the united states , intended to thwart mr fernandez s efforts to battle drug trafficking and money laundering his government has also sought , with limited success , to make the dominican economy more attractive to foreign investment those questions have been suddenly overshadowed , however , by the outpouring of grief that has followed mr pena gomez s death a brilliant orator who endured racism and a grinding , almost dickensian poverty as a child , mr pena gomez became the standardbearer for many poor and black dominicans , who took encouragement and comfort from his rise to national prominence party leaders have sought to capitalize on that deeplyrooted affection by repeatedly broadcasting speeches from mr pena gomez s funeral , including one especially emotional tribute delivered by felipe gonzalez , the former prime minister of spain in addition , mr pena gomez s own campaign commercials have also continued to run on television and radio , most notably one showing him visibly ill and saying that he forgave those who had persecuted him that emotional message appears to have taken root among voters i did n't intend to vote , but the greatest homage i can pay to my leader is to vote for his slate , juan ramon custodio , a 23yearold grocery clerk , said thursday as he sold soft drinks to a customer he may have physically departed from this world , but i want his ideas to live on at the same time , tempers have been running high here all week mr fernandez was pelted with oranges and insults when he went to a stadium to pay his respects to mr pena gomez , and his vice president was spat at by supporters of mr pena gomez still resentful over their party s narrow defeats in 1994 and 1996 in a striking confirmation of the personalitybased foundation of dominican politics , mr pena gomez s party turned to a star from the entertainment world as his replacement the singer and band leader johnny ventura on the ticket with mr ventura , a former legislator whose image was already widely displayed in advertisements for whisky and other products , is none other than mr pena gomez s widow , peggy cabral both other major candidates also have showbusiness backgrounds former mayor rafael corporan de los santos is the host of a television variety program , while roberto salcedo , the choice of the president s party , is a television producer mr pena gomez s death occurred too late for its impact to show in opinion polls but the news magazine rumbo , said it was clear that his death opens the doors to substantial changes in the composition of dominican political leadership
rio de janeiro , feb 24 as marcia rodrigues , a former actress , neared the daunting threshold of her 50th birthday , the question she faced was not whether to have plastic surgery , but where she could have gone to the clinical equivalent of a fivestar hotel , with a minibar she would not drink from and a television she was unlikely to watch , as her doctor , jose de gervais jr , noted or she could go to the decidedly inelegant holy house hospital and , perhaps , lift her soul along with her face she would see the same surgeons at half the cost while helping subsidize surgery for the poor , who are treated in the same rooms on alternate days a day after ms rodrigues s surgery , it appeared that what had begun as a preoccupation with her looks had drawn her into a consideration of the problems of others , problems often hidden from her sitting up in bed , she traced a mended hole in the sheet by her knee i have so many friends with linens they do n't even use , she said i 'll bet i could get them to donate some brazil has long been the world capital of plastic surgery , with 200 , 000 operations performed a year , half of them in rio , said dr farid hakme , president of the brazilian association of plastic surgeons there are 1 , 000 practicing plastic surgeons in rio alone , most of them in one verdant neighborhood , botafogo , that is to the liposuction set what seventh avenue is to the fashion industry here at holy house , the brazilian knack for finding a jeito , or unconventional solution for a problem , uses the national obsession with beauty and the shrinking income of the middle class to offset , in a small way , an enduring crisis in public health care working with orthopedic surgeons , the same doctors who tuck tummies and straighten noses on tuesday and thursday mornings repair the fingers , hands and arms of the poor on the remaining mornings free of charge we 're operating on the one side with the super rich and on the other side with people who do n't have bus fare , dr de gervais said they 're two specialties linked by plastic surgery philanthropic medicine is not entirely uncommon in brazil holy house , run by the roman catholic franciscan order , is one of several private charities that have explored innovative ways to balance their books while serving the poor in another wing of the ornate , colonialera hospital , students of dr ivo pitanguy , one of the world s most famous plastic surgeons , practice his techniques in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery on the poor without charge although the public hospitals are theoretically responsible for treating brazilians covered by the government health care system , they are chaotic places riddled with dirty corridors the equipment is often broken , there is a shortage of medicine and supplies , and disposable items like gloves and needles get reused in january alone , 72 babies , most of them born prematurely , died in hospitals in rio de janeiro state patients like bruno alves da silveira , 12 , who damaged the nerve in a finger when he fell last month , are told they urgently need surgery , then turned away his grandmother , maria gonzales silveira , said she had gone to two public hospitals and one clinic in copacabana , which sent the boy to holy house here , we 're treated very well , she said this is really the best place , even better than the clinic dr paulo maracaja said that much of the work the team does for the poor is to correct the malpractice in public hospitals not that we do n't have good professionals in them , he said across the metal table where they gather to review cases scheduled for surgery , dr de gervais nodded in agreement what s missing is an infrastructure , he said the cases the halfdozen doctors reviewed on a recent morning included several children born with syndactylism , a genetic defect in which fingers are not completely separated , requiring a series of operations as a child grows a domestic worker with the tip of a sewing needle lodged near a nerve in her finger , and a vegetable peddler with leprosy whose hands had been cosmetically restored and whose tendons would be reconnected through microsurgery for each consultation or treatment session , the doctors said , they receive 175 from the government , and it usually takes four months for the money to arrive the hospital covers the base salaries of the nurses and orderlies , which each team of doctors supplements the doctors estimate their total direct reimbursement from the government at 270 a month the doctors working here do not receive salaries from the hospital or the government the unit relies on a donated xray machine , but has no darkroom a single strand of the extrafine thread used for stitches in microsurgery costs 130 thus the doctors turn to the moneyed few with sagging faces for one facelift the doctors did two the day before the unit receives 550 , while the surgeon , anesthesiologists and nurses who perform the procedure split the remaining 1 , 800 to 2 , 200 paid by the patient the fee would run twice that at one of the private clinics where the doctors also work for me , the decision was purely economic , ms rodrigues said dr maracaja said he found a certain balance with the two kinds of work cosmetic surgery is really very simple , but the people are very demanding , sometimes over things that make no sense , he said with hand and arm surgery , the people are simpler , but the techniques are more sophisticated none of the doctors here deride the pursuit of beauty as a lifetime s preoccupation , but in this famously playful city , they find a deeper purpose in their work among the poor the people we see for hand surgery , we 're giving them the chance to work , to play , dr de gervais said if they do n't have use of their hands , all they can do in their lives is beg photo brazil s obsession with beauty has made plastic surgery popular in rio de janeiro , but at holy house hospital there it subsidizes orthopedic surgery for the poor a doctor examined a boy with a broken wrist \( john maier jr for the new york times \)

washington , nov 13 the postelection consensus that republicans need a nicer smile and a softer touch has left representative peter hoekstra of michigan feeling a little bit discriminated against in the race against three women for a lowerlevel house leadership position i do hear it from some members , that you 've got to have a certain mix , a certain diversity in the lineup , mr hoekstra said , and added that the real question of fitness for the relatively obscure post was a performance issue the republicans party of quotas and affirmative action \? maybe not , but congressional republicans do seem to have got the idea that the many female voters who have been snubbing them at the polls might enjoy seeing more women in prominent positions a record five women are in leadership races in the house , where representative jennifer dunn of washington , who is running for majority leader , is the first woman in either party to pursue a top leadership job all the other women are in races near the bottom of the leadership ladder , running for posts that have been held by women in the past in the view of some , as a way to put women in the leadership team photo without giving them much to do but the women competing for leadership positions clearly do see their sex as a selling point right after they say that their being women is wholly irrelevant , they talk about why being women makes them better at listening , communicating and working well with others all areas in which there is general agreement that their party could use some work representative sue myrick of north carolina , one of three women competing for ms dunn s old job as vice chairwoman of the house republican conference , essentially a spokesman s position and well down the ladder of leadership posts , put it like this i think there are a lot of us that feel we bring a special let s not say special a different way of working being in congress , said ms myrick , former mayor of charlotte , is like raising your kids you 're always trying to get people to get along and males do n't always she said , trailing off for a moment well , we tend to be less confrontational ms dunn , too , boasts of extra prowess as a result of her sex just little things that come from listening well and finding out where the soft spots are , women are very good at that and many men are , too , said ms dunn , a former party worker in her home state , nodding to the overwhelming majority of voters in the upcoming house leadership elections who are , after all , male representative tillie fowler of florida , who is also running for the vice chairwoman s job , said , we 're better at balancing because we 've had to be ms fowler , a lawyer elected to congress after serving on the jacksonville city council , called herself a good coalition builder and she showed what might be considered a traditionally female sense of collegiality , saying my opponents are good , too we 'll have a good strong team no matter who gets elected the other female candidate for the vice chairwoman s post , representative anne m northup of kentucky , a former state legislator , said nothing about being a woman but talked up her ability to help broaden the party s appeal to minorities in the recent election , she boasted in a letter to colleagues , she increased her share of black voters to 18 percent , from 11 percent in 1996 , and promised to help do the same for the party when asked whether that 18 percent left rather a lot of room for improvement , she showed that nonconfrontational consensus builders can be snappish too yeah , she said , but i doubled it , and 50 percent is half , and for a traditional voting bloc that s so significantly tied to one party , that s a lot of progress in two years \( ms northup does have some relevant experience two of her six children are black , adopted by her and her husband we 've probably had every conversation around our table that you can have , she said \) barbara sinclair , a professor of political science at the university of california at los angeles who teaches courses on congress and women in american politics , notes that women have held various lowlevel posts since the 60 s without ever moving up the ladder professor sinclair said the historical record of women in congressional leadership was so scant that it s a good sign just that jennifer dunn is running and people are n't laughing at her way down the ticket , representative deborah pryce of ohio is keeping her job as conference secretary and the race between ms myrick , ms fowler , ms northup and mr hoekstra is so eclipsed by other races that simply asking members , what do you hear about the vice chair s race \? is good for a laugh still , if ms dunn succeeds , the post may come to be considered a good launching pad and former representative susan molinari of new york , who preceded ms dunn in that job , said any leadership position was important because it came with a seat at the meetings where all the important decisions were made if you 're at the table , you can foresee a problem coming , ms molinari said , recalling how , because she was in a leadership meeting , she was able to extract from a pending bill an amendment barring single people from adopting i could throw out there , while newt s at the table , 'is this really the message we want to send \? ' ms molinari said the problem of women climbing the leadership ladder in this particular congress might have more to do with ideology than sex the women tend to be moderate and prochoice , she said , so in a conservative , prolife conference , that becomes somewhat difficult ms dunn has a mixed voting record on abortionrights issues and for that reason is regarded with some suspicion by some in the conference ms northup and ms myrick oppose abortion rights , while ms fowler supports abortion rights but voted to ban certain lateterm abortions ms molinari and others said the position of women in the house had changed significantly in recent years it used to be that none of us wanted to be seen as women s candidates or as particularly involved in issues considered women s issues , she said but politics has changed so much that now men want to be the women s candidate they 're asking , 'can i get time to speak about breast cancer \? ' one group that is not necessarily ready to applaud diversity in the republican leadership team is the democratic caucus some feel a little embarrassed that republican leadership could include several women and a black man , representative j c watts of oklahoma , who is running against representative john a boehner of ohio as conference chairman while democrats seem prepared to choose five white males representative rosa delauro of connecticut is considered an underdog in the democratic race for caucus chairman against representative martin frost of texas , who raised money for house races as head of the democratic congressional conference committee and has enjoyed a share of the credit for the november elections ms delauro , too , was talking up her resume as a legislator , a leader and a woman women deal with consensus , she said it s important that the democratic leadership reflect the caucus and the people that elected us photo representative sue myrick of north carolina , right , is one of three women running for vice chairwoman of the republican conference she visited with a staff member , becci roberts , and ms roberts s newborn , connor \( stephen crowley the new york times \)

on tuesday , queens voters in the sixth congressional district will choose a replacement for the recently retired rev floyd flake they will not get much help from party labels assemblyman gregory meeks is the democratic nominee state senator alton waldon jr , a democrat , is running on the independent and conservative lines , even though he seems to agree with none of the conservative party s agenda barbara clark , the 21st century party candidate , is a democratic assemblywoman who formed her own party for this race celestine miller , a republican and a district school superintendent , was also a democrat until two months ago the republican party is pouring resources into ms miller s campaign her commitment to education is impressive , but on other issues she seems fuzzy she can best serve queens by continuing her important work in the schools the three democrats appear to be almost interchangeable in matters of issue and ideology they differ in style and , most important , in their political alliances this race is wound up with the ambitions of veteran queens politicians like the mayoral hopeful alan hevesi , the gubernatorial candidate peter vallone and mr flake , who has retired from congress but not from the political battlefield senator waldon feels he had the congressional nomination sewed up until the democratic powers joined forces to support mr meeks mr waldon has stories of political betrayal to tell , but his attempt to portray himself as the victimized independent are unrealistic voters who are looking for a politician who bucks the system will be more attracted to ms clark , who has gone her own way both in queens politics and in the state legislature shut out by her party , she did an impressive job of rallying her supporters and quickly collecting thousands of signatures to run as a thirdparty candidate mr meeks is most definitely not an outsider , but he does appear to be a selfstarter who maximizes his political opportunities during his five years in albany he has shown an impressive degree of energy while working on labor and transportation issues among four candidates with strong credentials , he seems most likely to thrive in the large and competitive arena of congressional politics our endorsement goes to gregory meeks

washington , sept 17 at a news conference on education legislation , the first question put to speaker newt gingrich this morning involved the white house scandal mr gingrich snapped at the questioner we in the congress are actually focusing on substance , he said yesterday , i spent less than 45 minutes total on the topic that interests you most that is the pose the speaker has tried to assume all week the impartial observer waiting for his lawyers on the judiciary committee to sort out the facts and set the policy on how to deal with president clinton s transgressions , while he deals with the people s business but behind the scenes , other republican lawmakers said , not a step is taken or a decision made without the approval of mr gingrich , possibly the most partisan and certainly the most dominant speaker in the last generation look , the speaker is the speaker , said the chairman of an important committee who insisted on anonymity he calls all the shots if tapes are going to be released , it s his decision if hearings are going to be held , he will decide he consults with us he listens to us but he makes the calls at a closed meeting of house republicans on wednesday , representative nancy l johnson of connecticut expressed concern about the release of sexually explicit portions of the videotape of the president s grand jury testimony mr gingrich angry , according to the accounts of some who were there , or merely firm , according to those of others leapt to his feet and declared that the house had already voted to make the material public and that republicans were not going to back down in the face of complaints from the white house and democrats in congress mr gingrich called the president a misogynist , a person who hates women at the same meeting , representative gerald b h solomon of upstate new york , the chairman of the rules committee , repeated a point mr gingrich had made in a speech last week and reminded his colleagues that house rules did not permit language in floor debates that ridiculed or otherwise abused the president there was a smattering of boos , clearly in jest , from the back of the room , said people who were there mr gingrich , they said , declared sternly that decorum in the house was not a laughing matter and that he would not allow the rules to be abridged when mr gingrich walked out of the meeting and into a gaggle of reporters and cameras , he made a conspicuous show of talking about other issues trade and the economy and even praised mr clinton s efforts to renew world economic growth when reporters persisted in asking questions about impeachment and videotaped testimony , representative john a boehner , republican of ohio , pushed the speaker from the microphone so that staff members could usher him away it is very important to us that newt lie low , said a republican representative from the southeast this congressman explained that mr gingrich often came across to the public as strident and even mean and that if the speaker allowed himself to stand at the forefront of the clinton inquiry , the president and his allies would benefit by making him a lightning rod for their criticism of congress mr gingrich is under conflicting pressures the firebrands among the backbenchers want to go after president clinton with all the artillery in the house s arsenal but the speaker s political advisers are telling him , a former staff assistant said , that if he has any ambition to become president , this is his opportunity to dispel a reputation as a hothead and adopt the mien of a statesman one republican congressman suggested halfseriously that the most advantageous step the speaker could take would be to save mr clinton s presidency it might not be best for the country , the congressman said , but they would have a cripple as president going into the next election , and newt would go down as a profile in courage with all that in mind , mr gingrich tended carefully this week to the ceremonial and legislative aspects of his job he spoke at a conference on missile defense , received a hispanic heritage leadership award and another award from the community antidrug coalition , met with chief executives of some of the united states' largest companies , attended news conferences on education , agriculture policy and prayer in schools , appeared on the capitol steps with representatives of habitat for humanity and taped an interview for a cable television documentary on the 100 people who have the most influence on american society for the most part , mr gingrich stayed on message , but occasionally he let slip oblique mentions of the subject that must be on his mind , too speaking extemporaneously at a news conference on wednesday about a proposed

rock hill , sc , nov 2 over a steaming plate of baked beans and southernstyle barbecue , mark penny , a republican precinct chairman here , was shaking his head today over new republican attack ads that seek to exploit president clinton s sex scandal it s a waste of money , mr penny , a 63yearold retired real estate dealer , said of one television spot that asked if president clinton should be rewarded for not telling the truth he added , whatever turnout we have will be from people voting their convictions , not from negative advertisements but national republican campaign strategists are betting otherwise here in south carolina s fifth congressional district , one of 30 targets in a 10 million nationwide campaign , republicans hope the advertisements will stir up their base and help their underdog challenger , mike burkhold , oust the eightterm democratic incumbent , john m spratt jr congressional republicans have long coveted this democratic outpost in one of the nation s most conservative states , especially since republican presidential hopefuls from ronald reagan to george bush to bob dole have prevailed here indeed , republican luminaries newt gingrich , oliver l north and marilyn quayle have campaigned in recent weeks for mr burkhold , a 29yearold former town administrator and specialtyfoods company executive last weekend , the national republican congressional committee flooded the district with mailings that contended there s not a dime s worth of difference between mr spratt and president clinton the leaflets sought to tar mr spratt as a supporter of mr clinton s liberal social and proabortion agendas our base is not happy with bill clinton , said mr burkhold , who joined mr spratt in donning an apron and serving up coleslaw and iced tea at a charity barbecue today at sullivan middle school we need to get our base out to win mr burkhold , who acknowledged that he had not seen any of the advertisements and learned of them last week from a reporter , discounted any backlash from voters sick of impeachment talk he said democrats here were too disgusted to defend mr clinton or his surrogates but the district is about onethird black , so the potential for energizing the other party s voters is there none of this seems to worry , mr spratt , 56 , who after traversing his district , from this republicanleaning suburb of charlotte , nc , to the dusty old democratic textile towns to the east , said , if the effects of this ad campaign are out there , i do n't sense it nor do many republicans who plan to vote for mr burkhold , but not because of some lastminute prodding i do n't put much stock in that , said matt england , a 49yearold contractor i do n't pay much attention to those negative ads some republican voters here say the commercials will be just the tonic to turn the tide their way they 'll agitate a good many people , said mary rawls , a retired teacher who has lived here for 60 years ruthie helms , a 36yearold building inspector , and her two children , trey , 12 , and taylor , 5 , wore i like mike buttons democrats are in trouble this year , and this will hurt the whole democratic ticket , ms helms said it will be difficult to stick a label of taxandspend liberal on mr spratt , a centrist and one of only 31 democrats who voted last month to begin formal impeachment proceedings against mr clinton mr spratt also played an important role in last year s balancedbudget compromise , is hawkish on defense , and serves on a special house panel investigating whether china improperly obtained sensitive american technology the republicans would like to tie spratt close to clinton , but that 'll be hard to do , said marty mobley , a 46yearold electrical engineer mr burkhold has run hard on a theme of new energy , new leadership , borrowing a page from representative bob inglis , the republican congressman who is challenging senator ernest f hollings in a titanic battle for the senate seat here until a few weeks ago , mr burkhold favored an upbeat campaign that focused on lower taxes , prayer in public schools and less federal government even mr spratt s campaign manager , matt kuhn , complimented the challenger s serious tone but things have turned nasty republicans last week broadcast a spot challenging mr spratt s record on school prayer mr spratt said the advertisements were false and demanded that they be pulled mr burkhold at first distanced himself from the spots , noting that they were paid for by his party , but after viewing them said he did not find them inappropriate to be effective , the new television commercials dwelling on mr clinton must attract attention , but this area is saturated with spots for contested races for governor and senator in north and south carolina it s deadening the message , said glen broach , chairman of the political science department at winthrop university here the effects of these ads will be marginal photos mike burkhold , a republican , left , and representative john m spratt jr , a democrat , at a barbecue yesterday in rock hill , sc \( photographs by andy burriss the herald \)
to the editor i read your article on the manipulation of restaurant checks with special interest because i make it a practice of checking my receipts against my credit card statement , as i have had several instances where some wise guy waiter has upped the amount tipped but one point not covered in your article is the theft of credit card numbers by waiters not too long ago , after using my american express card to pay for dinner at a long island restaurant , i started to get written confirmation from various airlines for flights none of which i had made which had all been charged to my american express card i called american express s fraud division and found that someone in boston had , within a threeday period , bought more than 6 , 000 worth of plane tickets using my credit card number all the charges were made by phone or computer since i had possession of the card , and because of the dates involved and the fact that i had not used my card since dining at the restaurant , the american express representative speculated that a waiter had copied my charge number , phoned someone in boston and sold the number chester robert forest hills , queens
schumann symphony no 4 furtwangler symphony no 2 berlin philharmonic conducted by wilhelm furtwangler deutsche grammophon 289 457 7222 two cd s there are many monuments to wilhelm furtwangler s storied association with the berlin philharmonic , but none better than a 1953 recording of schumann s fourth symphony now , as part of its laudable originals series , deutsche grammophon has paired this work with furtwangler s own second symphony it is an inspired coupling , for hearing furtwangler the composer alongside furtwangler the conductor makes for an absorbing and illuminating experience though the second symphony had its premiere in 1948 , it could have been written 70 years before this recording , with the conductor s beloved berliners , dates from 1952 brucknerian in language and length , the work takes more than 80 minutes to unfurl wags may question whether furtwangler had ever heard of schoenberg or webern when he wrote this piece the point is , he pretended he had n't yet one must n't sell the symphony short , even if posterity has largely abandoned it the lush string writing and soaring brass lines , for instance , possess undeniable hyperromantic pull and though the work is broad in scope , there are many intimate and touching moments moreover , furtwangler s obvious grasp of symphonic structure and his ability to perceive both the big picture and the tiny details marked his interpretations in the music of other , greater composers nowhere is that more apparent than in the schumann , which the conductor infuses with engrossing bite has anyone ever led the scherzo with more passion and precision \? and in the finale , one stands mute as furtwangler effortlessly blends gravity and levity beethoven 'diabelli variations' bagatelles \( op 119 \) andrei vieru , piano harmonia mundi france hmc 901613 cd like bach s goldberg variations , beethoven s variations on a waltz by diabelli present pianists with a host of technical and interpretive challenges and like the goldberg variations , the diabelli variations have been well served on record more s the pity , then , that this new account by the rumanianborn pianist andrei vieru proves unsatisfying mr vieru s approach to the piece , which consists of a theme and 33 variations , is tentative and distended , and his tone , though not unattractive , is indistinct even in the work s final pages , where artists like artur schnabel and wilhelm backhaus hold listeners rapt , this pianist finds nothing extraordinary his meditations are vapid would that mr vieru could summon some of the confidence one hears in alfred brendel s 1976 live recording , which is unfortunately available only as part of an expensive boxed set , or the tightly sprung energy that suffuses stephen kovacevich s 1968 recording , now , sadly , out of print it is worth noting that at nearly 63 minutes , mr vieru s diabelli recording does not rival a 1956 version by the french pianist yvonne lefebure , who says twice as much in less the half the time mr vieru fills out his disk with beethoven s 11 bagatelles \( op 119 \) here , too , he sounds timid in the short piece headed risoluto , he ambles by contrast , mr brendel , on a recent philips release , gallops to top it off , this cd s acoustic is curiously distant , as though the playing were coming from a neighbor s hifi if only !
with congress in recess , washington is filled with threats of another government shutdown over the budget in october underneath the surface , however , a fragile majority of moderate democrats and republicans is emerging in both the senate and house that could set a less confrontational tone when lawmakers return in september on budget issues , moderate republicans are warning sensibly against big new tax cuts and spending reductions in essential areas it would be healthy for republican leaders to pay attention passage of the shaysmeehan campaign finance legislation owed much to independentminded republicans in the house this year in that vote , more than 60 republicans ignored speaker newt gingrich and voted with the democrats an equally large bloc of republican moderates voted with house democrats recently to save the national endowment for the arts and defeat a gaybashing amendment pushed by social and religious conservatives moderates in the senate , especially veterans of past budget battles like pete domenici and william roth , refuse to go along with the big tax cuts advocated by the budgetcutters in the house fights between republican moderates and conservatives have so tied up the budget this year that none of the 13 appropriations bills financing the government after the end of september have been passed by both houses of congress and sent to president clinton congressional republicans could not even agree on an overall budget resolution meanwhile , moderates in the senate support full funding for the international monetary fund to help it deal with the asian economic collapse house conservatives seem more in the thrall of the isolationism of dick armey , who recently commented i 've been to europe once i do n't have to go again the white house may be in crisis but can count on the country rallying against another budget siege by republicans , shutting down the government as they did in 1995 last week , when some house republicans were saying that this time they could reap political gains from a shutdown , it was mr gingrich s turn to cringe the title of his recent book , after all , is lessons learned the hard way the paradox of this moment is that while the conservatives brought mr gingrich to power , the moderates are the ones who learned the lessons
toronto , june 30 there is no good time to have a bad outing but in rick reed s case , this was a particularly bad time reed s manager , bobby valentine , made a special plea today during a pair of telephone conversations with manager jim leyland of the marlins on behalf of two mets pitchers valentine badly wants leyland to name to his national league staff for next week s allstar game reed and john franco unfortunately for reed , for his manager and for the mets reed had one of his worst outings of the year the righthander s strength is his precision but tonight , he kept getting his pitches up in four innings against the blue jays at skydome , reed allowed nine hits and six runs , including a careerhigh four home runs , all with two out meanwhile , toronto s righthander roger clemens struck out 11 mets and limited them to 6 hits over 141 pitches as the blue jays won , 63 earlier in the day , valentine who also made a strong case for his closer , franco had tried to assure leyland that reed could pitch an inning next tuesday in denver , even though he is scheduled to start in atlanta on sunday , the final day before the allstar game break but reed \( 95 \) , so reliable for the mets this year , was barely able to make it through four innings tonight if you could find a hole , you 'd want to crawl in it , reed said but there are n't any holes out there except the ones reed dug for himself he was staked to a 10 lead in the second inning on john olerud s second triple of the season and bernard gilkey s runscoring groundout the two triples matched a season high for the 29yearold first baseman , who was making his first appearance here since spending the first eight seasons of his career with the blue jays olerud was not in the original lineup , but was inserted after matt franco fouled a pitch off the fourth toe on his right foot during batting practice and took himself out of the lineup xrays showed the toe was broken , and franco could be placed on the disabled list wednesday the mets' run in the second was all they got off clemens \( 96 \) until brian mcrae drilled his fourth home run in eight games , with one aboard in the seventh that made it 63 by that time , reed was long gone he had surrendered just 6 home runs in 109 innings this season before darrin fletcher drilled a 408foot , tworun shot in the second to give toronto a 21 lead then jose canseco \( the 375th of his career \) and carlos delgado hit backtoback blasts in the third , and alex gonzalez unloaded with a runner on in the fourth to give clemens a 61 lead not since april 9 , reed s second start of the season , had he allowed so many runs or pitched fewer than six innings in a start instead of winning his 10th game and enriching his allstar credentials , reed saw his 231 earned run average rise to 271 he s pitched like an allstar for me , valentine said he had a bad night he just had one of those nights he threw a couple of curveballs , and they ended up in the seats inside pitch in making a strong push for john franco to be named an allstar for the first time since 1990 , manager bobby valentine said he s a guy who has been a victim of circumstance more than anybody else if he does n't make it , i think it s a crying shame when asked how he would feel if none of his pitchers were selected , valentine said that wo n't happen that s inconceivable mark mimbs , a 29yearold lefthander who was 92 with an international leagueleading 208 earned run average at class aaa norfolk , has accepted an offer to pitch for the orix blue wave in japan we really did n't think he had the kind of quality we wanted throwing on our staff , valentine said of mimbs he was very good at class aaa but he spent nine years at aaa jim tatum cleared waivers and was outrighted to norfolk tatum has four days to report , but plans to file a grievance with the players union , claiming he has a knee injury al leiter , who is out 4 to 6 weeks with a partial tear of the patella tendon in his left knee , changed his mind and decided to accompany the mets on this trip todd hundley was charged with an error on sunday and monday , one in right field , one in left , in his effort to adapt to the outfield at class a st lucie he s made some good plays and some not so good plays , as expected , general manager steve phillips said his arm will be playable he just needs some more playing time as for whether that will include a stint at class aaa , phillips said , it s not necessary , i do n't think , unless somebody convinces me otherwise in st lucie s 31 victory over lakeland on tuesday , hundley went 0 for 2 with two walks as the designated hitter photo the blue jays' roger clemens struck out 11 mets last night and limited new york to six hits as toronto won clemens s record moved to 96 \( associated press \)
pelham all that food and not a crumb to eat this is the situation at the pelham art center here yet , it hardly matters if we , the people , are no longer capable of just enjoying our food , having decided that to pig out is to pay later or so says dominick lombardi , who , impressed by this dilemma , has gathered images of food by 25 artists , adding an introduction , which in effect asks , how come \? nevertheless , the curator titles the show obsession \( food \) , which suggests that he regards the subject as a freudian misdemeanor rather than a sin , and the penalties he lists anxiety , heartburn and feelings of inferiority fall far short of fire and brimstone nor is there a hint of judgment in the works selected they range from a can of campbell s soup autographed by andy warhol and a lithographed closeup of spaghetti and tomato sauce by james rosenquist to small , ethereal paintings of meat and fruit by john wilde , and the exhibition includes prints , photographs , sculptures and assemblages , some humorous , others somber the piece de resistance , however , is peter rittmaster s installation of 31 castiron skillets filled with food that is garnished with dolls' heads and limbs this is all very appetizing until the viewer realizes that the dolls are no garnish but actual ingredients , that the limbs replace shrimp , the truncated torsos chicken breasts and , worst of all , the spot of blue in each freshly opened oyster is a glass eyeball mr rittmaster has his own agenda , and he meets it with grisly inventiveness and a statement that defiantly quotes the culinary advice of the likes of julia child and martha stewart sad to say , this does not mention the time mrs child dropped some fish on the floor and retrieved it , saying , remember , you are alone in the kitchen mr rittmaster s own cooking is both funny and picturesque but there is too much of it , and eventually i was compelled to move on by a churning stomach the last time i saw robert zott s work was in 1995 when , inspired by names on tombstones that were also the names of colors , he photographed them in black and white so that the tone of each print corresponded with the color symbolized he had also perfected a style of assemblage , which involved nuts , bolts , screws and lengths of cable all straight from their respective factories not one to give up easily , mr zott now offers black and whites of graves unbelievably named for fries , soda and other fast foods and suspended on gleaming springs in wellcrafted boxes having enjoyed the idea the first time around , it pains me to say that it now seems little more than a trick with a very short shelf life having carved a brioche in fine grained wood , holly lane lays it on a slab of marble supported by a more or less classical pedestal and attaches the whole thing , sconce like , to a wall jeremy commins carves replicas of franks in blankets also in wood but having skewered them with toothpicks , offers them , as it were , piping hot on a tray apparently unconcerned with stimulating the appetite , judy haberl offers a caseful of sausages disguised by pearls and colored stones and a silver tray piled high with babalike confections in synthetic stone peter anton is in a class of his own with a huge and convincing salmon head presented supermarket style in a cardboard dish complete with price , bar code and polyethylene shroud a carver with a subtle sense of humor , david terry contributes two lidded containers , one in white marble , the other in marble dabbed with reddish brown pigment and both striated with geometrical patterns it takes a while to recognize them for the fastfood containers they are although the real joke is in the titles , since the one for the colored piece is africanamerican while that for the white version is americaid masami togoka parodies hokusai with a color woodcut of a woman in a kimono slurping ice cream , which the title identifies as today s special steven skollar paints a policeman doing the same thing against a background of houses borrowed from edward hopper heather allen is no diane arbus , but she nonetheless pairs food with the people who eat it , as in the color shot of a lobster and a black and white of the man who demolished it treating obsession with food as if it were a peculiarly american weakness , mr lombardi attributes it to the kind of advertising that taunts its victims with visions of ideal bodies to be obtained by exercise or diet , on the barbie doll who gets them young but who always strikes me as a potential ax murderer i think he should have reflected on some of the historical precedents , notably that set by the victorians who were able to eat breakfast consisting of three or four courses , none of them fruit in a country ruled by a queen whose favorite painter was the master of dead game , edwin landseer , and whose privileged classes were egged on to indulgence by a seemingly boundless supply of food , not to mention mrs beeton s instructions on how to prepare it , such accomplishments were par for the course still , the show that tells the whole story is not to be imagined and , as it is , obsession \( food \) is definitely not a spectacle for the hungry the closing date is may 28 the number to call for information is 7382525 photos cream of wheat with milk fed babies , homage to fannie farmer , by peter rittmaster , above containing desire and appetite , metal , by julia m jiannacopoulos , left , and franks in blankets , wood , by jeremy commins , all part of obsession \( food \) at the pelham art center
the proposed 80 billion merger between exxon and mobil raises a question at what point does a company get so big that its size alone becomes a nightmare for consumers \? critics of the deal have called it rockefeller s revenge , contending that this and other oil mergers threaten to stitch back together the pieces of the standard oil company , broken up in 1911 but the historical analogy is vapid exxonmobil would control only about 13 percent of the american market besides , it is the organization of petroleum exporting countries , not private oil companies , that controls 40 percent of the world oil market and sets price and output targets as a group , the private companies help keep opec in line , but none controls much of anything it is for those reasons that morris adelman , an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology , regards the expected antitrust investigation by the federal trade commission as an exercise in trivial pursuit mr adelman no doubt exaggerates but the commission would be hard pressed to persuade a court to block the merger for starters , bigness is irrelevant to the antitrust law only competition matters and while companies have grown bigger over the decades , markets have not grown significantly less competitive in effect , there are more big companies competing against one another f michael scherer of harvard university provides unpublished estimates of the trends in concentration in 1947 , he calculates , around 25 percent of the nation s manufacturing output came from highly concentrated industries by 1992 , the number had risen to only about 28 percent measured differently , the four largest manufacturing companies in an industry typically controlled about 35 percent of sales in 1947 by 1972 , the percentage had risen to 39 percent and did not budge through 1992 in the case of oil , there is also evidence that bigness helps consumers matthew simmons , an energy investment banker , says that data from company reports show that the largest oil companies spend less on exploration and production for every barrel of oil than do smaller companies philip verleger , a senior adviser to the brattle group , an economic consulting firm in cambridge , mass , argues that mergers , by cutting exploration and production costs , will ultimately lead to lower prices for consumers he also argues oil companies have to become huge , undertaking many projects , in order to spread the risk of putting up the vast sums of money that are now required to explore for oil reserves laying pipeline from the caspian sea through turkey , or drilling more than a thousand feet down in the gulf of mexico require investments measured in the billions indeed , it takes huge investment just to stay alive in the oil business the simmons data show that 10 large oil companies have spent over 26 billion a year over the last 10 years to raise output by a mere 1 percent a year , a process mr simmons describes as running just to stay in place but do the large companies achieve low production costs because they are large , or are these companies large because they knew how to find and drill oil cheaply \? and there are also reasons to be skeptical about some of the industry s claims companies the size of mobil that contend that they cannot find the money to make risky investments make little sense , mr adelman says oil companies have been allowed to create joint ventures , free of antitrust challenge , to explore for oil in specific locations they do not need to merge their entire operations with the exxonmobil merger , there are uncontroversial antitrust issues that the commission will handle with relative ease there are regions , like the northeast , where a combination of the two companies would monopolize the retail gas market their refineries dominate parts of the south but the commission has a good record of forcing companies that merge to sell gas stations , refineries and terminals to preserve competition exxon and mobil expect such orders but the issue at the exploration and production end of the industry cannot be so easily resolved perhaps the easiest way to think about the commission s deliberations is to imagine the world oil market after asia rebounds and oil prices begin to recover from their recent 40 percent nose dive at that point , would opec have a harder time imposing its will on the market if it faced competition from eight major private oil companies , as would be true today , or if the number of competitors shrank by two , assuming british petroleum is allowed to merge with amoco and exxon to merge with mobil \? said another way , would opec plus six be substantially worse for consumers than opec plus eight \? the problem gets more complicated still , given that saudi arabia has recently hinted that it may be prepared to invite the major companies back into their domestic oil operations mr adelman loses no sleep over the prospect of opec plus six other economists are less sure if the economics of the exxonmobil merger poses no grave threat , there is a danger nonetheless the threat to consumers of huge companies can be offset by the presence of rivals , big or small but there is no similar offset in the political sphere given the nation s porous campaign finance laws , huge companies exert oversized influence that is not a problem the antitrust laws can or should solve but it goes a long way to explain why megamergers make americans cringe even if , as mr adelman says , the economic threat is minute

brussels , sunday , may 3 a bold european union plan to begin a common currency among 11 countries next year got underway this morning after temporarily running aground over a dispute between france and germany about who should run the new european central bank instead of celebrating economic and political unity by formally proclaiming the plan on saturday afternoon , leaders of the 15 european union countries spent hours in bitter argument between the two countries that have been at the heart of the european idea for decades france , apparently alone , had insisted that wim f duisenberg of the netherlands , the germanbacked candidate to head the central bank that will run the new currency , the euro , should agree in writing to retire four years after the start of an eightyear term so that the president of france s central bank , jeanclaude trichet , could take over germany balked , citing the statutory eightyear term of the european bank s president and concerned about any compromise that would turn the euro into a poor substitute for the german mark the dispute was finally resolved at midnight by an agreement to appoint mr duisenberg to an eightyear term after he suddenly let it be known that he planned to retire of his own free will by mid2002 , but gave no date , satisfying the german demand that none be specified the wrangling was an inauspicious start to a project intended to be a signal demonstration of european political will to become an economic superpower as strong as the united states and it could weaken european currencies against the dollar when the financial markets open on monday there are no reasons for laughing , president jacques chirac of france chided reporters who hooted when mr chirac told them that he and his fellow leaders had decided that mr trichet would replace mr duisenberg in about four years jose maria gil robles , president of the european parliament , which has to ratify today s agreements later this month , said , let us hope that the baby which has been born in such bad form can recover the countries taking part in the new currency are austria , belgium , finland , france , germany , ireland , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain britain , denmark and sweden decided not to join and greece did not meet the criteria i want to make the process irreversible , chancellor helmut kohl had said of the often tortuous emergence of european unification , but even he described saturday night s discussions as combative he sees european unity as the best guarantee against the wars that devastated the continent twice in the first half of the century but as the latest dispute showed , the barriers were formidable creating a central bank before a political union has never been done before in europe the european union has often failed to agree on common foreign or security policies , as in bosnia during the war there setting up a common currency means that countries with very different economic needs will be bound by one common economic policy that has already exacted political consequences the french public s dissatisfaction with the austerity measures the government proposed to keep its budget deficit low enough to qualify to join the euro was a major reason the gaullist party lost in elections last spring such tensions are bound to arise in the future what if one country s economy is doing well , but another s needs relief \? one policy will have to fit all , whether unemployment is at 6 percent , as in austria now , or 22 percent , as in spain in effect , the countries are giving up some part of their sovereignty to a central bank one reason why britain has resisted joining yet president jacques chirac of france was insistent on making mr trichet , 55 , a candidate for the presidency of the european central bank even after all the other countries and their central bankers had agreed on mr duisenberg , 63 alistair campbell , spokesman for prime minister tony blair of britain , whose country presided over the heated closed discussions , said mr duisenberg had agreed to step down after the euro actually replaces the franc , the mark and other national currencies in mid2002 but germany , where popular resistance to the new currency is strong and mr kohl is battling against the odds for election to a fifth term in september , backed mr duisenberg in refusing to agree in writing to a specific date , officials said the bank s charter , the 1992 treaty on european union , specifies that the president s term is eight years mr duisenberg has indicated he does n't want to stay for a full term , mr campbell said mr duisenberg should decide when he goes , rather than politicians but peter praet , a belgian economist , said the central bank will have to recover from this attack on its credibility the damage is done any damage will be attributed to france , which more than any other country wants a strong euro to stand up to the dollar on world markets the nations that join the common currency have agreed to keep their budget deficits to 3 percent of their gross national product germany insisted on that stiff requirement because of concerns about giving up its strong mark that requirement has caused years of antiinflationary , deficitcutting policies by countries that wanted to join the euro those austerity measures , skeptics say , have taken a terrible political and economic toll , causing governments to fall , driving unemployment up to double digits and dooming much of the continent to years of stagnation
regina , saskatchewan , june 18 it has become a regular , almost routine , occurrence another day , another record low for the canadian dollar the recurring declines that have sent canada s currency to one low after another since the beginning of this year might have caused a panic in many countries , especially in these jittery economic times when fluctuations in the japanese yen or the thai baht send shivers throughout the world but this is calm , collected , canada its currency is worth around 68 american cents today , just above the record low yet , despite the best attempts of chauvinist columnists and allnews radio stations to stir things up every time the canadian dollar weakens , canadians are acting as though pretty much nothing has happened indeed , not only have most canadians blandly tolerated the latest , relatively modest , decline of their dollar popularly known as the loonie because the dollar coin bears the image of a common loon on one side some are even cheering the currency s steady fall every time i see the loonie fall i think 'yes ! all right ! ' , said jack degelman , a manufacturer and exporter of farm equipment in regina , saskatchewan having a lousy dollar definitely helps us out a lousy canadian dollar makes products like the rock pickers produced by degelman industries ltd cheaper for buyers with american dollars , and mr degelman s sales have been on the rise since more than 80 percent of canadian exports go to the united states , the lopsided exchange rate helps lift the entire manufacturing and export sector that has given ottawa one big reason not to do much to keep the loonie from sinking besides , the overall canadian economy continues to be strong , with low inflation , attractive growth and the first balanced budget in decades but while exporters may laud the currency s depreciation and record numbers of american tourists discover how much further their dollars can go north of the border plenty of canadians are feeling some pain even with slight improvements that have , at least for now , pushed the loonie back up over 68 cents , importers have watched their profit margins shrink drastically canadians who usually flock to florida and other warm spots in the united states are cutting their trips short or flying directly to mexico , where the canadian dollar continues to hold its own against the peso the toronto blue jays , with their 50 million payroll in american dollars , buy greenbacks months in advance as a safeguard against further currency shocks despite the depreciation , prices have not yet increased substantially for all the imported food , clothing and other items that canadians buy every day but business is warning consumers to be prepared canada is a big importing nation , said robert j armstrong , president of the canadian importers association , an industry group apparel , footware , appliances , electronic goods , food stuffs we 're all going to have to pay a higher price this winter mr armstrong said the federal government had not acted to arrest the dollar s slide because it was focusing almost entirely on the export part of the economy without taking into account how badly the rest of canada was hurting we ca n't cope with a dollar this low , he said it s not good for the country but his pleas are falling on mostly deaf ears government economists preach pragmatism and patience canada s official policy is to let the market set the value of the loonie against the united states dollar and other currencies while the rate is supposed to float freely , the bank of canada the country s central bank can influence currency exchange rates by raising or lowering interest rates , which now stand at 441 percent for threemonth treasury bills \( compared with 518 percent for united states tbills \) fundamentally , a weaker canadian dollar reflects the declining competitiveness of canadian industry and an oversupply of the natural resources that canada produces in abundance officials argue that allowing the loonie to weaken is the least damaging way to deal with the situation and contend that trying to artificially support it with higher rates would be much worse , hammering investment and consumer spending on bigticket items occasionally , the central bank has intervened in the open market to buy back canadian dollars but it does so rarely , and then only to stabilize the currency on a particularly volatile day , not to rebuild its value the bank of canada enjoys a high degree of independence but it is more under the influence of the elected government than is the federal reserve in the united states canada s minister of finance appoints directors , who in turn select a bank governor in the case of disputes over policy , by law it is the government , through the finance minister , and not the bank of canada , that has final say the last time one canadian dollar was worth one american dollar was in late 1976 since then , the loonie has continuously lost ground , though it had generally stabilized from early 1994 to last summer , when the decline resumed but the decline has been gradual , minimizing the impact and even this year , while the exchange rate has bounced through several record lows , the cumulative depreciation so far is under 3 percent , far less than the huge declines of several asian currencies in the last year
atlanta , sept 18 while moving about his congressional district here last weekend , just after the release of kenneth w starr s report , representative john lewis was struck by the universality of support for president clinton that he found among black atlantans he heard it at bobby s barber shop he heard it at a candidates' forum at the ben hill recreation center he heard it at a community festival in candler park people would say , 'take care of the president , take care of my man , ' said mr lewis , a democrat who is black they do n't want to see him resign they do n't want to see him impeached they just want us to leave him alone because there s this deep feeling in the black community that this president has been there for us after a week devoted to assessing public opinion about mr clinton s involvement with monica s lewinsky , perhaps the most striking findings have been the circlethewagons defense of mr clinton by black americans and the undeniable racial gap between the views of whites and blacks polls conducted after the release of the whitewater independent counsel s report show that blacks are far more likely than whites to approve of mr clinton s job performance , to regard him favorably , to trust him to keep his word , to blame his enemies for his problems and to oppose his resignation or impeachment even within the president s own party , black democrats are significantly more supportive than their white counterparts in dozens of interviews this week , black americans ranging from julian bond , the chairman of the naacp , to the comedian chris rock cited everything from mr clinton s choice of friends to his choice of musical instruments in explaining that he has connected with minorities , both politically and viscerally , in a manner never achieved by previous presidents and while blacks , like most americans , are deeply disturbed by his infidelity and recklessness , they are not willing to jettison what they see as a unique relationship in exchange for an uncertain and potentially threatening future many of those interviewed remarked on the ease with which mr clinton moves in black circles , noting that he golfs with vernon e jordan jr , that he and his family seek spiritual counsel from the rev jesse jackson and that he sings in black churches without the aid of a hymnal many said there seemed to be a guiltless and unpatronizing egalitarianism in mr clinton s relationships with blacks that reflected his standing as the first president to come of age after the demise of legalized segregation what he has been able to project , unlike any other president in recent memory , is that he is completely and totally comfortable with black americans , said george c wolfe , producer of the joseph papp public theaternew york shakespeare festival it is not something that had to be negotiated or learned the rev joseph e lowery , the recently retired president of the southern christian leadership conference , said he knew perfectly well why black americans were more forgiving of mr clinton s transgressions than white americans it s the saxophone , mr lowery said , with an impish sound in his voice the man has soul most minorities clearly admire the president s defense of affirmative action , his appointments of black officials and judges and his eagerness to confront racism but their support for him is not simply a reflection of loyalty and political selfinterest it is also the product of distinct cultural traits born of the black experience in the united states , including a broad distrust of prosecutors , an instinctive empathy for the persecuted and a spiritual emphasis on forgiveness and redemption , many africanamericans said mr rock , the hot young comedian , goes so far as to describe mr clinton as the first black president because , he said , his every move is scrutinized he got his hair cut for 200 and people lost their minds , mr rock said in his trademark screech it s very simple black people are used to being persecuted hence , they relate to clinton alvin f poussaint , a black professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school , said some minorities were so aware of mr clinton s seeming affinity with black people that they circulate rumors that he must have had black ancestry and in a poll last year , the joint center for political and economic studies found that mr clinton was more popular among blacks than either mr jackson or gen colin l powell , the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff what s more , many of those interviewed said they not only subscribed to hillary rodham clinton s statement that a vast rightwing conspiracy had been directed against her husband but also that they believed the conspirators were motivated by a desire to reverse the gains made by blacks during the clinton administration you just ca n't help but think that some of this is racebased , said mr bond in civil rights terms , this guy s a liberal , and there s a part of the body politic that just ca n't stand this they have been determined to bring him down from the very first
newark the cherry blossoms are blossoming here in branch brook park the shad have started swimming up the delaware to spawn pollen floats through the air , irritating noses , making eyes burn red yes , spring is here and it is early , very early remember when there used to be four seasons \? last week s cold snap notwithstanding , meteorologists are ready to declare this the winter that never was september somehow turned into march , pausing , it seemed , only briefly for new year s day , the one day this winter when the temperature in newark stayed below freezing for an entire 24 hours at newark international airport , for the first time on record , there was no measurable snow in the month of february , according to paul knight , a meteorologist at pennsylvania state university this followed a january in which average daily temperatures were 85 degrees above normal while there may have been no complaints from household snow shovelers and heating oil customers , for businesses that rely on wintry weather , the unseasonably warm temperatures , lack of snow and heavy rain made this the worst winter ever , economically speaking all but one of new jersey s handful of ski slopes have already closed for the year it s hurt a lot of people who sort of count on snow , said don benanti , whose new brunswick concrete company , d f benanti inc , also does snow plowing and removal there is an economic domino effect , mr benanti said body shops do n't have the work they used to have from fender benders the auto parts places are n't selling parts to the body shops it just mushrooms from one thing to another even though the warm temperatures might have permitted it , the heavy rains often prevented construction companies from working through the winter mr knight , the meteorologist , offered an expert assessment things turned to mush pretty quickly , he said in a normal winter in newark , there would be 22 days when the temperature remained solidly below freezing for an entire 24 hours , mr knight said this year , there was only new year s day , which was followed by a warm spell and temperatures as high as 60 degrees the only snow to fall in urban , northeastern new jersey was a half inch on jan 18 some areas of southern new jersey had no snow at all this year and in higheraltitude areas to the north and west , there were 5 to 10 inches of snow , well below the seasonal norms , mr knight said school districts have been left with unused snow days in bridgewaterraritan , officials allocated four days in this year s schedule as snow days none have been used they are days that we have contracted for our teachers to teach , said the superintendent , joseph p mcgarry if we do n't have any snow , we are lucky we have more instruction for our students the mild temperatures coupled with the lengthening hours of daylight have sparked a premature budding of spring allergy suffers have started sneezing weeks earlier than usual visitors to flower festivals , like the cherry blossom celebration in branch brook park , may see no flowers ed obdens , the assistant parks superintendent in essex county , predicted that the park s 2 , 000 cherry trees a larger grove than the more famous collection in washington , dc would be in full bloom 10 to 15 days before the midapril festival the budding trees are threatened by dips in temperature with this cold right now , water in the tissues of the blossoms will freeze and will in turn damage the blossoms that are out , he said the early spring is breeding other frustrations people want to get on the ball fields right now , mr obdens said but the fields are not ready and cannot be worked on yet since the ground did not freeze this year , we have to wait until it dries out you take the truck out , you tear all the turf up trying to get out to it mosquitoes are one problem not affected by the early spring it is a popular belief that a mild winter means you are going to have a lot of mosquitoes the following year , said wayne kranz , an entomologist he said mosquito eggs are well adapted to survive the worst winters generally , weather patterns over the winter have nothing to do with what you can expect over the summer
london , sept 25 what he longed for most of all , salman rushdie said today , describing nine years of living under a death sentence that clouded his every thought , was the simple freedom to open his door and stroll casually down the street normality is a very simple thing , and yet it s the thing i 've been denied , mr rushdie , 51 , said at a jubilant news conference here , a day after the iranian government announced that it was formally dissociating itself from the threat against mr rushdie s life spontaneity to make one s own decisions without reference to anyone else , the indianborn british writer explained to do something at the precise moment that you feel like doing it , such as going for a walk these are the things that are impossible when one is in a security net and all i 've ever looked for is a return to real life , or at least let s say the normal life of a professional writer , and that s what i hope i can now very rapidly regain speaking in the offices of article 19 , an anticensorship group that has campaigned vigorously for him over the years , a relaxed , ebullient and often very funny mr rushdie said he was completely confident that the long campaign against his life was finally over the campaign began in 1989 when ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , then iran s supreme leader , issued a fatwa , or religious edict , against mr rushdie , accusing him of blaspheming islam in his novel satanic verses mr rushdie did say there was a small continued need for caution while he said he was not sure what kind of security , if any , he will need now that the fatwa is effectively over , he said the british authorities had persuaded him to his satisfaction that the iranian government no longer considered him a target the fatwa and the bounty are matters of profound embarrassment to the iranian government , and i do n't think we 'll be hearing about them anymore , mr rushdie said , referring to the 25 million reward for his killing that was said to have been offered by a revolutionary group in teheran i think they 're going to wither on the vine as far as the muslim groups who have publicly declared in the last two days that they still believe the fatwa exists , he called them dinosaurs who represent absolutely nobody saying that anyone who tried to collect the reward might find they 'd gone to a lot of trouble for nothing , mr rushdie added , many of my friends are in the literary and artistic world , and not all of them have a lot of money , and yet i'm happy to say that nobody s tried to cash in as a reward for its decision to disavow the fatwa , iran has been granted a full restoration of diplomatic relations with britain robin cook , the foreign secretary , told bbc radio that britain would work with iran to enforce sanctions against iraq and to help control the drug trade from afghanistan , and would press iran to take a firm line against the spread of nuclear arms today was a truly strange day for mr rushdie , who since 1989 has become one of the world s most prominent proponents of freedom of expression , published two novels , gotten married and fathered a child and although in recent years he has lived more openly , appearing at parties , restaurants and other public places around london and abroad , he has been unable to receive mail , shop or make even the simplest excursion without rigorous planning and a team of bodyguards provided by the british government the threat to his life has been allencompassing in july 1991 , the japanese translator of the satanic verses , hitoshi igarashi , was stabbed to death in tokyo that same month , the book s italian translator , ettore capriolo , was beaten and stabbed by a man demanding mr rushdie s address mr capriolo survived and in october 1993 , mr rushdie s norwegian publisher , william nygaard , was shot and seriously wounded in oslo even today , he and article 19 were forced to hold their news conference in the group s cramped offices in north london , after a frightened tenant objected to his presence in a building down the road one of the most worrying things around me in these years has been the climate of fear , he said i have been inhibited by other people s fear in situations where i believed there was nothing to be afraid of , other people would be alarmed but he said he hoped that the new political developments would put an end to all that , as well as bringing a profound new freedom to his own life , which he said had been deformed by the fatwa i feel that there is a small continued need for caution , but it s of the sort faced by many people who for whatever reason become prominent , he said there are cranks that come out of the woodwork and attack such prominent figures again and again , mr rushdie paid tribute to those who have helped him over the years friends , publishers , translators , writers , ordinary people , strangers who have expressed their support in innumerable ways and said he felt deeply that the cause went far beyond his own situation it s not just because somebody s life was in danger , because the world is full of people whose lives are in danger , he said some incredibly important things were being fought for here a thing that is important to me the art of the novel beyond that , the freedom of the imagination , and the great , overwhelming , overarching issue of freedom of speech the right of human beings to walk down the street of their own country without fear although he has struggled against it , both personally and as a writer as a writer , i did n't want to be a creature of the fatwa , he said mr rushdie said he had gone through terrible times in the last decade , probably none worse than in the early , bewildering days , when tens of thousands of people were demonstrating against him around the world it had nothing to do with fear , he said it was the shock and grief it s an extraordinary thing to see people walking down the streets of foreign cities , carrying your picture with the eyes poked out and calling for your death it s as if somebody were to break your picture of the world , and everything you think about somehow ceases to be true that s one definition of insanity even still , he said he did not regret writing the satanic verses , and would not consider withdrawing the book , or apologizing for it we have not fought a battle for freedom of speech to give in at the last moment , he said he said he wanted the book to return in people s minds to the place it belongs the bookshelf , the bedside , the armchair where readers read , and perhaps even the beach the time has come , he said , to leave the book to its fate , where people can either like it or dislike it he added the battle has been about free speech , and free speech is about disagreement and so we disagree what i'm saying is , 'end of story time for next story' photo normality is a very simple thing , salman rushdie said yesterday at a news conference in london , and yet it s the thing i 've been denied \( reuters \)
bobby valentine knew he would be secondguessed for waiting too long to pinchhit mike piazza in the mets' 105 loss to the st louis cardinals in the first game of a doubleheader last night at shea stadium but the manager s decision to go to a sixman rotation has worked out fine the mets' sixth starter , armando reynoso , tossed seven scoreless innings to win the second game , 10 , on edgardo alfonzo s firstinning home run the 32yearold righthander won his fifth consecutive start since returning from elbow and shoulder problems and lowered his earned run average to a stingy 154 there were boos when reynoso walked mark mcgwire in the first inning , after mcgwire had delivered a pinchhit double in his only atbat in the first game but reynoso went on to strike out the home run leader three times to end innings , twice with a runner on first base and the sellout crowd of 52 , 320 gave reynoso hearty applause after each strikeout , especially in the seventh , when mcgwire took a called third strike the victory , secured after turk wendell and john franco each pitched a scoreless inning , enabled the mets \( 7157 \) to tie the cubs in the national league wildcard race asked about his unconventional decision to go to a sixman rotation in the season s final five weeks , valentine could have preened i could probably be convinced to change my mind if someone gave me a reason , he said , but i do n't see one reason why in the opener , though , he did not seem as wise , keeping piazza on the bench long enough for the mets to come up short in the eighth inning and eventually in the game the turn of events came with the mets down by 64 but threatening with the bases loaded and none out valentine was saving his allstar catcher to pinchhit for mel rojas , so luis lopez batting two spots ahead of rojas hit with the bases loaded while piazza watched from the dugout lopez grounded into a double play , which gave the mets one run , but gave the cardinals two big outs as piazza then watched from the ondeck circle , jorge fabregas grounded out with the tying run on third to end the inning a threerun rally had come up one run short piazza had never come up at all so rojas , who had already allowed a run in the eighth , took the mound for the cardinals' ninth and allowed four more runs to put the game beyond the reach of the mets when asked if he had thought about pinchhitting the righthanded piazza for lopez against the righthander rich croushore , valentine said yes , there were thoughts obviously , i should have done it a double play was the only thing that was going to get me there and it got us i just did n't think the guy was a groundball , doubleplay pitcher i should have hit mike , no doubt about it had the mets been able to tie the game or go ahead in the eighth , valentine would not have had to send rojas out for the ninth , either but the manager said he was confident that lopez would do anything but what he did i thought i was going to have a shot to hit mike with one out , valentine said luis is a good fastball hitter i'm just sitting there saying , 'anything but a double play' the mets were trailing by 62 entering the eighth , when jermaine allensworth grounded a pinchhit single off lance painter to open the inning john olerud followed by lining a single to left and alfonzo , who was pinchhitting for matt franco , walked to load the bases that brought on croushore , who walked brian mcrae to make it 63 , then allowed a single up the middle to carlos baerga for another run lopez s turn was next if mike does hit and does n't drive in a run , we 're looking at fabregas and ordonez next , valentine said , referring to his backup catcher and rey ordonez , the only other position player besides piazza available to valentine off the bench valentine rolled the dice and let lopez bat and on a 21 pitch , lopez grounded hard to first baseman john mabry , who started the double play and rojas proceeded to let the game get away in the ninth , while allowing a pinchhitting mcgwire , who did not start the opener , a groundrule double off alfonzo s glove at third to score a run i tried to squeak by both ways , valentine said , explaining that he had tried to conserve both his pitching and his bench the manager had also tried to squeak an extra inning out of hideo nomo \( 511 \) , who was once again beset by control problems nomo was asked if he found it strange that he has had little success this season , even though nobody has been able to hit him i do n't think it s strange , nomo said runners are getting on by other means like walks after he struck out the game s first three batters on 11 pitches , it was apparent that nomo had good stuff it became equally apparent , though , that he did not know where his pitches were going which was nothing new nomo entered the game trailing only darryl kile of colorado in walks allowed in the national league and after nomo walked six more batters last night , he and kile were tied with 86 with 86 walks in 137 2 3 innings , the righthander is averaging 56 walks every nine innings that is one reason his record is so poor , even though he entered the day third in the league in strikeouts per nine innings and third in opponents' batting average yesterday , nomo was charged with four runs on five hits in fiveplus innings he struck out eight , but of his 109 pitches , 50 were balls nomo allowed a homer to ron gant leading off the second , and before the inning was over he hit fernando tatis with a pitch and walked eli marrero and matt morris , the pitcher somehow , he escaped with the mets trailing by only 10 in the fifth , the cardinals scratched out another run to make it 20 lighthitting luis ordaz opened with an infield single and took second when lopez s high throw from shortstop sailed into the photographers' box behind first base nomo then struck out delino deshields for the third time , but allowed a runscoring single to willie mcgee the mets struggled through four innings against morris , a former seton hall righthander , who quickly retired the first two batters in the fifth but tony phillips doubled to left with two out and one pitch later lenny harris launched his second home run of the season just like that , the score was 22 nomo took the mound for the sixth , but after a walk to tatis and a single by marrero , valentine

cleveland , june 20 ronald reagan was voted into the white house the last year the yankees won 100 or more games , in 1980 don mattingly never played on a pinstriped team that won 100 games , nor did dave righetti no easy feat , 100 victories but the 1998 yankees already are halfway there after beating cleveland by 53 this afternoon david wells allowed two runs in eight innings , improving his record to 92 and the yankees' record to 5017 the yankees became the first team in the major leagues with 50 victories this season , despite playing the fewest games of any team as well as the fewest home games \( 31 \) they have had six postponements , because of rain and the closing of yankee stadium after a 500pound expansion joint fell the atlanta braves are 5024 after defeating montreal by 51 tonight we 've been pretty impressive , said chuck knoblauch , the yankees' second baseman the whole team the whole deal the yankees have won four of their last eight , their pace slowing somewhat in the midst of what figures to be the most challenging two weeks of their season , with games in baltimore and cleveland and against the braves and the mets the yankees are playing without bernie williams , sidelined with a sprained knee perhaps the next two weeks nevertheless , the yankees' winning percentage is 746 they would win 121 games if they continue this pace and would shatter the modernday singleseason record of 116 victories should the yankees win 47 of their remaining 95 games just less than half they would finish the season 9765 a hundred victories seems inevitable , particularly because the yankees' starting pitching is so sound , so deep with wells s outing today , the yankees' pitching rotation has turned in 17 consecutive starts of five and onethird innings or more only twice in 39 games since may 6 has a yankees starter failed to last five innings wells s performance today may have been his best since his perfect game on may 17 , he agreed his curveball dived across the strike zone , and his fastball was explosive it may be , wells said , that the shoulder tendinitis that bothered him for two weeks is gone for good pitchers with arm ailments usually cannot control what they throw , and today , catcher jorge posada set his target , inside or outside , and wells hit it constantly , expertly wells struck out eight , walking none he had good stuff , said chad curtis , the yankees' center fielder but it seems like every time i 've seen him , he s had good stuff the yankees scored two runs in the fourth inning , two more in the fifth , and with a 41 lead and his ninth victory in sight , wells seemed to bear down in the middle innings , retiring cleveland in order in the fourth , six and seventh three times he struck out david justice , the indian allstar later , wells spoke of the challenge of facing the cleveland lineup i wish i could pitch against those guys all the time , he said they bring out the best in me , i bring out the best in them wells walked to the mound for the eighth inning , the top of his jersey flapping open two buttons down he knew this would be his last inning it turned out to be his finest david bell led off and lined a hit to rightcenter , but he numbly tried for a double and , after falling , was caught in a rundown the indians scored their second run with two outs , and with a runner at first , the slugger jim thome came to the plate as the potential tying run thome had homered twice on friday night in cleveland s 74 victory thome is a scary hitter right now , curtis said you throw him a fastball and he can hit it out you throw him a curve and he can hit it out wells threw him a curve with the count two balls and one strike , and thome took it strike two wells spun another curve , and thome fouled it off i do n't know how , wells said wells then fired a fastball over the outside corner , thome hacked at it , and missed it was , torre mused later , a big pitch , a big out , in the crucial part of the game but the yankees have made the crucial plays , got the big outs , got the big hits , in winning 50 games it s been a great start , said david cone , the yankee pitcher early on , we banged the ball around and scored lots of runs lately , we 've been pitching much better throughout , their defense has been outstanding the yankees have allowed five unearned runs since april 30 we 've been winning all sorts of ways , cone said halfway to 100 , and it is midjune inside pitch derek jeter , in his second game since coming off the disabled list , made a throwing error in the third inning , only his third error of the season and his first throwing error of the year jeter said he still felt out of sync the yankees made two errors it was their first multierror game since may 20 tino martinez , whose batting average has plummeted nearly 50 points since he was hit on the shoulder blade by armando benitez on may 19 , had a double in four atbats saturday , driving in a run he s not healthy , manager joe torre said but it s going to get better gradually his shoulder s bothering him something that three hits would do a lot to help photos the indians' travis fryman upending the yankees' chuck knoblauch to break up a double play \( reuters \) david wells earned his ninth victory of the season by limiting the indians to two runs and eight hits in eight innings yesterday \(

tooele , utah in the still air of this desert valley , home to the world s largest stockpile of chemical weapons , a collective sigh of relief is almost audible in nearly two years of operation , a prototype chemical weapons incinerator has destroyed 1 , 500 tons of sarin gas , one quarter of the depot s stock zeroing in on faulty lots of weapons , disposal workers also cut the number of leakers last year to 27 , twothirds the annual average number of bombs found to be leaking chemical gas here in the 1990 s the results and the local revenue have prompted at least one local official to suggest transporting other chemical weapon stocks to here for destruction , although the idea is widely opposed environmentalists had bitterly fought the tooele incinerator , once predicting that workers would come out in body bags but the only recorded injuries have been to two workers who slipped on icy walkways outside the incinerator , 17 miles south of tooele \( pronounced tooellah \) , a town of about 15 , 000 people southwest of salt lake city my constituents are pleased we are finally getting rid of this stuff , said the local official , gary griffith of the tooele county commission , which has long supported the incineration of the weapons here the massive incinerator is the world s most concrete advance in weapons reduction since the chemical weapons convention went into effect one year ago the treaty rules out the methods of disposal that were popular through the 1970 s open burning on windless days , burial by bulldozers and dumping in the ocean tooele s incinerator , which resembles a steamship beached in the desert , 45 miles southwest of from salt lake city , is the fruit of 20 years and several billion federal dollars in research and construction this is the rollsroyce of incinerators , said amy smithson , who has reviewed the plant s operation and who is a senior associate at the henry l stimson center , a research organization in washington that specializes in military issues the army has put more safeguards on this incinerator than exist on any incinerator in the world russian technicians have toured the tooele incinerator as part of efforts to destroy all of their country s stocks but russia , whose 40 , 000 tons of chemical weapons is the world s largest stockpile , is not expected to meet the russian government s 2007 deadline under the treaty , because it lacks sufficient money the united states has a deadline of 2004 in the 1980 s , the united states military withdrew all its chemical weapons stocks from europe and shipped them to johnston atoll , in the pacific an incinerator started operating there in 1993 and has burned about 1 , 500 tons , or almost 75 percent of the stocks two more chemical weapons incinerators are under construction at storage sites in the united states one at anniston , ala , the other at hermiston , ore a construction contract is to be awarded soon for an incinerator at pine bluff , ark and government researchers are testing chemical neutralization technologies for possible use at the other stockpile bases aberdeen , md richmond , ky newport , ind , and pueblo , colo but environmentalists continue to try to block all incinerators , including tooele s , saying they are unsafe our lawsuits are meant to derail the technology , not to derail the us mission , said craig williams of the chemical weapons working group , a citizens' coalition based in kentucky these facilities , as they are designed and operating , do not protect the public utah has reason to be skeptical about the military s safety claims in nevada in the 1950 s , the military exploded nuclear bombs in openair tests when the wind was blowing away from las vegas , nev , and toward utah in 1968 , about 6 , 400 sheep were accidentally killed when the wind changed during an open air test of nerve agent at the dugway proving grounds , an army installation about 40 miles west of here but a series of scientific reviews seem to be easing public fears about tooele s incinerator , the first to operate in the continental united states in two telephone surveys conducted last year by dan jones and associates , a polling group , the number of respondents in the salt lake area who considered the incinerator risk to be significant or very significant dropped sharply , to 28 percent in september , from 44 percent the previous march last year , a panel of 16 independent scientists reviewed operations at the tooele plant at the request of the national research council in its report , the panel upheld army calculations that said burning tooele s munitions would be far less dangerous than storing them then in september , a separate study rated prospects for continued safe operation of the incinerator as very good this report was prepared by independent consultants contracted by the utah citizens advisory commission , a diverse group appointed by the governor , michael o leavitt , a republican the report was commissioned after a series of plant shutdowns and accusations of lax safety practices by former managers at the tooele chemical agent disposal facility , as the plant is officially known
nagano , japan , feb 2 of all the places that sudhakaran palankandy expected to be next saturday morning , none of them included walking with his son in the opening ceremony at the 1998 winter olympics we never thought luge would start in india , the innkeeper said as a mode of transportation for india s 896 million people , sliding is not high on the list but 16yearold shiva keshavan palankandy has improbably qualified as the only athlete to represent india at the nagano games on saturday , he will carry the national flag in the opening ceremony , while his father walks behind him as the team leader skiers represented india at the 1988 winter games in calgary and the 1992 winter games in albertville , france but no one has ever qualified before as a human ice cube there may be about 30 lugers in india , but not all of them have been training on ice , palankandy said of his country , which has no luge course his mother , rosalba , an italian , watched him slide once in europe and said never again she could find less dangerous ways to occupy her time at the family s small inn and italian restaurant the tall , wiry palankandy never started out to be a luger no one in india ever starts out to be a luger he was born in manali , in the lower reaches of the himalayas , and by age 6 he had begun skiing on the town s beginners' slope there was no ski lift , so he lugged his skis 300 meters up the hill after each run his italian grandparents sent him a plastic sled for christmas , and sometimes he would go sledding , but i was the only one in september 1996 , when he was 14 , his boarding school received a recruiting letter for winter sports athletes palankandy is a star soccer forward and field hockey goalie at his school , and his adventurous spirit has taken him on a school mountaineering expedition to 17 , 000 feet in the himalayas the recruiting letter also went out to the army and the indiatibet border police , so palankandy figured he was going to a training camp for skiing then he noticed that the camp was to be held in a town that got no snow even in winter when the camp opened , an austrian coach named gunther lemmerer arrived with a luge , not a pair of skis lemmerer had finished fifth in doubles luge at the 1984 sarajevo games , and he had come to india as part of the international luge federation s program to spread the sport to developing countries lemmerer attached roller wheels to the sled , and palankandy got his first taste of street luge after two weeks , he returned to school , but officials did not look kindly on such a frivolous absence they asked me for a certificate from the camp , he said i had to produce one they did n't believe me two months later , palankandy was invited to another training camp , this one on ice in igls , austria we did n't start all the way at the top , he said you might die or something in early 1997 , he returned to austria to train and watch the world luge championships a friend from india crashed on the course and suffered a bruised kidney and a severe concussion palankandy broke his foot in a crash , but he remained for the world championships and served as a forerunner on the course , navigating it completely from top to bottom i have a natural feel for the ice , he said i was born in the beginning of the himalayas i have been skiing since a young age and i have a good sense of balance and concentration last september , palankandy began considering what had once seemed unimaginable a spot in the olympic games first he had to qualify during world cup races by finishing within a certain time of the leaders he finished last in a race in calgary , alberta , and 42d out of 46 in igls this season , but his times met the olympic qualification standards at 16 , he was headed for nagano some athletes and officials have decried the participation of what are called olympic tourists athletes who have only a loose affiliation with the country they represent , or athletes with little skill who seem to materialize in the olympic years but several lugers said today that they respected palankandy for his energy and commitment to the sport though palankandy receives some financial help from the international luge federation , his father said the family has paid about 5 , 000 for travel and training expenses the sport has to get much bigger , said wendel suckow of the united states , the 1993 world luge champion and a threetime olympian there should be a true world cup , not a european world cup with a few north americans attending it s exciting when countries like chinese taipei and india get involved if they 're paying their own money trying to get better , they 're not olympic tourists we should take our hats off to them and give them more respect for nearly a month , palankandy has been training on the olympic course , hoping to get a top30 finish in these winter games the chance to carry his country s flag in the opening ceremony is the biggest pride for any athlete after the games , palankandy will return to india , where he has spent only one day in recent months and has a major 12th grade exam awaiting him at boarding school but when he lies on his back these days , it is to ride a luge , not to study his books i have a lot of years ahead of me , he said , adding that he intended to compete in the 2002 games in salt lake city and dreamed of someday winning india s first medal in the winter olympics maybe some other olympics now , you just have to try

louisville , ky , nov 6 in the backstretch barns across the infield from the twin spires of churchill downs , the world s greatest race horses were stabled today on the eve of their allstar showdown in the 51 million breeders' cup classic , the richest thoroughbred race ever , the best since the cup series was started 14 years ago and one of the best in the long history of the sport the classic will be run on saturday before a throng of perhaps 70 , 000 spectators in the home of the kentucky derby , will be the seventh and ultimate event of a day with purses totaling 132 million and will be the final appearance in the distinguished careers of at least two of the favorites skip away , the leading candidate for horse of the year , and gentlemen , whose owner is risking 800 , 000 just to enter him in a race that he is not considered very likely to win this field is so good , said sonny hine , who trains skip away , that if anybody stumbles , he gets beat the field for the classic is , in a word , classic it includes last year s kentucky derby winner \( silver charm \) , the winners of the last two belmont stakes \( touch gold and victory gallop \) , the best horse in europe \( ireland s swain \) , the winner of the travers stakes \( coronado s quest \) , the winner of the hollywood gold cup and many other stakes \( gentlemen \) , and the winner of last year s classic and the leading contender for horse of the year \( skip away \) in a sport fighting for survival in a time of changing social values and tastes , the breeders' cup presents racing with its finest hours , and the classic remains its main event and this year s races should be run with no complications from the weather , which is expected to be partly cloudy with temperatures in the 50 s if you get beat , you get beat , said bob baffert , who trained the winners of the kentucky derby in the last two years and silver charm not only won the derby last year , but he traveled halfway round the world and won the dubai world cup this year if he could win the breeders' cup classic , it would be the ending to a true fairy tale this year s classic includes speed horses and stalkers and closers , all of worldclass caliber and for once , its chief contenders have escaped the injuries and illnesses that usually decimate fields at the end of the year and that have already removed several stars from the other breeders' cup races in recent days the classic is going to be as good a race as there ever was , said shug mcgaughey , who trains the 3yearold coronado s quest we 're hoping that skip away and gentlemen get into a speed duel , and then we 'll try to make one run at them this is going to be one great race , and coronado s quest is worthy of being in it just how great a race is this year s classic \? longtime racing analysts seem to agree that it is the best of the breeders' cup series , which was begun in 1984 , and one of the best anywhere , any time there s no question about it , said joe hirsch , executive columnist for the daily racing form and a student of great race horses for 50 years there have been other memorable races in other years , but none can match the depth of quality for this year s classic more important , every horse is coming up to the race in top form and at the end of the season , you might expect them to be going the other way many trainers are now building their entire seasons around the breeders' cup instead of making it an afterthought , hirsch added so , every race they run during the year is accountable to the breeders' cup every race they run becomes a kind of countdown to the breeders' cup hirsch listed some other melodramatic races of the past with deep fields , notably the 1917 brooklyn handicap with three winners of the kentucky derby and three handicap champions it was won by a 9yearold horse named borrow , who beat out his favored stablemate , regret , the filly who had won the kentucky derby two years earlier hirsch and many other people in racing have long rated the 1957 kentucky derby as the best calumet farm lost its star , gen duke , but ran iron liege against gallant man , round table and bold ruler , who finished in that order later that year , in the trenton handicap , in another historic run , bold ruler outran gallant man and round table and in the 1967 woodward at belmont park , in another meeting of champions , damascus defeated dr fager and buckpasser andy beyer of the washington post , whose name has become identified with the speed ratings of horses in races , remembered the 1979 jockey club gold cup at belmont park for star quality with seattle slew , affirmed and exceller in this year s classic , he said , the depth of quality extends down to coronado s quest , who won the travers stakes but still is n't regarded as a top contender in the classic i do n't think i can remember a race , beyer said , where the travers winner was rated the ninthbest horse photo classic favorite silver charm with the trainer bob baffert yesterday \( andy lyons allsport \) \( pg d1 \) skip away , left , leaving the track after yesterday s workout at churchill downs , is one of the favorites today in the starstudded classic \( andy lyons allsport \) \( pg d3 \)
when moviegoers see the screenwriting credit for the horse whisperer written by eric roth and richard lagravenese they may envision a team working cozily together , one partner banging the keys while the other paces the room two creative people united in both labor and spirit but the truth is that these men were never in the same room their names are linked professionally only because of downanddirty negotiations that took place long after each had a stab at writing the screenplay for the movie , which was directed by robert redford likewise , the new movie fear and loathing in las vegas , terry gilliam s take on the 1970 s classic by hunter s thompson , represents another odd behindthestory story in this case , the credit features four names two partnerships were at odds with each other , and credit almost went exclusively to the partnership that wound up with very few of its words on the screen small wonder that hollywood writers have long been the butt of jokes \( how many screenwriters does it take \) since talkies needed talk , screenwriters have watched as their work was underappreciated financially and , in wholesale fashion , obliterated by other writers and encroached upon by auteur directors eventually , about 40 years ago , a union , the writers guild of america , was formed to protect them from gross indecencies and to insure that those who had ideas first did not end up credited last but these days , many of the guild s rules seem arcane , and writers , though \( or perhaps because \) their fees have gone up , are in turn fighting one another arbitration has become as common as the highconcept pitch within the movie industry , there is less and less respect for the beauty and force of one writer s vision get me rewrite is as natural a reflex as get me a new agent outside the industry , people may get the impression that everyone wrote a movie , or , in the case of titanic , no one did as a result of this general disarray , some of the biggest names in the profession are hopping mad screen credit and hundreds of thousands of dollars may be going to the wrong people , and a proud but battered union is under siege this is madness , says stephen schiff , the former journalist who wrote screenplays for adrian lyne s lolita and for deep end of the ocean , a film rendition of the jacquelyn mitchard best seller , which stars michelle pfeiffer , treat williams and whoopi goldberg and is to open in the fall it s insane what we have to go through to prove we wrote the script we wrote now that i know what i know , i realize people have probably won awards for scripts they did n't write and thanked people they did n't know after arbitrations concerning numerous writers who had tried earlier versions , mr schiff earned sole credit for both films no easy feat , especially given the fact that each was adapted from a novel much of the credit chaos stems from the writers guild s having essentially the same guidelines for adapted screenplays and originals regardless of how much of the work of the first screenwriter on a project is finally used , that writer often ends up with credit , sometimes in the coveted first position they judge by who first selected the material that ended up in the final movie , says mr schiff is that really fair when obviously the best material from the book is going to end up in every version \? mr lagravenese puts it this way they presume you 've seen the prior script , but why would you use a script that did n't work \? in other words , if you gave six writers the book of exodus for a film about moses , would any of them leave out the parting of the red sea \? if a writer creates an idea from scratch , that s one thing , says the director barry levinson , who was a close observer of a battle over the screenwriting credit for his recent film wag the dog even if the script is given to other writers and rewritten , that first writer created the seeds of the idea and he or she should get some regard but for a script from a book , it s different early on , after seeing a script written by hilary henkin , mr levinson declined to get involved with wag the dog but then he and david mamet were allowed to veer wildly from that script , and from the novel on which it was based , american hero , by larry beinhart imagine their surprise when ms henkin demanded and won not only shared credit but also first position literally 999 percent of what is in our movie did n't exist in her script , says mr levinson only the notion of faking a war remained , and that was in the book i still do n't know how the guild could come up with its decision it just does n't understand how to connect the writer s contribution with what ends up on screen i had no vested interest in who got credit , but it disturbed me in terms of fairness ms henkin , on the other hand , feels that what is on the screen in wag the dog is part her , part mamet , part the book certainly david mamet did a great deal of work , which is why i asked for shared credit , says ms henkin but i was the originator of many of the concepts that ended up on the screen , and so i was given first credit it was appealed , and i was given it again , so i think it s fair to say this was looked at exhaustively barry levinson cannot make up his own standards for writing credits
by president clinton s proud reckoning on tuesday night in his state of the union message , these are good times in america but by the reckoning of most of the nation s governors , that was understatement in a series of state of the state addresses last month that were striking for their relentlessly upbeat and optimistic tone even discounting that 1998 is a reelection year for many governors the chief executives of some 40 states painted a picture of a nation that not only is enjoying good times but in many cases , as they see it , is enjoying the best times ever thanks mainly to the nation s booming economy , governors who a few years ago were bemoaning intractable problems , shortages of money and the need for sacrifice , now crow about spending new cash surpluses to solve old problems , about cutting rather than raising taxes and about giving out instead of rationing government goodies but most of all , the state of the state speeches of 1998 , based on a review of most of those delivered thus far , were speeches about good times on a roll like seldom before as gov terry e branstad of iowa , a republican whose 16 years in office make him the nation s senior governor , put it in his jan 13 address we 've come a long way today we stand stronger and taller than ever before the condition of our state is as good as we 've ever had it then mr branstad , who is not running for reelection , offered some persuasive proof consider just a few facts , he said , beginning a litany that could have applied as easily to new york or texas or california as to heartland iowa in 1997 , he went on , unemployment fell to the lowest level in history , and the number of working iowans rose to the highest level the number of jobs created by new businesses rose almost 19 percent we had onethird fewer iowans on welfare than four years ago land values increased for the 11th consecutive year we created one of the best studenttocomputer ratios in the nation and within a year every school district will be hooked up to the information superhighway we ended the year with a state budget surplus of over 800 million the state s best fiscal position ever and today every iowa taxpayer is paying 10 percent less in state income taxes other governors offered a similar message , even the governors of some states that traditionally have been depressed , economic laggards , like west virginia the detail and the wording varied , but not the ultimate conclusion the state of our state is sound , said gov tony knowles of alaska , a democrat our course is the right one the future for most alaskans is bright gov tommy g thompson of wisconsin , a republican , said the most visionary , vibrant and vigorous state in america we are young we are bold we are strong gov roy romer of colorado , a democrat , boasted , we are now one of the premier economies in the nation , perhaps the world the governor of delaware , thomas r carper , a democrat , declared , our economy is as strong as an oak gov cecil h underwood of west virginia , a republican , said , we can now sing a song of hope problems remain in all states , of course , ranging from low test scores in public schools and overcrowding in prisons to crumbling highways and hardcore , leftinthedust pockets of the poor , the homeless and the chronically unemployed and in most of this year s state of the state speeches , governors acknowledged such difficulties , a few with acute bluntness for example , gov benjamin j cayetano of hawaii , a democrat , spoke of struggling to lead a state tossing about in stormy waters and grappling with unprecedented problems , mainly because its main industry , tourism , has been hard hit by competition from other vacation destinations and by a sharp decline in visits by asians , who have their own economic crisis to deal with he warned what lies ahead may be the most difficult challenge our state has ever faced yet despite such admissions of problems , taken as a whole the 1998 state of the state speeches portrayed a nation that , near the dawn of the 21st century , was graced from sea to shining sea by such wealth and plenty that one governor , gary locke of washington , a democrat , waxed wondrously not only about a state grown ever bigger , ever better and ever richer but also a state suddenly infused with a growing sense that we are entering a time of moral renewal , a time when more and more americans are coming home to the values of service to others , respect for our elders and sacrifice for our children in many of the speeches , governors called for increased spending on early childhood development , health care for the very young and day care programs for working parents , a reflection of the importance the nation s leaders are now according to recent studies indicating that the earlier a child s education begins and the more stable it is , the better the adult will turn out many of the speeches also contained proposals for increased spending on highways , a reflection not only of growing concern about the aging of the nation s road network but also a reflection of the change in the way many of the nation s businesses now do business that is , many no longer maintain expensive warehouse inventories but instead depend on efficient communication and transportation systems to deliver goods within hours of need

event on the nike tour , a secondlevel circuit the commissioner of the pga tour , tim finchem , said the tour would appeal the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit mr martin , 25 , said he also planned to try to qualify for the united states open in june this may well mean another court case , because the united states golf association , which conducts the open , has taken the side of the pga tour , saying walking is essential to its competitions i would hope the us open would honor this decision , martin said i would be disappointed if they do n't the usga said in a statement that it would have no comment until it had time to review the decision one of mr martin s attorneys , martha l walters , said the judge s ruling today , which applies only to martin , is not binding on the usga but if the ninth circuit court of appeals took the case on an expedited basis and ruled in favor of martin , it might well apply , because this year s open is at olympic country club in san francisco and san francisco is part of the ninth circuit s jurisdiction mr finchem , who testified here yesterday that walking was an essential element to pga and nike tour playing competitions , said he was disappointed with the court s decision the pga tour believes that the ada was not designed or intended to apply to competitors in professional sporting events , including professional tournament golf , mr finchem said in the meantime , mr finchem said , the tour will abide by the judge s decision to make the preliminary injunction permanent and permit mr martin to have a cart on nike tour events i just want to qualify and get my card , mr martin said at a news conference after yesterday s ruling i could go down in flames with everyone watching but it gives me a chance to pursue my dreams and see how good i can be that part of the story is yet to be told mr martin agreed with a questioner that the need for a cart could be abused by others yeah , this could be abused , he said he also said he had some concerns about the reaction of his peers on the nike tour , on which he has been playing under a preliminary injunction issued last november by judge coffin i do n't want to be an outcast , he said , clearly aware that his case created public relations difficulties for the tour and its players mr martin s request to ride drew both support and criticism from his professional colleagues veterans such as jack nicklaus and arnold palmer testified in favor of the pga tour s argument , and most golfers who opposed mr martin cited the fatigue factor , saying mr martin s ability to ride would give him an unfair advantage i do n't understand how anyone can say , in golf , you do n't expend any energy playing it , fred couples said today at a tour event in hawaii but others supported mr martin s cause , and after the ruling phil mickelson , one of golf s best young players , said , it shows anything is possible on the pga tour in addition to the legal victory , the judgment was a great personal vindication for mr martin , a former teammate and roommate of tiger woods at stanford university mr martin walked in competitions early in his career but began to use carts later when the pain in his leg , caused by klippeltrenaunayweber syndrome , became too overwhelming his case against the pga tour began the day after thanksgiving when his lawyers asked judge coffin to issue a preliminary injunction ordering the tour to give martin a cart to play in the qualifying rounds for the nike or pga tour the pga tour had adopted new rules requiring all candidates to walk the final rounds , and martin was having difficulty walking the judge , who is a magistrate sitting as a district court judge for this case , heard the case immediately , and without taking testimony from witnesses , issued the preliminary injunction ordering the cart that day mr martin qualified for the nike tour , missing the pga tour by two strokes the judge then extended his injunction to cover the first two nike events mr martin won the first one , using a cart , in lakeland , fla , last month his case opened here feb 2 the implications for other sports , both professional and amateur , could well be immense if the case stands the disabilities act says a public accommodation , which the tour is now considered , must make reasonable modifications to accommodate the disabled unless those modifications fundamentally alter the nature of what is at stake , in this case competitive sports rules but in his ruling , judge coffin relied on ninth circuit cases , none of which involve sporting competitions these cases , the judge said , permitted individual consideration of each individual applicant , regardless of whether it fundamentally alters the nature of the organization s rules the ultimate disposition of this case will have significant precedential impact , not just at the level of professional golf , but also at all levels of athletic competitions , judge coffin said the question of whether and how the ada applies to athletic rules does not have different answers depending upon where the athletic competition takes place at it s the same at high school , college , pros , the rules are the rules , and it does n't matter which entity has those rules at the same time , the judge noted that the act does not cover all illnesses or disorders the act defines disability with respect to an individual as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities , for example , walking or seeing or learning or working , among others much of how one considers a disability under the ada depends on the nature and severity of the impairment and the duration of the impairment the judge said that temporary non chronic impairments , with little or no long term or permanent impact are not disabilities those types of impairments that are not disabilities include things such as broken limbs , sprained joints , concussions , appendicitis and so forth , he said judge coffin relied on ms walters s legal analysis in her final summation earlier in the day , she had asked the judge for a golf cart for one man with a dying leg so that he may ride part of the way but the pga tour s chief attorney , william maledon , told the judge that he was forbidden by law to give mr martin a cart if that act fundamentally alters the nature of pga tour and nike tour competitions
seeking to resolve a contentious question surrounding new york city s small , alternative public schools , researchers have found that they spend more per pupil than traditional schools but get better results for their money by graduating more students in four years the research report , due for release today , supports the longheld view of critics of the alternative schools that they spend more for each pupil than traditional schools but the researchers say their more significant finding is that , with higher graduation rates at the smaller schools , the cost per graduate is about the same the twoyear study of 128 city high schools by researchers at new york university found the small schools \( those with 600 or fewer students \) , spent 7 , 628 a year for each pupil , about 1 , 410 more than the larger schools \( those with 2 , 000 or more students \) , based on 1996 budget figures but they spent only 25 more per graduate the results of the study come just a few months after schools chancellor rudy crew raised questions about the efficacy of smaller schools , particularly their costs by suggesting an answer that small and large schools each spend about 49 , 500 per graduate over four years the nyu researchers offer at least the possibility that a longunresolved debate may be substantially quieted the small schools themselves had contended all along that they were as costeffective as the city s older and more traditional large high schools the larger schools had respectfully disagreed the research , until now , had been inconclusive while previous studies have shown that struggling learners , particularly those in lowincome neighborhoods across the country , benefit from attending schools in smaller settings , the nyu researchers suggested that creating such schools should now be considered good economics i think this means that the investment is well worth it , said one of the authors of the study , norm fruchter , the director of the institute for education and social policy at nyu , this is particularly true for poor kids and kids of color who have not done well in their previous education the researchers said that there were limits in the conclusions to be drawn from their work because the schools examined had to have several years' worth of graduation data , most of the dozens of alternative academies founded since 1993 were excluded but the researchers said they were confident that the 10 older alternative schools examined including the central park east secondary school \( 329 students \) and the choir academy \( 426 students \) , both in harlem were similar enough to the newer batch of schools to provide relevant data and they added that the preliminary graduation data at many of the newer schools , centered on such themes as the city s museums and its infrastructure , are even more impressive than at the schools that were studied in depth the results of the study come at a crossroads for the smallschool movement in new york city , which has been viewed as a national model and a precursor of the nascent charterschool movement last fall , dr crew described small schools as sexy , but not necessarily the most scalable type of reform , by which , he explained , he meant that they were hard to replicate in a costefficient way that got results indeed , a set of rules drafted by a midlevel board of education official but never endorsed by the chancellor would have , among other things , restricted the size of small schools , raising the minimum enrollments to 400 for elementary schools , 600 for middle schools and 800 for high schools those numbers sent shock waves though a movement that believes that schools with as few as 200 students are the perfect foil to the factorylike high schools of old since then , dr crew has gone out of his way to express his support for small schools and his spokeswoman , chiara coletti , said that the nyu study would only enhance that support popular wisdom has it that small schools are particularly more expensive than large schools , ms coletti said if the popular wisdom proves not to be valid , this is wonderful news for us champions of small schools predicted that the report would go a long way toward cementing the schools' place in the spectrum of educational offerings in the city people are used to thinking about cost per pupil , said heather lewis , the executive codirector of the center for collaborative education , a network of 40 alternative schools , none with more than 500 students but they do n't think about cost per graduate i'm not saying it s the ultimate measure but it is another way of looking at what it takes to successfully get kids through school the nyu researchers , who used graduation rates and budget figures tabulated by the board of education , made clear that they could not have undertaken such an analysis until recently because it was not until 1996 that the board was able to identify how much of its budget was apportioned on a schoolbyschool basis the researchers calculated annual spending per student to be highest in the smaller schools that 7 , 628 , based on 1996 budget figures , was an increase of 1 , 410 , or 23 percent , over large schools 685 , or 10 percent , over socalled smaller medium schools \( 600 to 1 , 200 students \) , and 780 , or 114 percent , over larger medium schools \( 1 , 200 to 2 , 000 students \) but in terms of graduation rates , the smallest schools were found to be superior , with 632 percent of students in the class of 1996 graduating in four years , compared with 559 percent in large schools , 504 in smaller medium schools and 512 percent in larger medium schools when those figures , and a host of others , were combined , the researchers found the cost per graduate to be 49 , 554 in the smaller schools , 49 , 578 in the large schools , 70 , 133 in the smaller medium schools and 59 , 384 in the larger medium schools
breznica , serbia on a hardscrabble hilltop farm with a collection of sod huts , wooden outhouses , fields of corn and wheat and lines of newly dug trenches protected by sand bags , there live some of the dwindling numbers of what the serbs proudly remind people are their loyal albanians the yugoslav president and serbian leader , slobodan milosevic , is still master over these few acres in kosovo a photo of his face hangs on the wall of the central fourroom house the separatist ethnic albanian rebels , who have taken control of portions of kosovo province in serbia and who have attacked this farm several times recently , are known here as terrorists the serbian police are comrades , and the crumbling old order is revered i am albanian , sali krasniqi , 62 , said , his voice quivering with nervous tension as he darted along the top of his earthworks but i respect all people everyone is against me because i defend freedom i did not sell my soul to hate serbs and build a greater albania mr krasniqi , whose family sheltered serbs from local fascist militias raised by the occupying italians during world war ii , went on to become a fervent supporter of tito s communist state of yugoslavia his neighbors say he worked as a police informer , which he denies in this province , which is 90 percent ethnic albanian , the support for the rebels has grown since a serbian crackdown began in march very few albanians here remain loyal to the serbs because mr krasniqi s family decided not to back the separatist movement , they have been threatened , ostracized , beaten and then attacked by rebel patrols he and his five sons , armed with a collection of shotguns and old carbines , stand guard all night around the family compound they rarely go into town and when they do , they travel in an armed group the family is a sad reminder that kosovo has been divided into two bitter , irreconcilable camps he is a traitor and has always been a traitor , said jetish shala , 56 , another ethnic albanian , who stood near his cornfield a few hundred yards away no one in the village speaks with him we treat him as if he does not exist he is the devil mr milosevic used the discrimination by ethnic albanians in kosovo against the serb minority a decade ago as kindling to build the virulent nationalist movement that brought him to power he became the serbian leader , then president of yugoslavia , of which serbia and montenegro are the two remaining republics the staterun news organizations , often apparently fabricating accounts of rape and murder to inflame serbian passions , turned to men like mr krasniqi to repeat the official line many times over the years , he has denounced separatists on belgrade television and allowed two of his daughters to marry serbs , an act that alone would have caused him to be shunned by the community retaliation has taken many forms , he said , standing in his yard with a pistol in a brown leather case on his belt he had a job in a brick factory a decade ago and , he said , my hands were badly injured i went to a hospital in belgrade and was promised a pension the local albanian authorities , however , destroyed my documents i never got my pension he said that the drinking water on the farm was contaminated when a dead cat was tossed into the well the family cow and dog were shot and killed none of his 11 children were able to finish school , he said , because of the hostility of their classmates his four schoolage grandchildren , both girls and boys , have been beaten , taunted as being milosevic s children and repeatedly thrown by classmates into the creek at the bottom of the hill until they no longer dared to go to class at the local primary school a couple of years ago , a local ballad singer , halit gashi , wrote the song of the traitors , played on the traditional quiftelija , a benchshaped two string instrument , that ridiculed by name those ethnic albanians who backed the serbian government he is not albanian , the refrain goes about mr krasniqi , who played a cassette of the song he is not even human he was bought with serbian money and serbian women the traitor krasniqi is paid to steal our freedom the children , who are sent each night to the dirtfloored cellar to sleep , are dressed in rags and barefoot there is little food in the house mr krasniqi s wife , habibe , 55 , apologized because there was not enough sugar to mix in the cups of thick turkish coffee my 8yearold daughter , elvedina , walked into town to buy a kilo of sugar and the other children threw her in the creek , said naim krasniqi , 32 , one of the krasniqi sons , who has three young children they dumped the bag of sugar in the water she came home in tears and said she was never going to town again the father and five sons , the only loyalists here and now largely cut off from the serbs , are gearing for further attacks the serbian police , fearing ambushes , have not driven into the village of 260 homes for weeks mr krasniqi and his relatives worry that if the rebels get past the trenches and sandbags , the family will join the list of some three dozen ethnic albanians executed by the rebels this year for collaboration with the serbs as the men got out the weapons for the night , mr krasniqi pointed out the white stucco houses dotting the duncolored fields and grassy meadows that belonged to serbian families when he was a child , but that are now all in the hands of ethnic albanians the serbian families were slowly driven out , he said the terrorists tell my neighbors we will all be killed , that my head will be delivered to the local rebel commander , but we have fought them off so far my wife was out collecting wood the other afternoon and she saw two of them in the woods , he continued she dropped the wood and ran they began to shoot we shot back for an hour i saw one fall my sons wanted to go capture him but i did not let them the terrorists took his body away aferdita krasniqi , the 20yearold wife of bekim krasniqi , 20 , another one of the sons , suffered a miscarriage during the attack she is trying to recover , her husband said we do n't have money to put her in a hospital besides , its not safe to leave the farm photo sali krasniqi and his family oppose the albanian separatist movement , and they have been threatened

cambridge , mass the age of innocence is over , and none too soon dna evidence strongly suggesting that thomas jefferson fathered at least one child by his slave mistress , sally hemings , has seen to it for centuries , through schools of clashing revisionist historians , the way americans viewed themselves , their heritage and their times has been dominated by a simplistic vision that sharply distinguished between good and evil , freedom and slavery , heroes and villains , the noble of character and the hopelessly flawed our memory and treatment of thomas jefferson is the most extreme example of this purist vision for the 196 years since a richmond newspaper first claimed that jefferson had a slave mistress , generations of ordinary americans and iconworshiping historians have twisted and denied the overwhelming circumstantial evidence that it was true it was considered inconceivable that a man of jefferson s character could do such a thing , notwithstanding his welldocumented contradictions on the subjects of slavery and other matters hardly a year ago , joseph j ellis , a leading jefferson scholar , dismissed the compelling circumstantial evidence marshaled by the scholar annette gordonreed in favor of the relationship with the assertion that she was playing the race card we now know that ms gordonreed was right nonetheless , another problem with the simplistic vision of the past is that it has encouraged both africanamericans and caucasians to underplay or misinterpret the role of race in the nation s past for many africanamericans and multicultural critics , jefferson s contradictions were proof not that he was human , but that he was a hypocrite without redeeming qualities , another reason to dismiss attempts to become engaged with the history of their nation and more reason for a separatist interpretation of america s past and present for many white historians attempts to arrive at a more truthful and nuanced view of jefferson by africanamericans were dismissed as racially motivated this is what happens when we refuse to acknowledge contradictions in our past and present lives and in the behavior of those we admire jefferson was no saint , but his racialist reflections on africanamericans must be understood within the context of his times and his relationship with an africanamerican woman nearly all caucasians of his day , including most abolitionists , simply assumed that africanamericans were racially inferior jefferson was unusual in the degree to which he agonized over the subject he was overtly inclined to what we would consider today to be racist views , but he also held out the possibility that he might be wrong in this regard he was ahead of his times the worst aspect of the africanamerican condition in the past was less the intellectual attention of racists and more the simple denial of their humanity in the refusal to recognize them at all this is the social death that ralph ellison had in mind when he described africanamericans as invisible people in their own country for jefferson , africanamericans could not really be invisible his relationship with hemings was almost certainly no onenight stand it is not possible that he could have had a relationship with an africanamerican that likely lasted more than three decades and deny the very human reality and presence of her being , her progeny and the people with whom she was identified the longevity of the relationship not only humanizes jefferson for us , but suggests that his doubts about his racialist theories may have been far more serious than he let on in his writings today , i feel less alienated from him , as i suspect will most africanamericans eventually he is part of the family , a family with a ghastly , contradictory past , to be sure , but a family nonetheless knowing that the greatest of our founding fathers was a practicing miscegenist should energize the recent shift away from the eitheror definition of race that has historically underpinned the castelike segregation of africanamericans , toward a more blended and selfchosen definition of group identity no society has ever solved its ethnic problems without intermarriage , and america will be no exception acknowledging the role of contradiction also allows americans to recognize and accept painful paradoxes in their history like the fact that virginia was , not by accident , both the cradle of slavery and of our democracy above all , it will allow us to accept that in the course of their forced and often brutal embrace over three and a half centuries , africanamericans and europeanamericans both wittingly and unintentionally influenced each other , in the process creating a civilization that is neither purely black nor white , but an ecumenical synthesis that drew its energy and its greatness from the very contradictions of the past and the mighty struggles to overcome them
rarely do the rangers root for the rival islanders , but last night was one of those times an islander victory at ottawa coupled with a ranger victory over montreal at madison square garden would help the rangers' playoff prospects tremendously the rangers came through with a 21 victory over the canadiens on an overtime goal by kevin stevens , but the islanders failed to completely pitch in by blowing a 40 lead in the final period and salvaging a 44 tie with the senators were the rangers watching the outoftown scoreboard \? there s no question it s that time of year , said wayne gretzky , who set up stevens s gamewinning goal we 're trying to get out of the mess we 're in unfor tunately , we did n't get 2 points like we could have but 1 point is better than none when asked the same question , rangers coach john muckler said no , i was n't watching how could you watch the scoreboard with a game like that going on \? in the race for the eighth and final playoff spot in the eastern conference , the rangers now trail the senators by 4 points , a surmountable deficit with 14 games to play , though ottawa has 15 left the senators return to the garden next wednesday things are starting to look better , muckler said better than they did yesterday stevens deflected a perfect pass from gretzky past canadiens goalie jocelyn thibault at 4 minutes 41 seconds of the fiveminute extra session it was the rangers' first victory in 20 overtime games this season i saw that gretzky had the puck and so i just drove to the net , stevens said i got my stick down and got it to go in gretzky makes great plays the rangers took a 10 lead 28 seconds into the third period on a goal by mike eastwood , who had missed an open net in the second period eastwood , who had been used sparingly over the last two weeks , picked up the puck to the right of thibault after the rangers' tim sweeney lost control of it crashing the net eastwood got control of the puck and beat thibault with a sharpangle shot between the goalie s shoulder and the post but the lead did not stand jonas hoglund beat a screened mike richter in the ranger goal on the canadiens' first power play of the game at 13 39 of the third period to even the score , 11 making the rangers' uphill climb more daunting last night was the absence of two key players injured in monday s 54 victory over the senators pat lafontaine , a center , was still suffering from headaches yesterday , the result of a violent collision with his teammate mike keane lafontaine , who was put on the injured list on tuesday , will miss at least seven days the rangers reiterated yesterday that lafontaine , who is second on the team in scoring with 62 points , did not sustain a concussion , which would have been the sixth of his career the other key injury on monday was to jeff beukeboom , a defenseman , who sustained a stress fracture of his left leg as the result of a slap shot that hit him on an unprotected area above the shin pad he could miss two weeks because of the injuries , the rangers recalled center marc savard and defensemen geoff smith and eric cairns from the minor leagues cairns did not dress for last night s game new york , which was outshot by 1610 through the first two periods , remained close thanks to richter , who made several outstanding stops , including backtoback pointblank saves on turner stevenson and sebastien bordeleau late in the first period in addition , richter got a big break in the second period on an apparent goal that would have put montreal up by 10 referee dan marouelli saw martin rucinsky knock the puck in with a high stick and immediately waved the goal off outstanding goaltending kept the game scoreless through two periods thibault dominated the rangers , making several key saves in the second period the rangers' best chance to score was thwarted by thibault s left pad , which stopped a puck shot by mike eastwood , who broke in with stevens on a twoonnone slap shots there was no significant improvement in pat lafontaine s head injury , a ranger spokesman , john rosasco , said i'm still feeling the same as yesterday , lafontaine said in a statement the headaches are starting to subside this is nothing compared to what i went i went through last year but i'm still frustrated that this happened photo rangers' kevin stevens slipping the puck into the net at the end of overtime last night to beat the canadiens \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c3 \)

haddon township many masters of 20thcentury photography regarded the camera as an extension of the eye that could capture human experience in a straightforward manner henri cartierbresson asserted , what the eye does is find and focus on the particular subject within the mass of reality what the camera does is simply to register on film the decision made by the eye hence , spontaneous judgment became a valued artistic asset melchior digiacomo of harrington park accepts the snapshot as art he is n't interested in staged subjects , manipulated negatives or darkroom experimentation what mr digiacomo sees is what the viewer gets for nearly a decade , he has been photographing the details of life at weddings and on the streets of moscow the 37 blackandwhite photographs on display here form an intimate oneman exhibition , a rarity at hopkins house , where group shows are the norm mr digiacomo is also a sports photographer with a most impressive career spanning 25 years his approach to magazine work is very different from his art photography on assignment at a sports event , he thinks about the page that needs to be filled by a visual image as a fine artist , mr digiacomo acknowledges that he shoots to satisfy himself however , his art photographs do not have titles because he feels they would rob viewers of their interpretation over the last eight years , mr digiacomo has been photographing weddings as art most of the blackandwhite images in this series were done for clients who preferred creativity to the conventional packaged album it is my interpretation of their wedding , he says a photo of a bridesmaid looks like a wrapped head from a magritte painting instead of the traditionally posed portrait , he shows the subject moments before she removed a long chiffon scarf from around her face the picture possesses a mysteriously surreal mood like that also found in andre kertesz s photographs mr digiacomo proudly acknowledges that no bride has ever told him , i was expecting more he is gratified when he hears how difficult it was for a newlywed couple to select images from the 20 or so rolls of film he had shot each wedding picture has a strongly cinematic quality , bringing to mind the film stills and lobby cards that were displayed in neighborhood movie houses through the 1960 s using a 28millimeter lens , the photographer draws the viewer close to his subject , and the camera seems to have an unobtrusive presence a photograph of an older bride dancing with her father documents the emotional bond that connects them in another image , two pairs of uncles are actively sharing anecdotes while kibitzing , one of the gentlemen simultaneously adjusts his partner s necktie it is most apparent how well mr digiacomo can tell a story about family by focusing on such a subtle gesture although weddings are joyous communal events filled with love , a number of images have a provocative sense of isolation there is a bridegroom who appears exhausted and is seated alone , enthroned at his place of honor in a photograph from a wedding on the island of eleuthera , two women are standing on the beach looking off in different directions like figures from a scene at long branch by winslow homer , they are physically close yet psychologically removed , not only from one another but also from the other guests , who are visually cropped by the camera s lens at a different reception , two men are separated at a table and look like absinthe drinkers in a parisian cafe by degas the way each holds his glass and the contrast of their dark and light jackets enhance the compositional design moreover , the giant drumstick allium of the table s centerpiece becomes almost a surrogate for the gentleman in the white dinner jacket i nstalled in the upper gallery and comfortably removed from the wedding scenes are 11 photographs from mr digiacomo s russian series in 1973 , he first visited the soviet union to photograph a world hockey competition for sports illustrated although he was fascinated by what he saw outside the rink , there was no possibility then for a foreign photographer to mingle with the people seventeen years later , he returned to moscow to cover the kremlin cup , a tennis tournament , and was surprised at the difference it went from a cloistered society to an open society , mr digiacomo said since 1990 , he has returned every november to photograph the people of moscow as an outsider , mr digiacomo sees many of the idiosyncrasies in russian life it is unfortunate that none of these photos are dated , yet two images are especially fascinating walking from the kremlin , president boris n yeltsin stands only a few feet from the viewer a photographer on the left is seen also taking his picture an entourage accompanies the president , but the attitude toward security is amazingly casual another image depicts a homeless man holding a cardboard sign with a carefully lettered message , obviously intended for the englishspeaking tourist brainless bonehead lenin is a cheater though less confrontational , mrdigiacomo s image of this street character brings to mind paul strand s celebrated portrait of a blind woman in new york what makes the russian subject so powerful is knowing how political dissent would not have been tolerated a decade ago , especially in so visible a spot as red square on the other hand , some aspects of life in moscow appear to go on as if nothing had changed there is a poignant photograph of three workers , dutifully shoveling snow in unison as the enormous statue of karl marx watches over them despite whatever tension these russian or wedding photographs might have , none are filled with the angst of diane arbus mr digiacomo admits he is very upbeat he jokingly blames his mother because , he says , he has no neuroses he does refer to the contemporary master photographer robert frank as a god and says , i learn by looking at his work like mr frank ,

to the editor re suicide rate rises after big disasters , federal study finds \( news article , feb 5 \) this will not be seen as news to social scientists a hundred years ago emile durkheim s suicide , one of the most important social science studies ever done , reported that disasters affect the suicide rate , sometimes causing it to be abnormally high , sometimes abnormally low anomie , a term popularized by durkheim , was the result of crises and the precipitating factor in distorting the normal suicide rate the anomic sense of normlessness following disasters makes life so meaningless for some that they take their own lives in greater number than otherwise expected none of this suggests anything wrong about the federal study what is significant is that nowhere in the federal study is durkheim , or the social science literature , cited are we doomed , in our age of information glut , to rediscover and reinvent what others specializing in different fields have already known for some time \? howard g schneiderman easton , pa , feb 6 , 1998 the writer is a professor of sociology at lafayette college
bob tewksbury knew the feeling he was most impressed with david wells s composure i had one for seven innings in st louis , so i kind of had an idea what he was feeling late in the game , the minnesota pitcher said it s tough to keep his composure like that in this ball park with 50 , 000 fans hopping on every pitch , it s a pretty spectacular effort on his part the fact that mentally he was able to go out there and deal with all that , that s the most impressive part to a perfect game wells pitched a perfect game at yankee stadium yesterday , breezing through nine twins' batters three times each , allowing none of them to reach base in the yankees' 40 victory it is one of the rarest events in baseball , having been achieved only 15 times in a century and a quarter of major league games tewksbury missed his chance for a line on the short list in 1990 , when franklin stubbs of houston blooped a double to left field at the start of the eighth inning i came in after the seventh at busch stadium and the fans gave me a standing ovation , tewksbury said that s what got me i 've got a perfect game going and the crowd is going crazy and i'm going , 'oh my god' so i go out and now you start thinking , 'i have to make the perfect pitch' wells , however , was able to withstand that urge , and that was what impressed tewksbury yeah , it was tough , wells acknowledged , sitting at his locker wrapped in ice bags , putting aside a cigar that was too strong even for him from the seventh on , it was ridiculous wells was interrupted in midthought he had to go to the manager s office to take a telephone call from george steinbrenner well , he does pay the pitcher s salary if it was n't for him signing me , this would n't have happened , wells said upon his return a few minutes later i guess you got to give him credit everywhere i thanked him for giving me the opportunity he made my dream come true , being in pinstripes i guess he did n't know what he was in store for when he signed me whatever and however many headaches wells has given the yankees since signing with them in december 1996 , they were all forgiven yesterday , by the owner , the manager , the pitching coach , the fans oh yes , the fans they were distracting , the portly lefthander said , but it s a great distraction i was just out there and the crowd is just going you 're just trying to zero in on the catcher s mitt the tendency , the pitcher said , is to try to hump up a little more as the inning goes on , but in the ninth inning , he said , i did n't do that i tried to relax and move the ball around the twins were duly impressed with the way wells moved the ball around he did it so well he might as well have been playing threecard monte at a makeshift table in times square we let some fastballs go , we chased some curveballs in the dirt , an admiring manager tom kelly said to pitch a perfect game , you have to have the pitches working it s not by accident we were trying to get an icebreaker , something to get us going , a little hit here or there but he was ahead of the count mostly on everybody we were cheering and rooting for each other , but nothing good happened wells reached three balls in the count with only four batters , the last and wiliest being paul molitor in the seventh inning if wells was going to lose at least the perfectgame part of his masterpiece , it could have been to molitor with a 31 count i had a pretty good atbat working , the 21year veteran recounted i laid off some close pitches we got to 31 i was taking because we were down , 20 , at the time i was trying not to concern myself with the nohitter i figured if i got on base , we 'd get the tying run to the plate wells had thrown two curveballs and two fastballs in getting to 31 on the fifth pitch , molitor said , he painted me a good fastball away tim mcclelland , the plate umpire , called the pitch strike two even though molitor said it was very similar to the third pitch wells had thrown him , which mcclelland called a ball but now it was 32 , and wells had another chance to give up his perfection he came back with another pitch out there that might have been borderline , molitor said but molitor was taking no chances he swung at the fastball , but missed i did n't want to take a pitch that was that close , he said i do n't think anybody wanted to take anything too close with two strikes today he certainly had an aggressively umpired game i'm certain the way the game was going , it would have been difficult for him not to call a strike mcclelland said he did not call pitches according to the moment it was exciting , but i still have a job to do , the umpire said i want to stay consistent the way i 've worked the first eight innings it appeared that mcclelland had a larger strike zone than players are accustomed to seeing in this day of the shrunken zone that s the way i 've been calling them all year , he said it was n't a conscious effort on my part i try to call a lot of strikes and make the guys swing the bat i was n't doing it for david wells i was trying to call my strike zone kelly said he did n't see wells getting any help from mcclelland he worked for it , kelly said this guy has the charisma for something like this he does n't have the most picturesque frame to look at , he s lefthanded , his shirt s half open give the guy an awful lot of credit this was wells s first shot at making yankee stadium history mcclelland , on the other hand , has been there before he was at the stadium in 1983 , ruling that george brett had put pine tar too high on his bat mcclelland laughed when he was reminded of that scene somebody wanted the lineup cards , he said , meaning yesterday s lineup cards , and i said i want to keep them because 15 years ago i threw the lineup cards in the trash and it probably cost me 10 , 000 if i had those lineup cards from the pinetar game , i probably would have got a lot of money for them so i'm going to keep these photo david wells got a few more minutes in the stratosphere yesterday at yankee stadium after he pitched a perfect game against the twins , the 15th perfect game in major league history \( barton silverman the new york times \)

the house gun by nadine gordimer 294 pages farrar , straus giroux 24 the nobel laureate nadine gordimer once observed that a writer is selected' by his subject his subject being the consciousness of his own era the subject that selected her , of course , was apartheid , and in novel after novel , she has explicated the consequences that it had on the lives of individual men and women in mapping the moral and emotional dislocations wrought by apartheid , she has not only served as an eloquent witness to the situation in south africa , but also produced fiction of enormous power and ambition ms gordimer s latest novel , the house gun , suggests as her 1994 novel none to accompany me did that she has yet to come to terms , artistically , with the dismantling of apartheid and her country s drastically altered social landscape her descriptions of the political scene in accompany me felt oddly generic and contrived , and her efforts to grapple with postapartheid realities in the house gun are often equally forced whereas ms gordimer s earlier novels tended to open out into subtle examinations of the relationship between individuals and society , society and history , the house gun is little more than a courtroom thriller , dressed up with some clumsy allusions to apartheid s legacy of violence and the uses and misuses of freedom the novel begins with a white uppermiddleclass couple named harald and claudia lindgard receiving the startling news that their son , duncan , an architect , has been arrested and charged with murder as in rosellen brown s 1992 novel , before and after , this news sends shock waves through the couple s marriage they are forced to question everything they once took for granted who their son is , how they raised him , what sort of values they believe he holds as harald observes , the news eclipsed the sun and shut off the air of all he had learnt , the understandings he believed he had reached in knowledge of human beings and the mores he had tested , the satisfaction in work and the pleasures of accepted emotions , the love between man and woman , between parents and son , the ease of friendship using her gift for psychological insight , ms gordimer draws a compelling portrait , in the novel s early pages , of the lindgards' stumbling efforts to make sense of duncan s arrest and of his confession that he did indeed kill a man , whom he had caught making love to his girlfriend harald , a literaryminded businessman , turns to religion in a search for answers , while claudia , a doctor , turns instead to freud although the lindgards will later form a united front , their bewilderment over duncan s arrest initially drives them apart this sentimental searching back to what he was , writes ms gordimer , is something each , harald and claudia , is alert to in the other , not because each seeks the weakness of comfort from the other , but because something vulnerable , incriminating to either , might be revealed someone must be to blame as the novel progresses , however , ms gordimer gradually moves from this nuanced examination of the emotional consequences of duncan s actions to a plodding examination of the circumstances surrounding the murder itself , and an even more plodding chronicle of his trial lengthy arguments from the prosecution and duncan s lawyer are laid out by rote , and the testimony of duncan , his girlfriend and other witnesses is reviewed and rereviewed from a variety of perspectives in an apparent effort to turn her courtroom drama into something larger and more ambitious , ms gordimer draws parallels between duncan s story and the story of rogozhin in dostoyevsky s novel the idiot she also tries to shoehorn into her narrative political and social observations that ultimately have little to do with the story at hand ms gordimer repeatedly points out that the lindgards' dependence on the black lawyer who is defending their son represents a reversal from the days in which blacks were dependent on whites \( a reversal examined with considerably more imagination and insight in her classic 1981 novel , july s people \) and she allows her characters to rattle on at length about such matters as the danger of handguns , the future of the death penalty and the climate of violence in south africa today a defense psychiatrist testifies that in a society where violence is prevalent the moral taboos against violence are devalued duncan s lawyer argues that the climate of violence bears some serious responsibility for the act the accused committed and harald wonders whether the inhumanity of the old regime s assault upon body and mind has somehow survived beyond its time not only in the hut burnings and assassinations of atavistic political rivalry in one part of the country but also in the hijackers who take life as well as the keys of the vehicle , the taxi drivers who kill rivals for the patronage of fares , giving license to a young man to pick up a gun that s to hand and shoot in the head a lover such moralizing seems ridiculously selfserving , given the fact that duncan is a young man who shot someone not for reasons of racial discrimination or ideology , but because he was caught up in a sexual triangle he could not accept it also underscores the basic problem with the house gun , a slight if sometimes gripping thriller with pretensions , a novel that wants to be more than it is photo nadine gordimer \( jerry bauer farrar , straus giroux \)
twentyfour hours after george steinbrenner was fined 25 , 000 for disparaging comments about umpires , the cleveland indians had reason to criticize them more precisely , jim mckean , umpiring at second base in tonight s game 4 mckean was involved in two plays that went against cleveland it was mckean s call on one of the plays and his positioning on the other that bothered the indians in the fourth inning , tino martinez lofted a fly ball to center field with runners at second and third and no one out for the yankees kenny lofton appeared to catch the ball , then drop it as he transferred it to his bare hand to throw home television replays subsequently showed that was exactly what happened , but mckean ruled that lofton dropped the ball without having held it long enough for a catch bernie williams , who tagged at third and began running home as soon as the ball touched lofton s glove , scored and would have , regardless but instead of having one out , the yankees had none the call , however , did not cost the indians because they allowed no more runs in the inning they also survived mckean s intrusion in the fifth without having a run score with paul o'neill at bat , derek jeter , who was at first base , set out for a steal of second sandy alomar jr fired the ball to second , making an ontarget throw , but mckean inexplicably was in the way and tried to jump out of the way the ball hit the veteran umpire in the leg and caromed into short right field as jeter got up and raced to third o'neill struck out , saving mckean any further embarrassment murray chass
when paramedics took the bleeding body of william koonce from the brooklyn apartment of his girlfriend thursday night , neighbors thought that she had finally had enough of his drunken beatings none suspected that the knife in his chest might have come from her son , a thoughtful 11yearold boy known for his kindness to elderly residents and his unfailing protection of his young sister but the boy , a fifth grader whose passions were nintendo and his bicycle , plunged a kitchen knife into the man to defend his mother , the police said although mr koonce , 37 , later died at brookdale hospital , the boy who is said to have admitted to the killing has not been charged , said law enforcement officials speaking on the condition of anonymity and the officials said it was unlikely he ever would be , given the circumstances of the killing while refusing to rule out charges until autopsy results were completed , the city s top juvenile justice prosecutor , peter reinharz , said that the case was extraordinary i 've been here 10 years and i have never had a case like this before , he said we see felony murders , manslaughters and a number of accidents with firearms but we really do n't have a lot of homicides committed by kids in new york city and even in this small subset , this type of case is a rarity it makes me look hard at the circumstances , he added the killing broke the usual quiet of the apartment building in the sutter houses complex in brownsville where the boy lived with his mother , desiree hoyle , and his 3yearold sister the building , known for its relative lack of crime , was referred to as the baby because of the wellbehaved children who live there but about 7 45 pm on thursday night , ms hoyle s neighbor , minnie jackson , heard a scream as she sat down to watch television then i made out someone yelling 'get out , get out of here i wo n't let you beat me again i'm tired of it , ' ms jackson recalled , adding that the commotion continued until she heard someone fall as she listened , another neighbor ran downstairs to alert the building s security guard , alfred george the neighbor was very upset and i could hardly make out what she was saying at first , mr george said but then she told me that desiree s boyfriend was beating up on her and i called 911 really fast within 10 minutes he saw the red lights of a police car and an ambulance pull up in front of his ralph avenue building officers and paramedics went into ms hoyle s secondfloor apartment and soon mr koonce was being carried out on a stretcher ms jackson said that she and other residents had urged ms hoyle to break up with her abusive boyfriend , and said that at first she thought the woman had finally fought back she said was shocked to be told that it was the woman s son who was being questioned in the case he could n't have done this unless he had seen his mother being beaten , again and again , ms jackson said he must have snapped his little mind just could n't take it anymore as news of the killing spread yesterday , neighbors talked of how mr koonce s presence at the apartment on the weekends cast a pall often , he was drunk , they said , and nearly always surly he always seemed like a really mean guy with never a smile on his face , mr george said and if you so much as talked to his girlfriend , he 'd give you a dirty look another resident , valerie hickling , said that when she visited ms hoyle s apartment on one occasion last year , mr koonce came in and began choking ms hoyle he grabbed her by the neck so hard that he left hand prints , and threw her down on the bed , ms hickling said then he just ran off yelling about something other residents said ms hoyle had been seen with black eyes , while law enforcement officials said that mr koonce had alcohol problems and that they knew he had assaulted his girlfriend at least once but the police said that mr koonce , who lived in the bronx , had no known convictions for assault in new york city ms jackson , the neighbor , said she was now concerned about how the killing would affect ms hoyle s son the youngster , she said , frequently helped her in and out of the apartment building and fetched her groceries other neighbors spoke of how he would sit on the building s front stoop , working on his homework or feeding and watching over his little sister i'm so worried about that child now , ms jackson said , because even if the police let him go on this , it s going to traumatize him for the rest of his life

david cone walked briskly to the yankee bullpen last night as the blue tarpaulin was being removed from the field following a rain delay cone had not thrown a pitch in almost an hour and wanted to loosen up his right arm but he stopped on the warning track and gazed up at the videotape replay of david wells s perfect game that was being shown to the soggy fans at yankee stadium what does it feel like to be perfect \? for a while , cone had that feeling using a tricky slider and a powerful fastball , he toyed with the phillies before and after the 50minute delay while retiring the first 14 batters of the 92 victory he was more than halfway to perfection and matching what wells did at the stadium on may 17 , and the 29 , 087 fans were poised for something special the drama died once bobby abreu squeezed cone for a twoout infield single in the fifth inning derek jeter almost negated it with a sprawling stab behind second , but his onebounce throw was not handled by first baseman tino martinez so cone had to settle for being as perfect as possible after that the crowd lets you know it , cone said you ca n't help but get involved you could tell they were into it despite the climax to cone s pursuit of perfection , it was still another marvelous night for the 35yearold righthander less than three months after cone wondered whether he might have to retire because he had been bashed for 16 earned runs in his first two starts , he throttled the phillies on five hits while striking out 11 and walking none for the second straight game cone lost the shutout when jon zuber tomahawked a twoout , twostrike , tworun homer in the ninth , the second home run of his career still , cone was the cone of old for most of the evening he s better now than he s ever been in the three years that i 've been with him , manager joe torre raved i'm talking about time and again going out with good stuff cone , whose arm has got stronger and whose mechanics have got crisper following offseason shoulder surgery , agreed i think joe has gotten more and more confidence in me now that i'm healthy , cone said he told me that he trusts me that s one of the greatest compliments that a manager can pay a pitcher perhaps george steinbrenner should forget about the 200inning plateau that cone \( 112 \) needs to trigger a 55 million option for 1999 and sign him now cone , who expressed a strong desire to finish his career with the yankees on monday , is 111 with a 322 earned run average in his last 13 starts despite the impressive statistics , cone is scheduled to start against baltimore on sunday , and that could preclude him from being an allstar because he would not be rested enough to pitch in tuesday s game i think it removes me from contention , cone lamented cone tinkered with his motion last night , as he often does just before he pushed off the rubber , he kept his hands together and paused near his chest longer than usual kind of like luis tiant without a twist cone said he hesitates to set himself for the pitch whatever the style , his pitches befuddled the phillies torre called him vintage cone in the sixth when he escaped a noout jam with runners at second and third by striking out doug glanville on a fastball , getting gregg jefferies to tap to the mound on a fastball and striking out scott rolen on a slider the yanks led by 90 , and though he was no longer perfect , cone liked his results it s probably the best pitching i 've done all year , he said that little stretch was the most quality pitching i 've done in a tight spot that was more satisfying than anything i 've done this year darryl strawberry drilled carlton loewer s 30 fastball for an oppositefield homer in the second , minutes before the rain delay when play resumed , chad curtis singled off loewer s first pitch to deliver the second run , and the yankees scored two more for a 40 edge loewer and toby borland combined to allow five runs on three hits and four walks in the fifth by then , the outcome was a formality the yankees did not experience a letdown following their emotional series with the mets on the contrary , they were as dominant as usual against an inferior team so increase the major leagueleading victory total to 56 for the yankees , even if cone fell a bit short of perfection last night it s tremendously satisfying to do this considering the way i started , cone said physically , if i hold up , i 'll be all right inside pitch bernie williams , who is on the disabled list because of a strained right knee and who has been rehabilitating in tampa , fla , will join the yankees today manager joe torre said it is unlikely that williams will play until after the allstar game , but he wants the center fielder around the team chili davis , who had surgery on his right ankle in april , was at the stadium last night and might return to the team in a month the american league has not yet ruled on mike stanton s appeal of his fivegame suspension photo david cone limited the phillies to five hits as he struck out 11 and walked none in getting his 11th victory \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c3 \)
john starks s and jeff van gundy s animated disagreement on monday night was well documented , with the television cameras recording the moment the two put that problem behind them before the game was over , but it is what they may have agreed on , not their disagreement , that is a problem that could linger van gundy said that his complaint with starks was not for the technical fouls he picked up late in the third quarter , making the knicks' futile comeback effort against the washington wizards even tougher it was on camera , so it was probably overdone , van gundy said of his disagreement with starks i told him i did n't like what i saw initially , he disagreed we talked on the bench , and he ended up agreeing and he played very well it was n't a big deal but the technicals were starks s misguided way of fighting what van gundy would agree is a continuing problem the knicks' reputation as bullies , as well as their slowfooted style , has left them spotting opponents a huge margin at the freethrow line without patrick ewing in the lineup , that is another obstacle that they are having a hard time overcoming the opponent tonight is the nets , who are looking to stick another dagger into the stumbling knicks , whom they can pass in the standing with a victory and if the game plays out the way the first meeting between the two did last week , when the nets went to the freethrow line 20 times to none for the knicks in the first half on their way to a 10398 victory , you can expect starks to be pleading his case with the officials once again obviously , we do n't want anybody being distracted by officials or concerned with things we ca n't control , van gundy said our team is becoming overly concerned with foul calls , noncalls , things that it has no control over really , my disagreement with john had nothing to do with those technicals i 'd like to stay as focused as we can and have nobody get distracted by anything refs , noncalls , opponents at the same time , it happens we 've got to get everybody concentrating on the real opponents , which is the opponent starks s argument with the officials has little ground to stand on since ewing s injury , the knicks have been on the short end of the freethrow stats in every game except one in the six games , their opponents have gone to the freethrow line 196 times , compared with just 123 for the knicks against the nets last week , it was the largest margin since ewing s absence , with the nets finishing with 50 attempts to just 20 for the knicks but without ewing in the post , using his skills as well as the wellearned respect of the officials , the knicks do little that merits sending them to the line too often settling for the jump shot , they deservedly get few chances at the line patrick was the only guy getting to the line consistently , van gundy said if we want to get to the line , we have to earn our way to the line in the second half against new jersey , we put our head down , played tough , and we went to the line 20 times we can get to the line that s not to say we 're a slashing team like them that s not our nature van gundy added the only thing i do n't think is justified is the issue of flagrant fouls i think any time there is hard contact , it s an automatic flagrant because of the reputation of the knicks buck williams had one against new jersey that i think was ludicrous when teams hit us it s never flagrant in the game those are reputation things those are things i find disturbing against the nets , the knicks need to focus on more than fouls , such as how to stop keith van horn , who scored 29 points in the first meeting i think we 're going to have to do a better job on van horn , van gundy said obviously , if he s making the 3point shot like last game , he makes himself a more difficult cover because he puts the ball on the floor so well rebounds the knicks waived pete myers yesterday to make room for anthony bowie , who was signed for the rest of the season bowie , 34 years old , spent five seasons with the orlando magic , and played last season for olimpia milano of the italian a1 league , where he averaged 153 points a game the 6foot6inch swingman had offseason knee surgery and has not played this season , but he will be in uniform tonight it gives us a versatile player , knicks general manager ernie grunfeld said he has a lot of experience in the league and gives us good insurance
triage by scott anderson 235 pp new york scribner 23 anyone who has lived through combat and tried to talk about it to someone who has not will remember the look there is excitement , at first but then the listener s eyes draw away , sympathetic but distant and , finally , simply uninterested and you realize suddenly that you have made your life , and your near death , a bore so after a while , you do not talk about the war to those who have not been there if you 're a journalist , you write the story , publish the picture you talk about other things scott anderson , a journalist who has been in many danger zones , including bosnia and chechnya , knows this so , too , do the characters in his haunting first novel , triage it is a story of war , the photographers who cover it and the people they leave behind it is about the insidious guilt that attaches itself to the deaths of all those you saw dying but could not save , because you never can not the shrunken babies in the refugees' arms not the young woman whose red handprint , streaked on the wall , lingers in the house where she had thought she would find shelter none of them it is the guilt that comes from having been the ultimate voyeur at the ultimate moment the novel opens among kurds facing an iraqi assault in the late 1980 s , another episode in a fight that only the kurds or the correspondents and aid workers who travel among them ever seem to care about , a perpetual secondtier conflict , as anderson writes mark walsh , an american freelance photographer , has been wounded and finds himself in a hideous makeshift hospital where the kurdish doctor can do nothing but guess at which patients are beyond his feeble power to heal to make room for those coming freshly wounded from the battlefield , the doctor tags the men he thinks have no chance to survive then he shoots them the kurdish warriors , those proud perennial losers of middle east history , call themselves pesh merga do you know what pesh merga means \? the doctor asks walsh it means 'those who face death' a romantic name do n't you think \? poetic i myself have never seen one face death they all turn away at the end walsh is not tagged for mercy killing he makes it out to turkey and back to his spanish girlfriend in brooklyn but he does not talk about what happened to him in the mountains of northern iraq he does not explain what happened to the friend who went with him to kurdistan but did not come back he kept the details of his work to himself as if it were all some desperate secret , anderson writes he would be quiet for a few days , waiting for his mind to adjust to peacefulness the same way eyes had to adjust to the dark if only his mind would adjust but it betrays him , and as it does , his body begins to shut down his legs no longer function the world of his apartment closes in one does not feel very sorry for walsh , in fact we do n't know him that well we never have any real idea why he has spent nine years of his life photographing combat for walsh , as for many other correspondents and photographers , war has become a job , a way of life , sometimes a rush and then it s all you know how to do is there a reason that he searches out suffering thousands of miles away from home when there is so much of it just down the street \? walsh does n't know , or guess , or ask he moves along the brittle surface of the pain that he sees , as if it had no roots in his own experience all we know is that his parents have retired to fort lauderdale , a brother has a nice apartment in seattle , one sister is in san diego and another is in chicago when walsh was little , he used to watch the evening news while sitting on his father s lap , and sometimes it made him cry so much for history , culture , faith , family , all the things so important to the people he photographs as they die in obscure wars a typically rootless american , walsh can hardly begin to understand their conflicts , their lives or their deaths walsh s girlfriend , elena , however , has a european s sense of history she has a woman s knack for deflating a man s pretensions of bravery , a woman s need to know the things he will not admit we are not sure what has brought elena to her barren loft with walsh , but we do know what she is running from the history of the grandfather who raised her she has discovered that he operated a special clinic for franco at the end of the spanish civil war papa joaquin took in war criminals and purified their thoughts before sending them back into the world this is the inherited guilt she lives with , and which she hopes to atone for then joaquin insinuates himself back into her life , hoping to cure walsh the old fascist is still spry , bright and unrepentant he is the character who gives the book its life , its grim but genuine humor and all of its worthwhile surprises into the sere landscapes of a hemingwayesque novel about men at war comes this roman catholic conscience straight out of graham greene , full of doubt , anger and hardearned , hardedged wisdom joaquin was not a voyeur , but a participant in a vast and monstrous war because decent men never act as quickly as tyrants , the decent of both sides were soon dispensed with and because cruelty has always been man s most awesome weapon capable of shocking entire nations , entire peoples , into submission the spoils of victory went to those who showed mercy the least , who knew cruelty the best joaquin learned in andalusia , where history had always moved with such cruel deliberation , that history was now to become like a falling object , constantly gaining momentum in triage you will find that there are a few peasants who are far too wise , or at least too articulate , and some long passages of dialogue that should have disappeared in earlier drafts and there are times when i wish anderson s design for this novel were a little less schematic there are too many layers of triage in kurdistan , in a new york hospital and in joaquin s defunct center for psychological purification plus the sorting that takes place when elena examines the files of refugees at her job in the united nations , or when walsh selects his slides on the light table but the thought that lingers at the end of the book remains strong those who look death in the face do what they can , and it is all they can do as reporters , as photographers , even as voyeurs , they try to make the rest of us glimpse , at least for one uncomfortable moment , the thing we did not want to see
to the editor two oped articles on march 22 , read in tandem , furnish compelling reasons for directing the country s attention away from sensationalism and back to responsible government gloria steinem explains that feminists have fought hard to make sexual harassment a punishable offense but to satisfy the law , an individual must be forced to submit to the conduct against his or her will in president clinton s case , none of the accusers have claimed that this happened while the president s attention is diverted to such trivia , our foreign policy , according to jack f matlock jr , is in shambles he calls our frenetic diplomatic activity in serbia s kosovo region a fresh example of floundering in today s international environment he criticizes our pursuit of nato expansion as mindless yet mindless or not , but for the intervention of trent lott , the senate majority leader , for unrelated reasons , expansion might have become a fait accompli as long as the press behaves as if the country s sole concern is with bill clinton s sexual conduct , united states interests will not be served renate a hunter pound ridge , ny , march 23 , 1998
to the editor any writer whose book has as many opinions as my own always in pursuit expects to encounter disagreement , some of it very intense but walter goodman s attempt to narrow my concerns and distort my meanings was quite surprising \( feb 8 \) he cites long essays about duke ellington , william faulkner and john ford but never assesses them he also fails to address the selfimposed adventures in essay form noted in the introduction , which are central to the shape , pace and sequencing of the book goodman wants the reader to believe that all i do in the book is attack black nationalists and critics of america , but fails to make clear the range of my targets of disdain in the long last essay , my paddling of louis farrakhan appears just before , to use one of goodman s handmedown terms , my bashing of patrick buchanan he distorts my take on affirmative action , which is that while i theoretically disagree with the idea of setasides , i observe that none of its critics have come up with a solution that faces the documented , hardcore facts of racist hiring practices what i have to say about the 1963 birmingham bombing foreshadowing the horror of oklahoma city , about popular culture , about race and film , about sex in the military , world war ii , colin powell , pedophilia , the media , anatole broyard , contemporary slavery in west africa , benny goodman , american writers choosing to segregate themselves while some of our most popular television shows and some of our best filmmakers have not , the relationship of anonymity to civility and a number of other subjects seems to have just whizzed by goodman his greatest obsessions nearly half of his review are the pieces on the o j simpson trial and secretary of commerce ron brown , which he calls rhapsodies to johnnie cochran and brown , rather than acknowledging the complexity of my readings if it were true that what crouch most deeply admires and celebrates is black success , the american way , eddie murphy , michael jackson , tupac shakur and russell simmons would have been rhapsodized as well were goodman to think of my central term , tragic optimism , he might get closer to my actual conception yet he finds the simpson and brown pieces less rewarding but more revealing than other essays \( they are also , the reader should know , much shorter than the big essays \) what goodman means is that , faced with a complex vision that favors neither black nor white , neither male nor female , nor any class from the top to the bottom , and that acknowledges the tragedies of america as well as its triumphs , he would prefer to impose a talkshow level of revelation stanley crouch new york
elizabeth warren , a professor at harvard law school , calls it the single biggest scandal in the consumer bankruptcy system but none of its many critics seem able to change it the scandal , as she and others see it , is that florida and texas and , to a lesser degree , iowa , kansas and south dakota have fast become debtors' paradises , allowing big spenders who file for bankruptcy to keep not just luxurious homes but often millions of dollars in wages , annuities and pension income as well by contrast , debtors in some states , including new york and new jersey , can wind up with little or nothing the disparity among the states is fundamentally unfair , ms warren said in iowa , a debtor can save a 1 million home , but a person who has a 6 , 000 home in oklahoma would lose it defenders of generous state exemptions say that nobody should be turned out of a home , be it a hovel or a castle but in october , after three years of study , a government commission released a 1 , 300page report that urged lawmakers to put an end to the smorgasbord of state homestead exemptions , which allow people to keep a certain amount of home equity after bankruptcy it recommended instead one rule that would allow debtors to keep up to 100 , 000 even so , the issue for now appears politically untouchable , with two members of congress introducing bankruptcyoverhaul bills last fall that ignored homestead exemptions altogether the reason is that in the last three years there has been such explosive growth in personal bankruptcies that lawmakers are more concerned with finding ways to slow the number of filings yet states with generous exemptions are clearly playgrounds for affluent debtors consider the case of dr carlos garciarivera , a miami surgeon who carried no malpractice insurance , a choice that is becoming more common among florida physicians in 1994 , faced with four malpractice suits , including one from a woman who lost her leg , dr garciarivera filed for bankruptcy protection , making it virtually impossible for these patients to collect anything from him but dr garciarivera could still swim in his 100foot pool , use one of his five bathrooms or stroll the grounds of his 500 , 000 miami home michael seese , a lawyer for dr garciarivera , declined to comment such cases are not uncommon , said joel tabas , a lawyer with tabas , singerman freedman in miami , the governmentappointed trustee in the doctor s liquidation when a doctor puts a lot of money in his home and does n't carry malpractice insurance , it s called going naked and it s perfectly legal some lawmakers contend that declaring personal bankruptcy is now too easy , enabling too many americans to erase debts they may actually be able to pay more bankruptcy filings , critics say , have translated into more abuses in 1994 , congress set up the ninemember national bankruptcy review commission made up of experts like robert e ginsberg , a federal bankruptcy judge , and edith hollan jones , a federal appeals court judge to examine the law and make recommendations on how to change it it was the commission s report that led to last fall s debate about homestead exemptions this debate will not be subsiding anytime soon the american bankers association estimates that a record 135 million people , up 134 percent from 1996 , filed for bankruptcy last year , seeking to discharge 40 billion in debt some 70 percent of those will try to pay creditors by selling assets under a provision in the code known as chapter 7 under chapter 7 , debtors can exempt certain assets usually 2 , 000 to 4 , 000 of personal property and a small amount of home equity under federal law , the states set their own ceilings and legislate whether debtors can choose the federal allowance instead debtors who choose the federal exemption can keep 15 , 000 in home equity generous in some areas but only 18 states allow that option critics of the bankruptcy code have long said that the homestead allowances in the more generous states may actually encourage people to file for bankruptcy there but that does not appear to be the case in 1996 , one household in every 82 nationwide declared bankruptcy , according to the american bankruptcy institute but in florida and texas , the rates were slightly lower one in 91 and one in 104 , respectively the nation s bankruptcy hot spot was tennessee , where one in every 40 households declared bankruptcy , even though the state has a miserly 7 , 500 homestead exemption one reason legislators have been slow to act on the homestead exemption is that no one is willing to tangle with politicians and doctors' lobbies from florida or texas , who have traditionally defended state policies in fact , a move last year in florida to cap the state s homestead exemption was crushed by a state commission the current system is grossly unfair , said a jay cristol , the chief federal bankruptcy judge in miami this law was written to give everyone a fresh start after bankruptcy , not to allow people to keep luxury homes
washington , nov 3 president clinton watched the election returns roll in tonight much the same way that he had campaigned from the white house , in the company of loyal friends and quietly although he bitterly complained in the last two days about the political culture of washington , the president remained sequestered with his wife , hillary , here rather than venture into a country that was molding his political fate none of us know what is going to happen , mr clinton said this morning when asked if this election , with impeachment hearings looming , was a referendum on whether he should stay in office , the president replied that it was a referendum on all the hopes of the american people for the future and their assessment of the present condition mr clinton monitored the returns for part of the evening in the office of john d podesta , his chief of staff , and telephoned several democrats across the country as they won or lost their campaigns mrs clinton spent the evening watching the movie beloved in the white house theater like birthdays for others , elections have served as signposts in mr clinton s life , and he seemed to be in a philosophical mood today answering a handful of questions before a lengthy meeting with his economic advisers , he seized on a reporter s observation that today marked his sixth anniversary they have been six very good years , very good years for our country , mr clinton said and as i tell everybody around here , even the bad days are good mr clinton spoke today with president ernesto zedillo of mexico about storm damage in central america and with prime minister tony blair of england about iraq but though his aides said the president seemed focused on such matters , they said he was quite nervous about the election his political director , craig smith , regularly updated him through the day , and the president placed several calls to friends around the country , asking , in the words of one adviser , whaddaya hear , whaddaya know , whaddaya think \? he s desperately worried about the money , this adviser said , referring to a 110 million republican party advantage in fundraising in this election all the late information was good , all the polling and the anecdotal stuff , but they 've got so much more money , and he s just haunted by how much more money they have early this year , some white house aides speculated that democrats might actually gain seats in the midterm elections but such talk faded as the monica lewinsky scandal intensified this summer now they are emphasizing that money , rather than any presidential dalliance and lies , gave the republicans a powerful advantage in addition to a lastminute push for help from donors , mr clinton and other democrats worked hard in recent days to encourage black voters among the most reliable democrats to go to the polls that strategy appeared to be paying off , white house aides said today through a series of interviews in the last three days with news organizations oriented toward black and hispanic americans , mr clinton repeatedly urged his listeners to vote , warning that republicans would obstruct policies beneficial to minorities in a measure of how much his political position has recovered since his acknowledgment of an affair with ms lewinsky , mr clinton tried to turn the scandal to his advantage , suggesting that republicans who were focused on it could not govern effectively the president presented himself as the victim of relentless political enemies obsessed with scandal , in an interview broadcast monday night on the cable network bet there s a sort of a permanent political class in washington that tends to thrive on such matters because they 're not affected by what i came here to do , mr clinton said he reeled off policy goals , like raising the minimum wage , that he said did not matter to such people there is a group in america where the acquisition of political power is more important than the purpose for which it s used , he said mr clinton said some of his opponents never thought they would have another democratic president in their lifetimes the ones that are consumed with personal animosity toward me or toward hillary , he said , i think are just angry because they thought they and their crowd would always be able to drive up to the west wing to work every day he said that he was not even angry at them anymore , adding , i'm just sorry mr clinton said the elections of 1992 and 1996 were the most important of his career but this election , he said , is very important to me because it will determine how much i can do for the american people in the next two years mr clinton took part in few campaignstyle rallies this year his aides said they decided on a rose garden strategy well before mr clinton was enveloped by scandal in 1994 , they said , sending mr clinton out on the stump seemed to hurt candidates' chances , and previous presidents seemed to do little good for their parties' candidates in offyear elections instead , mr clinton raised money for democrats and doggedly highlighted a select handful of issues even as the furor over ms lewinsky seemed to be drowning him out other democrats picked up on those same themes shoring up social security , raising the minimum wage , modernizing classrooms with a unanimity not seen since 1992 , white house aides said stop almost any democrat on the street corner running for office , and they 'll tell you why they 're running , said paul begala , a senior aide to the president and they 'll go right to these things we laid out at the beginning of the year photo economic meeting before settling down for the election returns , president clinton met yesterday with his advisers to talk about the economy \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
until today , none of newsweek s reporting had appeared in newsweek magazine but no one would know that from the way the clinton scandal has been covered over the past week although newsweek decided at the last minute , on saturday , jan 17 , not to publish its scoop on the accusations that are now common knowledge , the magazine has since been cited by just about every news organization for its accounts about monica s lewinsky , linda r tripp and vernon e jordan jr newsweek has been credited for every reprint of tape transcripts , and its reporters and editors have appeared on several news programs indeed , it seems that newsweek both hooked the big one and let the big one get away how newsweek pulled this off in such an overheated media climate has to do with several factors the tapes , the internet and michael isikoff , who became part of the drama even as he was reporting it basically , newsweek appears to be the only news organization that had heard a sample of the 20 hours of recorded telephone conversations between ms tripp and ms lewinsky therefore , newsweek receives credit when transcripts are reprinted , and this has put newsweek in the position of being able to control the flow of news to some degree in addition , newsweek appeared to regain some of its advantage on wednesday evening by posting an electronic version of the article on america online the report was perhaps the most comprehensive account to date of the accusations under investigation newsweek s edge is largely attributable to mr isikoff , who had been aware of the accusations regarding president clinton and a white house intern for about a year although he did not know the intern s name until the fall in fact , in newsweek s cover article this week , mr isikoff essentially reports on himself and how he first met ms tripp in the spring of 1997 , when he was reporting on the paula corbin jones lawsuit against the president the article explains how mr isikoff was present in october when ms tripp met with lucianne s goldberg , a new york literary agent , at the home of ms goldberg s son , jonah , and was invited to hear the tapes thus far isikoff declined to listen newsweek reports , and left goldberg s house in a telephone interview on saturday , mr isikoff said if i had listened to the tapes that were being made , i would have become party to the process that made me uneasy now , it appears that newsweek has weathered perhaps even benefited from what seemed like one of the most difficult decisions in its 65year history it was not , as mr isikoff said last week , an easy call ann mcdaniel , an assistant managing editor at newsweek , said , there was certainly a candid difference of opinion in another article in this week s issue , the magazine explains its decision not to go to press with the material on saturday night , jan 17 it says that the tapes neither confirmed nor disproved the accusations of obstruction of justice , and that questions remained about ms lewinsky it hurt like hell , and i felt especially bad for mike , said richard m smith , newsweek s editor in chief and president but given the magnitude of the allegations and the information we had at the time , i'm convinced we acted responsibly the decision was also informed by a request from kenneth w starr , the independent counsel , to hold off for fear of jeopardizing his inquiry abc news made a similar call two nights later in cuba to cover the pope s visit , top news officials decided not to broadcast jackie judd s report i had not been able to ask the questions i needed to ask to cross the t s and dot the i s , said david westin , the president of abc news if i had known everything everyone in the organization knew , we probably would have gone with it but i did n't abc broadcast the report over an hour later , on abc radio bill kovach , the curator of the nieman foundation at harvard university , said he favored restraint i think you 're better off missing a story than getting it wrong , he said i'm disturbed by the extent to which we 've allowed competitive pressures to enslave a free press still , mr isikoff said saturday , in some ways , it would have been nice to do it the right way but at the same time , maybe we 're getting more credit and publicity this way photo after pulling the article it had before all competitors , newsweek finally weighs in this week

all biologists i know grieve for the loss of a species , even one as obscure as a tropical land snail , the last individual of which expired a year ago in the hand of one of the few specialists who could recognize it for what it was the problem is that somehow this concern has to be spread throughout mankind i know people whose connection to the natural world has been so atrophied that they would happily see asphalt laid from one end of the land to the other many more , perfectly goodhearted , believe that the richness of nature resembles a welltended golf course on the contrary , in temperate climates we need tolerance of messy , weedy corners we have to cure suburbanites of their passion for tidying up eldredge movingly describes how a neglected corner of chicago has regenerated a postagestamp morsel of prairie natural ecology has a memory longer than human cupidity in the tropical rain forests the situation is both worse and more delicate with some justice , the local governments resent finger wagging from western ecologists , especially since men in suits from the same western countries are offering them good cash for their wood or animal products eldredge tells an illuminating story of being sold rare tenrecs in madagascar by children , and sneaking up the road to release them again into the wild who is in the right in this case \? we all know of the greed that is destroying great tracts of indonesia a colleague of mine discovered that a species of fish used as a staple item of diet was not even a named species it may be doomed even before its ecological needs are known clearly this is a global scandal , but can the tribesman be blamed for reaching for the last fat fish , and can a hungry child be expected to lament the passing of a salamander \? the story of man s dominion over nature and his subsequent abuse of power cannot be told too often , and eldredge , a curator at the american museum of natural history in new york , has provided one of the most succinct accounts yet the problem is that it is hard to know who is listening people are too busy mining the seam to heed the death of the canary politicians are mostly not evil , but political expediency has already allowed them to squander the fisheries , collude in the destruction of rain forest , fail to prevent erosion in the himalayas and exhibit dismal feebleness in the face of the supposed inexorability of markets president clinton s hand still hovers over the signature that might commit him to expensive pollution reduction the australians have even won concessions to increase greenhouse emissions eldredge s list of what we must all learn is sensible and biologically informed but we will probably go on nudging other inhabitants of our planet into oblivion until the stench of our own pollution forces us to realize that it is already too late
there is a term in hiphop , flavor it is a good thing rappers want to have flavor panache , style , something extra that enables them to stand out from the pack in their 17 years together , however , the beastie boys have developed something much better than flavor taste this is not a hiphop term it is the key to survival in the mercurial world of pop musicians like david bowie , peter gabriel and david byrne have good taste as most of their colleagues have fossilized , it has enabled them to remain relevant , even after their hitmaking days ended the beastie boys are listeners as much as they are musicians , so any music they make is going to be interesting this has enabled them to survive commercially while every rap act from their era has fallen by the wayside \( with the exception of l l cool j , whose grip on the mainstream has become tenuous as his taste has devolved into mimicry \) that is , if one could still consider the beastie boys rap , because they 've blown what little currency they did have in the hiphop world by following their broader instincts instead of the orthodoxy of the rap mainstream the band s previous two albums were a collection of hardcore punk songs and an album of lighter instrumental music its new record jams 22 tracks with 8 singers into 68 minutes this is not the output of a group that sets out to make the perfect pop record like pet sounds , sgt pepper or even it takes a nation of millions \( the rap classic by public enemy \) this is the work of a band that aims to show how much it can do hello nasty jumps from rap to easy listening to latin to noise to soul to opera to rock without pausing for breath as the band boasts in intergalactic , i'm so versatile the beastie boys are emblematic of a new breed of artists who have emerged over the past decade , the collectormusicians where postmodern musicians slap different styles together noncommittally , as if they were all equivalent colors in the sonic palette , collectormusicians weld different sounds together with commitment and bias their songs are more tributes than statements for example , the eccentric dubreggae pioneer lee \( scratch \) perry appears on hello nasty , not to make the album better , more commercial or more musical , but simply because the band likes him and wants to collect his voice like an audio autograph it s not that collectormusicians \( they also include beck , the dust brothers , stereolab and cornelius \) are fans more than artists it s that being a fan is part of their art from their first full hiphop album , licensed to ill in 1986 , the beastie boys set themselves up as observers and emulators of rap culture , privileged white boys looking in from the outside , as they did as teenagers in the years leading up to the record , running around manhattan clubs where punk , new wave and rap were mingling since then , the beastie boys have transformed themselves from a band to an enterprise like mr gabriel s real world label or mr byrne s luaka bop , the beastie boys developed grand royal , a record label and a magazine \( plus a clothing company called xlarge \) predicated on the notion that the beastie boys have good taste , that they know what is cool another key to their survival is their ability to spot talented musicians and use them on their albums , whether it s the dust brothers' producing paul s boutique nine years ago or the contributions from the turntablist mixmaster mike and the keyboardist money mark on hello nasty as music buffs , the beastie boys are also able to listen to current rap and rock and siphon off the elements that make them interesting , as evident in the snatches of violin and spedup female voices on the new album , both tricks borrowed from the wutang producer known as rza hello nasty sounds like a night with disk jockey who has a short attention span samples of everything from stravinsky to tito puente to earlier beasties albums abound hiphop beats are mixed into latin music songs skid to a halt as the sound of a needle scratching across a record interrupts and all kinds of turntable tricks sirens , horns , electronic gurgles and sound effects are mixed on top of the busy songs , as the band raps lines like , remote control , change the station on the album , some of the stations are playing seething , energetic music , and some are playing directionless throwaways it is the curse of the collectormusician knowing too much and wanting to do it all the most often cited dilemma for the beastie boys is that their most popular music has been their goofiest tongueincheek frat anthems like fight for your right \( to party ! \) and girls they may be too smart to fail these days , but they are also too smart to be a phenomenon again though some would place the beastie boys in the genre of alternative rock , they behave more like a classicrock band , especially since the personalities of the three members have been diverging though they tend to rap in unison , it s easy to pick out the three intertwined aesthetics at work lines like share your love with a friend come from the member who has discovered spirituality , the aspiring tibetan buddhist adam yauch phrases like money makin' come from the member making the shift into the executive world , mike diamond and the phrase dogs love me cause i'm crazy sniffable probably come from the band s secret weapon , the clown and collector adam horovitz sillysmart lines like the rundmc parody i'm the king of boggle , there is none higher i get 11 points off the word quagmire , best fuse all their personalities on hello nasty , there is probably something for everyone , but there is probably no one whom everything is for popular music is moving past the time when combining two genres is going to create something new it is more the exposition of a distinct personal taste that is going to result in a new sound in other words , something unusual is less likely to arise from a combination of hiphop and celtic music \( that s flavor \) then it is from someone mixing the sound of the wutang clan and the chieftains , along with a few other favorites from a treasured record collection , like , say , celia cruz , willie nelson and a cocktailmusic compilation on rhino records \( this is taste \) flavor fades , but taste is a lifetime trait and hello nasty is a testament to good taste , even if it at times it does lack flavor photo more than flavor the beastie boys from left , adam yauch , adam horovitz and mike diamond observe and collect the best of their contemporaries \( ryan murphy \)
just when people thought baseball would never recover its magic , along come the watches of 1998 , on subjects both pitiful and powerful who would have expected the seattle relievers' blown saves to dwarf their saves , causing the onceproud team to approach its series beginning tonight at yankee stadium struggling to reach 500 \? who could have guessed that the detroit tigers would , after 22 games , own all of five victories \? but enough of the rubbernecking at the car wrecks the runs for glory are really what 1998 is all about practically every player who ever visited a weight room is chasing roger maris s season home run record of 61 an incredible 19 players had 7 or more home runs after last night s games most eyes are naturally on mark mcgwire of st louis the paul bunyan of baseball had 10 before last night s rainout , one short of his april total of 11 last year , when he finished with 58 yet mcgwire trailed the unsung vinny castilla of the colorado rockies , the majors' leader with 11 home runs maris s home run mark is not the only legendary record being stalked so , too , are records for runs batted in hack wilson s major league mark of 190 rbi has stood since he set it with the cubs in 1930 lou gehrig s american league record of 184 has survived since 1931 but mcgwire , castilla and juan gonzalez of the texas rangers are all making some serious earlyseason noises gonzalez is proving particularly scary to pitching staffs the game s most relentless rbi machine , game per game , methodical to a fault , has driven in 36 in his first 24 games , a major league record for april now , compiling projections in april can seem as silly as it can be hazardous , especially in connection with gonzalez , given his penchant for injuries and longterm absences it can also be fun , and it certainly ca n't hurt anyone so here goes if gonzalez plays every day for the rangers , something he has done to date but has never managed in any previous season , he was on pace to drive in 243 runs there we said it now all the player known as igor has to do is to go out , find a way to top his personal best of 155 games played , and get it done should he stay healthy , you have to like his chances since the start of the 1996 season , gonzalez had driven in 313 runs in 291 games through last night , including 144 in 134 games in 1996 and 131 in 133 games a year ago that s an incredible 107 rbi a game no player in the last 40 years has matched that pace in a season other than gonzalez , in '96 last weekend alone , gonzalez collected 10 rbi in 3 games against the royals at this pace , gonzalez is showing every intention of at least equaling vern stephens s major league record of three consecutive seasons of 130 rbi or more , set by the former boston red sox player in 194850 in a telling comment on today s pitching , gonzalez is not the only player threatening to join stephens ken griffey jr of the mariners and andres galarraga of the braves can do so , too , should they top 130 this season castilla does not compare to griffey , gonzalez or galarraga in terms of name recognition or prior accomplishments yet he is proving to be one of most intriguing power men of his day , as his 91 home runs and 259 rbi dating to the start of the 1996 season suggest when the braves lost vinny to us in the expansion draft , bobby cox told me this guy would be a hitter , rockies manager don baylor said of his counterpart with atlanta now bobby says , 'i knew he would hit , but i did n't think he would hit 40 home runs ! ' castilla has been overshadowed in recent seasons by some remarkable power sources on his own team last year , galarraga , then the rockies' first baseman , became the first national leaguer to drive in 150 runs since the dodgers' tommy davis in 1962 larry walker came within 4 hits and 10 rbi of winning the league s first triple crown in 60 years walker , the rockies' right fielder , settled for 49 homers , 130 rbi , a 366 average and a most valuable player award castilla \? all he did was hit 304 , slug 40 homers and drive in 113 runs , incredibly duplicating his numbers in those three categories in 1996 for those who snicker that castilla s numbers are elevated by the thin air in the rockies' milehigh coors field , consider this only 3 of castilla s 11 home runs this season have been hit in home games last year , 19 of his 40 were hit on the road there are more star names out there , and he does n't get the recognition he deserves , baylor said but you do n't truly appreciate what he does unless you see him every day castilla still must wait his turn for recognition , lined up as he is in the national league behind allstar third basemen like the diamondbacks' matt williams , the braves' chipper jones and the padres' ken caminiti none have castilla s numbers this season they just have the reps if castilla , whose only allstar appearance came in 1995 , slashes through may the way he did april , he may well force others to consider the possibilities of what he might do as he said sunday following a twohomer , fiverbi feast in atlanta , when i hit the ball well , it jumps castilla is jumping in status , too , joining this season s intriguing races for glory with mcgwire , gonzalez , griffey and galarraga impressive company , indeed photo the unsung vinny castilla leads the major leagues with 11 home runs \( associated press \)
purchase , ny , aug 16 if john mcenroe had had his way , he would have preferred to play one of his longtime rivals , jimmy connors or bjorn borg , in today s final of the 200 , 000 citibank champions tennis tournament apart from the competitive fires that such matches arouse in mcenroe , he was eager to end connors s reign as the fourtime winner of this event and to avenge a loss to borg in last year s semifinals but connors had to default in the quarterfinals to john lloyd because of a foot injury and borg withdrew before the tournament for players 35 and over started because of foot blisters so , the 39yearold mcenroe found himself playing the 44yearold lloyd , against whom he was 130 in matches on the regular and senior tours mcenroe made it 14 after a 61 , 62 rout in front of about 3 , 000 at manhattanville college though mcenroe insists he is not the player he was while winning seven grand slam events and 77 career titles over all , he certainly appeared to be close to his top form this afternoon that was particularly true of his serve he yielded only eight points in eight service games and permitted lloyd to reach deuce only once , in the opening game of the 1hour10minute match in addition , mcenroe drilled six aces lloyd had none if john serves with that accuracy , especially in the corners , i do n't think anyone is going to get it back , said lloyd , who had his service broken twice in each set , and i do n't care how young the guys are and when he plays like he did today , i think he would cause damage among a lot of the players on the regular tour mcenroe conceded that he had not lost much on his wicked twist serve my service is the closest part of my game to being what it was before , said mcenroe , whose victory , worth 50 , 000 , was his third in four tournaments on the nuveen tour this year and my serve was better than average when i played so were his ground strokes , volleys and his service returns , and they were all vintage mcenroe today , as were his footwork and court coverage lloyd is primarily a serveandvolley player , but mcenroe passed him whenever he tried to come in to the net lloyd had to stay back and hit ground strokes , which proved futile against a gifted and steady shotmaker my plan was to be aggressive from the start against john , said lloyd , who lives in pacific palisades , calif , but obviously it did n't work
nairobi , kenya , jan 1 with more than half of the constituencies counted in kenya s chaotic presidential election , the former vice president , mwai kibaki , was putting up a strong fight against president daniel arap moi as the counting of ballots continued at a slow pace , the situation remained explosive both mr moi and mr kibaki have laid the groundwork for rejecting the results should they lose , raising fears of violence from their supporters both men have accused the kenya electoral commission of rigging the election against them after officials botched the delivery of ballots to many constituencies and had to extend voting on wednesday night , mr kibaki , of the democratic party , and another opposition candidate , raila odinga , of the national development party , said they would not accept the results if mr moi won and warned that the country was edging toward civil strife it is clear that this rigging will lead to violence , to disaster , mr odinga said in response , mr moi s aides put out a tough statement this morning warning opposition leaders to accept the results and warning them that security officials would deal swiftly and firmly with politicians who tried to disturb the peace today mr kibaki struck a more conciliatory tone at a news conference with mr odinga this morning , he appeared unwilling to reject the election results as long as he had a chance of victory urging his supporters to be calm , mr kibaki said mr moi was trying to confuse kenyans by placing all the blame on the electoral commission when much of the fault lay with the government itself kenyans can no longer be duped , he said he also committed himself to forming a government of national unity with mr odinga and other opposition leaders , hinting that should he become president he would include other political factions in his cabinet mr kibaki , who is 66 , may have reason for hope with about 69 percent of kenya s 210 parliamentary constituencies counted , he was trailing mr moi by only 336 , 000 votes 1 , 351 , 000 to 1 , 686 , 700 , according to unofficial returns broadcast on kenya television network mr moi , who is 74 , is seeking a fifth and final fiveyear term as president his opponents say his administration has destroyed this onceprosperous country s infrastructure and economy , ruling with corruption and incompetence in 1992 , he reluctantly bowed to international pressure and scrapped the oneparty state he had built in the 1980 s , agreeing to hold multiparty elections he won the 1992 contest with about 37 percent of the vote , mostly because his opponents were splintered along tribal lines mr kibaki , an economist who served as mr moi s vice president from 1978 to 1988 , ran a wellorganized campaign with an anticorruption theme he accused mr moi and his cronies of stealing tax revenues that should have gone to roads , schools and hospitals he also promised free primary education to every child though mr kibaki s message has won him more support than in the last election , when he placed third with 20 percent of the vote , he faces one big handicap he is a kikuyu , a member of kenya s largest tribe most smaller tribes fear the return of a kikuyu to the presidency under jomo kenyatta , the country s first president , the government ignored their regions mr moi , who comes from the small kalenjin community , has capitalized on that fear , forging a coalition of smaller tribes from the rift valley , the northeast and the indian ocean coast indeed , tribalism is at the root of kenya s current political crisis mr odinga represents the aspirations of the luo , kenya s third largest group , while the candidate now running fourth in the returns , michael kijana wamalwa , comes from the luhyia , the second largest tribe if mr kibaki , mr wamalwa and mr odinga had agreed to back a single candidate , they would have easily defeated mr moi but their supporters are too suspicious of candidates from other tribes to construct a coalition , analysts say in addition , none of these challengers have strong support outside their tribal regions , while mr moi has won allies from several tribes through government patronage the result is a tinderbox if mr kibaki and mr odinga choose to reject the election results and call on their supporters to take mass action , the country could easily descend into tribal violence , diplomats and political analysts said some prodemocracy advocates are even arguing the election should be immediately annulled to avoid violence a convention should be held to draft a new constitution that gives less power to the president and encourages coalition governments , they said the moment moi is announced as the winner , you are going to see this country go up in flames , kivutha kibwana , a prodemocracy lobbyist , said at a news conference today the violent undercurrent could be seen today in the railways club in central nairobi , where election officials were counting ballots in the presidential race in the westlands constituency it was a close race between mr moi and mr kibaki after tallying the figures four times , rosemary moraa , an election official , announced the winner is mwai kibaki mr moi had gotten 16 , 651 to mr kibaki s 17 , 154 despite having agreed to all the numbers , agents from mr moi s governing party the kenya african national union exploded and set upon agents for mr kibaki for several minutes , the two groups scuffled a dozen riot police officers did little to stop the fray , but eventually herded the opposition supporters outside while mr moi s backers remained inside , clustered around their candidate for parliament in another incident , two people were killed by the police during a protest outside a counting station in nakuru on tuesday night
the mets were waiting to hear from rickey henderson s representatives last night about their offer of a oneyear deal with an option for a second year while he waited , general manager steve phillips completed a minor trade for a 21yearold prospect and manager bobby valentine did not wait at all when the subject of one of his former players , todd hundley , was broached there s no change from yesterday , phillips said about henderson , referring to his offer of a oneyear deal with a base salary of about 17 million with incentive bonuses and a vested option that kicks in if henderson fulfills certain provisions henderson s representatives had not heard from their client about the proposal during the winter meetings , which begin today in nashville , phillips will likely explore signing edgardo alfonzo to a multiyear deal , according to someone close to the negotiations in the meantime , phillips dealt a player he had acquired last friday joe randa , from detroit for willie blair to the kansas city royals in return , the mets received outfielder juan lebron , kansas city s firstround pick \( 19th over all \) in the 1995 draft the 6foot4inch lebron , who projects as a right fielder , hit 251 with 17 homers and 84 runs batted in and 18 stolen bases in low class a ball last season with lebron , the highly touted alex escobar and jason tyner , last season s firstround pick , the mets now have three decent outfield prospects moving through their system but none of the three will be ready to play in the majors in the next couple of years hence the interest in henderson , who turns 40 on christmas but who stole a major leagueleading 66 bases last season and would bat leadoff for the mets next season i'm waiting for a response , phillips said i'm waiting for them to call me back the offer s on the table but i 've assumed from the beginning that the seattle mariners have been in all along , too with any player , you establish a value and make an offer if it does n't work out , then you go on to the next step and we have a more than adequate alternative within our organization i'm not dissatisfied at all with jermaine allensworth , roger cedeno and jay payton while trade discussions were going on yesterday , and while the waiting game was being played by mets officials , valentine was at a team christmas charity event at shea stadium the manager was asked by the msg network about some comments hundley had made about the poor nature of their relationship the comments had been broadcast on the fox show the last word the night before valentine was asked if he was sad that he and hundley , who also made disparaging statements about his former manager in a recent los angeles times article , just could n't hit it off i'm confused about all this stuff about us not getting along , valentine said i really cared about him everything i did was to try to help him if he misunderstood , that s a problem on his side and then valentine was asked if he felt hundley blamed him for the trade for mike piazza , which pushed hundley away from the mets without a doubt , valentine said , offering some curious reasoning todd does a lot of that italian stuff it s an italian thing he thinks that i would do something because he s not italian or because i am italian i think that s ridiculous it s utterly ridiculous , hundley said last night , pointing out that his best friend on the team , joe franco , is of italian descent the more valentine speaks , the more people will understand the reputation he has
london among the major works of 20thcentury art , none have traveled more widely in the 1990 s than the panoramic murals that were painted by marc chagall in january 1920 for the new jewish theater in moscow like that theater itself , and like many of those who had worked for it , they had been proscribed , suppressed and quite possibly destroyed in the soviet union if stalin could order the murder of salomon mikhoels , the jewish theater s greatest actor , what hope was there for the paintings \? the decorations the largest of which was about 13 feet high and 39 feet wide had , in fact , been taken away , rolled on big drums and kept in a secret place at the tretyakov museum in moscow in 1973 , chagall went back to russia after years of absence and was allowed to see them under supervision in 1985 , when the policies of glasnost prevailed , work began on their restoration since 1991 , the murals have been shown at the gianadda foundation in martigny , switzerland \( which had helped substantially toward their restoration \) at the schirn kunsthalle in frankfurt , the guggenheim museum downtown in new york , the art institute of chicago and the musee d'art moderne de la ville de paris invariably , the effect they made was of irresistible jubilation , not unmixed with mischief this was in large part because of the enormous painting called introduction to the jewish theater , which is both an encyclopedia of traditional yiddish motifs and a fastforward autobiography by chagall himself \( scholars have disentangled no fewer than 54 separate motifs in its wonderfully fanciful and yet always incisive intimations \) the murals also include four tall , commanding panels titled drama , music , dance and literature an immensely long and narrow frieze called the wedding feast and a large square painting , love on the stage at once a delight for the eye and an education in the humanities , they were completed by chagall in a remarkably short time there was much to celebrate when those murals were first seen in moscow in 1920 in 1883 the czar had imposed a total ban upon the yiddishlanguage theater , which , thereafter , led at best a clandestine life there appeared to be more promising times in 1919 , when the new regime took cognizance of the fact that 97 percent of russia s jewish population spoke yiddish and should no longer be subjected to deprival yet it may be that only now , at the royal academy of arts in london , where the murals are on view until oct 4 in the exhibition chagall love and the stage , do visitors experience their original impact to achieve this , the viewers need to feel that they are in an enclosed and quite small space at the royal academy that need is met in the unornamented upstairs spaces of the academy s sackler gallery , there is no distraction plain ideas about installation are worked out on plain white walls there is plenty of auxiliary material , and much of it is very telling , but it never strays from the point even those visitors who long ago gave up on later chagall smile in bemusement nearby , but separately , are drawings and sketches that show with what an instantaneous fidelity chagall could note down whatever would suit him for future work a prime instance of this is the jewish wedding , a drawing done with gouache and india ink , pen and brush , mounted on cardboard , on loan from a private collection in st petersburg , russia for energy , vivacity and sharp observation it would be hard to beat chagall said in his memoirs this was to be a real yiddish theater , a temple of joyous creation , where prayers are chanted in the yiddish language we were building a world theater in which only the language separated us from other theaters how would it be \? what gods should we worship \? we could not yet answer these questions we did n't yet know our goals to search for them was our main object the theater in question had a tiny auditorium , with no more than 90 seats it was originally part of a large private house chagall was determined that in this theater painting should take precedence the theater should be a picture gallery as much as an auditorium , and the audience should have had an allenveloping theatrical experience before the play had even begun chagall himself was to be preacher and poet , storyteller and dramatist the theatergoers could watch the actors , if they liked but he , chagall , was ready to occupy their whole attention during the four weeks it took him to complete his work , he allowed no one else to enter the theater food was passed to him through a crack in the door if anyone spoke to him of rehearsals onstage , he groaned \( if only we did n't have to have people around , he said \) when he saw how members of the audience might have to back into the walls to let others pass , he feared that some damage might occur to his paintings above all , he wanted every one of the actors to be chagallized they were to leave the real world at the stage door there was to be nothing of the naturalistic theater that stanislavsky and the moscow art theater had brought to perfection to help his actors avoid that , chagall wanted them , in effect , to merge with his murals to that end , he covered every inch of their costumes with paint he would fall upon them almost at curtain time , with brushes and palette in hand frock coats and peaked caps were transformed at breakneck speed tiny houses with tiny gardens appeared on their trousers birds and little pigs appeared on their hats anything that smacked of realism was outlawed , and even their faces were not exempt from transformation just before \( or after \) curtain time even salomon mikhoels , whom chagall worshiped as an actor , could not escape chagall would hold him back even when he was late on cue and the audience was calling out for him if only i could tear out your right eye , what a wonderful mask i could make for you , the artist once said to the actor when the murals were first seen , they did their work almost too well the audience was so fascinated by them that it refused to let the play begin until someone came onstage and explained what the murals were about but before long , the love affair between chagall and the jewish theater curdled , and aleksei granovsky , the theater s director , decided that there must be limits to chagallization chagall had taken over the auditorium , but he simply could not be allowed to take over the stage in the words of chagall s friend and champion , amos efron we had to fight for our right to perform theater over chagall s dead body , almost everything that we did to try and make theater upset him he even accused the stagehands of deliberately scratching the scenery that he had painted himself chagall was bound to look for a larger audience for his murals , and in february 1921 he wrote to the management of the jewish theater i can find no inner peace until the 'masses' can see my work at present it can be seen , at best , by one hundred jews at close quarters he added , i like the jews very much , and have proved it many times over , but i also like the russians , and people of many other nationalities , and i have been used to painting serious things for all of them he therefore asked the theater to show his murals for two hours a day during which anyone who wished could see them in the end , marc chagall has had his way his murals are welcome the world over , and nowhere more so than in the limpid spaces of the sackler gallery at the royal academy of arts in london at this moment photo a work from the show chagall love and the stage , in london \( adagp , paris , and dacs , london \)

everyone is raving about mark mcgwire s longdistance home runs and how big mac is making roger maris and his home run record of 61 in a season look oh so small with 29 players sporting doublefigure home run totals , the onslaught suggests that this is not just the year of mark mcgwire , but the year of the home run hitter through sunday , there were 724 games played and 1 , 441 homers hit according to the elias sports bureau , that puts the major leaguers well ahead of last year s pace when , after 720 games \( the closest approximation available \) only 1 , 389 homers had been hit watereddown pitching because of expansion and ironpumping , dietarysupplementswilling musclemen are insuring the onslaught but what makes this season truly scary is that short of mcgwire and a select few allstars , many of baseball s big men are falling short when it comes to the long ball when they awake , entire forests may have to give their lives to produce new record books mcgwire s 25 homers the most ever hit through may certainly dazzles so do the 19 hit by alex rodriguez and the 18 by ken griffey jr for seattle colorado s vinny castilla \( 17 \) , and atlanta s andres galarraga \( 17 \) and chipper jones \( 14 \) are doing their part , as is the newcomer damion easley \( 14 \) , who is making tiger stadium look small even the revival of seemingly overthehill power men like san diego s greg vaughn \( 16 \) and toronto s jose canseco \( 17 \) suggests something extraordinary is unfolding still , one look at the leader boards of both leagues shows just how many big names are conspicuous by their absence like , say , most of the yankees at the present pace , the highflying yankees are n't hitting highflying homers they certainly wo n't be confused with the bronx bombers of old until at least one reaches double figures in home runs so far no yankee is close , since derek jeter and darryl strawberry lead the team with seven each jeter and strawberry certainly were n't expected to lead the yankees tino martinez , bernie williams and paul o'neill , who combined for 86 home runs a year ago , are supposed to be the big power sources yet , martinez and williams have only six apiece and o'neill has three through the yankees' 44 games when the majors' home run leader has 10 more homers than martinez , williams and o'neill combined , you have to wonder if all the juiced balls are reserved for mcgwire s games then there are the mets not satisfied to feature a home run leader with only five \( john olerud \) , the mets imported power by acquiring mike piazza from the florida marlins last friday yet piazza , perhaps dizzied by all the wheeling and dealing , has only nine home runs this season he has not gone the distance since may 11 , four days before he was traded by the dodgers to the marlins and 11 days before landing in the middle of the mets' lineup as for piazza s supporting cast , it cannot compare to mcgwire piazza s presence might bring butch huskey \( four homers \) , carlos baerga \( four \) and bernard gilkey \( none \) better pitches whether that will result in homers raining down on shea remains to be seen mcgwire , who has hit nine homers in his last eight games , including no 25 against colorado yesterday , is not making only new york city s big hitters look lilliputian consider this mcgwire now has more home runs than frank thomas \( eight \) , albert belle \( nine \) and fred mcgriff \( six \) combined he has more than 12 times as many homers as the indians' sandy alomar jr \( two \) , more than six times as many home runs as the orioles' cal ripken jr \( four \) gary sheffield \( eight \) and bobby bonilla \( five \) , bornagain dodgers , are n't even in double figures , let alone mcgwire territory nor is san diego s ken caminiti \( seven \) or baltimore s brady anderson , who hit his fifth last night in the absence of these players , mcgwire remains the headliner of this season s home run show he certainly figures to tower over everyone in this year s home run hitting contest when the allstar game festivities visit that longball mecca in denver , coors field , especially since griffey has announced his intentions of being a noshow for that contest griffey s absence would be a tough break for rockies fans , who are used to noshows among homer hitters after all , there are no bigger ones this season than their own larry walker and dante bichette the rockies' onetime home run howitzers combined for 75 homers last year they have nine this season if and when such players start delivering the long ball , major league pitchers might surrender altogether and major league fans will simply be asked to sit back , suspend disbelief and enjoy a display unprecedented in its power , majesty and mayhem let the records fall
political favoritism and nepotism have tainted the admissions practices at a staten island magnet school that had promised to select students only by random lottery , according to a report by an independent investigator that was released yesterday a disproportionate number of students were related to school district or government employees , the investigators found , noting that 52 percent of the sixthgrade students who were accepted for this school year had parents who worked for the school board or city government agencies but the extent of the problem could not be determined because many crucial admissions documents such as applications are missing , the investigators said schools chancellor rudy crew yesterday ordered the superintendent who oversees the school to come up with a plan to correct the admissions process although the report concluded that no board policies had been broken , dr crew said he was concerned about the appearance of impropriety surrounding the admission of students to the school there were no plans to discipline school officials , a board of education spokesman said edward f stancik , the special commissioner of investigation for the new york city school system , began looking into how the michael j petrides school , which opened in 1995 , has been selecting pupils after receiving complaints from parents the parents said that , among other things , school officials were not living up to their promise to use a lottery to pick students school officials have said they use a computerized selection process intended to reflect the geography , demographics and academic ability of the island s students investigators found that some applications had words like sibling or the names of prominent people in the community written on them , though none were identified by name in the 40page report in addition , an analysis of the students showed many were related to teachers and other district employees for the current school year , for example , of 650 applicants for the sixth grade , 67 students , or 10 percent , were children whose parents were board employees but of the 93 applicants who were accepted , 29 students , 31 percent , were children of parents employed by the board 52 percent of the accepted sixth graders , 48 students , had parents employed by the board or by city government agencies like the police and fire departments , the report said what i found most alarming is that the average parent without connections , without influence , was cheated , mr stancik said in an interview a promise was made that every child on the island would have an equal chance to get into this school , and that turns out not to be the case because so many back channels of admission policies really made it impossible to get a random , fair lottery mr stancik went beyond the report in noting the disappearance of applications the fact that records are missing suggests somebody wanted to prevent us from finding the truth , he said there was sloppy record keeping , but it is not a coincidence that all politically related written recommendations are now missing in the report , petrides school officials acknowledged they had received many letters of recommendation , but played down their influence investigators said they found only four applications that had names of influential people written on them all four students were admitted but teachers told investigators there were many more the school s principal , gregory gallo , was also faulted for a lack of candor in responding to investigators' queries mr gallo gave conflicting answers to questions such as who generated the random lists used to select students , the report said , noting that he finally admitted he probably did it himself despite his lack of proficiency with computers mr gallo did not return telephone calls christy cugini , the superintendent of community school district 31 , whom the report criticized for lack of supervision of the process , said he would soon meet with the chancellor to discuss ways to improve oversight of the program he disputed the suggestion of a coverup of records , saying officials had no reason to keep applications once students were accepted mr cugini said he was disturbed only at the number of children with relatives working for the school or board mr cugini s two grandchildren attend the school , a fact the report suggested was the result of an unofficial professional courtesy policy mr cugini denied any intercession on his relatives' behalf and vowed to insure such a practice was not followed the school , on a 42acre campus at 715 ocean terrace that once housed the college of staten island , promotes itself as a seamless kindergartento12thgrade laboratory turning out students adept at technology , analytic thinking , languages and cultural awareness named for a board of education member who died in 1994 and had pushed for the creation of the school , it now enrolls 800 students in kindergarten through ninth grade , with plans for students in all grades by 2001 timothy violette , a member of parents for effective education , a 75member adhoc group that asked for the investigation , praised the report for shedding light on the selection process but complained it did not fully address the group s concerns that the school has fallen short of its academic promise borough president guy v molinari said that he had been called by several people asking him to use his influence to help their children gain admission , but that he had rebuffed them i doubt very much anyone on my staff ever tried to interfere either , he said photo the michael j petrides school occupies a 42acre campus on staten island \( dith pran the new york times \)
like most children , the second graders in room 205 at public school 116 in murray hill love to see images of themselves in the stories they read , their teacher said last week they love the story about how people of every shade rally to help a hispanic mother and daughter who lost everything in an apartment fire they love to read about how children come in all the colors of the earth they especially enjoy a book about an africanamerican father who leaves home to find work , only to return when the seasons change these are tales that most of the 27 students in virginia l lockwood s class can relate to , ms lockwood said on thursday they are mostly children of employees at the united nations , and come from vietnam , the caribbean , japan and other places , as well as manhattan in a setting so dizzyingly diverse , race and ethnicity are beside the point , ms lockwood said multiculturalism a flash point for so much recent tension and bitterness in the city s public schools is no big deal in ms lockwood s class i do n't say , 'look , children , here s a story about a little africanamerican boy , or here s a story about a vietnamese girl , ' ms lockwood said instead , i say 'look , children , here s a great story about feelings let s read it together' the characters might happen to be black , hispanic or asian , but that s not the point but not every classroom in the city is so relaxed last month , a white thirdgrade teacher was driven from a school in bushwick , brooklyn , by black parents angry over her use of a book called nappy hair , a comingofage story about a black girl the parents whom schools chancellor rudy crew later criticized as misguided denounced and threatened the teacher after concluding that the book was offensive in a school system where 66 percent of the 70 , 000 teachers are white and 70 percent of the 11 million school children are black and hispanic , having white teachers teaching black history and culture can hardly be avoided though the bushwick incident resonated throughout the city , it did not dampen the enthusiasm of teachers like ms lockwood if anything , it only strengthened their resolve ms lockwood integrates multiculturalism into her classroom mostly through reading and writing , rather than introducing it as something separate a trap that many people fall into , she said ms lockwood s strategy seems to work while reading a story last week about american children picking on an asian girl because of her native clothes , a vietnamese student said emphatically that the outfit was dressup clothes , not pajamas an africanamerican boy then offered to have his mother sew the outfits for all the students in the class we have children sharing information about their culture in a relaxed setting , rather than setting it up as a day for this culture or that culture , ms lockwood said gail wesson spivey , a black librarian at ps 198 in east flatbush and teri gray , a white jewish secondgrade teacher , help each other avoid culturally insensitive material by running books by each other ms spivey also relies on parents last week , she asked a muslim mother to read a book about ramadan to see if it was culturally sensitive the parent approved the book and ms spivey added it to the library this was not , 'mother , may i use this book \? ' ms spivey said it was more like , 'what do you think \? ' ms spivey is certain that she would have been driven out of ps 75 in bushwick right alongside the teacher , ruth a sherman , over the use of nappy hair she has been recommending it to white colleagues since it was published last year it gets on my nerves that this is something that people still have to figure out , ms spivey said i 've spent a lifetime being a voracious reader and none of the books were about me when 'nappy hair' came out , i was ecstatic ms sherman transferred from ps 75 to ps 131 in jamaica , queens , about two weeks ago after some black parents threatened her at a public meeting they said the book , a critically acclaimed story by a black scholar , was racist they were angered by blackandwhite photocopied pages of an illustration from the book that were left in mailboxes around the community the fliers showed a darkskinned black child complaining about having kinky hair taken out of context , the illustrations can appear jarring and the text insensitive last week , dr crew lashed out at the disapproving parents , saying their actions could cause white teachers to shy away from a multicultural curriculum ms sherman , however , has said in interviews that she would not be deterred and planned to use the book at her new school with the approach of black history month in february , evelina barker , a hispanic parent who lives in bushwick , wondered aloud whether teachers were going to fear teaching children about historic black figures what s going to happen here \? ms barker asked recently on a windswept sidewalk outside ps 75 on grove street her 8yearold daughter , amani coleman , was a student in ms sherman s class if a teacher teaches something in spanish , are they going to be called racist \? isoke t nia , a black instructor at teacher s college at columbia university , said she had seen white teachers teach black history better than some black teachers i could n't let the words come out of my mouth that only black teachers can teach black kids , ms nia said we as a people , who have had a less than pleasant relationship with america , need to sit down together and shake out some of the stuff i do n't see anyone banning any asian books or stories about the holocaust , ms nia continued in books about the holocaust , jewish people are n't referred to kindly in every sentence it s the knowledge of the teacher the question is do they have the sensitivity to teach it in most cases , the answer is yes photo virginia l lockwood , a secondgrade teacher , with her students at public school 116 in murray hill \( ruby washington the new york times \)
john c malone , the toughtalking chairman of the cable television giant telecommunications inc , is back in the news again , and industry watchers who were around for the first interactive television debacle of the early 1990 s are having flashbacks back then , convinced that the convergence of computer technology with television and telephones was only a couple of years away , mr malone was making headlines with promises to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on beefy new cable wires and whizzy new digital settop boxes designed to deliver a stilluninvented generation of interactive entertainment today , convinced that the convergence of computer technology with television and telephones is only a couple of years away , mr malone is again making headlines with promises to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on beefy new cable wires and whizzy new digital settop boxes designed to deliver a stilluninvented generation of interactive deja vu ! who spiked the punch \? the answer , of course , is the same gang that always spikes the punch the people who run not only the cable business but also computers , software , telephones and media , all of which have converged on the creation and distribution of their products and services with digital technology mr malone called the infobahn warrior by wired magazine in 1994 once told an industry conference in the early 90 s that these socalled convergence companies were octupuses whose primary goal was to get their tentacles into one another s pockets those tentacles have only become more aggressive in the ensuing years recently announced partnerships between computer and cable companies including the microsoft corporation and the comcast corporation , and tci and sun microsystems inc trumpet bright and shiny interactive entertainment services that , we are told , await only the arrival of their new digital settop boxes but truth is that there are no new services in the offing each industry is simply trying to grab away another industry s customers adding cable modems and upgrading the capacity of cable wires to deliver digital video which mr malone has promised for tci customers , to the tune of 19 billion by 2000 are moves intended to steal internet customers from the telephone companies in the short term and eventually to steal the video rental business settop boxes are meant to steal people away from their pc s and get them to buy or rent a new box that lets them sit in front of the television to read their email and surf the world wide web this is a far cry from interactive television , although it does meet a growing need nick donatiello , the chief executive of odyssey lp , a research firm that studies consumers' adoption of new technologies , says that americans , at least , are demanding more choice and control over their information and entertainment and , he says , the internet and world wide web are riding that trend but at the same time , he says , consumers are desperate for new kinds of entertainment at home , and merely sticking a box on top of their tv sets and giving them highspeed access to the internet will not pacify them for long it s not about more bandwidth , he says it s about what you do with it more may be beside the point at least one early critic of interactive television agrees no one is breaking any new ground , or doing anything that says they will evolve the form and shape of tv in the future , said gene de rose , chief executive of jupiter communications llc in new york , a newmedia consulting company that was sharply critical of the interactive television hype in the early 1990 s settop boxes and highcapacity cable wires may be part of an interactive cable system , but none of the recent announcements discussed the less mediagenic , yet crucial component that an interactive cable network needs to function a reliable backoffice computer system , like the one being developed by the cable equipment provider scientific atlanta , to handle the billions of instructions that such a network would have to process every day naivete or arrogance about the difficulty and cost of building these sophisticated networks mortally wounded early projects by tci and by time warner cable , which invested millions of dollars in a highprofile trial of interactive television in orlando , fla but the deeper problem , say both mr donatiello and mr de rose , is that unless they want to see another generation of investment money circling the drain , convergence companies must stop themselves from jockeying for technological clout and start thinking about giving something new to their customers mr donatiello , whose company was scheduled to release a white paper today called 10 ways new media will change how things work , says that far more emphasis must be placed on creating unique interactive services not , he says , on 60 more start times for payperview movies think about how much the world has changed , mr donatiello said fifteen years ago , everyone had a dumb television set with no intelligence whatsoever , no processing capability now we 're talking about a world where not only will there be bandwidth , but the ability to do something interesting with what comes down the wire you can use the technology to make an experience , but ultimately it s the experience that matters drawing \( randy jones \)

the scoringchallenged rangers have been looking for that new face who can put the puck in the net , and they found him last night at madison square garden he was jose theodore , the masked montreal goalie , who accidentally put one over his own goal line when he tried to clear a loose puck that had trickled behind him into the crease unfortunately for the rangers , that was the only time the red light ignited behind the goalie in the red uniform at the other end of the ice , it flashed four times and the canadiens emerged with a 41 victory three of the goals beat rangers goalie mike richter , and the final goal was into an empty net with all those trade rumors circulating in the boofilled garden , can help be on the way \? can any of those lockedout basketball players skate \? we ca n't wait for somebody who is coming , said john maclean , who got credit for the ranger goal after his shot trickled through the pads of the goalie and came to rest in the crease before theodore mishit it we 've got to work doubly hard or harder just to keep it going also working hard last night , in his californiacasual way , was mike barnett , one of hockey s super agents , who stood outside the locker room to greet the rangers' wayne gretzky , his prize client barnett also represents petr nedved , a restricted free agent who missed last season with the pittsburgh penguins and is currently playing for a minor league team in las vegas , nev nedved , once a ranger , is a center who can create offense , one of the types of players the rangers need barnett said he has talked to the rangers about nedved and has assured them that nedved wants to be back in the national hockey league and will come to an agreement on a reasonable salary barnett said the rangers are one of a halfdozen teams who have contacted penguins general manager craig patrick about nedved but barnett said he did not know of any impending deal it was the second consecutive defeat for the rangers , who had three victories and three ties in their previous six games averaging 15 goals a game , lowest in the nhl , they are last in both the atlantic division and the eastern conference their record is 363 and they will spend most of november on the road , playing in florida , california and in the rust belt their next game is saturday night in toronto montreal s goal scorers were shayne corson , mark recchi , martin rucinsky and vincent damphousse recchi scored on the power play the rangers were 0 for 4 on their manpower advantages and managed only 20 shots on goal they hit two posts and fired several wide the line of maclean , kevin stevens and esa tikkanen was most effective hoping to encourage more offensive production , rangers coach john muckler shuffled his other forward lines he moved niklas sundstrom off gretzky s left wing and put him alongside center todd harvey , who had been gretzky s right wing gretzky was flanked by adam graves and mike knuble p j stock , usually a fourthline center , got more ice time than usual because harvey spent time in the penalty box after two fights the second , with craig rivet , left harvey with blood on his right hand manny malhotra , the rookie rangers center , who had not dressed for three of the previous four games , played a few shifts and was effective , finishing his checks at every opportunity and nearly scoring on a deflection muckler admitted he sounds like a broken record , but said the rangers need to get their shots through from the point men on the blue line and need to hit the net more instead of missing it or hitting the posts i do n't think the pressure mounts to add a proven goal scorer , muckler said i still do n't think our hockey team s that bad offensively brian leetch , the captain , said , we 're a betterscoring team than we are right now maclean warned , you ca n't get down on yourself because you start squeezing your stick and then you do n't shoot , you do n't do what you should be doing speaking of not shooting , gretzky and leetch each had one shot on goal , same as malhotra they played 23 minutes 51 seconds and 28 26 malhotra played 2 06 sundstrom had none in 16 10 the canadiens , without a victory in their previous four games , played without saku koivu , their best player , who is out with an abdominal injury that could be serious a similar injury has cost them scott thornton for the season defenseman vladimir malakhov blocked a puck in the final minute and crawled off the ice but he said he was all right photo mike richter making a save against canadiens' turner stevenson last night rangers lost their second straight after a sixgame unbeaten streak \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)

after six years , president clinton s foreign policy has brought dramatic results it has strengthened the world s three major dictatorships , won the contempt of america s friends and enemies for its word and determination , and helped spread missile weaponry that alone would be a historic record for a president to achieve with two years still to go but mr clinton has also labored to create attitudes in americans themselves that demean america s vision of itself and of duties that freedom imposes on it never before have the thoughts , statements and actions of an american president been so favorably influenced by any dictatorship as mr clinton s by china , and its business , intellectual and journalistic support groups in the us many of america s allies have also been doing their best to help china and the two other dictatorships iraq and iran like mr clinton in china , they chase trade profits over democratic principle but america s allies never claimed leadership of the free world or keen interest in democracy outside their borders for them it is business as usual like the buildup of saddam hussein before the gulf war but for an american president to walk away from those who believed in america to those who torture them is , of course , betrayal of us history and promises mr clinton s grand voyage to china is a symbol of his achievements already he has given beijing much of what it craves missile technology and huge commercial trade , all benefiting the chinese communist party and armed forces , a gentle eye toward chinese missile and nuclear sales , and a complete reversal of his preelection promises to link trade with human rights so , on to tiananmen we go could the killers in the politburo have dreamt that a us president would give them so much honor , respectability and absolution all for vast trade profits , which turned out to be vast trade deficits for america \? about iraq mr clinton , like george bush before him , let iraq get away with what saddam hussein then wanted most that was clear fields to slaughter the iraqi opposition then , when saddam smashed the un inspection system for as many months as he wished , mr clinton agreed with the un on the appropriate punishment none now , after seven years of iraqi refusal to reveal the truth about its preparations for making weapons of mass destruction , a plan was worked out at the un that could have lifted sanctions , possibly beginning in october let s not be dullwits everybody at the un knows saddam will again set to making forbidden weapons and already is revered by arabs as the victor over america , which he is but evidence of iraqi nerve gas production was discovered , so the sanctionslifting may be delayed washington has the veto power but no longer the political clout to prevent un members from selling saddam what he wants , veto or no the us also refuses to pay its un dues blame this on congress , not the administration or the un delegation led by the muchrespected bill richardson but nobody likes losers and deadbeats , particularly two in one now it is iran s turn for a clintonian helping hand he waived sanctions against russia and france for pouring billions into iranian gas fields then he offered to start making nice with iran itself , not just its suppliers iran is still run by the same folk who made it the world s center of terrorism and antiamerican hate propaganda but never mind mobil oil is ecstatic about the curtsey to teheran mr clinton will give the same rationalization for a deal with iran as for selling missile technology to china engagement with china is better than isolating it he knows the comparison is lividly false , of course americans who oppose his empowerment of china do not want to isolate it they want engagement not as appeasers but free people trying to use american political and economic pressure to ease political shackles in china and tibet , end forced abortions and religious persecution and release the five to seven million slavelabor prisoners usually without nuisance of trial , they work in factories built into the prisons , dual use with bars and prods , part of national budgeting mr clinton , the whole family , might have fun dropping in
chicago , june 4 motorola inc announced late today that it would eliminate 15 , 000 jobs , or 10 percent of its work force , and take a 195 billion charge against secondquarter earnings , the direst indicator yet of tough times in the semiconductor industry motorola also warned that it would report an operating loss for the second quarter , its first plunge into the red since the semiconductor industry slump of 1985 the forecast quickly took its toll on the shares of motorola , which is based in schaumburg , ill after rising 6875 cents during the day , to 5150 on the new york stock exchange , the share price fell as low as 49 in afterhours trading analysts had already slashed their consensus earnings projections to 20 cents a share from 43 cents after motorola announced in april that the quarter had begun poorly but motorola said then that it expected to finish close to the 23centsa share profit it earned in the first quarter , so today s projection of a loss was a shock some people have downplayed motorola s repeated earnings disappointments because of the problems in their communications businesses , but this clearly shows the semiconductor industry is suffering from overcapacity exacerbated by the economic crisis in asia , said charles hill , director of research at the first call corporation , a bostonbased firm that tracks corporate earnings estimates of wall street analysts indeed , motorola s bad news merely put an exclamation point on what others in its industry had been reporting national semiconductor warned investors early in the spring that wall street s projections for its recently completed second quarter were too high \( those figures have not yet been reported \) last month , analog devices , a chip maker applied materials , a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment , and amp inc , the world s leading supplier of connectors and other passive components used on chips , issued similar warnings robert l growney , motorola s president and chief operating officer , said today in a written statement it is clearly time to accelerate the implementation of our renewal plan we are determined to return our financial results to acceptable levels as soon as possible mr growney s statement meant things have gotten so bad that it was time for motorola s largest layoffs and writeoffs ever the company has suffered a double whammy demand in asia has slowed for many of its cellular phones , pagers and other products , most of which contain motorola semiconductors at the same time , there is heightened competition from asian manufacturers that are desperate for sales and can cut prices without sacrificing profits because their currencies have been devalued it has been difficult to offset those problems in the developed world , in part because motorola has fumbled the move from analog to digital wireless phone technology and the oncerapid growth of its domestic paging business has slowed once the overwhelming leader in cellular phones and systems to serve them , it has lost ground to companies like lucent technologies , nokia , l m ericsson , and qualcomm the positive side of this is that chris galvin has been given an opportunity to take drastic corrective steps and it looks like he s taking it , said mark mckechnie , an analyst at nationsbanc montgomery securities in san francisco , referring to christopher b galvin , the company s chief executive officer motorola said that the job reductions , associated plant closings in semiconductors and paging operations , and plans to sell poorly performing businesses should eventually save 750 million annually the job reductions will take place over the next 12 months motorola declined to comment on where the layoffs would be concentrated the domestic semiconductor operations are based primarily in arizona mr galvin was unavailable for interviews before the company s conference call with analysts , scheduled for friday morning in his written comments , he emphasized that the company would continue to invest in growth opportunities and singled out plans to introduce new digital phones in the third quarter he said that the communications sector of the company had begun to improve and that overall performance should be better given stabilized economic conditions in asia motorola earned 180 million on sales of 69 billion in the first quarter of this year earnings have been slumping since 1995 , when they topped 2 billion for the year semiconductor business cycles are nothing new for motorola it suffered deep earnings plunges in both the 1970 s and 1980 s motorola has already taken numerous steps in its attempts to cushion the impact of the current downturn and reinvigorate sectors like the cellular phone business , where its own errors have compounded its problems the company is in the process of closing a pager factory in puerto rico it also said recently that it was ending a 129 billion project to create a network of 66 loworbit satellites for carrying internet traffic in favor of investing 750 million for a 26 percent stake in teledesic , a consortium planning to launch 288 satellites aimed at the same market so far , none of those steps have done much to encourage investors who have suffered through the stock s long slide from a peak of 90 last summer some analysts predicted shares could fall to the mid40 s after today s news
to the editor re where all doors are open for disabled students \( front page , dec 28 \) as the parent of a specialeducation student , i believe that new york city and state should take a lesson from the vermont inclusion experience new york s specialeducation reform proposals assume that inclusion will produce a cost savings , or at least a capping of costs but this is a fallacy despite the virtual elimination of segregated specialeducation classes , vermont s specialeducation tab has continued to rise this is because children with significant disabilities require expensive supports regardless of whether they sit in a regular classroom or a specialeducation classroom in new york city , none of the inclusion proposals include adequate financing for student supports in the classroom , comprehensive teacher training or smaller class sizes it is absurd to plan inclusion of students with significant disabilities in overcrowded classrooms where the teacher has received no more than a crash course in special education margaret puddington new york , dec 28 , 1997
taipei , taiwan six hard ladderback chairs sat empty against the custard yellow wall , next to a curtain of red velveteen that hung more like a shroud than an invitation men , whispered a rouged kuan hsiuchin , pointing a crimson lacquered fingernail toward the doorsill , cannot cross there buds of grace tower is closed closed by mayoral fiat , closed by political expediency , closed in a frenzy of public moralizing buds of grace was one of taipei s 18 legal brothels , brothels that employed , along with ms kuan , 143 other licensed prostitutes until taipei s crusading mayor , chen shuibian , ordered them shut last year america does n't have licensed prostitutes , japan does n't have licensed prostitutes , observed mayor chen , who swept the longruling nationalist party from power in taipei in 1994 and who is now regarded as a potential contender for the country s presidency in 2000 taiwan is a member of international society and it must take the same steps as the majority , which do n't have licensed prostitution we must move forward with the current of the times but for ms kuan , and the other licensed prostitutes of taipei , the mayor s decision to close their brothels smacked of little more than opportunism born of political imagemaking unsatisfied with the mayor s decision , she and her colleagues have rallied in defiance , besieging city hall and city councilors , demanding that they be allowed to return to work , the only work they say they know hugged on one side by a gold merchant and the other by a redcolumned buddhist temple , ms kuan s brothel was visited last september by the police , who removed the plastic sign over the door etched with the ideographs wen ming lou buds of grace tower and symbolically smashed it from that moment , no customers were allowed to cross the portal and take one of the women who sat on the straightbacked chairs to one of four spartan cubicles past the red velveteen curtain chen shuibian wants to make this a city for rich people , said ms kuan he wants to chase people at the bottom like me out ms kuan , 48 , said she had worked at buds of grace for eight years although she hesitated to talk about the circumstances that led her to prostitution , she said that she had three children to support and this was the only work she could do for thousands of years this has existed , she said , as she sat on one of the frontroom chairs , carefully made up and dressed in a modestly splashy black blouse studded with sequins wherever there are men there are women everyone should understand this there is no country in the world that does n't have this the only question is , is it legal or illegal \? most annoying to ms kuan , beyond losing her job , is the fact that tens of thousands of unlicensed , illegal prostitutes are still plying their trade in this city of six million that has long been known for its relaxed attitudes toward sexual entertainments indeed , at most fivestar hotels here , as well as at innumerable love hotels , prostitutes are available at prices from 100 to over 1 , 000 a night licensing of prostitutes in taiwan goes back a century , first under japanese rule , and then under the nationalist government administered by the local police , there were until last year 55 licensed brothels in taiwan employing 364 women from the 18 women at buds of grace tower here in taipei , to the 2 women who worked in a tiny brothel in nantou , all were required to undergo medical checks each week for sexually transmitted disease ms kuan thumbed the pages of her work permit , pages splashed with the blue stamps from her weekly clinic visits , and then unrolled buds of grace s license , taipei city brothel permit , it read , no 1009 we get 700 yuan for each customer , she explained , about 22 , and the madame gets 300 , or about 940 this is far more than you can make in a factory ours is a very egalitarian profession mayor chen will have none of it when he proposed abolishing legalized prostitution last year , the 48member city council applauded his efforts and approved his legislation but when the prostitutes and their supporters marched to city hall with banners and petitions , the city council quickly backpedaled and voted to nullify the law the mayor did not care he ordered the brothels kept closed if there are not licensed prostitutes , there will still be prostitution underground , said wang fangping , a social activist who has been working with the licensed prostitutes to try and get the brothels reopened this is not the way to reduce vice or reduce the number of prostitutes those men with money will still find a way to find a prostitute it s only these women who are licensed who are affected ting yuanchin , the director general of the national police administration , shrugged when asked about enforcing the mayor s edict this vice is a fact , he said but we do n't want to let it get out of hand licensed prostitution has been going down anyway many of the women who worked in the brothels said they have no other way of earning a living , and certainly no way to earn as much as they had as prostitutes already , three prostitutes have reportedly attempted suicide , apparently in despair over finding a way to support their families on average , said ms kuan , i earn about 100 , 000 yuan a month , about 3 , 125 this is very safe work if the guest is n't polite or drinks , you can throw him out we 're not the same as private prostitutes of course there are private prostitutes in hotels , she said but they do n't have health checks ms kuan , who does not read very well , said that she could not find any other job at her age and so for the moment is relying on 470 a month in unemployment benefits from the city and like many of the other women , she continues to live at the shutdown brothel they say we have no dignity , ms kuan said quietly , sitting beside a pair of red scrolls daubed with a classical chinese couplet protect a flower and sympathize with the fragrant guest love uncut jade and it becomes a cherished gem we do n't steal , she said , removing a tea kettle from a small burner in the brothel s front room we do n't cheat what is undignified about that \? if we take handouts from the government , that is undignified everyone does what they can photo kuan hsuichin , 48 , was proud of her career as one of taipei s licensed prostitutes but the mayor ordered the brothels shut , and she is bitter \( edward a gargan the new york times \)
yet another upscale restaurant is scheduled to open in tribeca soon , this one called city hall owned by henry meer , proprietor of the cub room in soho , the new place was billed in promotional literature as a town square for the entire downtown neighborhood , with several rooms and a sidewalk cafe which is just the problem , according to some residents of duane street , where the restaurant is supposed to open next month they are worried that noise from sidewalk diners would disrupt a street they call quiet and residential mr meer said his original plan called for 16 small outdoor tables on a loading dock outside the restaurant , at 131 duane street , near church street but after consulting with the tribeca committee of community board 1 , he scaled down the plan to 10 tables and agreed to limit the cafe s hours to 10 pm on weekdays and 11 pm on weekends the committee then backed a oneyear trial period for the cafe but members of the duane thomas neighborhood committee protested , pointing out that none of the restaurants on the street had outdoor tables after dark still smarting from the loud latenight goingson of an indian restaurant and party hall that had previously occupied the space , they said mr meer should not get a sidewalk cafe permit until he had proved himself to be responsible in the past , they 'd wait for a restaurant to be open for a year and then talk about sidewalk tables , said jean grillo , the group s acting chairwoman a sidewalk cafe is a privilege , not a right sidewalk cafe permits are awarded by the city s department of consumer affairs , with community board opinion only one factor in the ultimate decision in april , the community board voted against mr meer s 10table plan he asked for a chance to make another presentation , which he did at board meeting on may 19 ms grillo and other members of the duane thomas neighborhood committee also spoke the resolution calling for 10 tables was then defeated , again so was another resolution opposing the tables entirely in effect , the board took no position on the issue , the district manager , paul goldstein , said mr meer is rethinking his plan neighborhood support is vital to me , he said i think the cafe would be a great addition to the area , but i'm thinking about not doing it , at least at first the city has n't yet scheduled a hearing on his cafe permit application when it does , mr meer said , i 'll make up my mind what to do bernard stamler photo a plan for outside tables at a restaurant opening soon on duane street is n't sitting well with some who live nearby \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
to the editor the sequencing of the tuberculosis bacterium s genome sets the stage for significant progress in tb research \( week in review , june 14 \) yet the national institutes of health spends only 65 million a year on the study of tuberculosis , a pittance compared with its financing of research on equally important diseases like hiv \( 15 billion a year \) and cancer \( 27 billion a year \) knowing the sequence of the tb genome could allow scientists to study how the bacterium escapes the body s immune system and what makes some strains of tb more deadly than others it could also accelerate the development of new drugs and an effective vaccine but none of these advances will take place unless we invest the necessary resources now celine gounder washington , june 15 , 1998 the writer is project manager of the princeton project 55 tuberculosis initiative

john regan , a retired bell atlantic employee , wanted to join a health maintenance organization near his home in centerville , mass , on cape cod but the hmo said no he lived in the wrong zip code the health care field today is a very confusing one , mr regan said for people in medicare , that is an understatement congress decided last year to make over the program , the government insurance plan for 38 million elderly and disabled americans as part of the balanced budget act of 1997 , private insurance companies , hospitals and groups of doctors were invited to offer an array of new types of taxpayerfinanced health coverage the revised program , called medicare plus choice , was to take shape this fall but with only a handful of exceptions , medicare options have not changed and by thursday , a day before hmo s had to say whether they would participate in medicare , existing medicare hmo s had announced their exit from more than 300 counties around the country , forcing more than 200 , 000 elderly people to seek new arrangements scrambling to explain choices that barely exist , government officials will mail bulletins or handbooks early next month to millions of people who , not surprisingly , often have little understanding of the thicket of rules that already govern medicare the new law portends mass confusion , said geri dallek , a health care researcher at george washington university is this choice or is it chaos \? she asked nancyann min deparle , head of the health care financing administration , the agency that runs medicare , said she never expected that there would be a lot of new plans this year she added for the first time , we 're going to educate beneficiaries about what is out there we will make them aware of the choices they already have standing pat may be best , many health care experts say a government mailing advises , if you are happy with the way you receive your medicare benefits now , you do n't have to do anything but even consumers who stay on the sidelines are likely to be upset in many parts of the country , medicare hmo s are raising charges and paring benefits the entire medicare program is being squeezed between government budget balancers and rising medical costs many of our clients already have fewer choices and much higher outofpocket health care costs , said diane archer , executive director of the medicare rights center , a nonprofit consumer advocacy group based in new york city the cost pressures are pushing up premiums for 10 million people who supplement their traditional feeforservice medicare with private medigap policies insurance that fills some gaps in government payments for care and they are clouding the future of extra benefits offered by medicare hmo s , which until recently were adding about a million members a year the legislated changes were an attempt by congress and the clinton administration to give medicare consumers a variety of health care options like those available to the under65 population policy makers were also hoping to help restore medicare s fiscal health in its latest warning , the administration estimated in april that the program could run out of money by 2008 a fivepoint plan but the new options will actually add 25 billion over five years to medicare costs , the congressional budget office said , because younger , healthier people are likely to congregate in the new medicarefinanced options , leaving traditional feeforservice medicare to bear the burden of sicker , older people who tend to dislike taking chances on losing access to familiar doctors most of the savings in the period will come from provisions in the 1997 law holding down annual increases in some feeforservice medicare payments additionally , premiums paid by beneficiaries for nonhospital medicare coverage will rise , starting next year the net savings through 2002 should total 112 billion , the budget office said the law also imposed new requirements on the 347 existing medicare health maintenance organizations those not already doing so must start providing preventive services , like flu shots , and all will have to collect data to assess members' health eventually , medicare payments will be adjusted to reflect the balance of healthy and sickly members in each health plan but for now , hmo s must provide the added services at their own expense in the new law , congress established five new medicare options hmo s sponsored by medical groups or hospitals pointofservice hmo s , which typically let members visit doctors outside the hmo s network when preapproved and for an extra charge preferred provider organizations , which offer incentives to go to certain doctors and hospitals governmentfinanced medical savings accounts for people who feel healthy and prosperous enough to gamble on a highdeductible policy a private feeforservice arrangement insurers , not medicare , would set premiums and other charges to policyholders and fees to doctors , hospitals and laboratories these providers could charge an additional 15 percent
hartford yesterday , john rogers rooted from afar as his alma mater , princeton , extended michigan state before losing , 6356 last weekend , rogers played princetonstyle basketball for himself rogers , the 1980 princeton captain and the president of ariel mutual funds in chicago , and two other former tiger stars , craig robinson and kit mueller , won a threeonthree tournament in dallas , using the same quick cuts and unselfish passes that have emanated from central new jersey for decades sometimes they get so angry and so frustrated , they try to hammer you , rogers said with a chuckle from his car phone on friday retaliation was hardly michigan state s solution yesterday the big ten school was bigger and faster and quite disciplined enough to overcome the traditional princeton patience in these fractious , sprewellian iwas n'treallychokingmycoach times , it is a pleasure to see teams blend brains and poise with athleticism , the way both north carolina and its rival from charlotte did in the tar heels' 9383 overtime victory yesterday the contrast is the formless way that st john s went out against detroit on friday night , with the hapless seniors still in major need of a transfusion of princeton purposefulness however , there are gyms and playgrounds where the former princeton players' use of tactics are so uncommon , they seem almost illegal , like using a marked deck in poker , or nudging the ball out of the rough in golf this effete and suspicious brand of ball goes back to butch van breda kolff and pete carril and gary walters , the athletic director , and bill carmody , the current coach , in a nearly biblical series of begats rogers and robinson , both africanamericans , played for carril at a school occasionally portrayed as america s darling because it is white and ivy league and , therefore , obviously snobbish , and plays a style of ball labeled only for white men , who , presumably , cannot jump i 've heard that stereotype , rogers said when i was there , i played in the gym against some africanamerican folks who would say that to me there was that occasional sniping , but i tried to persuade them it just is n't true the labels were around yesterday as princeton finished with 27 victories and only its second loss , using five white starters who play such a controlled game rogers , who is on the board of the chicago parks system , said you hear the scuttlebutt from rival schools when he tries to recruit more africanamericans to his alma mater walters , who is white , said aptitude and achievement examinations keep many prospects of all colors from princeton \( the gloomy carril used to employ flavorful houseofhorrors nicknames for the admissions building \) and in the era of sixdigit tuition bills , it is difficult to get any potential basketball star to pay his way in a league that does not offer athletic scholarships given the realities of skewed income in america , a black athlete might not want to burden his family to take out a loan , walters said , so he 'll take an athletic scholarship to another good school i can understand , he added yes , we 're aware of it , but we think we have two black players for next year princeton has had its share of africanamerican athletes , including armond hill , a former national basketball association point guard and now the coach at columbia , and brian taylor , who played later for the nets , plus twothirds of rogers s hotshot touring team and sydney johnson , the only threeyear captain in princeton history , who was graduated last year the current starters grit their teeth when they have to discuss athleticism , which implies race , but none more than brian earl , the intense junior from medford lakes , nj , who has long gravitated to the prestigious sonny hill tournament in philadelphia i still like street ball , earl said friday i'm not going to bash our offense , because it works here , but i 've always loved the ball in my hands i 've got a lot of friends in philadelphia , and they know how i play there earl bristles at the earthbound label for his teammates , particularly mitch henderson , the competitive senior from indiana he s one of the best athletes i 've ever seen nobody knows how quick that kid is if i had that body , i think i 'd drive more even at the hallowed home of the 30second weave earl hates the thought that people are looking at the color of the players still ruing a 5042 loss to north carolina this season , earl said there s no doubt in my mind that vince carter and antawn jamison could play our system no doubt the only difference is that you 'd see the backdoor play end with a reverse dunk earl and henderson may well find that their princeton experience will brand them in early adulthood walters , for example , hung it up when he was 28 , after a fullcourt game with some famous college players , including one chucker from new york three straight times walters ducked into the corner , where the backdoor play begins , and three straight times the chucker let the ball go from the top of the key the fourth time , he let loose , and i just kept running right through the door , right into the pool , walters said of course , it took them five minutes to discover i was n't playing anymore by the way , the chucker from new york was white that s the point princeton basketball is for the chosen few like john rogers and craig robinson and kit mueller and this glorious team , now history yesterday , princeton forced michigan state to work hard one day , these five princeton starters may employ their maddening style on playgrounds and in gyms all over the land , to the consternation of strangers photo princeton s mitch henderson colliding with michigan state s mateen cleaves during yesterday

with each astonishing signing by a highrevenue club this off season , the lament has grown louder the day the 1999 season begins , half the teams , if not more than half , will not have a chance to win a spot in next october s playoffs gene orza wonders when that fact of major league life has not existed when was it not true \? asked orza , the players association s no 2 official even a cursory check supports his point baseball history has been filled with teams that did n't have a chance from the opening pitch in a 35year period from 1934 through 1968 , the franchise now known as the oakland athletics finished in the second division , the lower half of the league standing , 33 times the washington senators \( later the minnesota twins \) finished in the second division 24 times in a 28year period from 1934 through 1961 in the first 59 years of the franchise now known as the baltimore orioles , the team finished in the second division 47 times it finished first once , as the st louis browns in 1944 the chicago cubs played for 20 successive seasons , 1947 through 1966 , without emerging from the second division the philadelphia phillies wound up in the lower half of the standings 45 times in the 56 seasons from 1918 through 1973 at the other end of the spectrum , the yankees won 22 pennants in 29 years , from 1936 through 1964 , and 29 pennants in 44 seasons , from 1921 through 1964 in a shorter period , a 10year stretch from 1947 through 1956 , the brooklyn dodgers finished first six times the st louis cardinals won nine pennants and finished in the first division nine other times in the 21season stretch from 1926 through 1946 in each of the next three years they finished second the yankees' dominance prompted their opponents to vote for the implementation of the draft of amateur players , beginning in 1966 , but these days nonplaying baseball people view the predraft times as the good old days salaries in those times were not an issue the players association , not unexpectedly , views recent developments differently from major league baseball officials , owners and general managers as long ago as 1976 , bowie kuhn , then the commissioner , decried the advent of free agency , warning that it would wreck competitive balance the fact that no team repeated as world series champion from 1978 until 1993 presumably did not alter kuhn s thinking four commissioners later , the people on the management side of the competitive fence say growing payroll disparity is wrecking competitive balance bud selig , the current commissioner , has made the issue his no 1 priority but the players' representatives become uncomfortable when owners start mentioning competitive balance competitive balance does not deserve to be uttered with a view toward what it really means , orza said competitive balance is a code for restraining payroll levels that s what it means historically they 've been using that term for the last 20 years they do n't mean competitive balance officials and owners point to the 1998 experience to support what they say they mean none of the 17 teams with payrolls under 48 million reached the playoffs only two of those teams , st louis and toronto , had winning records of the 13 teams above that payroll plateau , only baltimore had a losing record and they see the trend becoming more severe not only are payrolls going up , but they 're also going down , sandy alderson , major league baseball s vice president for baseball operations , warned last month we lose sight of the fact that there are some clubs that are giving up the minnesota twins last week became a case for alderson s point proclaiming they could not compete in the current economy , the twins said they would slash their payroll from a seasonending 245 million to a figure between 10 million and 15 million the montreal expos had last season s lowest payroll , 8 , 317 , 500 orza said no one should be surprised that payroll disparity exists who bought into a system that says new york and los angeles should n't spend more than montreal \? he asked this notion that the goal of baseball should be to create a balance by which all the teams , no matter what their population base , what fan support they have , however well marketed and run they are , should have an equal chance to win the world series is n't realistic it s just the way it is there always will be disparities when owners buy teams , he added , they understand the rules they do n't say at owners meetings , 'because i have only 400 , 000 people available for local tv and you have seven million , i'm going to want your money , ' orza said they say , 'let me in and i 'll compete with you and beat your brains out' then when they do n't win , they say 'it s not because i run a bad franchise or made mistakes it s the other guy has an unfair edge over me because i'm in montreal and they 're in new york' the owners will continue to lament payroll disparity , but they obviously should not expect a sympathetic ear from the players association a pox on several houses the toughness that players show in games and that agents display in contract negotiations evidently does not carry over to verbal assaults
auction houses have been trampling on the turf of dealers for some time now , what with sotheby s and christie s buying up art galleries and increasing their private treaty sales \( selling art , that is , without putting it on the block \) at the same time , the houses have been tiptoeing on museum and publishing territory , mounting museumstyle exhibitions and producing lavish books , besides the standard catalogues here s the latest from feb 17 through march 1 , christie s will put on view an exhibition of cuttingedge art from the late 1960 s and early 1970 s at both its park avenue showrooms and its annex at 308 east 59th street in manhattan but the auction house says none of the art is for sale yet indeed , interested buyers may be somewhat perplexed there will be no price list , which galleries always offer clients , nor will there be the estimates traditionally provided but there will be a fancy color catalogue , painting object film concept works from the herbig collection , designed by takaaki matsumoto , a manhattanbased designer , and for sale for 45 a scholarly catalogue , it is meant to look more like a museum publication than an auction house production , with essays by experts and art historians neither prices nor a possible sale are mentioned anywhere neal meltzer , the head of christie s contemporary art department , said , things will be sold from this collection in june to kick off the new contemporary art department but exactly which works or how much of the collection will see its way to auction has yet to be determined , mr meltzer added the designer of the park avenue portion of the exhibition is annabel selldorf , the soho architect who has designed several art galleries , including the barbara gladstone gallery in chelsea and jeffrey deitch in soho richard francis , who joined christie s last year after having been the chief curator at the museum of contemporary art in chicago , said , this is intended to be a museumstyle show and a museumstyle catalogue he added , it s what the client wanted the client , barbara herbig , a jewelry designer , is the wife of dr jost herbig , a scientist from cologne who died in 1995 the couple put their collection together over eight years , buying works by artists including georg baselitz , joseph beuys , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard tuttle and bruce nauman while the collection has been on view since the mid1970 s at the museum of contemporary art in kassel , germany , this is the first time it will be out of that country experts believe it is worth around 10 million a christie s official said the company had a financial interest in the property , though no one would discuss the details of christie s arrangement with mrs herbig contemporary art experts say mrs herbig wanted to sell the collection as a whole , offering it to the san francisco museum of modern art a museum spokeswoman said the trustees had explored the possibility of buying the collection but had never made a bid still , experts say the museum did make an offer , but not for as much money as mrs herbig wanted with this exhibition , mr meltzer is out to get attention for his new department , which was created in september and concentrates on works made after 1970 we 're hoping to attract the kind of people who spend their time going to galleries in soho and chelsea , mr meltzer said mr meltzer is also hoping to follow the formula christie s used when it sold the modern and contemporary art put together by the new york collectors victor and sally ganz in november that was a recordbreaking sale , totaling 2065 million for months before the ganz sale , christie s pumped up its marketing efforts it also mounted a museumlike exhibition , though with estimates on the labels , and published a 100 book in addition to an 80 , 210page hardbound catalogue the herbig collection , besides representing a larger group of artists than the ganz collection did , is far more european in taste it includes several paintings by mr baselitz and mr richter there is also a strong showing of early works by mr polke , a r penck and blinky palermo , as well as examples of pieces by mr tuttle , dan flavin , mr nauman and jorg immmendorff it s about a moment in time , mr meltzer said a change at sotheby s kevin bousquette , sotheby s executive vice president and its chief financial officer worldwide , is leaving the company after five years mr bousquette came to sotheby s from wall street , where he had been a limited partner at kohlberg kravis roberts i have invested myself totally in sotheby s , but it s time to go on , he said i want to spend my time pursuing my personal interests mr bousquette follows several other highlevel sotheby s officials who have left the company recently , most notably simon de pury , sotheby s chairman in europe and its star auctioneer mr de pury left in november along with daniella luxembourg , sotheby s chairwoman in switzerland , to form an art investment and advisory company sotheby s sales rise sotheby s also reported its yearend figures this week its worldwide auction sales increased by 15 percent from 16 billion to 184 billion , a figure that excludes its private treaty sales mr bousquette said we had the highest total for impressionist and modern art since 1990 389 million in auction sales we also set an alltime record for old master paintings , a total of 157 million meanwhile , the company posted aftertax profits of 48 million , a 17 percent increase from 1996 , when its profits were 409 million christie s is to release its yearend figures next month photo richard tuttle s 1966 letters \( the twentysix series \) is part of a collection to go on view at christie s \( christie s \)
riverhead the nearly empty room at riverhead town hall was silent as the officers of the court entered on a recent wednesday to decide the fate of a 15yearold boy charged with possession of marijuana leading the procession was the judge , sabina sapienza , in her black robe all of the other court officers wore blue golf shirts with gold letters and an emblem of the scales of justice the judge is 18 and a recent shorehamwading river high school graduate none of the others is old enough to take a legal drink but it was not a mock trial this was real justice being dispensed it was the third case ever tried by the new riverhead youth court , a judicial innovation in which minors who choose to plead guilty to misdemeanors are given the option of being sentenced by their peers the defendant decided to go before the youth court when given the option upon his arrest by the riverhead police i figured this was better than a real court , the defendant said while waiting outside the courtroom during deliberations by the jury , which on this night included three officers of the newly formed town of brookhaven youth court , who who had come to get a taste of participation in a real trial three youth courts have been established on long island with funding through federal grant money administered by the new york state division of criminal justice services youth court defendants are juveniles who agree along with their parents to have their cases heard using the unconventional method they must be firsttime nonviolent offenders who plead guilty to nothing more than a misdemeanor cases can be referred through the probation department and other sources such as a local school district the feedback that we 've gotten on the youth courts has been overwhelmingly positive , said scott sandman , a spokesman for the state division of criminal justice it s a movement that s going around the country , said vincent iaria , the suffolk county director of probation if you have peer involvement not only will people learn about the system and take it seriously , they 'll also have to do meaningful punishment decided by their peers it helps the delinquent to see it s a crime against the community it s a crime against all of us , including their fellow peers besides the defendant in the riverhead marijuana case and his mother , who sat next to him throughout the session , the case involved two prosecuting attorneys , two defense attorneys , the five jurors , a clerk and the judge the only adults with any significant role in the proceedings were dan rodgers and john shields , volunteer attorneys who coached the young prosecution and defense teams and answered questions asked by the jurors during deliberations the two adults have the right to intervene in case of some miscarriage of justice the toughest critics on kids are the kids , said mr rodgers , a criminal attorney in riverhead who volunteered to be a mentor to youth court members and said he found the process rewarding and worthwhile the message gets across loud and clear i think it s fantastic , said mr shields , another volunteer mentor and also a southampton town deputy town attorney i 've seen some performances here that are equal if not better than law competitions i 've seen the defendant s two young attorneys argued for leniency after presenting three witnesses , including the defendant , to testify that the 15yearold was cooperative , helpful at home , active in sports and not planning to break the law again he has admitted that he made a stupid mistake , said lauren paladino , a recent riverhead high school graduate , issuing her closing statement for the defense i'm sure most of you have been in the same spot from the stand , the defendant told the jury that his desire for a career in law enforcement was strengthened by the experience i want to stop kids from messing up like me , he said when asked if he would be a repeat offender , he said i was arrested and handcuffed that scared me a lot officer scott wicklund of the riverhead town police also took the witness stand to testify about the arrest and the defendant s cooperation i really firmly believe in this , officer wicklund said of the court , adding that he felt more nervous testifying in youth court than he did in the conventional court system during deliberations , where mr rodgers and judy doll , who supervises the youth court program for riverhead town , dispensed advice and answers , the jury talked about how they wanted to be sure the defendant learned from the experience and did not get in trouble again they did not buy the defense s requested sentence 10 hours of community service working with the defendant s choice group , the elderly instead they went with the suggestion of the prosecuting attorney ed libassi , a recent shorehamwading river high school graduate who will attend john jay college in new york in september to pursue a police science degree he recommended 25 hours of community service the defendant was given 10 hours of cleaning and washing riverhead town police vehicles , 8 hours working inside the police department and 7 hours at the town s animal control center the defendant was also ordered to take a tour of the local jail and serve as a juror on a later case outside in the hallway throughout the trial was a woman whose daughter was serving as a juror as part of a shoplifting sentence handed down in an earlier youth court session the daughter had also been sentenced to four hours of community service and was sent to a recovery program on shoplifting i think it means more to them when they 're told through their peers , the mother said the mother of a another youth court defendant whose case was being heard that night said she noticed a positive change in her son even before the trial i think that he got a lot out of it because he met with an attorney who was in his peer group , the mother said i do n't think he would have responded if he had gone before a judge i 've been living with the kid for the past 10 days , and it s been a pleasure thirtyone youth court grants were awarded throughout the state , with the riverhead program getting 26 , 500 , brookhaven 24 , 000 and southampton 26 , 500 but for now , the riverhead program is the only one on long island to have tried a case state assemblywoman patricia acampora , a republican from mattituck , helped procure funding for the riverhead youth court and said she would like to see the teenagers get more cases according to her , there has been some resistance from the family court system because of a lack of state legislation that would establish clearer lines of accountability in case something went wrong with a youth court case the supervising judge of the suffolk county family court , david freundlich , declined to comment although she can understand the concern and is in the process of researching the possibility of a future bill , ms

the number of reported accidents involving taxicabs in new york city rose more than 40 percent from 1990 to 1996 , even as the total number of motor vehicle accidents in the city was falling , according to police figures injuries in taxi crashes , including those involving yellow cabs , legal livery cars and illegal gypsy cabs , increased by 59 percent during the same period , an analysis of the figures by the new york times shows , while injuries in crashes that did not involve taxis decreased by 4 percent there is no consensus on what caused the increase in accidents , which seems likely to reinforce the popular notion of cab driving in new york as a sort of demolition derby with meters some people in the taxi business contended that the rise resulted primarily from more diligent reporting by drivers , not from a huge jump in accidents but a wide cross section of veteran drivers , fleet owners and transportation experts said that , especially during the 1990 s , new york city s driver corps had become increasingly inexperienced and incompetent , and some said the sharp rise in accidents and injuries was a predictable result of that shift in 1990 , police reports show , there were 8 , 886 accidents involving taxis and 80 , 766 that did not involve taxis the number of taxi accidents increased in four of the next five years \( it fell slightly in 1996 \) , so that by 1996 , there were 12 , 557 taxi accidents during the same period , accidents that did not involve taxis fell 14 percent , to 69 , 678 critics of the city s taxi and limousine commission said the agency bore some of the blame for the increase in accidents , noting that it does not require a road test for cab drivers and does not even routinely keep track of accidents involving cabs when you do n't have a system in place that tracks dangerous drivers and you do n't rein them in and educate them , give them the necessary driver s ed if they 're being reckless , what you get over a period of years is a buildup of more accidents , said assemblyman scott m stringer , a democrat from the upper west side , who plans to propose a series of taxi industry reforms today the taxi and limousine commissioner , diane mcgrathmckechnie , declined to speculate on the reason for the increase in accidents she pointed out that the police statistics included accidents involving unlicensed taxis , outoftown liveries and vans for the disabled , none of which are regulated by her agency when asked if those vehicles outside the commission s control could account for the entire 40 percent increase , she said she did not know to me , these statistics are so fundamentally skewed they may or may not relate to what we do , she said edward rogoff , a baruch college professor of management who has studied the taxi industry for more than 20 years , said that if anything , the number of illegal taxis had declined since the start of the decade because of a crackdown by the commission the number of legal cabs increased by about 11 percent from 1992 to 1996 , according to state figures , significantly less than the increase in the number of taxi accidents \( comparable figures are not available for 1990 and 1991 \) because many cabs are on the road almost constantly , it is difficult to make direct comparisons between the risk of accidents for taxis and private cars assemblyman stringer has compiled a report estimating that taxis are eight times more likely than private vehicles to be involved in an accident during rush hours , based on the number of cabs and the estimated number of private cars on the city s streets each day there have been several recent highprofile taxi accidents , including one last month in which a cabby who the police said was cut off by another cab swerved onto the sidewalk on lexington avenue and pinned a pedestrian against a light pole , severing her leg some riders interviewed yesterday acknowledged feeling a certain trepidation each time they slid into the back seat they 're nuts , said fernando rivias , who runs a manhattan trucking business , as he tried to get a cab at rockefeller plaza i almost got killed today the cab driver got in a fight with a truck driver , over on 57th and madison the cabby cut a truck off , and the truck honked the cabby stepped on the brakes and they leaned out their windows screaming at each other but no one seemed prepared to give up cabs , and several riders suggested that navigating the city s streets was chancy no matter who was behind the wheel better them than me , said bobbi crownover , 24 , a student from philadelphia the police figures show that from 1990 to 1996 , the percentage of accidents in the city that involved taxis increased to 15 percent from 10 percent injuries in taxi accidents rose from 12 , 536 in 1990 to 19 , 958 in 1996 , an increase of 59 percent during the same period , injuries in accidents that did not involve taxis dropped 4 percent , from 102 , 182 to 97 , 893 injuries in taxi accidents classified as serious including broken bones , severe cuts and internal injuries increased by 4 percent from 1990 to 1996 that is far less than the increase in accidents , and defenders of cabbies said that since serious injuries are less likely to go unreported , the relatively small increase suggested that better reporting might account for much of the rise in accidents even so , as serious injuries in taxi accidents were increasing 4 percent , serious injuries in accidents that did not involve taxis fell by 33 percent the number of people killed in taxi accidents has fluctuated during the decade , from a high of 46 in 1990 to a low of 27 in 1992 twentynine people were killed in taxi accidents in 1996 injuries to passengers in taxi accidents the statistics do not specify whether the injured are taxi passengers or passengers in other cars increased by 70 percent from 1990 to 1996
when new york city promised in federal court last week to build a huge filtration plant for the most troubled portion of its water supply , the pledge did not end the long struggle over the plan it simply opened a new chapter in the story for one thing , despite the promise , which settled a lawsuit by federal environmental officials , the city still says it hopes to avoid filtration , which it says could cost up to 1 billion perhaps more daunting , if it does move to construct the plant , there is likely to be a bitter battle over where to put it four of the seven sites being studied for the plant are in westchester county , but the county executive there has flatly declared that none of them are even remotely acceptable and new york city s big unions and construction interests are appalled at the notion of such a big project being built outside the city on the other hand , bronx residents and their politicians vow to oppose the other three sites , all in that borough and they continue to maintain that filtration is unnecessary people are viewing a filtration plant as if it were an incinerator , said eric goldstein , senior staff attorney for the natural resources defense council nearly forgotten in the battle is the fact that the federal environmental protection agency sued to force filtration for health reasons , particularly the risk that microorganisms including cryptosporidium , for which a formal standard has never been set can be dangerous or even lethal for people with immune deficiencies only in eight instances , each involving an exceptionally pristine watershed , has the epa allowed a city to avoid filtration of surface water to hold back on the only thing that will make the croton water safer is ludicrous , said daniel a okun , an environmental engineering professor emeritus at the university of north carolina who in 1993 headed a blueribbon panel on the city s water the croton watershed usually supplies onetenth of the city s drinking water , but as much as 30 percent of it during droughts opponents of the filtration project have contended that the city can devise a plan for the croton watershed similar to the one agreed to last year for its two larger watersheds , the catskill and the delaware that plan involves protecting the water by buying and preserving adjacent lands and reducing pollution from septic tanks and other sources but westchester and putnam counties , home of the croton s 13 reservoirs , are considerably more developed and polluted than the catskill and delaware watersheds if filtration cannot be avoided , the issue of choosing a site will come to the fore as the city s department of environmental protection holds environmental impact statement hearings for each of the seven sites officially under consideration , the same concerns are raised repeatedly a project lasting more than five years , replete with dust , noise , ceaseless truck traffic and rats culminating in an intrusive industrial plant chlorine and other chemicals would be used in large quantities close your eyes and picture a ninestory building on 50 acres , said the westchester county executive , andrew j spano it s hard to hide the most vigorous , bestorganized opponents live around jerome park reservoir in the northwest bronx there are 50 , 000 neighbors living in highrise apartments and brick multifamily homes there are also 25 , 000 students in eight schools from elementary schools to the bronx high school of science it was the opposition of jerome park residents that prompted mayor rudolph w giuliani to delay the project in 1995 in order to review other sites at that point , the other proposed site in the city was croton woods in van cortlandt park but park supporters brought in researchers from yale university s forestry school to study the trees there , who judged the trees virtually irreplaceable a third possible bronx site grew out of the efforts of frank schonfeld , a resident of amalgamated houses near the jerome park reservoir a retired painter , he read in his union newspaper that labor was throwing its weight behind the jerome park site , which had been the prime candidate for a filtration plant since the idea was first broached in 1911 with the help of tom fox , an environmental consultant , he hit upon shandler recreation area at the northern end of van cortlandt park the area has two baseball fields , a picnic area and a large parking lot mr fox worked out a preliminary plan in which these features would all be replaced on the roof of the new plant after construction the major deegan expressway extends right to the site , meaning trucks would not rumble through neighborhoods woodlawn cemetery is on one side the only people you 'd be disturbing are dead , mr fox said in fact , the shandler site is heavily used for recreation by residents of nearby neighborhoods that s the only open space the kids have , said fay muir , a filtration plant opponent mr fox suggested that the schools around jerome park reservoir make their playing fields available on weekends to give shandler users a place to play he has also proposed that jerome park be made into the 150acre park it has never been in anything but name , as a tradeoff to the bronx community union leaders are desperate to keep one of the largest city building projects in years in the bronx they contend that is foolish to pay to acquire land outside the city and then pay taxes in westchester county not to mention sacrificing 2 , 500 construction jobs we cannot allow these jobs and the resulting taxes that they generate to be lost to the city , said thomas p maguire , president of the international union of operating engineers this could be the catalyst for reviving the bronx one advantage to the bronx sites is that they are directly along the aqueduct leading from the croton watershed proposed westchester sites in greenburgh and mount pleasant are a mile or more away from the aqueduct , and it could cost as much as 250 million to connect them , according to some estimates yonkers officials have objected to building the plant at the defunct yonkers raceway , preferring housing and other development people in and around yorktown vigorously oppose building the plant in a cove in new croton reservoir all of westchester county has significant undercurrents of environmentalism , said david gordon , a lawyer for the hudson riverkeeper , an environmental organization that stresses watershed protection but is not against filtration the city has the power to condemn land in the watershed , whether in westchester county or the bronx , and is committed to finding a site by the end of the year it is being held to a rigid timetable to begin operating the plant in 2007 or face fines of 25 , 000 a day and the public health arguments , if anything , are getting stronger opposition to siting the plant wo n't be reason for for not doing it , said jim tripp , a lawyer for the environmental defense fund who is convinced the croton watershed is deteriorating something will have to be done photo frank schonfeld and anne marie garti oppose building the city s water filtration plant near jerome park reservoir mr schonfeld suggested a site near van cortlandt park , one of the locations under consideration \( chris maynard for the new york times \) map of

tokyo , thursday , jan 29 the finance ministry s top bureaucrat said today that he was stepping down , creating a vacuum in the ministry as it tries to cope with a bribery scandal and steer the nation out of an economic quagmire takeshi komura , the vice finance minister , submitted his resignation after the departure of the finance minister , hiroshi mitsuzuka , who formally stepped down on wednesday toshiro muto , who is also one of the most powerful ministry bureaucrats , offered to resign , too , but prime minister ryutaro hashimoto asked mr muto to stay on for now , kyodo news service reported early this morning in the japanese system , where politicians play less of a role than the career bureaucrats , mr komura arguably influenced japan s economic life more than anyone else in the country , even the prime minister his departure is particularly notable because it is rare for the finance minister and the vice minister to step down at the same time though none of the officials are accused of wrongdoing , the finance ministry is in a fragile position , facing attack for its mismanagement of the nation s economy stepping down to accept responsibility is a traditional japanese way of defusing a crisis but it is not clear that the bribery scandal will end here once of the most striking signs of the finance ministry s diminished influence came on wednesday , when masayuki matsushima , a senior official at the central bank , the bank of japan , was quoted by kyodo as saying in a speech that the government s economic policy was on the wrong track though the bank of japan helps oversee the banking system , it is virtually beholden to the finance ministry in an unusual expression of disagreement , mr matsushima suggested that japan should abandon the fiscal austerity that the finance ministry and mr hashimoto have both championed president clinton has also urged japan to take further steps to pump up its economy , and the upheaval in the finance ministry is widely expected to make such a policy change more likely fiscal reconstruction should not be treated as the only priority area , mr matsushima , director of the central bank s research and statistics department , said on wednesday fiscal policy cannot be formulated without a sound economy in a further shock , the finance ministry discovered wednesday night that one of its banking inspectors had committed suicide , just as he faced interrogation by prosecutors in the widening scandal yoichi otsuki , 54 , an inspector in its banking bureau , was found dead by his wife earlier in the day japanese news reports said he had hanged himself with a necktie attached to a curtain rail near the entrance to his apartment in central tokyo prosecutors had summoned mr otsuki for questioning , but he had failed to appear on wednesday earlier this week , prosecutors arrested two banking inspectors for accepting bribes in the form of entertainment from the banks they supervised , and as many as 10 more finance ministry officials are being questioned as the prosecutors deepen their investigation mr komura s resignation underscored the pressure the finance ministry is facing the resignation of mr mitsuzuka may have been a result of a political bargain between opposition parties and the ruling liberal democratic party , but mr komura seems to have been pushed out because of a broad desire for major change in the finance ministry takashi kiuchi , an economist at ltcb research institute , said pressures within the ministry probably helped bring about mr komura s being sacrificed the ruling liberal democrats are concerned about public anger against the finance ministry , particularly since the scandal erupted earlier this week koichi kato , a top party official , said on wednesday that senior administrative officials in the finance ministry should also accept the blame , partly to assuage public ire over the scandal and , more generally , over the troubled economy his comments apparently led to mr komura s resignation mr hashimoto , a former finance minister , is concurrently taking on the post again but is expected to name a successor by the end of this week the two banking inspectors arrested in the bribery scandal had been wined and dined by banks and in return had disclosed information on the timing and place of the ministry s inspections of the banks some analysts say that the bribery scandal may ultimately highlight a relationship between lax inspection and the hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debt that is prompting bailouts with the use of taxpayers' money the parliament is considering legislation to rescue the nation s banks with 30 trillion yen , or 240 billion the heart of the issue is closely related to a policy issue , said jeffrey d young , an economist with salomon brothers asia ltd , referring to mismanagement of the economy it s viewed at the very highest levels as something the public is not tolerating as it did in the past the liberal democratic party suggested earlier this week that it would announce another economic stimulus package on feb 20 , raising hopes that the government would shift its policy and take more aggressive steps to boost the economy other legislation under consideration in the parliament to bolster the economy includes an income tax cut of more than 15 billion the government

hempstead , ny , april 3 harlem , newark and bedstuy none of those place names suggest big white houses with wide green lawns and azure backyard pools they are not places where children routinely learn to swim about the time they learn to walk and that s just fine with robert trotman he gets his greatest pleasure from helping children who could never expect success as a birthright in his nearly 40 years as a swimming coach in gritty urban areas like harlem and bedfordstuyvesant , and in new york suburbs like hempstead , he has helped more than 1 , 500 poor , troubled or unmotivated children move on up to the next level , as he puts it for the last 18 years , he has had no trouble getting 30 boys and girls ages 4 to 18 on his village of hempstead team every year who are willing to endure practices at 5 am , after school and sometimes on weekends , not to mention the coach s no slouching , no street language , no horseplay , no attitude approach to those who know him , the youngsters he inspires and the parents he impresses , he is simply coach , and his bearing is so commanding that acquaintances feel comfortable addressing him as coach after just a few minutes of conversation under his driven approach , mr trotman s swimmers , most of whom had not been in a pool before he took them under his wing , routinely outpace their more affluent competitors in town , county and state meets among their most recent successes was winning the 1998 nassau county swim conference championship , against seven other teams mr trotman is far from humorless , but he does n't tolerate silliness and horseplay when there are meets to be won he made that clear during the county championships , held in late march at the north hempstead recreation center in new hyde park hey ! he yelled at one young man dancing around on the sidelines if you lose , i'm going to beat you in the head ! you need to conserve your energy for the race ! come on , mark , he yelled at another swimmer just before his event i want you to swim into the wall ! swim into the wall ! still , watching him work , it s also clear that he has a soft spot for his young charges he listens carefully and is generous with his praise sometimes you have to put your arm around these kids , he says later , meaning it as much metaphorically as literally andre chesimard , who attended the meet , remembers taking his son karim , then 3 , to mr trotman four years ago , in hopes that he could help the boy overcome his fear of the water karim had fallen into a pool and was terrified of them coach took him screaming and trying to hold on to me for dear life , just dragged him away , mr chesimard said within an hour , karim was in the water like nothing had happened , and two days later he was swimming laps across the pool using a float board i 've seen coach take kids who were overweight , who had had major operations , who lacked selfconfidence , mr chesimard continued he s turned them into new kids before coming to hempstead , he coached in his native harlem , then in bedfordstuyvesant when i first came to hempstead , a good friend of mine who was already coaching in suffolk county said 'do n't worry about the kids it s their parents you 'll have to educate , ' mr trotman said he said he appreciates the support from many parents and local officials , but often has to persuade adults to do their share by making sure their children get to practices on time and pushing them academically after they show their report cards to their mom or dad , he says , they have to show coach swimming is a very disciplined and structured sport , and that carries over to education mark nosworth of hempstead , a 16yearold who has been swimming with mr trotman for six years , calls him the bobby knight of swimming he s no nonsense , but he s really interested in helping us , he said lots of kids drop out of his classes , but if you look at them now , they are doing nothing and going nowhere we keep getting better and better mr nosworth , a sophomore at hempstead high school , also swims for his school team that team is coached by mr trotman s wife , patricia , and won the nassau county high school championship in 1991 many of the school s swimmers are on mr trotman s village team as well with his closely cropped black hair , pencil mustache and powerful , compact build , mr trotman , a retired new york city transit worker with a black belt in karate , appears far younger than his 50plus years \( he refuses to say how old he is \) he did a twoyear hitch in the army s 82d airborne division in the early 1960 s stationed at fort bragg , nc , he wound up teaching officers' wives and children how to swim in addition to his paratrooper training his father abandoned the family when mr trotman was young , leaving his mother to rear him and his siblings he said that when he was a child , a major influence in his life was the head lifeguard at the 134th street bathhouse in harlem his name is charles smith , mr trotman said he s puerto rican and cuban , and was a competitive swimmer in the amateur athletic union at a time when there were very few minorities in the aau in high school , and later at queens college , mr trotman s classmates pursued basketball , football and track , the neon sports , he calls them but swimming always held the most appeal for him in basketball , only five guys get to play most of the time , he said no one sits on the bench in swimming fat , tall , skinny , everyone gets a chance to participate he also said swimming provides a steady supply of jobs for youngsters lifeguards are always in demand , he said not only at the beaches , but fitness clubs , hotels , lots of places they can make a lot of money during the summers in addition to coaching the village of hempstead team , which charges nothing , he has his own swim club , the nufinmen , which charges membership fees he also holds clinics and teaches courses , including a lifeguardtraining class with all that to keep him busy , he took just three days off last year , between the spring and summer swimming seasons this year , he said with just a hint of a smile , i'm going to treat myself to a whole week off photo robert trotman , a swimming coach for nearly 40 years , gives the village of hempstead team a pep talk before a meet mr trotman has also coached swimmers in harlem , where he was raised , and bedfordstuyvesant \( steve hart for the new york times \)
dar es salaam , tanzania , aug 11 a security camera that was pointing directly at the american embassy gate here where a terrorist bomb exploded did not contain videotape but was merely used for monitoring by marine corps guards , a state department security official said today the camera , which was attached to the roof of the embassy building and survived the blast intact , was one of six or seven cameras on the embassy site , he said none had tape the official said that the cameras were never intended to have tape but that a lesson learned from the explosion here was the need for videotape to be installed in embassy security cameras around the world american officials said soon after the blast on friday that the security camera might provide vital evidence for the investigation now under way by the fbi after it was discovered that there was no videotaped record of the explosion , all embassies were ordered by the state department to start installing cameras with videotape , said the security official , a senior official with the state department s diplomatic service security office he is leading a team of 40 security and counterterrorism experts flown in from washington the pictures from the cameras at the embassy here as in most embassies show up on monitoring screens in the booth inside the embassy door where marine corps guards are on duty , he said it was impossible , the official said , for a marine to watch all monitors all the time , but what the guard had seen on his monitors last friday would be part of the ongoing investigation by the fbi the tanzanian police said today that they had arrested 14 foreigners in connection with the bombing of the american embassy the officials gave only nationalities and some job descriptions but no names of those being held for questioning six of the men are iraqis , six are sudanese , one is turkish and one a somali , the police said in washington today , tanzania s ambassador , paying a condolence call at the state department , said some of the detained foreigners may have had a role in the attack our people are satisfied they may have had a hand in it , the ambassador , mustafa salim nyang'anyi , said the tanzanian police spokesman , aden mwamunyange , said at a news conference , the reason for the arrests is they are dubious characters and intelligence information suggesting that they may be involved with the explosion it was not clear tonight whether the fbi investigators here have interviewed those being held in washington , state department officials cautioned that the arrests , which were apparently made over the last several days , appeared to be part of a general roundup that is a common part of crime investigation in some african countries the most striking aspect of the arrests was that none of those being held are tanzanian and that they all come from predominantly muslim countries the tanzanian leaders have repeatedly stressed that they did not believe that a tanzanian was involved in the bombing , which killed 10 people and wounded more than 70 no americans died in the explosion here tanzanian mortuary officials today identified the body of a tanzanian security guard who was at the embassy gate inspecting a water tanker when the bomb went off he was the tenth victim identified at the morgue at the main hospital , the chief pathologist , who would give his name only as dr makata , said the bodies of the two people who were closest to the water tanker at the time of the explosion were the most severely mangled this appeared to lend credence to what american officials have called the most plausible scenario of what happened here that the bomb was attached to the water tanker that made daily water deliveries to the embassy building the body of paul elisha , 32 , the security guard , who was apparently looking at the underside of the truck with a mirror attached to a long stick , was the most difficult to identify , dr makata said the other severely damaged body was that of the driver , yusuf shamte ndange although the extent of death and destruction was significantly less here than in kenya , the attack has shaken a nation proud of its stability the tanzanian leaders have sought to place responsibility for the attack outside their country s borders president benjamin mkapa said after touring the damaged embassy building that it was very unlikely that the bombing was carried out by a tanzanian
davos , switzerland , feb 2 the international monetary fund , looking for ways to avoid a future asiastyle financial crisis , may be moving in the direction of endorsing rules that would prevent another surge in foreign bank lending such a surge played a key role in the asian crisis the clinton administration distances itself from such proposals , fearful they may draw criticism in congress , which is considering an administration request to approve 18 billion in financing for the imf the concern is that any attempt to discourage too much lending through controls may sound like tampering with free markets , a potential obstacle in congress the possibility of an imf shift came sunday in an interview with stanley fischer , the imf s first deputy managing director , who was here for the annual world economic forum mr fischer , who is secondincommand at the imf , insisted that he spoke only for himself , not the organization s directors but his remarks were the first public acknowledgment by an imf official that discouraging the flow of shortterm loans might be a good idea the imf recognizes the problem of surges of shortterm capital across borders and the need to find ways to deal with that , mr fischer said he then suggested that the chilean scheme is one that needs to be considered chile discourages shortterm loans from abroad by taxing those of a year or less the goal is to encourage longterm investment the imf usually pushes member countries toward unrestricted open market systems that is certainly a condition of the huge imf bailout loans now going to south korea , indonesia and thailand in a speech last september , however , mr fischer said that capital controls could be acceptable in emergingmarket countries , but only for a brief transitional period yesterday , he greatly lengthened the period for countries that can make them work , he said , capital controls could be acceptable to the imf for a transitional phase until the financial system of a country is sufficiently strong to deal with surges in short term loans from abroad the implication was that a developing country might apply capital controls for years while it constructed a financial system with all the checks and rules that exist in industrial countries like the united states recognizing the problem , mr fischer said , none of what i am saying is a reason for a country to delay fixing its financial system he was among hundreds of government leaders , chief executives , financiers , investment bankers , artists , scientists and economists gathered here for a sixday version of the kind of renaissance weekends that president clinton has popularized in the united states the asia crisis was the main topic its causes , cures and how to prevent another there was wide agreement , for example , on the need for a monitoring system run by the imf or some other organization that would track the finances of countries much more closely than any international agency now does a rating system might also be developed , one that might prompt foreign lenders to raise interest rates for countries with poor credit ratings if we have sound surveillance and the right regulations , jacques santer , president of the european commission , said , then of course the free movement of capital takes place without the same risk excessive shortterm borrowing from abroad has appeared on nearly everyone s list of precipitating factors south korean banks and corporations , for example , amassed huge debts in yen and dollars when the south korean economy slowed , and the nation s currency , the won , began to lose value , the south koreans had trouble repaying the billions of dollars coming due each month to japanese , european and american banks the banks responded by refusing to renew the loans , doing further damage to the economy the imf bailout is partly intended to get south korea s credit system functioning again and to help assure repayment of foreign debts mr fischer s concession is aimed at discouraging so much shortterm borrowing joseph e stiglitz , chief economist at the world bank , the imf s sister organization , also spoke in favor of considering capital controls as an example , he said the controls might take the form of a big tax deduction for loans longer than a year , and a much smaller deduction or none for shortterm loans , to discourage their use if you believe there is a sufficient systemic risk , he said , referring to the danger that the asian turmoil might spread , even to the united states , damaging its economy and markets , then you have to believe that there is a need for prior action but most of the people here oppose capital controls , viewing them as unwarranted interference in free markets a global economy , they argue , functions on free and rapidly flowing capital the clinton administration officials here , spending part of their time promoting the president s request to congress for 18 billion in imf funds , shared that caution the administration is trying to sell its case on two contentions the imf is necessary when a crisis does occur , and a crisis that endures , because of a weakened imf , can cost american jobs the issue of inhibitions on shortterm capital is one that requires careful study , said lawrence h summers , the deputy treasury secretary there is no question that where supervisory structures are inadequate or financial systems are immature , excessive inflows can create problems but there are also real risks that controls can delay or prevent more fundamental adjustments some , like jeffrey garten , dean of the yale school of management and a former investment banker himself , said that capital controls simply would not work global lending is so complex today , he said , that to think you can block off one part and get the results you want is a level of hubris that is unrealistic capital finds ways to go flow around the stone
it is 12 30 pm on a wednesday on west 46th street in manhattan cars with suburban license plates pull into nearby garages charter buses unload streams of tourists who set out trolling for pretheater lunch deals and inside the luntfontanne theater , the strains of a lone clarinet float up from the orchestra pit , just one of a very different set of rituals under way in preparation for the matinee performance of titanic onstage , the gangplank emblazoned with white star line in black on blinding white canvas is lowered from where it hangs in the wings and pinned into place for the opening number ginger ale is poured into the wine bottles and stored on the prop shelf , next to the boarding passes , binoculars , stateroom towels and telegrams cloth napkins are folded on the long firstclass dining table and the hydraulic elevator that lifts the lower portion of the stage to create two levels and tilts to simulate a sinking ship is tested to make sure that its computerized signals are functioning so begins a day in the life of a broadway show audiences generally know a production by its stars , story , music rarely do they get a glimpse behind the scenes , where the set and costume changes can be as intricately choreographed as the dancing , where the relationships may be as intense as those the actors portray onstage , and where the unexpected crises can be even more suspenseful than the plot titanic offers a particularly compelling example of the magnitude and the minutiae of this backstage drama to begin with , the show is a beast of a production there are 44 actors 21 men and 15 women in the cast , plus 8 understudies who step into a variety of roles the production is technically elaborate , involving everything from smoking coal bins to a sliding piano to a precarious crow s nest from which the lookout spots the iceberg because there is so little storage space in the wings , about 40 , 000 pounds of scenery and lights are hung in the fly loft and move during the show the entire stage is raked at an angle , which makes high heels something of a challenge and has given several actors and stagehands chronic backaches and handling all the technical elements , including rapid scene and costume changes , requires a substantial backstage crew that is both quick and calm , strong yet graceful there are 13 carpenters , 7 prop men , 3 sound engineers , 2 electricians , 1 lightboard operator , 3 followspot operators , 2 men who run the automation computers and 3 flymen who pull the ropes that move the nonautomated pieces in and out coordinating all of this are four stage managers led by leigh catlett , whose even temper and gentle manner somehow make the whole operation look effortless i have a great team of stage managers , and the stagehands are a great , efficient bunch of people , mr catlett said so they actually make my job really easy because the director , richard jones , is based in london , responsibility for keeping the show true to its original self falls to susan green , the production supervisor , who also runs auditions and rehearsals for replacements and recently cast the touring company of titanic mustaches wearing out the upkeep of the show between performances is a formidable undertaking it includes the maintenance of 71 wigs , all made of human hair every one needs to be reset after each performance , constantly brushed and occasionally shampooed to handle all of this , the show has five hair and wig dressers in the wig room on this day , gary martori , hair supervisor , and chris calabrese , his assistant , prepare the wigs for the afternoon performance grecians for the firstclass passengers , gibsons for second class , single braids for third the captain s beard comes in four sections chin , two chops and mustache and has to be replaced about every five months the mustaches for other men in the cast wear out faster , particularly because they have to be ripped off and reapplied at top speed during quick changes each actor has about 20 rapid costume changes during the show there are more than 180 costumes , every one of which was custom made for each actor more than 275 hours are spent on costume maintenance a week , including the washing , starching and pressing of about 300 shirts juggling all this are 14 wardrobe people , 1 for every 3 actors lastminute cast changes by 1 30 pm , the show is technically ready to go the crew has run through every special effect , checked the lights and the sound backdrops that unfurl from the ground during the production have been loaded into the floor the smoking room has been rolled out and the radio room rolled in the porthole in the radio room has been switched to a day sky from a night sky suitcases are lined up neatly underneath the stairwell a wardrobe person walks by with an armful of life preservers , copies of the actual vests worn on the titanic the cast arrives for the halfhour call an actor who is late is obligated to call and alert one of the stage managers if a cast member still has not shown up by the 15minute mark , a swing , an actor who substitutes for several roles in the show , steps in
offering a sobering portrait of an aging metropolis , a new study by the city comptroller has found that new york would have to spend more than 90 billion over the next decade to make the necessary repairs to put the city s subways , water mains , schools and bridges in safe working order the figure is vastly higher than the 52 billion that government agencies now plan to spend on repairs but the comptroller , alan g hevesi , said that if city hall , the board of education and the transit authority did not spend more money now on repairs and maintenance , conditions would further deteriorate , meaning costs would be much higher in the future if the ultimate goal is to have an adequate physical plant where every facility functions well and safely , this is what is required , mr hevesi said in an interview it is not a wish list this is not the optimal this is by our definition a state of good repair the comptroller and his report dealt only with the city s fundamental infrastructure they did not address recent problems falling bricks , crashing scaffolding that have plagued construction sites and privately owned buildings in the city the idea that parts of the city s infrastructure are deteriorating is certainly not new but the report based on the work of auditors , investigators and engineers is the first in 20 years to describe the scope of the problem and to estimate the money needed to make repairs schools and the city transit system account for more than half of the projected cost in the report providing more space for growing enrollment , and repairing many of the city s 1 , 028 aging school buildings would cost 28 billion fixing the city transit system , including rebuilding and repairing subway stations and improving track and signaling systems , would take an additional 21 billion , the report maintained like any projection , those in the report are based on assumptions ranging from the influence of the weather on water pipes to how many people will be riding subways or attending schools that may or may not prove accurate in the future david neustadt , a spokesman for the comptroller , said teams of engineers made sample visits to more than 200 sites and then used what they learned to make projections about the likely condition of similar sites the investigators also reviewed records from 18 agencies , and used the agencies' own condition reports to make their evaluation a spokeswoman for mayor rudolph w giuliani , colleen roche , declined to comment on the report yesterday afternoon we have not been given the same courtesy of being given a copy of the report , she said i am not able to comment on what appears to be government by press release mr neustadt said that the comptroller s conclusions were discussed with each agency before the report was written and that there were no major objections none of this , mr hevesi added , is offered with hostile intent or to be critical he described the status of the city s infrastructure as a huge governmental problem that we have to solve despite its large price tag for repairs , mr hevesi s report has some good news it found that since the city s fiscal crisis of the 1970 s , the city has made strides in improving the condition of many parts of its infrastructure , including the subways , jails and many sanitation stations over all , the comptroller said , new york is a very wellmanaged city but the sheer size of the city s physical assets , combined with the cost of maintaining them and their age many of them are rapidly reaching the end of their typical life span makes it difficult to find a single solution the 900page report , in the works for 18 months , reflects the varied needs and the ways in which small items can quickly add up the city has 223 firehouses , many of which were built decades ago and not designed to handle modern , 12 , 000pound fire engines as a result , floors in 125 firehouses are in danger of buckling , or have already begun to give way although the fire department has shored up the floors , it only has had the money to fix 46 floors the city s east river bridges the brooklyn , manhattan , williamsburg and queensboro bridges are undergoing a 32 billion rehabilitation of the city s 838 other bridges , more than 70 percent are in poor or fair condition the report says 148 bridges are expected to deteriorate from good condition to fair condition in the next 10 years if maintenance is not increased the report projects a shortage of beds in homeless shelters in two years by 2007 , a shortage of between 1 , 556 and 4 , 800 beds is predicted there are no plans to build more shelters by 2007 , 1 , 060 miles of water mains about onesixth of the system will be more than 100 years old , which is

as kurt masur revisits the scenes of his early triumphs at the new york philharmonic , it is tempting to think that he is coasting , if only a little in the case of bach s st matthew passion , which he presented to great effect in 1993 , a listener might even have wished for a more or less literal revival but mr masur is having none of that in the current run of the st matthew at avery fisher hall , with one more performance scheduled for tomorrow evening he has rethought everything , with admirable enterprise and often , though not invariably , admirable results the master stroke is to import the thomanerchor , the 744yearold boys' choir of st thomas church in leipzig , germany , which bach himself directed from 1723 to 1750 and with which mr masur had a long and close relationship in his former life as kapellmeister of the gewandhaus orchestra he displays the chorus proudly here , at the front of the stage on either side this unusual forward placement not only gives the group greater prominence , which it brilliantly exploited on friday evening , but also affords greater separation to the choral division bach often uses for purposes of dialogue and contrast and the thomanerchor , 80 or so strong , was wonderful to hear unfailingly full of spirit , secure in pitch and beautifully balanced \( a good thing , since its director , georg christoph biller , was close at hand throughout , playing continuo harpsichord \) bach s incomparable counterpoint has seldom sounded so richly flavorful , and it was given added crunch by the group s splendid articulation and emphasis kids love consonants , it seems , the way dogs love trucks \( or so television commercials tell us \) all of which left the instrumentalists somewhat in the shade , not an entirely bad thing with a powerful modern orchestra in such music but it also relegated some players with important roles to the far reaches , where they were hard put to establish intimate relationships with vocal soloists as in his earlier st matthew , mr masur used about half of the orchestra , generally playing lightly and that is where the larger problems entered mr masur seems increasingly to subscribe to earlymusic orthodoxy in terms of scale and tempo here , the forces were often reduced to a whisper , and the performance was pushed ahead somewhat unyieldingly within and between movements there was little of the warmth remembered from the earlier st matthew still less of the monumentality though now politically incorrect , that quality is essential to the opening and closing choruses of this work , especially in so large an auditorium the most impressive of the vocal soloists were the mezzosoprano , annette markert , and the baritone , olaf bar john aler was effective as the evangelist , william stone slightly less so as christ , in a late substitution stanford olsen was a bit edgy in the tenor arias , and sylvia mcnair , the soprano , who can often be so expressive , here seemed caught up in the sheer beauty of her sound still , when all else , failed , there remained the beauty and expressivity of that choral sound , literally one of a kind and if mr masur , who has thought longer and harder about bach than most , was thrilled with the outcome , he was entitled photo kurt masur with the new york philharmonic and the boys' choir of st thomas church in leipzig , germany , at avery fisher hall \( chris lee \)
harrison , ny , june 12 it was a wet day at the buick classic , but an easy day for kevin sutherland though he never teed off , sutherland maintained his twostroke lead today when rain halted secondround play shortly past noon only 17 of the 139 players in the field finished the round , and more than half the field failed to finish even one hole secondround play was scheduled to resume at 8 am saturday , but the forecast called for more rain , with a thunderstorm possible the outlook for sunday was cloudy , with a chance of light rain once the second round is completed , tournament officials will decide on the rest of the schedule possible scenarios include playing 36 holes on sunday , extending play to monday , or shortening the event to 54 holes sutherland remained at the top of the leader board , thanks to his sevenunderpar 64 in thursday s opening round bob tway , j p hayes and steve lowery were in a threeway tie for second place after shooting rounds of 66 on thursday none of those players teed off today paul goydos , who also shot a 66 on thursday , was the only early contender who lost significant ground today , shooting three over par through 15 holes and falling into a 12thplace tie goydos was unfortunate to have a 7 51 am tee time , forcing him to play in steady rain the already thick rough at westchester country club became even more difficult to hit out of this morning , and the course played much longer , with balls stopping more quickly in the wet grass nick faldo and stewart cink managed to cope with the wet conditions , both shooting three under par through 15 holes and moving to even par for the tournament but the players who teed off this morning envied those who did not it s not unfair , but it s unlucky , said brad faxon , who finished 18 holes this morning , shooting a twounderpar 69 to move to one under for the tournament if i had been sitting in the clubhouse , i 'd be pretty happy that i did n't have to play the bottom of the bag gets wet , so every time you pull out a club , it s wet the towels are wet , the balls are wet , the umbrella gets heavy , your grips are wet , your hands get wet there was a huge difference in how far the ball traveled it s a bad break with the united states open starting thursday at the olympic club in san francisco , many players will be eager to leave if the tournament cannot be completed on sunday however , faxon was not certain whether some players would opt to withdraw after sunday if you 're in contention , you wo n't withdraw , he said most of us have played olympic club , and you 're going to get out there monday night anyway many players figured the challenging conditions of westchester country club would help them prepare for next week however , when play resumes , the greens will be much softer , making it easier to hit approach shots at the pins meanwhile , the bad weather cut short practice time more than a dozen players were on the putting green this afternoon despite the heavy rain but the conditions were not what they were looking for this rain does n't do us any good , faxon said i thought yesterday afternoon was as close to open conditions as you could get it was tough but sutherland was happy to finish the day where he began the guys who had to play today got the bad end of the draw , he said i did n't even get a chance to warm up but if i have to play 36 holes saturday or sunday , i do n't mind
prompted by neighbors' complaints about noise , the city shut four upper east side bars over the weekend in what officials said would be a crackdown on rowdy manhattan bars and clubs that would last through the summer deputy mayor rudy washington , the chairman of the city s social club task force , said yesterday that after focusing on bars and clubs in queens and brooklyn for the last two summers , the task force would step up inspections in manhattan this summer the task force has shut 50 to 60 legal and illegal establishments since it was created in august 1996 , he said now it s going to start cranking up and we 'll be out every weekend , mr washington said , referring to manhattan establishments that face a backlog of complaints in the summer , you 've got windows open and the loud music can be heard and the crowds are moving around robert s bookman , a lawyer who represents dozens of bars and restaurants in the city , said the raids were often more an example of city officials trying to look responsive to community complaints than of their closing serious threats to public safety or health a lot of these raids are pure 'let s get these people any way we can , ' he said some of these violations are minor it makes for a great press release and that s it but while critics have accused the task force of trying to limit the city s night life , some community groups and residents praise it for shutting rowdy bars that draw noise , and sometimes drugs and violence , to their neighborhoods the four bars shut by the task force saturday night were all within a few dozen blocks of one another on the upper east side , and were closed for various health and fire code violations mad river bar , at 1442 third avenue between between 81st and 82d streets , was shut by the fire department for failing to have a functioning sprinkler system , fire officials said ski bar , at 1825 second avenue between 95th and 96th streets , and bar new york , at 1819 second avenue between 94th and 95th streets , were shut for failing to have restaurant permits , sandy mullin , a city health department spokeswoman , said reminisce lounge , at 334 east 73d street between first and second avenues , had a restaurant permit that had expired , ms mullin said reminisce had been fighting a longrunning battle with nearby residents over noise from the bar for several days at least , residents have won the bars will be allowed to reopen when they have obtained the required permits , health department officials said it does n't surprise me , gifford miller , a city council member whose office is a few doors away from reminisce , said of the closings he said that in the last year his office had received more than 20 complaints about the bar rhonda santamour , who lives accross the street from reminisce , said the bar had not created noise problems in the neighborhood since steeper noise violation fines were enacted by the city council in october but she said neighbors would probably be happier if the bar was closed they do a big thursday night party and they do a big reggae party that residents complained about , she said ms mullin of the health department said that all three bars shut by the department were visited by the task force in january and february and issued warnings about the lack of permits none had complied as of saturday , she said no one answered the phone last night at ski bar and bar new york an answering machine at reminisce said the bar would be closed for several days for renovations but tim hurley and mike mastellone , who took over management of the mad river cafe only two months ago , bitterly complained that they were being unfairly singled out by the task force the fire department padlocked the restaurant saturday and issued summonses for lack of a proper sprinkler system or smoke alarm , mr hurley said mr hurley said that a massage parlor above their restaurant had angered neighbors city officials shut the massage parlor two weeks ago , but mr hurley said the pressure on his establishment continued he said that he had no professional or personal ties to the massage parlor the only complaints i could see were stemming from the second floor , he said people were obviously unhappy with the activity going on there mr washington said the task force raids a bar or nightclub only after numerous complaints are received city officials also check whether the local police precinct has received repeated calls to a bar he said the goal of the task force is to make partying in new york safe , not nonexistent you 've got to make sure that there are places tourists and new yorkers can go to safely in the city , mr washington said you ca n't tolerate that in an orderly city photo bar new york at 1819 second avenue is one of four upper east side bars that were closed by the city saturday night the social club task force is acting on complaints of rowdiness as the weather warms \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
state health officials investigating the case of a man who died in a westchester county hospital have discovered the first case in new york of a strain of staph bacteria that can be resistant to antibiotics , the officials announced yesterday the discovery comes as other strains of bacteria , such as the one that causes tuberculosis , have shown that they , too , can be resistant to treatment by antibiotics in some cases in which antibiotics are found to be ineffective , patients can be treated with combinations of other drugs the westchester patient , whom state officials identified only as a man older than 70 , died of a staph infection and other ailments last month at united hospital medical center in port chester family members , hospital workers and other patients were tested , and none had contracted the bacteria , the officials said frances tarlton , a spokeswoman for the state department of health , said staphylococci bacteria are among the most common causes of communicable infections , and are most often picked up in hospitals since the 1980 s , the antibiotic vancomycin has increasingly been used to treat staph infections because the bacteria have become resistant to other drugs only two other cases of staphylococcus aureus infection with resistance to vancomycin have been found in the united states the two cases occurred last year , one in camden , nj , and one in michigan both patients received other drug therapies and survived
the camera often sees a great deal that the human eye does n't for adam fuss , cameraless photography sees even more in his photograms images created by placing objects on large sheets of photographic paper and exposing them to light the simplest things are transformed into abstractions of startling beauty a red balloon suspended in black , a spot of brilliant white at its center , glows like some perfectly oval otherworldly sun slabs of cow liver are severe sculptural forms inlaid with splashes of dazzling colors an infant placed in a tray of shallow water resembles a phantasmagoric water baby with ripples of golden water for wings and , where her body rested on the tray , a dark heart in her belly the entrails of rabbits interacting with the chemicals in cibachrome paper produce astonishingly vibrant abstract expressionist marvels currently on exhibit at glenn horowitz bookseller in east hampton are five cibachrome images of snakes that mr fuss made in recent months , as well as images he created years earlier mr fuss , who developed a keen interest in the natural world and its denizens while growing up in west sussex , england , began to use snakes in his photograms about a decade ago in a 1988 precursor of the new photograms now on exhibit , a small snake glides through the water , leaving in its wake everwidening semicircular ripples that image was a minimalist blackandwhite study on the gallery walls of the glenn horowitz bookshop , the color photograms created with red or blue filters placed over the strobe have a different aura and energy level here , the snake s motions are more vigorous , and its shimmering , calligraphic ripples more pronounced and even more beautiful there is a clear difference between the red and the blue images , and between those with differing gradations of blue the blue has a cool , cerebral transcendence the hot red may be obvious , but the snake s ripples are like a seductive , mysterious veil mr fuss has positioned these snake photograms either side by side with or in close proximity to his earlier , strikingly enigmatic work , mostly of perfectly round moons or targetlike circles in orange or red \( none of the pictures in the exhibit are titled \) in particular , the three images on the wall near the front door of the gallerywithinabookshop are in ascending or descending order of size and complexity , depending on whether you view the images from left to right or vice versa viewed from left to right , the first image , created in 1986 , is little more than a pale yellow moon on a white background the second image , and the only photograph in the show , is a stunning 1996 blackonblack portrait of an elderly man wearing a black eye patch , his head bowed , his chest bony , ripples of aged skin around his breasts and under his arms the third image is a red photogram of the snake and its gorgeous trail of ripples by themselves , these are arresting pictures , but together they are a mesmerizing meditation on life and change , from an egg to darkly fragile old age to the exhilarating , liberating youththatwas , perhaps or death given the artful care in his work , mr fuss came by his art almost casually at age 4 and with a cheap plastic camera , he took a photograph of his pregnant baby sitter feeding ducks at st james park in london the boy pressed the button just as a small bird flew toward the young woman s outstretched hand taken from a child s height , the slightly blurred picture \( which appears in adam fuss , a monograph of the artist s work , published by arena editions \) seems to show an unconventional statue that of a flaxenhaired beneficent madonna in a tan raincoat and dark trousers \( a second edition of the monograph is scheduled to be published this spring \) at boarding school in sussex , another boy taught adam how to develop film and like william henry fox talbot , who experimented with cameraless photography in the 1830 s , mr fuss discovered the photogram quite by chance in 1986 not sure what he wanted to do after arriving in new york in 1982 , when he was 21 , he spent a few years waiting on tables during the day and experimenting with photography in his spare time an art teacher at his boarding school had responded to his complaint that he did n't have a good enough camera by saying he could make the most beautiful pictures with a pinhole so in new york , mr fuss began to take pictures with pinhole cameras made of cardboard these had 8 by 10inch film backs and metal buttons covering the pinholes after developing an exposure one day , he found himself looking at a baffling but fascinating image blue light streamed across the picture from the upper left hand corner , the light casting a long shadow on a small piece of something in the middle of the frame and the shadow disappearing into the surrounding darkness mr fuss realized that he had forgotten to remove the metal covering for that exposure , but a tiny leak in the worn camera had let light in , which then cast shadows on the specks of dust in the camera in a vitrine on the second floor of the glenn horowitz bookshop are four photograms from mr fuss s spiral series that he made in the early 1990 s the genesis of the series was a car accident in which the driver was injured and the artist , then a 19yearold hitchhiker lying in the back of the truck , was bruised and shaken up some days later , mr fuss saw in his mind s eye a glowing , whirling blue funnel to create the intense , almost hallucinatory concentric circles in the spiral series , he attached a flashlight to a long piece of string , which was tied to an eye hook in the ceiling he covered the light with colored gel and positioned it a short distance above the photographic paper set in circular motion the flashlight created spirals of color that ended in a vortex of white light the images in the vitrine show the centers of the spirals , where the light is at its most concentrated they include a white orb tinged with the surrounding turquoise and a lovely purplish black , orange and yellow yolk floating on white paper in the context of the exhibit , these whitehot centers are all of a piece with the notion of the beginnings of life and life itself their dominant colors white , yellow , orange are echoed in the target photograms that face the snake images on both floors of the gallery space like those by jasper johns , mr fuss s targets are silent and impassive and while they are a counterpoint to the visually lush ripples in water created by motion , they also invite thoughts of the cycles of life or maybe of nothing at all adam fuss remains at glenn horowitz bookseller , 87 newton lane , east hampton , ny , through aug 9 what is man , a limitededition book conceived and designed by mr fuss and by andrew roth , a rare book dealer and curator of photography shows at glenn horowitz bookseller , has been published by the bookshop in conjunction with the exhibition photo untitled \( 1998 \) by adam fuss , a cibachrome image of a snake , is on view at glenn horowitz bookseller in east hampton , ny \( glenn horowitz bookseller \)
they called themselves the cut throat crew , and the authorities say that in one horrific incident , the drug gang more than lived up its name by beating , trying to rape and then throwing a customer off an apartment roof to her death when the gang was not demanding payment from its customers , investigators said , it was solidifying control of a 150 , 000aweek heroin empire on the lower east side , squelching competition through violence and using children as young as 14 to ferry drugs to customers but yesterday , the gang suffered what could be a decisive blow , said the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , who announced the indictment of 39 members on charges that include conspiracy , murder and felony narcotics sales of the 39 , 33 are already in custody , with 1 arrested shortly before yesterday s announcement the 6 others remain at large this was an active drug gang that committed murders and controlled large sections of the lower east side , mr morgenthau said and we believe the arrest of these members will have a major impact on the heroin trade there the indictments follow a lengthy crackdown on other drug gangs in that area over the last year , grand juries have brought indictments against 90 members of other drug gangs there , resulting in the arrests of most members of notorious gangs like dead man walking and champion the cut throat crew gained the attention of law enforcement officials as they were wrapping up their investigation into the dead man walking gang , prosecutors said according to the district attorney s office , the gang had been active on the lower east side for several years , receiving and selling large amounts of colombian heroin but the presence of dead man walking tended to hem in this smaller and lessorganized crew , which was constantly having to fight off other dealers wanting to sell on its turf , law enforcement officials said they added that the cut throat crew did not begin to blossom until 10 months ago , when the police took most of the members of dead man walking into custody according to the district attorney s office , the crew took its name from one of its most popular brands of heroin , whose packaging bore a picture of a head being pulled back by a hand with a knife resting at the throat the members also sold packets under the names overtime , good and plenty , good news and raw dog , but none of these names stuck as well with customers , mr morgenthau said three of the gang s members have been charged in the nov 26 killing of a customer , evalene santana , 18 according to the indictment released yesterday , the gang was angered because ms santana failed to pay for some narcotics she had been given when she could not come up with the money , the indictment alleges , three of the gang members eldredge blaylock , tumai waters and dominic perciballi kidnapped her , tried to rape her , dragged her body to a rooftop on avenue d and dropped her to the ground the three gang members were arrested on murder charges in the month following her death , although yesterday s indictment additionally charges them with counts of conspiracy two other murders are also under investigation , mr morgenthau added law enforcement officials would not elaborate on these killings , though they said both were related to the drug trade on the lower east side as with many other drug gangs in the city , the cut throat crew evolved over time , changing its mode of operation to stay ahead of law enforcement while gang members began selling heroin through storefronts and in apartment lobbies , these business dealings were soon frustrated by police surveillance , mr morgenthau said he said the gang then turned to offering a delivery service , in which customers could call and have the drugs taken to them by car or bicycle the indictment alleges that one gang member even bought a car to help in this service most of the customers were not locals but people coming in from everywhere else yonkers , jersey , wall street , mr morgenthau said they were selling by car and sending kids out on bicycles people would just page them and they would send the drugs out
on what 905 workers in cityowned hospitals thought was their last day on the job , mayor rudolph w giuliani announced yesterday that he would delay widespread layoffs for 30 days and try to avoid them altogether by seeking to place the workers in other city jobs the move , which helps defuse tensions with the largest union of municipal workers , also includes provisions for severance or early retirement for workers who fail to find other jobs stanley hill , executive director of district council 37 , which represents 120 , 000 city workers , hailed the agreement and praised mr giuliani , a longtime ally whom he had harshly criticized during the last two weeks , both for the layoffs and for the city s use of workfare workers in municipal jobs last week , mr hill had said he would not bury the hatchet until mr giuliani rescinded the 905 layoffs we 've worked out a beautiful agreement and i'm willing to move forward here , mr hill said the main goal of a union is to make sure we avoid layoffs nonetheless , the agreement still leaves open the possibility that workers will be laid off , if the city cannot find enough positions for them or if enough workers do not voluntarily accept early retirement one giuliani aide said the city and the union would work together to push the state legislature to enact a new early retirement bill that they hope will encourage hundreds of municipal hospital workers to retire , thus opening up positions for many of the 905 workers who received pink slips the mayor and mr hill described the agreement as a winwin accord , which was reached after mr hill and deputy mayor randy levine bargained well past midnight for mr giuliani , the agreement has several important advantages it enables him to continue to pursue his longtime goal of reducing what he insists are overstaffed and underused public hospitals it goes far to patch up his relationship with mr hill , a powerful ally who began snarling at him and mobilizing labor unions against him as soon as the layoffs were announced in attacking the layoffs , mr hill also took aim at the city s vast workfare program , in which welfare recipients work for their benefits at one point in the dispute , mr hill equated the workfare program with slavery if you 're not prepared to give these people meaningful jobs , he said in an interview two weeks ago , you 're not really helping as part of the agreement , mr hill said , the union would suspend a lawsuit it had brought against the city , charging it with violating state law by using people on workfare to displace union workers in the hospitals for mr hill , the agreement not only avoids layoffs of his members but also gives him something he has sought for months the health and hospitals corporation , which administers municipal hospitals , will work with mr hill to examine whether there are staff shortages in certain hospital departments , and if there are , some of the workers destined for layoffs might be given jobs in those departments we both made concessions , mr giuliani said everyone gained something from this , as is classic in negotiations word of the agreement reached many of the affected workers as they gathered for a rally at harlem hospital to protest the layoffs in a 1 pm announcement that provoked a thunderous roar of surprise and delight , union leaders told the workers their jobs were safe , for at least 30 days , and that the city would then try to place them in other jobs we have an agreement , james butler , the president of local 420 , the union representing public hospital workers , told the rally the city of new york has agreed to a 30day coolingoff period , and we are going to work around the clock to prove to city hall that it needs us it was the unexpected climax of what had been planned as a wellplanned demonstration , with gospel music , hospital beds on the sidewalk , readings from scripture and boisterous participation by the crowd several union leaders praised mr hill for pressuring the mayor to reach a deal but with many details still to be worked out , one labor expert said mr hill could end up being embarrassed if layoffs still take place doris cross , who has spent eight years sterilizing supplies at north bronx central hospital , said that when she received her layoff notice last month , it s like your insides are being torn apart she said she feared she would have to go on welfare to support her two sons , but she said yesterday s agreement was a big relief at least there is some hope for a lot of us now , she said i have faith none of us want public assistance we all want to work although the layoffs would only have affected a small number of the 35 , 000 people who work for the city s hospital agency , union leaders had asserted that patient care would have suffered but city officials countered that the system faced a large deficit and that managed care had reduced the number of patients in the city hospitals the agreement does not affect about 900 workfare employees who suddenly lost their jobs in city hospitals after mr hill filed his lawsuit charging that the city was violating state law by using workfare participants to replace hospital workers mr giuliani removed them all from city hospitals , saying it was a tactical effort to prove that no one is being displaced city officials said they would not lose their welfare benefits and would be reassigned to other city agencies city hall officials boasted that the agreement was little different from what they said they had originally offered before announcing the layoffs mr giuliani said the city had offered a severance and redeployment package early on but mr hill insisted that the package announced yesterday was considerably better for the union , because it contained a richer early retirement package as well as a commitment from the city to study whether some of the 905 workers could be moved into hospital departments that are understaffed mr hill acknowledged that he rejected the city s initial severance offer he explained that when he accepted severance packages previously for municipal hospital workers , those packages reduced the work force so much in some departments that the employees who remained were heavily overworked mr hill angrily insisted that the city had not made good on its commitment to restore workers where public hospitals had shortages city hall officials and mr hall acknowledged that they had little idea how many jobs could be found for the displaced workers but mr hill said he knew of one city agency that had more than 100 job openings under the agreement , the city , rather than the health and hospitals corporation , will pay the salaries of the 905 workers during their 30day job search joseph j lhota , the city s budget director , estimated that those salaries would cost 3 million last night it was clear that city officials and mr hill did not quite see eye to eye on some aspects of the accord mr giuliani said a vast majority of the 905 would not be redeployed to city hospital positions , while mr hill held out hope that many would one senior giuliani aide said those who received layoff notices would be redeployed into hospital jobs only where there were existing posted vacancies but mr hill said the city had committed itself to redeploying some of the 905 to hospital departments that union officials could demonstrate were understaffed photos stanley hill and mayor rudolph w giuliani announcing that layoffs of hospital workers would be delayed , and

do you know where your children are \? if you 're arguably the most dangerous lingerie manufacturer in the world , then your 18yearold son , warren straub , is about to spend the night in the vanderbilt suite at the plaza he has just stolen 15 , 000 from your briefcase and is trying to make out with jessica goldman , his pretty new girlfriend though jessica is available and eager , she and warren inhabit different psychic spaces she is studying at the fashion institute of technology to become a designer his only thought about clothes is that they should be comfortable she lives with her mother with whom she has an incredible relationship , even if they have really huge fights from time to time he is a dopesmoking dropout , a slacker who also lives at home \( except when his father kicks him out \) and has n't a clue about what he wants to be warren s goforbroke courtship of jessica provides the wildly fibrillating heart of this is our youth , kenneth lonergan s very funny off broadway comedy at second stage by chance , the theater is actually on broadway , in the heart of the upper west side that is the play s milieu except for one change in the threeactor cast , this is the same production , directed by mark brokaw , that had a short run with the new group at the intar theater on theater row in 1996 i did n't see it then , but it seems unlikely that this is our youth will again be allowed to disappear so quickly commercial comedies of such brio and darkly satiric edge are rare these days mr lonergan has said in interviews that his play was inspired by his own experiences growing up , like his characters , on the upper west side in wellheeled circumstances he knows the territory and , to keep things accurate , he fixes the time of the play in 1982 , when he was just out of his teens and at loose ends the single setting is the minimally furnished studio apartment of the third character in the play , dennis ziegler , warren s slightly older role model and only friend theirs is a relationship that began in the progressive manhattan preparatory school where they think it s gonna cripple you for life if they teach you how to spell dennis is a wheelerdealer and occasional drugseller for whom the slacker s life has started to lose its joys he treats everybody badly , but he saves his most vicious invective for his offstage girlfriend , the clearly bewildered valerie one of the writerly accomplishments of this is our youth is the way mr lonergan surrounds warren , jessica and dennis with equally vivid characters who never appear among them dennis s father , a successful painter who has always been selfabsorbed and is now dying of prostate cancer , which has made him especially mean dennis s mother , a city administrator involved in social service programs , whom warren describes as a bleeding heart dominatrix with like a hairdo warren s bitter father , who does business with criminals and mourns a daughter murdered at age 19 , and his divorced mother , now living with her boyfriend in california , where she does volunteer work for some kind of grapepicking civil liberties organization there are also exclassmates , drug connections and former and wouldbe girlfriends the stage is teeming with bizarre but always recognizable life warren , jessica and dennis are n't like their parents , who came of age in the kennedy era , when the peace corps and other good causes were in fashion in the early years of the reagan administration , these three arrested children have no obvious ways of defining themselves yet the times are good warren , jessica and dennis are lucky enough to have been born into the overachieving upper middle class they can afford to indulge their unfocused discontent dennis notes that his parents are so grateful he does n't want to live with them that they are more than happy to pay for his apartment aimlessness and disaffection are not easily dramatized , unless they are reflected in the glamorous decadence that fellini so enthusiastically sent up in la dolce vita in the 1930 s , american movie makers blamed the waywardness of youth on the evils of drinking , dancing , smoking and drugs in such kitsch classics as are these our children \? and reefer madness only later did they decide that the lack of parental love and care was at fault , as in rebel without a cause mr lonergan knows there are n't any easy answers booze , drugs , inconstant parents or even the royal tone of the reagan presidency he is also aware that the slacker life can do serious damage the epicenter of this is our youth is the extended , hilariously written , beautifully acted scene in which warren \( mark ruffalo \) and jessica \( missy yager \) get to know each other alone with jessica in dennis s studio , the twitchy warren has only one thing on his mind , as does jessica , but she is thinnerskinned , more quick to take offense and worried about her reputation they flirt without finesse , attempt to dance , though neither is at ease in dancing that requires body contact they talk about parents , about 1960 s flower children who went on to become establishment lawyers , about \( in jessica s phrase \) the last pathetic remnants of upper west side jewish liberalism with a ferocity that fuels his passion , the sexy , miniskirted jessica says she is convinced that evil has , like , triumphed in our time
the justice department filed suit yesterday to prevent northwest airlines from buying a controlling stake in continental airlines , saying that the deal would stymie competition and lead to higher ticket prices for millions of americans this is the first time that the government has tried to block a deal between two major airlines since the aviation industry was deregulated 20 years ago it appears to indicate that the clinton administration , which has stepped up its antitrust enforcement , will not permit any more consolidation within the industry , which has coalesced around a handful of large airlines in recent years affordable , quality air transportation is critical to consumers both in their personal lives and in their businesses , said joel i klein , assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department s antitrust division this acquisition would lead to higher ticket prices and worse service for the over four million passengers traveling on the routes dominated by the two the heart of the government s case is that control of continental by northwest would diminish competition between the two airlines , especially on seven routes between their largest hub airports northwest , the country s fourthlargest carrier , dominates air traffic in detroit , minneapolis and memphis continental , the nation s no 5 carrier , is now the single largest airline in the new york area , operating from its hub in newark it also dominates the airports in houston and cleveland but it was not immediately clear how effective yesterday s action would be the lawsuit , filed in united states district court in detroit , seeks to block the northwestcontinental transaction , but the government did not ask the court to stop the two airlines from completing the deal while the case was pending the complaint also did not address an alliance between the two airlines that would enable them to sell seats on each other s flights and engage in other joint marketing while maintaining separate managements , employees and fleets continental has described the arrangement as a virtual merger calling both the equity investment and the alliance procompetitive and proconsumer , northwest said yesterday that it would acquire the stake in continental , within weeks , if not days , while it prepares to challenge the government in court if it loses , it will be forced to divest itself of the continental shares , but that might not be for a while this litigation could drag on for years , said jeffery a smisek , continental s general counsel antitrust experts were puzzled that the government did not seek a temporary order to stop the deal but government lawyers said it would be possible for the justice department to get a decision from the court relatively quickly , perhaps within a year , and that it could still block the alliance , which it is still investigating there is no reason why it has to be a multiyear proceeding like the old ibm case , john nannes , the deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust unit , said in an interview yesterday merger cases can be brought to trial very promptly he said that the government did not seek a restraining order because northwest and continental were not proposing to make changes that could not easily be undone the case promises to have farreaching implications for the airline industry after northwest and continental announced their alliance in january , the country s other major airlines scrambled to match them , fearing that the larger network of a combined northwest and continental would lure away their customers within weeks , united airlines , the country s largest , agreed to link its domestic network with delta air lines , the thirdlargest carrier no 2 american airlines stuck a deal with no 6 us airways though none of the agreements involved exchanges of stock , they alarmed lawmakers in washington who have grown increasingly concerned about rising ticket prices and declining airline competition last month , united and delta were forced to scrap plans to jointly market their domestic flights after delta s pilots objected but airline executives acknowledge that if the northwestcontinental alliance is permitted to go forward , the other alliances will seek similar rights the question is if you permit this one , how do you stop united , delta , and so on , said alfred e kahn , who presided over airline deregulation as head of the civil aeronautics board in the carter administration and is now an emeritus professor at cornell university maybe you can , but it is going to be hard northwest and continental said yesterday that their alliance would result in what they estimated to be 14 billion in consumer benefits , while maintaining the independence of both carriers together , the two carriers account for about 16 percent of domestic air traffic , enabling them , they argued , to become a viable fourth challenger to united , american and delta , which each have 17 to 20 percent of the market in january , northwest agreed to buy 14 percent of continental s shares , which represent 51 percent of all voting rights , from air partners , a texas investment group controlled by the financier david bonderman , for 311 million in cash and 41 million shares of northwest stock to insure continental s independence , northwest said that it would place the shares in a trust a set of independent directors on continental s board would control the votes , though northwest would retain the right to vote the shares in the event of a takeover and a few other key circumstances determining continental s future after the justice department objected to the trust , which was to expire after six years , northwest offered to extend its life to 10 years it also offered to submit to further restrictions on the conditions allowing it to vote the shares and to forgo a seat on continental s board but douglas m steenland , northwest s general counsel , said that negotiations with the government broke down earlier this week when the justice department refused to back down from its demand that northwest give up majority voting rights after the trust expired he added that northwest was planning to acquire the continental shares on the more liberal terms it had offered the government , which meant that many of the issues outlined in yesterday s lawsuit would be addressed this complaint challenges a transaction that does n't exist anymore , he said but the government obviously disagrees anticompetitive acquisitions cannot be cured by longterm voting trusts or other artificial legal devices that leave one competitor in the hands of another , mr klein , the antitrust chief , said yesterday chart their way or the highway in filing to block the proposed merger between northwest and continental airlines , the justice department cites seven major routes , serving over 36 million travelers annually , in which the combined company would have

why must dance be understood \? ask hesitant new audiences for dance why they draw back , and the difficulty of understanding dance almost invariably comes up people do n't worry about theater mystifying work by playwrights like samuel beckett and tom stoppard is there to be experienced music is there to be listened to but dance must explain or amplify itself music can have any old title , as the composer and juilliard teacher pia gilbert suggested to jack anderson in an article on training choreographers last month in the new york times no one would question calling a delicate piano piece sunbeams one time , she said , and snowflakes another but if i called a dance sunbeams' or snowflakes , ' people would immediately try to discover some relationship between movement and title mark morris discovered this when he created a piece called mort subite \( sudden death \) some reviewers struggled mightily to discern themes of loss and grief in a time of plague in the plotless , relatively abstract dance but the title , mr morris responded , was the name of a brand of belgian beer mr morris s unconscious may have been speaking but it is not so farfetched for a reviewer or a member of the audience to assume that the name of a dance might have something to do with its content otherwise why not go the way of music and name dances by number \? titles can be reassuring and this is a time when guidance or outreach is in fashion , an era when it seems no school or community group can escape periodic lecturedemonstrations designed to prepare potential audiences for the new experience of dance sadly , much of this activity can be explained by the fact that such programs are just about the only lucrative area in the breakeven art of dance these days dance may seem too dangerous too independent , too unpredictable an art form to be supported by tax or foundation money except as carefully spoonfed , through such lectures , into the empty maws of future dance audiences a lively , savvy exception occurred last month in a weekend celebration of high five , a program that provides the best kind of outreach by getting people , in this case new york teenagers , into the theater with lowcost tickets at a matinee in an elegant exhibition room at the american craft museum in manhattan , the companies of stephen petronio , arthur aviles and douglas dunn performed wildly varying moderndance works whose only common denominator was movement as part of the event audiences had the chance to question each choreographer what they might have learned was that mr petronio was as ardent as his highenergy workouts , mr aviles was as exuberant and specific as his hip updating of the story of the wizard of oz and mr dunn was as meditative and full of ideas as his piece their listeners might also have learned something about the process of making dances but it would have been up to them to get into the heart of each work a piece by merce cunningham was one of my first experiences of modern dance , as a fledgling new york balletomane who had wandered astray with no great knowledge of that area of dance nothing that happened on the stage was recognizable none of the sounds that washed up against and battered my ears were recognizable as music the experience was confusing but something drew me back there was something there that i needed to know , though not , as i look back , necessarily to understand it is not possible for most youngsters to wander back today , given the generally high prices of tickets but how do we convince audiences \( and reviewers \) of all ages to let go , to allow themselves to inhabit the world of a dance \? dance , like poetry , is an art of metaphor and abstraction , though it whisks by and cannot easily be reread there are narrative dances , from swan lake to revelations , just as there are narrative poems and nothing having to do with the human body can be truly abstract stillness and motion are inherently dramatic but even the most clearly expressive phrase of dance is a distillation , whether the beating of a foot that suggests the beating of a heart newly and fearfully in love , or a raising of arms that approximates prayer literalism is the enemy of dance another enemy is the choreographer who falls back on ambiguity audiences must revel in ambiguities of their own choosing , plucked from dance created by choreographers who understand what they feel about a work and what they want to communicate if that understanding is present in the creator , even instinctually , the most overarching and vast of themes can be expressed in dance just as in verse there s a better shine on the pendulum than is on my hair and many times , the poet lorine niedecker wrote , i 've seen it there one can enjoy this as a poem about light , a pendulum and hair but eternity and the mortal day are captured , with certainty , in her everyday objects and their connection and effect a similar sense of metaphor and unfolding time were to be found in unfinished business , a new work by dennis o'connor , which was performed at the kitchen in the chelsea section of manhattan last month even before the dance had begun , the precise blue of an upholstered chair on stage signaled that one was in good hands and that something telling was about to happen here was an object that suggested an informed , imaginative choice as it happened , the chair was one of several homey , elegantly resonant props it was sat on by one of four members of what might have been a family or simply a dance company nothing was explicit mr o'connor allowed his audience to wander mentally into and around the lulling , mysterious world he had created on the stage at one point , he knelt in a quarter profile to the audience , soft light revealing a luminous back covered with dark clots that could be seen gradually to move live crickets , they fell to the ground , and he almost imperceptibly picked them up , dropping them gently into his cupped hand what did it all mean \? one could have taken the piece as a dance about a chair and insects mr o'connor might have been suggesting implicitly the oneness of all creatures , though i doubt it , or simply evoking great calm but what the solo did surely mean was stillness , quietly focused attention , the delicate yet implacable curve of a back and arm and hand , and a body poised just so in open space inhabited by three other hushed bodies it meant pale , clear light and an absence of sound or music , in moments that fit perfectly into the piece as a whole and were eloquent in their own right mr o'connor could have chosen chair or blue or bugs as his title it would n't have made a difference a magical image was music for open eyes , unmediated by explanation photo from left linda sastradipradja , dennis o'connor and jodi melnick dancing mr o'connor s unfinished business \( tom brazil \)
tasting all the wines made every year on long island is possible theoretically doing it properly slowly and thoughtfully might take a week or more but the opportunities to arrange and carry out such a complex exercise are rare , even for the wine makers time is short , responsibilities long almost certainly none of them have tasted all of each other s wines , however much they 'd like to do so many have dipped into only a handful of bottles or barrels from the competition , even though a fullscale overview would yield a wonderful education about the range of differences and similarities in style and quality on the east end true , it s fairly easy to get a general handle on a vintage still , in hourin hourout tasting , palate fatigue sets in fairly soon objectivity , such as it is , ebbs identifying characteristics and making fine distinctions becomes progressively harder aware of these limitations , i was curious about which of their colleagues' wines each wine maker or owner especially liked or remembered this year nobody was asked to deliver weighty most outstanding judgments first , because opinion , like wine itself , is changeable second , some people do n't take full or any notes third , memory fades i asked everyone to choose a red and a white , asked that the wines be currently available somewhere \( a few are n't , it turns out \) and asked for a few words of commentary here are the opinions bedell cellars , cutchogue , expressed by kip bedell , an owner and the wine maker pugliese s '95 blanc de blanc sparkling wine i had it at a picnic , and we had

larry perrine , the wine maker palmer s '96 lieb vineyards pinot blanc the other one is sagpond s '96 sagpond rose , he said i like the quality for the price i did n't come up with red wines because we have n't achieved what we can with the fruit that has been grown , and that would include me the white wines have achieved a higher and more consistent level of quality corey creek , southold , expressed by peggy lauber , an owner paumanok s '97 chenin blanc i had it with oysters and it was crisp and delightful also , russell hearn s '95 cabernet franc at pellegrini cabernet franc has real

california , mrs hargrave said , has made some wonderful sauvignon blancs he had a good touch with that particular grape also , gristina s '95 cabernet sauvignon it is made for longevity it shows some room to develop jamesport vineyards , jamesport , expressed by sean capiaux , the wine maker paumanok s '95 tutt hills lane vineyard limited edition cabernet sauvignon incredibly concentrated , very dark , very deep , rich , and , like a california wine , gives a sweet perception when it is not actually sweet also , schneider s '95 cabernet franc , made by kip bedell it shows varietal characteristics of this region , very pretty laurel lake vineyards , in laurel lake , expressed by michael mcgoldrick , the owner lenz s '95 merlot , because the subtleties of eric fry s winemaking techniques stand above the crowd also , corey creek s '95 chardonnay , made by mr kleck at palmer subtlety of oak lenz winery , peconic , expressed by mr fry , the wine maker macari s '97 sauvignon blanc it s good news that a new winery on the block can hire a good wine maker \( gilles martin \) and start right out of the box with such a good wine , he said bedell s '95 reserve merlot it s a

jasper , tex , june 12 from the shade of his porch across the street , grover thomas could watch the steady stream of people , black and white , bearing casseroles and baked chicken and other peace offerings today to the family of james byrd jr , who was killed this week in one of the south s most grotesque racial murders in many years but somewhere in his 81yearold imagination , mr thomas known as pete in the quietly disheveled , mostly black neighborhood of east jasper still held out hope that mr byrd would somehow walk up to his porch , as he did every morning , with a friendly word and a few sausages or a cardboard box of dominoes when he did n't come over sunday , i knew that he was gone , not coming back , mr thomas , a retired sawmill hand , said as a rooster strutted about the dirt lawn and an old dog scratched he had cut my lawn the day before , and he was supposed to take me to church he had his problems , but he never forgot james byrd , who was 49 , never seemed to have made full use of a broad intelligence and a renowned musical ability , relatives and neighbors said but those who knew him described something solid within him , a reliability that drove him to take care of mr thomas , an elderly neighbor he had known since boyhood , and a deep affection for the three children of his failed marriage for all of his personal problems alcoholism , petty thievery , an inability to hold a job he was well liked and had apparently never been involved in any kind of racial incident family members , gathered from across texas for the funeral on saturday , said they could not fathom the kind of random racial hatred that the authorities say led three white men to drag him by his ankles from a pickup truck early sunday morning , tearing his body to pieces we told the children that this was just an isolated act of people who were sick and twisted , said clara taylor , one of mr byrd s sisters , standing on the front lawn of the brown wooden house where they both grew up and where mr byrd s parents still live to do this , you have to believe that someone is just not worth living to begin with it had nothing to do with him it could have been anyone walking down the street if they were black , that is mr byrd s high school class of 1967 was the last segregated class in this east texas town of 8 , 000 , but even before full integration began , neither mr byrd nor most other residents had any significant runins with white residents , neighbors and relatives said mr byrd often sold vacuum cleaners to make money , said another sister , mary verrett , and had success with both white and black customers he would often be seen walking the streets of town , accepting rides from friends or acquaintances , and never with any consequences the kind of racial problems we had here were the kinds of things where you would n't get the promotion or the right jobs , mrs verrett said in all the time i grew up , there was never any outright bigotry , and none of us were afraid to walk the street in fact , you could say we were pretty happy mr byrd was the third of eight children of stella byrd , a sunday school teacher , and james byrd sr , a dry cleaner the family s life revolved around greater new bethel baptist church , a few blocks from their home , where mrs byrd taught and her husband was a deacon when the church doors opened on sunday , we were there , said mrs taylor , 50 , who teaches eighthgrade science in the houston public schools there was school in the morning , then services , then baptist training union , then church again at night you knew what you 'd be doing on sundays as a boy , mr byrd was known in church more for the passion of his piano playing and singing than his faith he could pick out any tune on the keyboard before he was 10 , and was particularly adept at belting out spirituals and hymns , especially walk with me , lord , and more recently the pop hit i believe i can fly he was the lead trumpeter in the band at rowe elementary school , and also did a morethanpassable imitation of al green but despite an excellent academic record at jasper high school , he decided not to follow his two sisters into college , even though he was encouraged to do so by his parents his friends and relatives speak vaguely and sadly of an aimless , drifting element to his life , an unwillingness to commit himself to a career or a passion he was so very intelligent , and as his family we always regretted that he never used his intellectual potential to the highest capacity , said mrs verrett , 47 , a medical transcriptionist who lives in houston he was n't the type of person who liked a 9to5 job he would get in a rut , and then his personal difficulties would begin the drinking started in high school , friends say , and was exacerbated by medical problems like arthritis \( he had also injured his foot in a bicycle accident in his youth , leading to his neighborhood nickname , toe \) at some point , said the rev kenneth o lyons , pastor of greater new bethel and a boyhood friend , mr byrd lost his religious faith
so far , 1998 has been a long and dispiriting year for the hudson river the first worrisome news came in february , when the federal environmental protection agency delayed its longawaited decision on the cleanup of the river putting off until 2001 a decision on whether to order general electric to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from a 200mile stretch of the river , which is one of the largest superfund sites in the united states then the corporation on the defensive for dumping the industrial contaminant in the river from 1947 to 1977 started publicly challenging government findings that linked the pcb s to an increased risk of cancer at an april stockholders' meeting , john f welch jr , chairman and chief executive of the fairfieldbased ge , told the audience that new research indicated that the contaminants , long thought to be carcinogens , had no adverse health effects on humans and last month , new york state , bogged down by internal conflicts , failed to approve this year s allotment for the hudson river estuary management plan , a program that for 13 years has coordinated environmental work along the river an initial 6 million for the plan in the budget was vetoed by gov george e pataki , and a separate bill , which followed , failed in the state assembly the hudson river has become a victim of politics , john cronin , executive director of hudson riverkeeper , a nonprofit environmental group based in garrison , observed ruefully last week it is a sad state of affairs against this somber backdrop of disappointments , many hudson river advocates now await president clinton s announcement , expected later this month , on the 10 waterways to be designated as american heritage rivers a white house advisory committee has recommended that the hudson be included in the program , which would encourage efforts for environmental protection , economic development and cultural and historic preservation it is a bitter irony that these setbacks have occurred on the eve of the president s declaration , mr cronin said we 've always assumed that the hudson would get its due , but the truth is that we have to continue to fight for every inch of the river every inch of the time perhaps the blow that struck hardest this spring and hit closest to home for those active on behalf of the river was the loss of state financing for the hudson river estuary management plan what had not been a partisan issue became one , assemblyman richard l brodsky , a democrat from greenburgh and chairman of the assembly s environment committee , said , bristling over the defeat of one of his pet environmental projects mr brodsky observed that the two separate estuary plan proposals in the budget and in a separate bill failed even in a year when the state government is flush with cash the hudson is the last estuary in the north atlantic to retain strong spawning stocks of its traditional varieties of fish , and it is considered one of the richest estuaries on the planet but as mr brodsky , sponsor of the estuary plan bill , observed , the river s continued vitality cannot be taken for granted studies , including those by the federal fish and wildlife service , show that between one and three pounds of pcb s a day leach from the river bottom at thompson island pool , a sixmile section of the hudson downstream from two general electric plants in fort edward and hudson falls , about 45 miles north of albany the chemicals in turn contaminate fish and move up the food chain , affecting birds as well among other things , financing for the estuary plan included money for habitat restoration along the river , testing of toxins in fish and provisions for recreational access to the river the program was up and running , and suddenly everything came to a grinding halt , said gary sheffer , assistant commissioner of the state department of environmental conservation while aides to mr pataki and democratic leaders pointed fingers at one another for the failure to finance the estuary management plan this year , mr brodsky predicted last week that the story was far from over he said he was optimistic that the legislature would restore the money meanwhile , general electric , under pressure for its part in the river s decline , cited a study published last october in the new england journal of medicine showing no link between pcb exposure and breast cancer and another michigan study from 1975 indicating no increased risk of cancer or other health effects in people who had eaten pcbladen fish from the great lakes more than 20 studies , conducted over 20 years mainly by academics , private institutions and government agencies , have shown that pcb s do not cause cancer in humans or other adverse health effects , a recent company publication said the publication also said that many of ge s occupationally exposed workers who worked with pcb s on a daily basis for many years have shown little negative effects that s very powerful evidence , david c warshaw , a spokesman for the company , said
marshall , liberia when the militiamen arrived in this picturesque fishing village one august afternoon eight years ago , they quickly rounded up all of the ghanaian immigrants they could find , marching them off together with liberian friends and sympathizers for execution in the massacre that ensued , perhaps 1 , 000 people were shot to death survivors say that children were swung by their feet by laughing soldiers as their heads were smashed against palm trees many say they can still hear the screams of the countless others who drowned as they attempted to swim across a river for the safety of a nearby island two truckloads of fighters showed up here around three o'clock one friday , and the shooting began almost immediately , said kwesi kayah , a 48yearold fisherman who lost his wife , father , two children and an uncle the killing went on into the evening , and started again the next morning before they left , they rounded up seven survivors and began shooting us i only escaped by playing dead few in liberia even remember the marshall massacre today , so little does it stand out in a record of atrocities that grew thick during the country s seven devastating years of war fewer still , outside of the survivors who have drifted back here over the years , can recall what the killing was about , or even who its perpetrators were in retrospect , however , the disaster at marshall stands out as one of the first mass killings in the liberian civil war , a war that killed as many as 10 percent of liberia s 25 million people , and made refugees of another 700 , 000 , becoming , in the process , a prototype for other african conflicts in the 1990 s as in the wars that were to follow in somalia , sierra leone , the central african republic and the congo republic , the liberian capital and other towns were heavily shelled for weeks at a time in a brand of fighting that blurred all distinctions between military and civilian targets as in the conflicts in rwanda and burundi that were to follow , ethnicity became a driving force behind gruesome bouts of killing , with individuals being shot or whole villages torched because the victims did not speak the same language as their attackers liberia was also a pioneer in the use of children as soldiers , a prominent feature of so many recent african wars since but even beyond factors like these , the signal distinction of the liberian war , and its most disturbing legacy for this continent , was the notion that combat may , or even should , be waged against unarmed civilians so common were attacks like these that the victims themselves often came to view wartime atrocities with fatalistic acceptance i lost my own son and all of his children to the npfl boys , said cecilia bestman , a wrinkled peasant woman who appeared to be in her 70 s , whose hair was braided with safety pins and keys asked if her son was a combatant , mrs bestman replied with a resigned shrug he was a fisherman , not a fighter but this was war the npfl , or national patriotic front of liberia , was the militia of charles g taylor , the man who began liberia s war with an invasion from ivory coast on christmas eve 1989 that aimed to overthrow the country s thendictator , samuel k doe mr taylor s militia attacked the ghanaians at marshall in reprisal for ghana s deployment of soldiers in liberia as part of a west african peacekeeping force that fought to stop mr taylor from taking the capital , monrovia , by force mr taylor s troops set the tone for the war and determined its pace , twice laying siege to the densely populated capital with heavy artillery attacks , and waging scorchedearth campaigns in regions he identified with rival militia leaders the npfl had no monopoly on atrocities , however in one of the most infamous incidents of the war , and one of the few massacres that received more than a brief notice internationally , more than 600 people were slain inside monrovia s downtown lutheran church in 1990 by soldiers of the late mr doe s national army their crime , diplomats and human rights workers said at the time , was to have been born into the gio and mano ethnic groups of northeastern liberia , the region from which mr taylor drew most of his guerrilla fighters people were killed here for the simple reason that they spoke the wrong language , said joshua iroha , nigeria s ambassador to liberia you could be killed just for looking healthy people got killed because they had a brother or sister who worked for the government if the liberian bloodshed set the example for so many african conflicts that were to follow , in one important respect , liberian and foreign human rights experts say that this country is creating an equally negative precedent for the aftermath of war however slow or flawed the process , countries like rwanda and the congo republic have created mechanisms to try war criminals and to give some accounting for their heavy tolls of victims but in liberia , where the instigator of the war and leader of its largest faction won a presidential election last year , there has been virtually no movement for an accounting of past atrocities all of the factions killed civilians , looted civilians and raped civilians , said janet fleischman , the director for africa for human rights watch , the united statesbased advocacy group and because they all took part in these kinds of acts , none of them have any interest in seeing any accounting for what happened mr taylor announced the creation of a human rights commission with great fanfare after his inauguration last august , but the body still has no offices or budget more important , its statutes do not provide for subpoena power , and allow investigations only when they are approved by the government no one in this country will be secure until the truth can be told about this war , said one unlikely advocate of a thorough investigation of atrocities , roosevelt johnson , leader of a faction that fought mr taylor during the war , who is now minister of rural development but if this government has to give its approval for every investigation do you think anything will ever happen \? never photos in the village of marshall , liberia , perhaps 1 , 000 people were killed by guerrilla fighters in a 1990 massacre at the start of liberia s civil war those killings set the pattern for a decade of brutal conflicts in africa today in marshall , where fisherman prepared for another day s work and children played among wrecked cars , few people other than the survivors can recall who the perpetrators were \( photgraphs by robert grossman for the new york times \) map of liberia showing location of marshall in marshall , the line between civilians and

life is a battle for the human soul between the forces of the sacred and the profane or so it would seem even to a casual voyager through theological musings on dance over the last four centuries dance , like sex , was marginally allowable as a duty , a way of maintaining a healthy body otherwise , dancing led to perdition of the 500 , 000 fallen women in the united states , over 300 , 000 started from the ballroom , w w hamilton , a baptist minister from virginia , stoutly proclaimed early this century but dance has a connection to the spirit that is intimate , immediate and unavoidable an art that merges abstraction and the literal physicality of the human body , dance became selfreferential in the mid20th century , making a virtue of being about nothing more than the body itself yet dance has remained singularly capable of evoking the spirit , whether in the soul of a dancer who has achieved selflessness in motion or in the soul of the viewer identifying with that physical exaltation this week , in theaters a few blocks apart in brooklyn , two programs will address and seek to incorporate and represent the spirit the dance in those programs is worlds apart in time , history and geography the madrasbased chandralekha , whose new fullevening raga in search of femininity is to open on wednesday for four performances at the majestic theater , presented by the next wave festival of the brooklyn academy of music , comes from the east and a culture that at least by western standards is permeated with the spiritual a performer of the bharata natyam school of stylized indian dancedrama , chandralekha left the field to devote herself to political activism when she returned in the mid1980 s , it was to create a form of dance that merges traditional eastern and modern western movement forms in the service , largely , of summoning the spiritual her raga aims to embody the unseen self that hovers in between , that is neither man nor woman , in the words of a poem by the 10thcentury poet devara daslmayya that partly inspired the piece chandralekha s innovations , while acclaimed internationally , have been controversial at home in india the three choreographers whose work will be shown in dance and spiritual life , the second event , are a part of a long , though largely unacknowledged , tradition in american modern dance unusually , attention will be paid to the potential of dance to connect the spirit and the body in the oneperformance program on saturday , which features choreography by dianne mcintyre , bebe miller and jawole willa jo zollar , three black choreographers who have been prominent on the american moderndance landscape during the last several decades their work will be presented by 651 , an arts center at the academy opera house , with free ancillary workshops and discussions on the subject of dance and the spirit , particularly in black american culture , to be given this week in various locations in brooklyn what exactly does spirit mean in these farflung contexts \? for chandralekha , sensuality , sexuality , spirituality are all unified in the body , as the choreographer told shanta gokhale in a recent interview in persona magazine my work is about linking inner and outer spaces we live in the body without understanding its vital parts and points and without the knowledge of how to bridge the innerouter divide by contrast , body and spirit are separate entities in the works in dance and spiritual life , with the yearning , vital distance between them the subject of much of the choreography the dancers , singers and actors in ms mcintyre s love poems to god , a collaboration with the composer and poet hannibal lokumbe , engage in intimate conversations with god in a way that is very personal , ms mcintyre said a funny , sad and awesome vision of god emerges in ms zollar s transitions , a ritualistic piece built around the dancers' taped memories of their ideas of god from childhood on ms miller s blessed , performed to a cappella gospel music by an australian group called the cafe of the gate of salvation , comes closest to an abstract blending of mind and soul none of these works refers to specific religious tradition american dance studios , unlike foxholes , seem to be home to a fair share of nonbelievers religious imagery is not paramount to the delineation of spiritual content , the dance historian joe nash said mr nash will participate in dance in the black church , a dance and spiritual life discussion on thursday night at the cornerstone baptist church in the bedford stuyvesant section of brooklyn martha graham uses religious imagery to further her thesis about the spiritual nature of joan of arc in seraphic dialogues , ' he said , but what about doris humphrey s day on earth and the serene , quasispiritual look it takes at the human life cycle \? there s no religious imagery there , but the quality comes through , mr nash said eleo pomare s 'blues for the jungle , ' a dance about violence in the city , is a choreographer s response to suffering humanity the church finale in alvin ailey s 'revelations' serves as the inspiration for the whole work , but the spirituality that comes through is because of the rich images he has created , the blending of the music and the movement

jablanica , serbia , april 1 a gaunt , nervous rebel with a scraggly black beard and a large hunting knife protruding from one of the pockets of his vest pulled a chromeplated pistol from his belt as two dozen guerrillas ambled from nearby farm houses to join him this is our territory , he said we are through with these albanian intellectuals in pristina , with journalists , diplomats and everyone else no one saved our women and children from slaughter now it is up to us the onceelusive guerrilla bands from the kosovo liberation army , who are fighting for an independent state in this serbian province , are suddenly ubiquitous rebel groups that a few weeks ago numbered four or five guerrillas have quadrupled in size , swelled in part by an infusion of new troops and weapons smuggled over the border from albania there are also indications that the guerrillas have been joined by foreign mercenaries the rapid and startling growth of the armed insurgency has prompted fears that the unrest in the province could explode into the next balkan war the guerrillas move within a few hundred yards of sandbagged police checkpoints and open fire frequently on passing police convoys they wear uniforms with red , green , black and white splotches , as well as arm patches with the black , doubleheaded albanian eagle and cradle new , welloiled assault rifles on the ridge tops above them other rebels , including adolescent boys , man machine guns from newly dug trenches assault rifles are casually slung over the shoulders of nearly every ethnic albanian male in these mountains , including those in the cordonedoff drenica triangle , about 25 miles west of pristina many interviews with rebels during the last week suggest that the guerrillas have been joined by foreign mercenaries whose heavily accented albanian , appearance and martial demeanor suggest experience in other war zones many ethnic albanians roaming the hills said they quit their menial jobs in germany or switzerland when the serbian counterinsurgency sweeps that left at least 80 people dead began last month they traveled to albania , where they hastily collected uniforms and weapons , and crossed the rugged frontier with pack mules bringing in fresh arms and ammunition rebel leaders , they contend , have been busily signing up recruits and collecting contributions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from the more than 600 , 000 ethnic albanian refugees and seasonal workers in europe to prosecute the war i came back as soon as i saw the pictures of the massacres , the destroyed houses and the bodies of the women and children , said a rebel wearing a black ski mask i left everything in germany when i understood what the serbs were doing to my people it was my duty we will fight until the last of us is dead we have little interest in speaking we are fighters in the indiscriminate killings by hundreds of heavily armed serbian police and paramilitary units last month , more than half of the victims were women and children the death of so many noncombatants has enraged a population fed up with heavyhanded police rule and life as secondclass citizens in the serbian state we laid flowers today on the desks on nine of our pupils who were murdered by the serbs , a 49yearold teacher at the petro marko elementary school in srbica said as he wiped away his tears none of us could teach and none of the students could study we are overcome by grief for our little ones and hatred for our enemy the serbs , rather than hunt down armed groups , blasted villages into rubble with 20millimeter cannon , grenade launchers and 50caliber machine guns those trapped in the houses died and many of those who fled where gunned down , according to witnesses many bodies , laid out at mass funerals , bore signs of mutilation and summary execution serbian officials have tried to blame the rebel fighters for the carnage , saying the guerrillas executed those who tried to run away the police remain in heavily fortified emplacements in the province , despite calls from abroad that they be withdrawn in many villages , like this one about 30 miles northwest of djakovica , women and children have been sent away to live with relatives in anticipation of the looming combat you have to wonder if the serbs had any idea what they were doing when they shot their way in here last month , said a western diplomat who is in pristina , kosovo s capital , monitoring the conflict they will have to keep hundreds of police deployed for the next 30 years or accept that parts of this province will be ceded to the rebels the ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of kosovo s 2 million people , had their autonomy stripped by belgrade in 1989 when they began to call for an independent state a shadow government led by ibrahim rugova has mounted a disciplined program of civic resistance that has seen the ethnic albanians boycott all state institutions , set up their own schools and administration and collect taxes the failure after eight years to achieve independence , coupled with the police sweeps , appears to have doomed the peaceful resistance many of the funds collected for the administration among ethnic albanians abroad are being diverted to the coffers of the rebel movement , according to officials close to mr rugova the sound of automaticweapons fire , along with the whoosh and detonation of mortar rounds , punctuate most days and nights in the rolling , duncolored hillsides
chicago , feb 3 an analysis of a blood sample preserved since 1959 from the oldest documented case of infection with the aids virus called hiv1 shows that the first such infections probably occurred in people in the late 1940 s or early 1950 s , about a decade earlier than many estimates , scientists said today the researchers compared that sample with others to build a family tree to trace changes in the fastmutating aids virus the family tree , or phylogenetic analysis , is in the shape of a starburst , with branches radiating from the center , and the 1959 virus is close to the center the scientists used calculations to estimate the date when the virus first developed the viral family tree cannot pinpoint where the aids epidemic began or how it was propelled so rapidly through the world , the researchers said but by providing a better approximate date for the origins of hiv1 , the most common form of the aids virus , scientists can try to better understand how it evolved the 1959 sample came from a bantu man who lived in leopoldville , belgian congo \( now kinshasa in the democratic republic of congo \) in 1986 , scientists used what were then the latest laboratory techniques to show that he had been infected by hiv1 but only now could scientists , using the latest powerful tools of molecular biology , identify key fragments of the virus in the last few drops of the blood sample in a quest for the origins of the aids virus at a scientific meeting here today , dr toufo zhu of the aaron diamond aids research center in new york city said his team s conclusions derived from information from the fragments , or sequences of nucleic acids , of the 1959 virus those sequences were then compared with those from hundreds of other virus samples isolated from people infected since the aids epidemic was first recognized in 1981 the comparisons included data from a norwegian family that was infected in the early 1970 s scientists study the evolution of viruses that cause epidemics in the hope of learning how to predict and prevent such outbreaks in the case of influenza , for example , such information could lead to better flu vaccines the knowledge of how hiv developed could someday help scientists prevent similar epidemics many scientists have presumed that the current worldwide epidemic evolved when the virus was introduced on multiple occasions when people were bit or cut while butchering infected primates for food but dr zhu s team concluded that the major subtypes of hiv1 that dominate the current epidemic of aids in the world have evolved in humans from a common ancestor virus rather than arising from repeated crossspecies transmissions from primates to humans the findings also give the lie to a widely publicized theory put forward by the soviet kgb that the aids virus had escaped from an american germ warfare laboratory , dr david d ho , the head of the diamond aids center , said in an interview dr ho said the findings indicated that the major group of viruses that dominate the global aids pandemic at present shared a common ancestor in the late 1940 s or 1950 s the findings also pointed to the need for close monitoring of hiv strains because the virus was likely to diversify further in the future , dr ho said the virus could theoretically mutate to become more dangerous or less lethal dr ho speculated that hiv1 might have been unwittingly spread through things like shared needles in largescale immunization programs for diseases like polio and smallpox but dr ho said social changes , like easier access to transportation , increasing population density and more frequent sexual contacts , might have been bigger factors shortly after the discovery of hiv1 in the early 1980 s , dr andre j nahmias of emory university in atlanta was among the scientists who searched for evidence of it in stored blood dr nahmias s team tested blood samples kept from a genetics survey that involved more than 1 , 200 people living in africa and was conducted by dr arno motulsky s team at the university of washington a screening test indicated that 21 of them may have had hiv infection further testing confirmed only one as actually being hiv1 positive it is not known whether the man developed aids later , a published report said that none of the man s blood remained for further testing , but some remained in a freezer in dr nahmias s laboratory he said in an interview several years ago that he would not yield any of the precious little serum in the vial until he found the scientist who had the best method for such tests meanwhile , dr ho became involved in the scientific investigation of a man who died in 1959 in manchester , england , of an aidslike illness in 1990 , british scientists reported identifying hiv1 in tissues kept since the man s death but the case took a perplexing twist in 1995 when dr ho failed to confirm the british findings and said his tests showed the tissues sent to him had come from at least two people dr nahmias later sent a sample from his 1959 case to dr ho s laboratory in new york city after several failed attempts , dr zhu used laboratory techniques to extract hiv s genetic information from the blood sample he identified four fragments and stitched them together the small amount of genetic information was sufficient for his team to construct a map and to go to computerized data banks to compare the 1959 virus with others in the family tree those findings are also being reported this week in the scientific journal nature in a separate article in that issue , dr simon wainhobson of the pasteur institute in paris , agreed that the epidemic had probably come from a single hiv ancestor dr wainhobson said findings of dr zhu s team all make good sense
childsized wheelchairs sat empty in the corridor , an odd sight alongside the playful murals of elephants peeking through the jungle bush colorful , too , were the red and yellow syrups and pills by the nurses s station with notations for azt or dilantin in a crib tucked into one corner , a 3yearold rested , his chest rising and falling with every rasp of breath thomas cahill walked into the room and glanced at the youngsters living at the incarnation children s center , a residence for hivpositive children in washington heights he was there to read bedtime stories , a simple act filled with the singsong cadences of tales about giants , princesses and animals yet in reading to these fragile children , mr cahill and his friends hoped to find strength for themselves mr cahill , the author of the surprise best seller how the irish saved civilization , has for the last two years led a small prayer group in midtown called the friends of st giles it is affiliated with the community of sant'egidio , a large ecumenical group that was established by roman teenagers in 1968 to pray , read the gospels and lead lives of friendship with the poor city dwellers may be too caught up with getting ahead that they have no time to make friends with their neighbors , much less the poor , but mr cahill insists it is neither impossible nor foolish to think that small acts of charity can make a difference we 're just a bunch of middleclass people , he said none of this is earthshaking or monumental it seems extremely minor , but everything is minor in a way you know the famous response of mother teresa when someone asked her how she did it \? 'one by one' i think that is always the response one by one is how the friends of st giles formed in 1996 when mr cahill was leading a discussion group at st malachy s roman catholic church on west 49th street there , he met others who shared his aspiration to emulate what he had seen in the sant'egidio community in rome the italian group , born of the social protest and religious renewal of the late 1960 s , grew to a point at which it fed thousands of people , educated children and sheltered the homeless it was , mr cahill said , a powerful reflection of what faith could accomplish he calls it nonprofessional christianity , lay people who pray together , read the gospel and try to act on those words the gospel is like a treasure hidden inside a beautiful building that no one goes into , he said that s been contorted out of shape by uptight church people who put up a smoke screen between the gospel and ordinary human beings since last year , he and his friends have been reading to the children at incarnation , talking with hospitalized aids patients and compiling a list of soup kitchens that need volunteers on monday at st malachy s , he begins a series of talks on encountering god in the hope of attracting more people to the prayer group then , he hopes to work with imprisoned youths , a group mr cahill feels is overwhelmed by hopelessness the idea of of connecting with the poor can engender its own hopelessness , familiar to anyone who ever avoided the gaze of a beggar while wondering if he was denying someone a meal being confronted with that is a conscience tickler , said peggy pugh , a newcomer to the prayer group you give something and you hope it s to someone who really needs it and not adding it up for drugs it s a huge problem , unless you turn off your heart when you walk the street linda dickey , one of the group s original members , said her visits to former addicts suffering from aids have given her insights into her city and herself she has seen how people s lives disintegrate in a flash , something that she thinks strikes fear and denial in others why do people fear the poor \? she said because we have so much privilege , we think it s so terrible but we 're fooled by our possessions what she clings to now are the moments she spends running errands for the sick , writing letters for them , or just listening i 've gotten to meet people i would n't otherwise ever met , except maybe as a victim , she said they taught me you can have a painful life and yet be a loving person friends , even until you try , you might think it s scary , she said for new yorkers like me , middle class and educated , it could be hard but i feel different now about the other people i see on the subway they 're my people
washington , feb 21 are vernon jordan and bill clinton still best friends \? in legal and public relations terms , mr jordan s path this week began to diverge in small , telling ways from the president s on the cbs news program 60 minutes , mr jordan s mentor and law partner , robert s strauss , said bluntly last sunday that there were limits to mr jordan s loyalty to bill clinton , and further fissures were visible in a series of news stories that seemed to emanate from mr jordan s camp mr jordan s unfolding account of his actions in the matter of monica s lewinsky , the former white house intern , as told by lawyers and other close associates , was not very helpful to the white house mr jordan s associates said the president and his lawyers had not told him a crucial bit of information at the time he was asked to help ms lewinsky find a job that she had been dragged into the sexual misconduct lawsuit filed by paula corbin jones against the president mr jordan , several friends said , felt he was treated badly by this omission this and other differences stop a long way short of open conflict but the president has made few deep friendships in five years in washington , and any perceived division with mr jordan would encourage fairweather friends to desert it has become clear in recent days , in private conversations and public forums , that if the washington establishment must choose , it will stand by vernon e jordan jr and not bill clinton when people fall from grace in the capital they can fall slowly , or quickly , depending on whether the establishment a mix of politicians and journalists decides to help break their fall or kick them as they go down that showed vividly last weekend , when mr strauss first hinted at a rift he was joined on the television program by another democratic wise man , lloyd cutler , and the georgetown novelist sally quinn it was a very public embrace of the 62yearold , milliondollar superlawyer during the weekend the program was broadcast , president clinton was barricaded at camp david with old arkansas friends , like harry and linda bloodworththomason , who , despite their stated distaste of beltway culture , have been staying at the white house to help the president get through this latest storm while the clintons had valentine s dinner with the thomasons and others , washington s political class was chattering about the president s increasing isolation during the investigation led by kenneth w starr , the independent counsel investigating the whitewater deal the bubbling controversy over the question of whether mr clinton had a relationship with ms lewinsky has exposed new fault lines in the crusty terrain of insider washington , none more potentially devastating than the possibility of a rift between the president and his best washington friend , mr jordan mr strauss , who brought mr jordan into his prestigious law firm in 1981 , gave the clearest signal that this distance might now separate the president and mr jordan mr strauss , a bluntspoken , 80yearold texan , said vernon is a loyal , devoted friend but vernon is not a fool and vernon is n't a man who does things that he knows to be either conceivably illegal , improper he does n't do that mr jordan s associates also said he had gone to the white house to confront president clinton and had asked whether he and ms lewinsky were sexually involved the president denied it and at a news conference on jan 22 , mr jordan said ms lewinsky had told him in no uncertain terms that she did not have a sexual relationship with the president this account , in which mr jordan appears remarkably innocent , may be hard to reconcile with the image mr jordan himself has promoted over the last six years a bawdy companion with whom the president can share locker room talk as mr jordan once described it several friends of mr jordan , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that he would not betray the president and still feels a loyalty to him but they also said he would not sacrifice himself for the president they said it was important for mr jordan , who is facing accusations that his help for ms lewinsky was part of an effort to buy her silence in the jones case , to set the record straight and defend the legality of his own actions for the president , one of the most painful parts of the starr investigation has been that it has deprived him of the advice and company of mr jordan , who has served as first friend since mr clinton moved into the white house \( these days , mr starr could question mr jordan about any conversation \) he knows i'm up late at night i get up early i'm always available for advice , mr jordan said in a 1996 interview the president has pulled mr jordan off the golf course when there was something on his mind for his part , the president has said of mr jordan , the last thing he 'd ever do is betray a friendship while mr jordan s tall , elegant presence has been a mainstay of bill and hillary rodham clinton s life in washington , he has been conspicuously absent on recent occasions he was not at the white house dinner on feb 5 for prime minister tony blair of britain , a dinner that was heavily stocked with clinton loyalists from hollywood
washington , march 20 following are excerpts from president clinton s arguments in support of his motion to dismiss paula corbin jones s lawsuit against him they are in response to papers filed by ms jones s lawyers on march 13 , arguing that the suit should proceed the president s motion to dismiss the suit was filed on feb 17 these arguments were made public today by lawyers for the president preliminary statement plaintiff s 90page press release in opposition to summary judgment , and its immaterial , scurrilous exhibits , are nothing more than a smoke screen intended to camouflage the fact that plaintiff has no evidence to support essential elements of her claims one would scour these materials in vain for a shred of admissible evidence that governor clinton did or said anything to anyone at aidc to handicap plaintiff in her job or that anything concretely adverse occurred to plaintiff in her job or that she experienced distress so severe no reasonable person could endure it one need look no further than the first page to see that the opposition s rhetoric is not supported even by plaintiff s own testimony the opposition contends that governor clinton summon ed plaintiff to the hotel room plaintiff , however , states that she went there voluntarily under no threat or compulsion the opposition accuses president clinton of sexually assault ing plaintiff the president vehemently denies this moreover , nowhere in plaintiff s numerous statements and revisions of her allegations does she ever allege the requisite elements of sexual assault the opposition asserts that the governor command ed plaintiff to perform oral sex even if one were to credit plaintiff s testimony , there was no such command to the contrary , plaintiff expressly alleges that he told her he did not want her to do anything she did not want to do , and allowed her leave the room upon rebuffing his alleged advances the opposition claims that the governor threatened plaintiff but plaintiff testified that no one , including governor clinton , ever told her that she had to submit to his sexual advances to receive job benefits or that he would use his relationship with the director to penalize her or that her refusal to submit to sexual advances would have a negative effect on her job at every crucial point where the burden is on plaintiff to counter concrete record evidence , the opposition instead points only to plaintiff s feelings , perceptions and beliefs this is not sufficient under rule 56 to create a genuine issue of material fact rather , the burden is on plaintiff to present facts and evidence to support her claims she cannot rely on unsubstantiated assertions , speculation or inferences built on inferences now that the time has come to prove her claims , moreover , plaintiff unsuccessfully attempts to improve the record after the close of discovery with selfserving declarations from herself and others , including a purported expert who examined plaintiff on the eve of our filing for summary judgment these materials fail to meet plaintiff s legal burden , as does her tardy statement purporting to catalogue material facts in dispute , filed four days after it was due these materials are not supported by competent evidence , and their untimely submission makes a mockery of the federal rules and the court s orders the court can and should disregard all of them plaintiff s failure to satisfy legal requisites is typical of plaintiff s modus operandi every time president clinton points out legal or factual deficiencies in plaintiff s case , plaintiff simply revises the facts and changes her legal theories thus , plaintiff s opposition disavows legal theories plaintiff previously championed to the court asserts several claims the court already has rejected and explains at length what plaintiff does not have to prove , without stating what elements she does have to prove in the process , plaintiff fails to cite a single case imposing liability based on the novel legal claims she now asserts indeed , the opposition is the best evidence that plaintiff has no case , and is only using this litigation as a vehicle to vilify the president plaintiff took advantage of the court s good will and improperly used the filing as an opportunity to dump on the public record page upon page of salacious material none of which has any bearing whatsoever on any of the issues raised in the summary judgment motion the real purpose of this tirade appears to be to make spurious charges of criminal conduct against the president , which he vehemently denies thus , despite its bulk and hyperbole , the opposition does not supply any admissible evidence to prove essential elements of plaintiff s claims accordingly , the president s motion for summary judgment should be granted argument plaintiff has failed to proffer competent evidence to counter president clinton s motion for summary judgment president clinton s statement of facts must be deemed admitted pursuant to local rule 561 \( a \) , president clinton submitted with his moving papers a separate , short and concise statement of the material facts as to which \( he \) contends there is no genuine issue to be tried \( statement \) it was then incumbent on plaintiff to respond with a separate , short and concise statement of the material facts as to which a genuine issue exists all material facts set forth in president clinton s statement , moreover , are to be deemed admitted unless controverted by the statement filed by the nonmoving party
say michigan and the automobile business comes to mind to think of texas is to think of the oil industry and north carolina still means big tobacco but say new jersey , and the word pharmaceuticals hardly leaps to the tongue the rodney dangerfielding of the state has extended to its mightiest manufacturing industry , which ca n't get no respect people know that our companies are here , but they have no idea what an important industry we are , said raymond v gilmartin , the chief executive of merck company we have n't gotten the focus or attention that we might have deserved and yet the state s 186 pharmaceutical companies , with their 60 , 000 jobs , have spawned an influential corporate culture and an exploding , highly skilled talent pool the drug makers have transformed nearly every aspect of new jersey , ranging from the consumption of pizza in nutley and the proliferation of rural executive subdivisions to making key early contributions to the new jersey performing arts center in newark thanks to an accident of geography and history , the industry is the state s largest manufacturing sector , according to the new jersey department of commerce the giant , researchbased pharmaceutical companies' global war is increasingly being waged from new jersey turf and the state s role is growing in december , for example , pharmacia upjohn , of kalamazoo , mich , the maker of rogaine hair restorer and nicotrol nicotine patches , announced that it would move its worldwide headquarters and 700 jobs to bridgewater township this year fred hassan , the company s chief executive , said the move would place the company s headquarters within the global center of gravity of the pharmaceutical industry yes , new jersey certainly the industry s vocal critics in environmental groups and labor unions , who have bitterly fought the pharmaceutical companies for decades , charge that the drug purveyors have all too much power in the statehouse and in the legislature they call for more regulatory focus on the dark side of the business but the industry is gearing up to foster an imagebuilding campaign that would make new jersey and pharmaceuticals synonymous last year the state s largest companies , including merck company , novartis pharmaceuticals corporation , johnson johnson and hoffmannla roche , each paid dues of 50 , 000 to set up a trade association , the 16member health care institute of new jersey drawing on statistical and financial information never before released by the implacably competitive and often secretive companies , coopers lybrand , the accounting and consulting company , was hired by the institute to compile a statewide portrait of the business it conclusively supports the notion that new jersey is the medicine chest of the nation , as the institute perkily puts it new jersey has the nation s largest concentration of businesses that produce prescription pharmaceuticals , overthecounter medications , generic prescription drugs , vitamins , diagnostic drugs and medical devices these companies inject more than 8 billion into the state s economy , including 32 billion in wages the state s drug makers are currently targeting 60 major ailments , including cancer , alzheimer s disease , heart disease and aids a third of all new drugs approved by the united states food and drug administration during the last five years have come from new jerseybased pharmaceutical companies \( pennsylvania and california came next \) new jersey companies produce at least 43 percent of the pharmaceuticals sold in the united states last year , 17 of the 48 most significant new drugs approved by the fda originated from new jersey companies nary a nook or cranny in the state is untouched by the industry the pharmaceutical companies channel 14 billion to new jersey vendors ranging from temporaryemployment agencies to security guards they include not only computer suppliers but also the park pub in nutley a cozy , barnbeamed watering hole directly across from the main gate of hoffmanla roche on kingsland avenue and the crocco brothers new york pizza and restaurant , just around the corner we recently sent over 150 pies for an office party , said john crocco , the restaurant s coowner they account for 80 percent of our business during the day , he said sometimes the scientists will even order in pies at midnight for knowledge workers , at least , the life style can be thoroughly rewarding the average salary of fulltime workers at the top 15 companies is 58 , 380 , and senior researchers make 150 , 000 and up the new jersey talent pool is like something out of the middle ages , where all the shoemakers worked on the same street , said dr daniel o hauser , who heads preclinical research for novartis in summit new jersey is the equivalent of the pharmaceutical guild , the place where you find the talent in attracting top scientists to the region , the access to academic institutions , museums and fine restaurants is important , said dr alan j main , director of pharmaceutical research at novartis
give in , cry uncle it s time to admit that the sound of music is a de facto classic when the show originally opened in new york in 1959 , the critics were dismayed to find that richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein 2d had turned their backs on the modern american musical they pioneered instead of producing something as experimental \( for them \) as allegro , a 1947 flop , they came up with an operetta so sugarfrosted that its nazis would not have looked out of place as tiny attendants on a wedding cake in spite of the critics' pans , the sound of music survived with a vengeance it tapped into the public psyche in a way that reached beyond the draw of even mary martin , the star the show ran for 1 , 443 performances later it was turned into the hugely successful 1965 film that threatened to mire julie andrews in nanny roles for life the news this morning the sound of music still is n't about to disappear , certainly not when it is done with the skill evident in the revival now at the martin beck theater , the first broadway revival since the initial run i say that as someone who , having made his first sound of music contact with the movie version , fled from the theater suffering what resembled an acutely cockeyed anxiety attack instead of feeling good as the ads promised , i felt terrible the socalled free world appeared to be doomed the spectacular physical production of the film \( its picturepostcard alpine scenery , its skies of a blue no mortal has ever seen \) had the effect of making the work s pushy optimism seem suicidally silly maybe unamerican we were being softened to death the movie went further than most escapist entertainments , which simply do n't mention worrisome topics that , in the mid1960 s , would have included the bomb , the cold war and vietnam the movie was so allencompassing , its characters so narrow of vision , that by denying the existence of the real world with such vehemence , it called attention to everything being omitted it was with some reluctance that i finally went to see the show at the martin beck , and found myself not only tolerating it but also appreciating it in ways that could n't have been anticipated the difference between the dreaded movie and this genial , nicely cast revival is one of human scale it is the difference between watching live actors perform within a modest proscenium arch , and watching giant humanoids romp across actual tyrolean landscapes that , on the big screen , seem less real than heidi ettinger s efficient sets for the show as directed by susan h schulman , this production never allows the sentiment to upstage the actors , and never allows the actors to upstage the rodgers and hammerstein score there is harmony here that supports the charm of what is really a fairy tale set in the tyrol do n't be fooled by the fact that the howard lindsayrussel crouse book was inspired by a reallife story it plays like a benign variation on cinderella s triumph maria , a novitiate whose worst sin is singing without permission , is sent from the convent to act as governess to the seven children of the widowed capt georg von trapp the captain has been estranged from his children \( and even from music \) since the death of his wife in no time at all , helped by some jolly songs , maria wins the love of not only the children but also of georg he marries maria and , except for the pesky 1938 anschluss when hitler occupied austria , the trapp family , now known as the trapp family singers , would have lived ever after on their estate instead , they are forced to flee on foot to switzerland they thus have to scale all those alpine peaks that were simply metaphors when , earlier in the show , the mother abbess instructed maria how to live her life \( climb ev'ry mountain \) but even this ending is sunny if the family had n't left austria , they never would have ended up as successful innkeepers in vermont the cast plays all this with a brisk , disciplined musicalcomedy brio that seldom slops over into unbridled sentimentality rebecca luker s maria is purevoiced , strongjawed and sweetly forthright in the manner of julie andrews , without being an imitation she dominates but never intimidates michael siberry , an australian actor who lives in england and is making his broadway musical debut , is very good in the none too rewarding role of georg , an assignment that defeated the great christopher plummer in the film version even the trapp children are attractive without being allowed to be determinedly cute the score , including my favorite things , doremi and the title song , is satisfying in context , if heavy on the calories and dangerously filling it may remind you of the little girl who was told on her birthday that she could eat all the cake she wanted , and who later threw a tantrum when she found that she could n't that small kids love the sound of music is understandable most are responding to the sense of ideal community shared by the trapp children , but a few may be watching the performers and thinking there , with a little luck , go i it s show biz for me ! parents be put on your guard , but do n't be put off 'macbeth' the most optimistic thing to say about george c wolfe s staging of macbeth , upstairs in martinson hall at the joseph papp public theater , is that it s unlikely that many people will turn in their tickets no matter what they hear about it the limited run has been sold out since the day tickets went on sale the magnet is n't shakespeare , nor one of the most viscerally disturbing melodramas in the entire englishlanguage theater it is the chance to see alec baldwin in the title role and angela bassett as lady macbeth when these two go at each other , you hear most of the words , but you might not realize that a kingdom is at stake rather than the captaincy of a bowling team call them fred and daphne and , while you 're up , get each of them a beer mr baldwin and ms bassett are exciting actors in movies and have worked with reported success on the stage , though i 've not seen them they appear to be risktakers and eager to extend their horizons , which is great that said , it is clear from this production that neither is ready to challenge the role assigned at least , not outside those halls where actors study and exercise their talents in private with their peers because actors are so vulnerable , the impulse here is to put the blame on mr wolfe as the director he should have protected his actors , even from themselves if they insisted on going ahead with what must have seemed an illfated project from the start neither mr baldwin nor ms bassett yet has the vocal equipment or body language necessary to do these roles they paddle wildly , but are overwhelmed by the sea of words mr wolfe s vision here is lean and leathery everyone wears leather , as if to identify a primal society , though ms bassett s gown has the understated lines of italian couture the playing area is a long thrust stage , planked with timber that seems to have come from primeval forests there are few props , only swords and a goblet or two the production has a spare visual style , but no discernible point of view about the text the result is an embarrassment that may make money for the public but otherwise does no one credit only liev schreiber , who plays banquo , is up to his task the three weird sisters could have been borrowed from a firstyear speech class even the battle scenes and the sound and lighting cues seem underrehearsed , or maybe just

minneapolis , april 2 the olympic champions may be missing , but the russian dominance in figure skating has continued unabated at the world championships despite an underwhelming performance , aleksei yagudin won the men s title tonight , a day after yelena berezhnaya and anton sikharulidze won the pairs title at 18 , yagudin is not yet a polished performer and perhaps because he had stomach problems in recent days and had not been able to eat regularly , he struggled with his usually reliable jumping tonight but he still managed to land seven triple jumps and to become the second youngest men s world champion first prize was worth 50 , 000 , even if yagudin did not win in top form he is six days older than donald mcpherson of canada was when mcpherson won the world title in 1963 yagudin s timing was off as he stumbled out of his opening combination jump , then reduced a planned quadruple toe loop to a double toe he also botched another triple jump , but the judges appeared to reward his ambition as much as his performance lucy j brennan , the american judge , awarded him 58 s for technical merit and artistry the world title will undoubtedly assuage a disappointing fifthplace finish at the olympics for yagudin , who suffered from pneumonia and a temperature of 102 degrees at the winter games in nagano , japan it was not my best skating , a subdued yagudin said it was too hard to lead after the short program i was lucky today , that s all tonight s long program , which counted for twothirds of the scoring , was actually won by a resilient todd eldredge , 26 , of bloomfield hills , mich , the 1996 world champion however , because eldredge finished fourth in the short program , he could not win the overall title unless yagudin finished third or lower in the long program so eldredge settled for the silver medal it was a welcome consolation prize after a disappointing fourthplace finish at the olympics on a night when none of the medalists could land a quadruple jump , eldredge fell on his quad toe loop he did not complete his first combination jump , but he gamely began improvising with another tripletriple combination , fast spins and a triple toe loop tossed in near the end of the fourandahalfminute routine he now retires from olympicstyle competition with five national titles and five world medals i was aggressive i said , 'i want to go for this , ' eldredge said i'm so happy i skated well yagudin s training partner in st petersburg , russia , 15yearold yevgeny plushenko , finished second in the short program , but fell three times in the long program and tumbled to third place over all two of plushenko s falls came while he attempted a quad toe loop it was an impressively assertive performance by a skater who was named to the russian world team only last friday after the olympic champion ilya kulik withdrew with a bad back michael weiss , 21 , of fairfax , va , stumbled from third place in the short program to sixth over all with a mistakefilled long program all three olympic medalists withdrew , so these championships served more as a preview of coming seasons rather than a climactic review of this season the prize money that yagudin has won this year , at least 158 , 000 , has elevated him in financial as well as skating circles he currently lives in an apartment with his mother and grandmother , and they share the bathroom and kitchen with another family but yagudin has purchased another apartment with his winnings and will soon move himself and his family into their own place he has also purchased a sport utility vehicle , saying dryly , on russian roads , you need a jeep
thou shalt be silent when the celebrating begins , is a commandment for broadcasters calling title games the pictures tell the story , so shut up do n't narrate the hugs there will be lots of time to talk later surprisingly , nbc s bob costas violated the rule on sunday night during the exultant moments after the chicago bulls defeated the utah jazz in game 6 to win the national basketball association title after saying what needed to be said the chicago bulls have won their sixth nba championship , and it s their second threepeat costas clammed up for seven seconds , then began talking again costas spoke for 69 of the next 80 seconds most of what he said offered insight or perspective and , yes , the bulls' achievements , particularly michael jordan s , merit a doctoral thesis but all of costas s words could have waited for two minutes' worth of selfexplanatory video imagery to run its course by comparison , a randomly chosen tape of a previous bulls championship showed marv albert staying absolutely quiet for 2 minutes 19 seconds as chicago celebrated winning the 1992 title over the portland trail blazers we expect much from costas , a peerless studio host and inquisitor his recent dateline nbc profile of art schlichter , the onetime quarterback whose compulsive gambling landed him in prison , was riveting but costas is not albert his voice does n't match the rhythms of basketball as faithfully as albert s did yes , costas is prepared he rarely makes mistakes yet his style seems more suited to baseball , more in tune with its pace when he was called upon to replace albert , costas had n't called basketball in nearly 20 years albert achieved his mastery over more than three decades nbc s postalbert team was ever in flux costas had to readjust to hoops , nurture isiah thomas through onthejob training and then bring the far more experienced doug collins into the mix they improved , but not to the level albert achieved with his partners only collins is a no 1 basketball voice on sunday , collins was usually sharp as costas invited him to coach the game as it advanced collins gained primacy over thomas as the no 1 analyst , a title nbc bestowed on him despite his lack of experience but would you turn down 750 , 000 a year simply because you were a great player \? as always , the choice of announcer made no difference in the ratings the teletubbies could call the nba finals , especially one starring mr jordan , and ratings would soar in fact , these finals will be the highest rated ever such viewership makes players virtual pals if jordan rang your doorbell asking for cheese for his nachos , you 'd call him michael , would n't you \? if scottie pippen popped over for a chiropractic adjustment , you 'd call him scottie , right \? if karl malone stopped by for an emergency swabbing of rogaine , you 'd say , karl , take my last drop of rogaine , because keeping your bald spot filled is critical to the nba s postjordan future right \? but some players were addressed more familiarly by costas than others , as if they moonlighted as brazilian soccer stars bob called jordan jordan 53 times , michael 21 times , mj twice and michael jordan 11 times pippen was pippen 23 times , scottie pippen six times and scottie seven times \( confusing some who believed scottie burrell made the plays \) bulls coach phil jackson was phil twice luc longley got a luc or two but utah s stars were not on such a firstname basis not once did bob call john stockton john \( he was the only john on the floor \) malone was malone 48 times and karl malone six times bob waited until 5 minutes 45 seconds remained in the game to call malone karl , then let it slip once more wolf s nightmare channel 2 s warner wolf thought coughing uncontrollably and partially losing his voice during last tuesday s sportscast was bad but i got through it you know , the show must go on , he said last friday , however , something more bizarre occurred his new upper dental bridge fell out on the air as he was leading into his final segment , the featured horse race two things that never happened in 38 years on the air ! wolf said yesterday , laughing and it is n't even sweeps month ! noting the dental calamity , wolf clamped his hand over his mouth , but the tumbled bridge was briefly noticeable to viewers fortunately , the race tape came up , wolf said , giving him time to push the bridge in he ended his report , but all i could think of was , 'get this sportscast off the air !

with their bold , inventive palette and unfurled gestures , helen frankenthaler s colorstain paintings of the 1950 s represent a middlesize step for art and an astounding one for a precocious young artist barely out of college fourteen of these canvases form a radiant exhibition at the guggenheim museum , beginning with mountains and sea , a weightless concoction of translucent pastels that hovers tantalizingly between landscape , still life and pure abstraction often seen as the catalyst for color field painting , most notably for the mature styles of kenneth noland and morris louis , it was made in 1952 , when the artist was 23 the show , organized by julia brown and susan cross , curators at the guggenheim , could have presented a fuller view of this fertile decade in the artist s career , with its ups and downs , dead ends and triumphs but it s still a treat for anyone interested in postwar painting and , more generally , the challenges faced by young painters few american artists have entered the new york art world at a better time or more prepared than helen frankenthaler there was , as never before , a viable new york art world and ms frankenthaler was a native new yorker , from a welltodo family \( her father was a state supreme court judge \) and conscious early on of her creative drive she attended the dalton school , where she studied painting with rufino tamayo , and from there went on to bennington college in vermont , where she worked with paul feeley by january 1949 , she was back in new york for good , setting up her first studio at the time , the new york art world was becoming increasingly stimulating , contentious , populous and selfaware jackson pollock and willem de kooning had just had their first solo shows and the critic clement greenberg had announced new york as the next center of vanguard art abstract expressionism was asserting itself as the first american art movement of international stature soon , to the chagrin of the newly annointed abstract expressionists , who had toiled for years in straitened obscurity , a disturbing thought balloon began to take shape above manhattan it was especially visible to young artists , and it said , in effect , what s next \?

here but not here a love story by lillian ross illustrated 240 pp new york random house 25 of all the rumors that used to flourish in the ratty hallways of the old new yorker offices on west 43d street , none were more persistent or more fascinating than those concerning the relationship between william shawn , the magazine s famously shy and reclusive editor , and lillian ross , one of its star reporters they were seen together all the time , in cabs arriving at or leaving the office , at lunch , at movies , at restaurants on the upper east side but could they really be more than just friends \? the notion was thrilling , sexy and given shawn s welldeserved reputation for prudishness and hypermorality a little weird yet the truth , if ross s memoir , here but not here , is to be believed , is even weirder than anything we imagined shawn and ross were indeed more than friends they were lovers who inhabited a private world of their own making , beginning in a bedroom that had formerly been marlene dietrich s clothes closet , and whose 40year affair , despite the inconvenient fact that shawn was married and would n't get a divorce , attained a degree of perfection rarely granted to sublunary adulterers their lovemaking never paled , ross says it had the same passion , the same energies \( alarming to me , at first , in our early weeks together \) , the same tenderness , the same inventiveness , the same humor , the same textures as it had in the beginning their regard for each other never altered every night he called her from a special phone he had installed at the side of the bed he shared with his wife the affair , ross explains , took place with the acknowledgment of cecille shawn , but acknowledgment , it hardly needs pointing out , is not the same as consent while shawn was alive \( he died in 1992 , at the age of 85 \) , he and his wife went to elaborate , at times almost comical lengths to keep up appearances , and more than appearances they doted on each other with an affection that would be hard to feign whatever the exact nature of the triangle , cecille shawn pretended to her friends and family that it did n't exist ross , who is in her 70 s , no doubt feels some urgency about telling her side of the story , but for her to publish it now , while mrs shawn , at 92 , is still alive and vigorous , seems a cruel betrayal of the shawns' muchvalued privacy a tactless example of the current avidity for tellall confessions in certain respects the book also seems a betrayal of shawn s high editorial principles it s not particularly well written , at least by the standards of ross s earlier work , especially the classic picture and it is on occasion factually inaccurate or misleading \( discussing the unrest that beset the new yorker in 1976 , for example , when many of the magazine s younger staff members sought to join the newspaper guild , ross says that after the crisis was averted people felt free to take their complaints to shawn directly only if they wanted to see him turn purple in a complimentary reference describing how shawn designated me as his heir apparent in 1986 , she telescopes to a matter of a few weeks what was actually a drawnout , onagain , offagain affair and describing the magazine s finances in the postshawn years , she suggests that his departure in 1987 by itself plunged the new yorker into unprofitability in fact , much , if not most , of the red ink can be attributed to a vastly different business climate , and to the inevitable costs of restructuring , rather than to a failure of editorial leadership the magazine s circulation has grown steadily \) ross says at the end of here but not here that she is sure shawn would have been proud to read the book perhaps some of it would almost certainly have made him wince or , at any rate , the shawn most of us thought we knew fastidious , ill at ease , ascetic , a little timid but ross s book offers another , surprising shawn , one who may have been hidden to everyone but her and her adopted son , erik this shawn was intrepid , tooling around in a brandnew triumph tr3 , for example , and iceskating at grossinger s he was a sensualist \( who longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures \) , a lover of rich food \( no wonder he only had cornflakes for lunch ! \) and a bit of a dandy \( who enjoyed dressing like fred astaire \) he even used obscenities and went to pornographic films ross suggests that this shawn was the truer one , and that he felt trapped in his other , official life some of the book s most fascinating passages are those in which he declares himself a nullity , a person without qualities , more ghost than man i am there , but i am not there , he says to her more than once , referring to his homelife , but the statement also applies to his existence itself he seems to have felt a loneliness and a sense of disconnection so extreme that it verged on dread he yearned , ross tells us , for freedom , for fresh air , for lightheartedness , for warmth , and she assures us that in her arms he found them

in rockandroll , only the cranks survive or so it seemed last week , when rock icons of the 1960 s descended on new york city baby boomers dug deep into their pockets to sell out both parts of madison square garden for three shows by the rolling stones in the arena and , in the smaller theater , five shows \( continuing through wednesday \) that pair bob dylan and van morrison although they were in the same building with the potential for a historic collaboration , or at least a memorably sloppy mutualadmiration session the titans did n't play together but the rolling stones could n't resist playing mr dylan s like a rolling stone where are the slicker pop careerists who always quibbled that mr dylan s voice was too raw , mr morrison was too erratic and the rolling stones , for all their showmanship , made music that was full of loose ends \? and where are the experts who thought that popular music was all a matter of love songs and escapism \? they must be retired or playing lounges somewhere maybe they 're back at their day jobs , or working for record companies on wednesday night , the rolling stones sang about capital punishment , slavery and lucifer mr dylan took up morality , mortality and fate , while mr morrison pondered betrayal and a private search for meaning context has shifted inexorably on the old songs to hear the stones' audience , paying up to 300 a ticket , gleefully singing along on like a rolling stone \( a song about having no direction home and nothing to lose \) was to hear affluent boomers nostalgic for a life none of them would go back to sympathy for the devil is a rhythm workout now , not an incitement to mayhem mick jagger , who always played at being a satyr in songs like tumbling dice , now plays at being mick jagger playing a satyr , though still with boundless energy mr dylan s songs are less tied to a youthful persona , and , as the years have shown , reveal new perspectives every time through singing old songs , mr dylan s voice was more worn yet less harsh than it was in the 60 s and when he sang the observations of like a rolling stone or just like a woman , which once were cutting , the songs were now purged of spite , as if time had turned bitterness into resigned compassion for the 60 s icons , the old forms of blues , country and soul constantly renew themselves there s always room for variation on wednesday night at the garden a mere 18 , 000 seats compared to the stadiums the stones are touring mr jagger announced , it s a real intimate venue for us , and the band actually treated the show that way freed of the video cues and effects of its stadium shows , it changed its sets , pulled out unexpected songs like \( in saturday s show \) when the whip comes down and all down the line , and tried out songs from its new album , knowing that the string of solid riff songs at the end of the set would satisfy the fans mr morrison , never much concerned with crowd pleasing , used the same strategy , working through recent songs he cares about before winding up with older hits like domino and tupelo honey and mr dylan , whose new album time out of mind \( columbia \) stands with his best work ever , tore into his new songs , making them bleak and stoic and rowdy it mattered not at all that , through the weekend at the garden , only mr morrison hit more notes precisely on key than the average karaoke singer , or that both the rolling stones and mr dylan s band sometimes got their guitar chords tangled in fact , that was precisely the point the music was made to be roughed up and transformed not that any of these old hands came unprepared they had worked out basic arrangements mr morrison with meticulous vamps out of soul and jazz and rhythmandblues , mr dylan with roadhouse blues and casual mariachi country , the stones with keith richards s indelible guitar riffs and charlie watts s unswerving beat but the pleasure that they took in the songs and delivered to the audience was in how much leeway they enjoyed why memorize something , and deliver it like a jukebox , when it s easier to make up something new on the spot \? ron wood of the stones has perfected rhythmguitar parts that do n't interfere with his cigarette habit as he strolls around the stage mr richards communed with his guitar throughout the set , plucking his chuck berry licks or power chords or blues licks with new subtleties each time around and tracing their wakes in the air mr dylan , with his voice cracked and haggard , kept resyncopating his songs' tag lines a million miles from you in one verse , a million miles from you in another and mr morrison , with direct and indirect homages to ray charles , rushed some lines with gruff vehemence , then leaned into others with a sustained ache he kept his band alert by cuing stops and crescendos at whim his group included a backup singer , brian kennedy , who answered him in a sweet , wimpy high tenor , like the disciples who sing alongside master raga singers , learning in public it was as if mr morrison were demonstrating how sentimental his songs could become without his own unruly delivery the old pop professionalism was n't exactly overthrown by rockandroll at the rockandroll hall of fame ceremony last monday night , the eagles , a quintessentially 70 s band of former studio musicians , strove to play a notefornote imitation of their recording of hotel california , shying away from improvisation even in the guitar solos mr dylan , mr morrison and the stones , now all in their 50 s , are n't so timid wheezy and gruff but not jaded with music , they insist on personal obsessions and private satisfactions on friday night , mr morrison sang rain check from his 1995 album days like this \( polydor \) i do n't fade away unless i choose , he insisted it was a musical instruction to his band , which promptly quieted down but it was also a proclamation that he , along with his peers , was too cranky to stop now photo the rolling stones onstage , from left , ron wood , mick jagger and charlie watts \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
trenton the governor s official residence is in princeton the new jersey legislative correspondents' club holds its annual banquet in east brunswick the trenton thunder baseball team puts up visiting teams at the mcintosh inn in lawrenceville these are tough facts for a city trying to behave like a state capital they are tough for a city merely trying to behave like a city and as trenton begins to peek out from the scaffolding that has scarred its capital district over years of state renovation projects , it is trying not to hope too hard after all , in personal income levels , trenton ranks between newark and elizabeth the sat scores at trenton high place it in the bottom tenth of new jersey schools trenton has no big corporate cheerleader , especially since the state has more workers here than the next 50 employers combined the only downtown coffee house closes at 4 pm , and the last bookstore left town more than a year ago but trenton is being tantalized by the prospect of what it fears is too much to ask a real hotel , the city s first since 1985 , with a convention center attached , that is supposed to rise behind the state house the financing of the 45 million project is expected to be in place before the end of the year and with this lined up , the city can perhaps start living in its dreamedof future as a center of tourism and entertainment already , some goodies are in hand , like the lavishly restored trenton war memorial building , home of the greater trenton symphony , scheduled to reopen next month , and the baseball park , successful beyond all expectations , which opened in 1994 and others , like a hockey and basketball arena on the old roebling steel yards , are under construction the building spree is a big pitch forward for a city that has learned to live without a movie theater or a department store trenton s most ardent promoters are keeping their optimism to modest levels it closes at 6 o'clock , mayor douglas h palmer volunteered within seconds of sitting down for an interview there s no other capital city in america that does n't have a hotel i would like to see us be a capital like other state capitals many acknowledge that trenton is struggling against relentless suburbanization in what many think is a state suburbed and exurbed beyond reason we 're not going to displace suburbia as a center of retail and office space , said alan mallach , director of the city s department of housing and development we 're not going to become a workingclass bedroom community for route 1 this is not just a collection of affordable housing units it s a small city the question is , what are we here for \? if trenton is here to serve as a showcase of the state s history and government , said sally lane , director of the convention and visitors bureau , it could use a great deal of help ms lane greets many tourists in the bureau s stone building behind the state house which has no visitors center and when they compare trenton with other state capitals , she said , most of them are not very flattering you cannot project an image until you have a selfimage , she continued , and new jersey is way behind on that it s partly a matter of state pride , and then of marketing more action in the revolution took place in new jersey than in virginia but people do n't know that still , while allowing that hers is the only convention and visitors bureau she knows of that has no hotel to offer , ms lane , like the city s political leaders , talks confidently about trenton as a potential center for heritage tourism , cultural events and entertainment and she sees markets everywhere in the 275 , 000 people a year who visit the state museum , the 400 , 000 who attend trenton thunder games , even the suburbanites who come here for jury duty \( between the state and federal and county courts , that s a serious audience , she said \) suburbanites are already subsidizing trenton , which gets much of its revenue from the state and the suburbs are where the money is while trenton s median household income is 25 , 719 , ewing township s is 43 , 191 , lawrence township s 51 , 035 and hopewell s 65 , 522 robert d prunetti , the mercer county executive who is from trenton s chambersburg section he now lives in ewing township said he was constantly trying to convince suburbanites that they could expect dividends from every dollar of capital put into trenton mr prunetti s own favorite generator of revenue is sports when a group of local investors secured a minor league baseball franchise in the early 1990 s and looked for a publicly financed stadium , the city could not offer one the county could , though , by justifying the use of public funds for redevelopment of the delaware river waterfront and the mercer county waterfront park , home of the trenton thunder , was built even people who thought that baseball was a good idea thought i was absolutely crazy to put a stadium in the city of trenton , mr prunetti said but within 30 minutes of trenton there are 3 million people we had never looked at trenton as being the center of a huge market area people will come , obviously
a distinct chill emanates from the hottest show on broadway the blue room , the david hare play that new yorkers would seemingly sacrifice their firstborn to get into , opened last night at the cort theater for a 12week run with an advance sale topping 4 million and all but the tiniest percentage of its tickets spoken for how , really , could it have been otherwise , with its promised catnip cocktail of sex , culture and celebrity \? not to mention such drumbeating phenomena as last week s newsweek cover , with the show s star , nicole kidman , in a sultrierthanthou pose , and drooling advance notices from london , where the production originated one phrase , from a review in the daily telegraph of london , has already attached itself to the show like a sandwich board pure theatrical viagra yet those who take their seats expecting a highbrow equivalent of a blue movie \( remember emmanuelle \? \) may wind up donning their overcoats blue , in mr hare s reworking of la ronde , arthur schnitzler s fabled portrait of love as an erotic relay race in turnofthecentury vienna , is a cool color , a shivermaking shade signifying , if not exactly nothing , then the loneliness , emptiness and futility of human encounters blue is what you see , in the words of a song in the play , when you step aside from life and realize that the earth looks kind of circular and hollow accordingly , the metaphoric room of the title , given fluidly changing life by the set designer mark thompson , has no need of an asbestos lining the carnal couplings among the play s 10 characters , all dexterously played by ms kidman , the australianborn movie star , and the english stage actor iain glen , ignite a few ephemeral sparks but no roaring flames each coital vignette ends in an exasperated but philosophical shrug in the soulless neon glow of hugh vanstone s lighting a shrug , and an occasional worldly chuckle , is pretty much all that the blue room elicits as staged by sam mendes , the fastrising director behind the hit revival of cabaret , this 100minute , intermissionless evening is a deft , efficient and sometimes amusing piece of work its thematic thrust is so selfevident , and so familiar , as to preclude lively posttheater debate , and it does n't stir you emotionally the show is best appreciated as a rangestretching exercise for actors it is not unlike a darker version of neil simon s comedies set in a single hotel suite that one of the performers is ms kidman , the wife of tom cruise and the star of the films practical magic and \( most memorably \) to die for , has much to do , of course , with what has made the blue room a mustsee event theater ghouls who thrive on watching big stars from another medium stumble onstage have nothing to dine out on here ms kidman gives a winningly accomplished performance , shifting accents and personae with an assured agility that never stoops to showing off or grandstanding it is also a performance that obviates prurience , despite the fact that she often wears very little and at one point , only briefly , nothing at all \( and yes , as one of mr glen s characters observes , feasting on the vision of the nude ms kidman , she has nothing at all to be ashamed of \) her roles range from a cockney streetwalker to a continental au pair girl , from a teenage american model to a grande dame of the theater her comic timing is effortless , and she provides the evening with its biggest laugh that comes when the cokedout model responds to a lover s question as to whether his particular brand of sexual stimulation satisfies her her dazed answer i do n't know what you 're doing she also generates the play s only glimmers of real pathos , letting her face fleetingly betray an irritation that shades into despair when her characters realize that the expectation of sex is as good as sex gets it would have been better on the bench , says the prostitute , after a brusque copulation on a riverside quay , with a mixture of defiance and forlornness that , of course , is mr hare s main point , that sex would always have been better somewhere else , at some other time , with another person erotic satisfaction is a chimera , the elusive quarry of an eternal and fruitless hunt the male characters , being more intellectual than the women here , give fuller voice to this poignant if less than original theory , especially the foppish , selfinfatuated playwright and the wistful , intellectual aristocrat of the concluding scenes mr glen has the harder row to hoe of the two stars , since the men of the blue room tend to be blind and fatuous , swaggering macho jokes with little redeeming selfconsciousness but this actor , who leaned toward caricature when i saw him in london , has definitely improved , modulating his performance in welcome ways there s little depth in any of his portrayals , but that may be built into the quicksketch nature of the play like ms kidman , he is comely and willowy , and he gamely performs an adroit cartwheel in the altogether
when george young was general manager of the giants , he took his share of criticism from some of his draft picks to the coaches he hired , his decisions always prompted someone to take shots at him yet young persevered because he stayed true to what he believed , and in the end , most of the time , he was proved right but young , now a vice president with the national football league , is discovering that criticism does not stop when you get a promotion especially when it comes to the highly volatile issue of race and coaching in professional football young is overseeing the career development symposium for nfl coaches that will be conducted today at the owners' meetings in miami almost all of the nfl s head coaches and coordinators will attend as well as three noncoordinator assistant coaches from each team that is about 200 coaches in all though the nfl says the seminar is not specifically for black assistant coaches , the fact is that twothirds of the noncoordinator assistants invited are black the idea for the seminar arose because of the lack of representation of blacks among the coaching ranks the nfl was publicly embarrassed when , two years ago , there were 11 headcoaching vacancies and no blacks were interviewed or hired four new head coaches have been named in the current off season , and again none of them have been black roughly 60 percent of nfl players are black , but as of now there are only three black head coaches tony dungy of tampa bay , dennis green of minnesota and ray rhodes of philadelphia dungy was the last one hired , in january 1996 young has put together an eightman panel that will speak to the coaches and , in theory , begin to bridge some of the social and mechanical problems that have exacerbated this issue the panelists include the former san francisco 49ers coach bill walsh , who will speak on how to interview for a headcoaching job giants coach jim fassel , who will talk on dealing with the news media the former buffalo coach marv levy , on keeping life in perspective throughout a football coaching career tony dungy , reflecting on the lessons he has learned as a head coach , and the former texas coach john mackovic , on college coaching this is the first time in the history of professional sports that such a seminar has ever been attempted it s historic , and i think most coaches look at this as a chance for networking opportunities , said ray anderson , the agent for several prominent black coaches , including green an important part of the effort will come tonight , after the seminar , when the assistants will meet with the league s owners at a cocktail party for an informal networking session black coaches have often complained that white coaches have an automatic advantage when it comes to headcoaching jobs because owners feel more comfortable socializing with them the idea is to familiarize black coaches with white owners and help cut down on that potential bias interviews with a halfdozen black assistant coaches in the last few weeks revealed a consensus of what their problems are with the seminar the makeup of the panel dungy is the only black on the eightman panel , and that infuriated some black coaches the league attempted to add stanford coach tyrone willingham , who is black , but he had a scheduling conflict is he the only black coach out there \? asked one black assistant who insisted on anonymity how about finding a black agent or a black financial expert to put on the panel \? that panel is pretty white the cocktail party coordinators are meeting with the owners at around 7 pm followed by noncoordinator assistant coaches one hour later since most coordinators are white and the majority of noncoordinator assistants who will be attending the seminar are black , black assistants say they feel as if they are secondclass citizens because they are meeting with the owners second young said it was impractical to have about 200 coaches and 30 owners jammed into one room at the same time and the only way to have such a meeting was to divide the two groups into coordinators and noncoordinator assistants since owners usually hire coordinators , young said , it only makes sense to have them meet with the owners first young added that while most coordinators are white , several prominent black coordinators , like the offensive coordinators jimmy raye from kansas city and sherman lewis from green bay , are among those who will meet with the owners the coaches are also concerned about what they believe is age discrimination according to the national football league coaches association , of the 400 assistant coaches in the league only 7 were 60 or older in 1997 because of their concerns , both black and white coaches are considering a nonconfrontational form of protest around the beginning of the seminar , according to some coaches familiar with the plan they said the plan called for coaches to gather en masse at about 8 15 am , purposely 15 minutes late , then enter the seminar at the same time the idea \? coaches say it is to show they are unified on critical issues affecting them whether or not it happens remains to be seen meanwhile , many coaches and league executives expect the seminar to go well , especially young , who knows he ca n't make everyone happy if you are worried about people taking shots at you , then you had better not step up to the plate , young said

s body was found floating off a pier along the brooklyn waterfront lawrence r andrews jr was found dead in the waters off shore road in bay ridge , near the entrance to the narrows , at 7 am yesterday , said officer sonia oquendo , a police spokeswoman the cause of his death was drowning , and mr andrews had apparently been in the water since his disappearance , said ellen borakove , a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner s office although the last witnesses to see mr andrews had said that he appeared to be drunk , the manner of his death whether it was an accident , suicide or homicide

like many bridestobe , bridget griffin spent a whole year planning the details of her wedding and when it came to the entertainment , ms griffin , 33 , a marketing executive from nanuet , ny , knew exactly what she wanted a fivepiece orchestra led by paul rich , a 20something stockbroker and singer who promised to deliver a lively mix of pop hits , rhythmandblues and disco classics instead , when ms griffin and her new husband , michel amiel , strolled into their wedding reception last march , they found that the rockin' mr rich had been replaced by tony avena , a 40something crooner who sings far more burt bacharach than celine dion mr rich , it turns out , had quit the band a week earlier rather than upset the bride , the band , the frank terris orchestra of yonkers , said it was decided to send mr avena instead it was the old bait and switch , said ms griffin , who sued the company and got back half of the 3 , 275 she had spent on the band at least they could have given me a choice judge thomas dickerson of yonkers city court agreed the magic that bridget and michel expected paul rich to bring to their wedding reception was noticeably absent , he wrote in his decision , which also awarded ms griffin 500 in punitive damages in his ruling , judge dickerson cited the film the wedding singer and dozens of court cases involving wedding disasters , including a bridesmaid hurt in a human wheelbarrow race and a handicapped guest injured while attempting to dance the chacha weddings are unique events , at least the first time around , the judge said in an interview yesterday you 're talking about a highly charged , emotional event , and when you get a different singer than the one you expected , it puts a damper on things during her reception , ms griffin said she was so upset by the replacement singer that she had to fight back tears mr avena , she said , sang too many older , frank sinatratype tunes , for her taste , although none of the guests complained they probably thought i was being emotional because i had just gotten married , she said kathleen caucci , a sales representative for the frank terris orchestra , disagreed that mr avena s performance was lacking tony can get anyone out on the dance floor , she said from what i heard , he did a wonderful job joseph giaramita , a lawyer representing the orchestra , hired mr avena for his own wedding several years ago he 'll do anything you want , mr giaramita said , from the macarena to the chicken dance
marvin e wolfgang , who found new ways of looking at and thinking about crime and criminals , died on sunday at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia he was 73 and a professor of criminology at penn and the president of the american academy of political and social science the cause was pancreatic cancer , the university said professor wolfgang , a philadelphia resident , was acknowledged in 1994 by the british journal of criminology as the most influential criminologist in the englishspeaking world he expanded the field of criminology by introducing and perfecting a methodology in which great masses of data like arrest records are analyzed over years to discern patterns of violence and crime through such longitudinal studies , now common in social sciences beyond criminology , he was able to portray criminal behavior in specific ways , examining subjects like the scale of juvenile delinquency , the relations of murderers and their victims and the extent of racial imbalances in sentencing for much of this century , academic criminology had concerned itself almost exclusively with psychological studies of the criminal mind and the amassing of anecdotal material that emphasis was irrevocably altered in 1958 when mr wolfgang produced a study , patterns of criminal homicide , a deep analysis of 588 philadelphia murders with that work professor wolfgang virtually defined modern criminology , said richard rosenfeld , a professor of criminology at the university of missouri mr rosenfeld is serving as editor of a forthcoming edition of the journal of criminal homicide that is dedicated to mr wolfgang to mark the 40th anniversary of his work one of the more significant findings in that study was that 150 of the philadelphia murders were what mr wolfgang termed , in the neutral language of sociologists , victimprecipitated homicides cases in which the eventual victim was the first one in the homicide drama to use physical force he spelled it out even more clearly with a typical example a drunken husband , beating his wife in their kitchen , gave her a butcher knife and dared her to use it on him she claimed that if he would strike her once more , she would use the knife , whereupon he slapped her in the face and she fatally stabbed him at the time , terms like spouse abuse were unknown , and mr wolfgang did not use it but with the evidence he had found from the police reports , he was able to define the shape and determine the scale of a not uncommon form of violence that few if any before him had studied in detail findings of a similar magnitude emerged from another remarkable longitudinal study , delinquency in a birth cohort , which was published in 1972 and is generally regarded as professor wolfgang s crowning scholarly achievement for this study , which , like all his work , was written by hand with a pen , mr wolfgang obtained from schools in philadelphia the names of 10 , 000 boys who were born in 1945 after 1963 , when the boys turned 18 , he and his team of researchers pored through police and court records to determine how many of the boys had police records they found that 3 , 400 of the boys , or just over onethird , had records by the time they were 18 he also determined that it was the youths whose records showed five or more offenses who together accounted for 52 percent of all offenses recorded in the study , and that this group amounted to only 6 percent of the total mr wolfgang s conclusion that a few chronic offending juveniles account for a disproportionate amount of crime has strongly influenced legislative bodies and criminal justice policy makers around the world at the time of his death professor wolfgang was working on a 10year longitudinal study of juvenile delinquency in china in conjunction with chinese officials neil weiner , once his student and now a senior research associate at the center for the study of youth policy at penn , said mr wolfgang was often asked to testify in courts and before legislative commissions he routinely responded to such requests , but , in seeming contradiction , he rarely laid out policy recommendations , whether specific or general such things he left to others to infer from his dispassionate and objective studies however dispassionate was the form of his testimony , its content was sufficiently stirring to provoke any number of mailed threats we kept a folder of these loony letters , said esther lafair , who had been mr wolfgang s secretary for 27 years she said the letters came in whenever he offered reasons that the death penalty should not be used or how the distribution of handguns should be curbed mr wolfgang was proud that his research findings were used in the supreme court s decision in furman v georgia , which held in 1972 that the death penalty as then applied by states was unconstitutional although none of mr wolfgang s colleagues could say how or why he first turned his attention to criminology , ms lafair said she thought his decision had much to do with the violence he had witnessed as a soldier in italy in world war ii marvin eugene wolfgang was born on nov 14 , 1924 , in millersburg , pa after his service in world war ii , he received a bachelor s degree from dickinson college and completed his graduate work at penn he served on many commissions , and was director of research for the presidential commission on the causes and prevention of violence in 1968 he received dozens of fellowships and prizes , among them two guggenheim awards mr wolfgang is survived by his wife , lenora , a professor of french at lehigh university two daughters , karen w swenson of bronxville , ny , and nina wolfgang of philadelphia a sister , patricia w mignogna of lynchburg , va , and two grandchildren photo marvin e wolfgang
washington , jan 17 after five years of scandalous rumors and heated court fighting , president clinton journeyed a block from the white house today to face paula corbin jones and defend himself under oath against her allegations of sexual misconduct on an otherwise quiet day in the idle heart of the capital , a throng of reporters and photographers waited in the streets outside as the president spent six hours in his attorney s office being privately questioned by lawyers for ms jones intent on reviewing his sexual history and proving him a reckless philanderer after the intense session , the president departed 15 minutes before ms jones , offering a brief wave from his limousine and ending a long day that was interrupted for a brief lunch break none of the principals made any comment on the proceeding , in line with a court gag order within minutes , white house officials were insisting that the president , seeming far from shaken , had quickly returned to the oval office to check on the asian fiscal crisis and on a daylong staff meeting about his state of the union speech later this month ms jones s representatives made an equal effort to reflect equilibrium , pointedly noting that they would celebrate tonight over dinner the fact that they had finally forced mr clinton to face their detailed , decidedly unfriendly questions about his private life he was the first sitting president in history to have to submit as a defendant in a civil court challenge , and ms jones s team planned to have four different lawyers fanning out to the sunday morning political television shows to offer comment the president s videotaped deposition featured ms jones listening in close attendance and federal judge susan webber wright available to settle disputes between the legal teams in the wideranging discovery step of the civil damage suit the president fielded the questions in the 11thfloor office of his lawyer , robert s bennett , overlooking the white house from the corner of pennsylvania avenue and 15th street the site was chosen by the president s advisers to deny ms jones the dramatic backdrop of the white house grounds she wants to look across the table and look him right in the eye , ms jones s spokeswoman , susan carpentermcmillan , had declared as the litigants arrived separately in the morning , their way cleared by bombsniffing dogs the president was fully prepared for a barrage of inflammatory questions about his sexual history , mr bennett said and mr clinton was hardly disappointed , according to sketchy , unofficial reports after the deposition mr bennett had emphasized that the president was ready to flatly deny ms jones s accusation that on may 8 , 1991 , when he was governor of arkansas and she was a state worker , he summoned her to a hotel room in little rock , exposed himself and demanded oral sex the deposition , which was ordered sealed pending a trial scheduled in arkansas in may , was mr clinton s first lengthy response to the allegations and , if he chooses , his final word under the court procedures , mr clinton cannot be compelled to testify in open court by ms jones s lawyers , but he has the option to appear if the issue goes to trial ms jones maintained a smile upon arrival by taxi until she was mobbed by photographers who knocked one another down in their frenzy her look turned wideeyed and anxious , and she retreated to the lobby , shielded by ms mcmillan she s very upbeat , not nervous , ms mcmillan insisted she said a prayer this morning the president traveled by limousine from the white house , entering his lawyer s building at 10 20 am through a tightly secured garage entrance he could be briefly glimpsed staring out from the limousine , which displayed none of the fender flags that mark his usual motorcade travels when he is on official business mr clinton was questioned by donovan campbell jr of dallas , ms jones s chief attorney , and a team of assistants who have spent the past six months searching out details of mr clinton s sex life and liaisons the lawsuit , scheduled to go to trial on may 27 in little rock , has provided a sensational , embarrassing aside to the normal business of mr clinton s presidency as ms jones s complaint secured a date on the court calendar , mr clinton s defenders have had to deal increasingly with its details , even to the point of mr bennett s rebutting ms jones s contention that she can recall distinguishing marks in the president s genital area the bizarre case has seen lawyers for both sides scouring the two principals' past , deposing witnesses for evidence of sexual licentiousness if the suit is not settled , which now seems less likely , or dismissed by the court , a civil jury of 12 members will hear the issue a unanimous decision in ms jones s favor would be required for her to prevail the scene outside the law office during the deposition had a locustlike buzz , with dozens of camera tripods arranged in picket lines and tall pole antennas reaching up toward the roof of the treasury building , broadcasting the scene live to the nation and beyond what did she have for breakfast \? a reporter desperately shouted at ms mcmillan , who grew furious at the crush of news media ms mcmillan declined all discussion of the substance of the case , including morning reports that mr clinton would reaffirm his denial of the sexual harassment charge but would not take direct issue with an arkansas state trooper who reputedly says he escorted a willing ms jones to the alleged 1991 hotel encounter mr clinton maintains that he has no recollection of ever meeting ms jones public interest , which has increased with ms jones s progress through the courts , is difficult to assess the latest new york times cbs news poll presents a mixed reading , with 59 percent of those polled deciding that the president is mostly telling the truth but is hiding something , and 52 percent answering , in response to a separate question , that ms jones is mostly telling the truth but is hiding something mr clinton had sought to delay the suit , which was filed in 1994 , until after his presidency ends he cited the press of responsibility as the nation s leader but the supreme court ruled unanimously last may that a sitting president can be sued for actions outside the scope of his official duties the court found that neither the constitution nor public policy justified the delay mr clinton sought ms jones sued initially for 700 , 000 in damages , contending that mr clinton used his powers as arkansas governor to violate her civil rights she complained that after rejecting mr clinton s advances , she was punished by being denied promotion by the state and suffering emotional stress and character defamation the court dropped the defamation charge but allowed the rest of the suit to go forward mr bennett has repeatedly denied the charge that the president propositioned ms jones , 31 , and he contends that the lawsuit is politically driven and underwritten by rightwing opponents of mr clinton out to hurt the president at several points in the past , the possibility of a cash settlement was discussed by the lawyers , with some observers speculating it could come in the last minutes before deposition , perhaps , or even before the trial s opening but mr bennett maintains this is impossible because of ms jones s insistence on a public apology from mr clinton white house strategists maintain that the recording of the deposition , with its potential for being leaked beyond the bounds of court strictures , makes it more likely now that the sensational confrontation will go to public trial for settlement photos paula corbin jones and her husband , stephen , arriving for the

for several years , mattson technology inc in fremont , calif , embodied the silicon valley dream sales tripled from one year to the next when the company s stock was first sold to the public in 1994 , about a dozen executives became millionaires one year the company took all employees and their families to lake tahoe for a christmas vacation but this year , the christmas party will probably be pot luck mattson s sales have dropped in half from their peak last year one round of layoffs at the 400employee company has occurred and another is in the works and the company s stock , which traded above 16 in july 1997 , has fallen to 5375 , making employee stock options worthless mattson s travails come from across the sea twothirds of its sales it makes milliondollar machines used in manufacturing computer chips are to semiconductor factories in asia , which have cut back sharply on their spending in the face of asia s economic crisis it s like a faucet , said brad mattson , the company s president they just turned off the spigot mattson is perhaps an extreme case but it is not alone silicon valley , the nation s cauldron of innovation , has suddenly been hit by a onetwo punch from forces originating thousands of miles away the asian economic crisis , which began in july 1997 , has slowed exports , causing a cascade of layoffs and the stock market volatility has battered technology company shares , making it harder for young companies to raise money and crimping the spending of workers whose sense of wealth is tied to the stock options that are considered a birthright in silicon valley the double blow has tempered the exuberance of a region that has witnessed an explosion of growth , prosperity and extravagance in the last few years , a region in which 20something internet millionaires routinely plunked down cash for fancy cars and close to 1 million even for a relatively plain threebedroom house panic has not yet set in , but reality has , said paul saffo , an analyst at the institute for the future , a silicon valley research center the same forces are at work elsewhere , of course , but few parts of the country are as tied to both asia and the stock market as is this area is and fewer are more important to the nation s competitiveness so far , the damage has been slight the unemployment rate in santa clara county , which encompasses san jose and much of silicon valley , has climbed in recent months but was still an enviable 37 percent in september , well below the 69 percent rate in 1992 after cutbacks by military contractors the expensive restaurants that have sprung up amid the burger joints near stanford university are still bustling but milliondollar homes are no longer selling at the same frenzied pace and vacancies are starting to grow in the office real estate market the electronics and computer industries ranked first and second nationwide in terms of the number of job cuts announced this year , according to challenger , gray christmas , a chicagobased outplacement firm there is this noticeable crispness in the air , and not just because it s fall , said betsy collard , director of strategic development at the career action center in cupertino , calif , which counsels those seeking new jobs the milken institute , a nonprofit economic research organization in santa monica , calif , forecasts that the san jose area could experience a recession if the asian crisis worsens san jose surged ahead of new york and detroit in the last few years to become the largest exporter among metropolitan areas , and nearly half of those exports go to east asia , according to the milken report no american city is as dependent on asian exports for income as is san jose but the impacts of the asian crisis vary greatly the biggest has been on companies that like mattson , make the machinery used to manufacture chips applied materials , the giant of this business , has cut about one quarter of its work force , or 4 , 000 jobs , this year companies that make the chips themselves are also ailing , not only because of asia s slump but because of its previous boom , when companies there built so many factories they caused a glut that depressed semiconductor prices the semiconductor business is known for its steep up and down cycles but , i 've been in the business since 1957 and this is the worst one , said alfred j stein , chief executive of vlsi technology in san jose though some chip companies and analysts see signs of an upturn , the pain is not over yet the lsi logic corporation , in milpitas , calif , recently announced a 17 percent reduction in its work force still , some economists say the impact of the asian crisis has not been as big as expected for california as a whole , increased exports to canada , mexico and europe have helped offset a decline in shipments to asia another tempering factor is that the biggest job growth now comes not from silicon chip manufacturing , the business that gave the region its nickname , but from smaller companies in newer fields like the internet and computer software , which have less exposure to asia
the sky was brilliant blue and the water had a silver sheen of glare i sat on my ninefoot surfboard and waited for one of the waves that give long island s most famous surfing spot , ditch plains in montauk , the reputation for making even average surf seem perfect montauk s shoreline , on the tip of the south fork , is scalloped its numerous coves make surfing ideal from the lighthouse , at long island s most easterly point , west to ditch plains ditch plains itself is a point break , meaning the waves start breaking crisply from a geographic outcropping \( in this case , a grouping of glacial boulders \) and wrap into a cove the rocky reef shapes and forms all but the largest surf generated by hurricanes , northeasters and other storms , making for ideal surfing conditions on a recent sunday , i went to ditch plains in part because it can also perform an almost contrary function producing modest , ridable waves out of the doldrums of a hot sunny season , a beachgoer s bounty but a surfer s bummer until this week s heavy surf , courtesy of hurricane bonnie , local surfers were calling this the summer of no waves now there are waves aplenty because of the tropical storm weather whose heavy surf can present an exciting challenge or a serious danger to even experienced surfers veterans usually proceed with caution into turbulent waters but on this calmer day , there i was , waterborne among 30 surfers , wetsuitless and warmed by the sun , hoping to eke out a good wave from the tranquil atlantic suddenly , such a wave crested before me it had a defined peak and a long wall of surging shiny water i pivoted the board around , lay down and paddled hard to match the wave s speed i jumped to my feet and strode the board as it skimmed down the wall of water the wave broke behind me , creating a surge of roaring white water and i rode it into the shallow water until the board s underside fins scraped the rock bottom this was the way i remembered ditch plains it never changes , which is one reason surfers have flocked there for over three decades , and why i returned this summer it was 1976 when , flush with earnings from washing dishes at an elks club in the midwest , i stepped into an aframe surf shop in montauk , which in my eyes was the capital of east coast surfing , the only place that could be mentioned among malibu and huntington beach , the california surfing towns i came clean with the taciturn , wildhaired owner of the shop , admitting i was a gremmie a beginner in a sport that eats its young could he recommend a board \? he pulled out a narrow , aquagreen board about a foot longer than i was tall i bought it for 150 , with just enough left from my savings for a leash \( to attach board to ankle \) and three bars of surf wax \( to keep feet attached to board \) i was ready to start my surfing career on ditch plains road i passed spartan cottages whose porches were littered with surfboards and wet suits , and pulled into the legendary surf spot s tiny parking lot another weathered surfer stood on the bed of his pickup , scanning the horizon , checking out the surf i proudly showed him my glimmering new board he was unimpressed where s your wet suit \? did n't get one , i said he looked at me with pity that water s 62 degrees you should 've spent your money on a good wet suit and found an old , cheap board , he said , adding something about how i 'd freeze off a certain part of my anatomy thus began my surfing education you do n't learn to surf in a classroom , and teachers are few most surfers , by necessity , are selftaught it s hard , for example , to meet at a specified hour because surfing is subject to the capriciousness of wind , weather and waves much of the time you 're alone , or with a small group of strangers while surfing solo is not recommended , most experienced surfers are by necessity strong swimmers and are aware of their limits , of which the ocean constantly reminds them so much of surfing s reward comes with experience knowing how to duckdive the nose of the board under an oncoming wave , where the best waves in the water are breaking , when to turn the board around and start paddling to catch the wave , how to maneuver the board there are few shortcuts unlike skiing , where even a novice can have fun , surfing imparts a steep learning curve a beginner needs two things a long board , which is easy to paddle and offers stability when standing , and patience part of the fun lies in judging a wave perfectly you turn at precisely the right time to start paddling you feel the surge of the wave picking up your board , your legs come under you in a graceful crouch position and you 're sliding down the curved glass of a wave s arc , racing ahead of the frothy whitewater you 're no longer a gremmie suddenly , you 're hooked twentytwo years later i returned to ditch plains and , surprisingly , little had changed the beach is narrower like most of eastern long island , its shoreline was badly eroded by northeasters last winter the cliffs are more gouged to get from the parking area to some parts of the beach requires stepping across the boulders of a stormbeaten jetty
trenton on the day after governor whitman was nearly defeated for reelection last fall , she stood before a dozen television cameras and reiterated her campaign promises to address voters' top two concerns auto insurance rates and property taxes the legislature , after much stumbling and debate , last spring adopted a plan that promises to lower auto insurance rates and now , finally , property taxes are on the table for discussion a 24member commission , appointed by the governor in december , is expected to make its recommendations public next week so what can new jersey s overburdened property taxpayers expect \? well , no one should expect a property tax bill to plummet at the same time , no one needs to worry that this commission will recommend major statewide tax increases the commission is expected to come up with three dozen recommendations , whitman administration officials say , but they concede that none of the recommendations could be described as a magic bullet that is because the commission received early instructions from governor whitman do not even think about making recommendations that would increase statewide taxes or the state s overall tax burden and in case mrs whitman was ever tempted to change her mind , she needed only to look at the way voters responded to former governor jim florio s approach to property taxes he increased the income tax rate to help pay for an increase in state aid for education , and voters threw him out of office yet most experts say the only way to reduce property taxes significantly in new jersey is to increase state assistance for public education significantly that is because the cost of public schools makes up the biggest portion of property tax bills the state pays only 40 percent of the cost of public education , sticking local taxpayers with the rest the national average of what states pay toward public education is 50 percent complicating the picture is the fact that new jersey spends more on education per pupil than any other state the report is also expected to note the high price new jerseyans pay for their insistence on home rule a hundred years ago , there were 270 municipalities in new jersey today , there are 566 cities and towns taxpayers are also paying for 21 counties , 188 fire districts and 611 school districts and taxpayers in new jersey have also come to expect more municipal services than residents in other states do in many states , residents pay a private contractor for trash pickup in new jersey , tax dollars cover trash pickup in most towns and in tiny essex fells , a borough of 2 , 139 people in essex county , you do n't even have to drag your trash cans to the curb the local department of sanitation collects them from the rear of your home so this commission hopes to generate debate among new jerseyans about exactly what municipal services they want badly enough to pay for through their property taxes , not to mention how much they really want to spend on public education the commission also hopes to help new jerseyans recognize that there is a tremendous cost to landuse decisions made weekly in borough halls and township buildings the commission is expected to point out that new residential development , once considered a way for towns to expand their property tax base , can often add to a municipality s overall tax burden some of the commission s recommendations are expected to generate controversy already , the new jersey education association , the state s largest teachers' union , is gearing up for a battle over a suggestion to place a cap on annual raises for teachers' salaries the commission is also expected to recommend a cap on annual salaries for all local government employees we would be opposed to such a move , said karen joseph , a spokeswoman for the new jersey education association first of all , there is already a cap on all school budgets in new jersey all of the contracts are negotiated by representatives of the community , and they are driven by the local economy we hope that they deal with the property tax issue itself and do not take a detour that places blame or responsibility on the shoulders of public employees property taxes , like auto insurance rates , have bedeviled one new jersey governor after another it is a problem that has always been around new jersey politics , said stephen salmore , a republican political consultant but i am not convinced that the public blames the governor for it not , that is , until governors try to do something about it voters tossed former governor william t cahill out of office after he recommended a statewide property tax and mr florio was also badly punished by the voters for his efforts to lower property tax rates i have repeatedly asked , in polls , questions about taxes , said mr salmore , a coauthor of the newly revised book government and politics of new jersey suburban politics comes of age everyone believes that their taxes are going up , whether they are or not and then , when you ask who is responsible , most of the blame falls to the local government and the local school board well , last year voters blamed governor whitman now , the commission is likely to put most of the blame on local governments and local school districts but maybe new jerseyans need to put some of the blame on themselves photo jennifer preston
a man whose infant daughter was severely burned while living in a foster home has filed a lawsuit charging that new york city and a nonprofit foster care agency failed in its duty to care for the child the man s lawyer , bruce young , said the incident was an example of the city s failure to supervise the agencies that administer the foster care program and the failure of the foster care agencies to find safe homes the city has a duty to supervise and make sure everything is ok , mr young said the girl , edalia alonso , was 2 1 2 months old on sept 29 , 1995 , when she was severely burned while being bathed by her foster mother , mr young said the manhattan district attorney s office conducted a preliminary investigation but did not file any charges , mr young said he said the ultimate responsibility for the incident rests with the city and with lutheran social services , which has a contract with the city to place children in foster homes if there was a problem in the house it should have been rectified , mr young said if the foster mother was inattentive , she should have been replaced the city and the state also failed to notify the girl s father , jorge alonso , that he had the right to take custody of her before she went into foster care , mr young said had he been given notification of his rights , this might not have happened , he said mr young said edalia , now 3 and living with her father , had severe scars on her back and abdomen the lawsuit names the former commissioner for the city s human resources administration , which supervised the city s foster care placements until 1996 , and four other city employees the suit also names lutheran social services of metropolitan new york , two of the agency s former caseworkers and the metro north riverview houses , the owner of the building in upper manhattan where the foster mother lived the lawsuit , seeking 9 million in damages , was filed on monday , a day before the statute of limitations was to run out none of the defendants were aware of the suit when called yesterday an official with lutheran social services , who would not give his full name , referred questions to the city in 1996 , as part of an overhaul of the child welfare system , the administration for children s services took over supervision of the foster care program from human resources leonora wiener , the children s services spokeswoman , said yesterday that it was difficult for her agency to comment because the incident occurred before her organization was created mr young said that after the baby was burned , the foster mother first told investigators that the infant , who she said always cried while being bathed , had kicked the water faucet and that she did not notice that the water had grown too hot later , the foster mother , who was not named as a defendant in the suit , said she had left the baby in the sink to attend to another child , mr young said he added that there were indications during the investigation that the building s water might suddenly have become hot , scalding the baby a manager at the building said yesterday that the foster mother had left her apartment a year ago there was no answer at a number previously listed for the foster mother
trenton rarely is the career retrospective of an 80yearold artist also his virtual introduction to the public yet that is the case with two worlds , at the state museum here , which presents five decades' work by bogdan grom of englewood mr grom is something of an outsider to the gallery and museum circuit , yet since immigrating in 1957 , he has had considerable success in producing sculpture and other works for architectural situations ranging from churches and synagogues to shopping malls yet it is clear that producing monumental works for public buildings could never have given full artistic satisfaction to someone like mr grom , who is revealed here as an eclectic artist with a playfully experimental approach to forms and materials , and a penchant for an intimate mode of expression he is a man of many talents , and that fact is the basis of both the strengths and the weaknesses of his work mr grom is a native of the province surrounding trieste , the muchcontested polyglot port city that has been part of italy for most of this century he was educated in rome , venice and perugia , where his teachers included veterans of the italian futurist movement , which does not , however , seem to have had much of an impact on him the earliest works here are , on the one hand , some rather earnest landscape and figure paintings assaying various degrees of modernism in approaching their mainly pastoral subjects , and charming book illustrations , including some for translations of tom sawyer \( 1947 \) and huckleberry finn \( 1948 \) , which benefit from the artist s wittily cursive line in the mid1950 s , in a series of works executed in a batik technique of his own invention , mr grom arrived at a curious synthesis between his affinity for the spontaneity of expressive line and his fascination with painting s slower , denser accumulation of elements these works , with their stratified patterns of flat colors and vigorous drawing , can be reminiscent of popular prints mr grom continued to use this technique after arriving in the united states a 1958 view of times square , in which flashing light becomes practically disconnected from volume , is one of the rare works in which his futurist roots are conspicuous but sculpture soon captured his attention instead the examples of view here are mainly in two rather incompatible styles , neither much favored today first came a sort of lyrical abstracted figuration embodying familiar postures and gestures works like mr grom s pu dique \( 1966 \) now seem rather coy and sentimental later , without abandoning this willfully humanist mode of sculpture , mr grom also took up polychrome , planar constructions like desert flower , a new work that stands outdoors before the museum entrance although the color can be ingratiating , these works tend to be cool and a bit faceless perhaps the most powerful sculptural work here , however , falls outside both categories a small , un titled paper construction from 1975 consisting of just two superimposed layers of torn , heavy paper fixed within a wooden box by pins and held at their distance , it seems , by some bits of foam , this work is at once fragile and brutal and would not be amenable to reconstruction at a larger size , yet for that very reason somehow appears heavier and deeper than it really is this work , with an inscription indicating it was done hastily in the middle of the night , was apparently the basis for the artist s return to the twodimensional surface after two decades devoted to sculpture from it emerged a whole series of layered paper cutouts , including both unique and editioned works , some of them monochrome and others full of color in them there is a multiplicity of spaces that , through overlapping , become a field of opacities , like a forest these works in turn suggested forms which mr grom has translated into media as various as stained glass and woolen tapestries mr grom was right to have given the little untitled relief a prominence that belies its size , but the conclusions he drew from it may have been the wrong ones as the art historian john defazio remarks in the exhibition catalogue , in these works mr grom returned to pictorial space and yet the fascination of the little relief is in part that it is perfectly balanced between the pictorial and the sculptural , as well as being unified and monumental without being simple and being completely embodied in its materials the subsequent cutouts are none of those all they take from the original inspiration is a particular kind of shape that comes from tearing paper , and the idea of overlapping yet the paper is no longer torn , but cut that is , when it is a question of paper at all rather than a representation of forms similar to torn paper in other materials for all his roaming through so many artistic realms , mr grom has apparently always thought more like a designer than like an artist the paradox here is that while he is clearly fascinated by materials and techniques of all kinds , which he has used quite inventively from the early batik paintings onward , these usually seem to be applied to a preconceived idea or image fundamentally indifferent to its physical embodiment mr grom has always been full of ideas , but only when they inhere in his materials , rather than being applied to a subject , do they blossom two worlds new jersey state museum 205 west state street , trenton the work of bogdan grom , 1938 to 1998 through dec 27 hours tuesdays through saturdays , 9 am

the surprise economics lesson came straight from home in the form of panicked telephone calls and televised images of the sagging , dispirited faces of the rich and powerful as the won , ringgit , rupiah and baht the currencies of south korea , malaysia , indonesia and thailand fell hard over several months , students from those countries studying in the united states suddenly saw the value of bank accounts halved , parents thrown out of work , family businesses dissolved a number of students have merely toned down spending habits that had been fed by boom times back home but others are struggling to stay in the united states , where they have found a broader range of programs in technology , business , science and the arts in a less stringent teaching atmosphere than back home they are taking on two or three roommates to help pay the rent some have illegally taken jobs in restaurants and stores foreign undergraduates on student visas are not permitted to work to help pay tuition and other expenses a few never returned to class after winter break because families summoned them home , while many of those who stay fear the same fate yusung hwang , an architecture student from south korea , learned in december that his father s construction company had gone bankrupt at the height of the financial crisis mr hwang , 22 , owes the pratt institute in brooklyn 6 , 000 , he said even though pratt is allowing students to stretch out tuition payments , mr hwang said he cannot count on money from home and will leave for south korea next month unless he finds a way to pay off his debt the situation is terrible now , he said i do n't want to stop my education in less dire straits but almost as anxious , yoon nam , 22 , a communications major at new york university , has stopped buying new clothes , rarely goes to the movies and cooks her meals at home now sacrifices she says have muted the new york experience she craved my mom told me maybe i should marry somebody with a green card so i could stay here and work here , said ms nam , of south korea , unaware that the wait for a legal residency card can take several years i want to help my family back home , but i do n't want to end my dream of studying here to prevent an exodus to asia , college administrators across the country have responded with special aid and breaks on tuition payment schedules in many cases , students have until the end of the semester to pay , with no late fees it s been extraordinary , the response from local campuses , said peggy blumenthal , vice president of education services at the institute for international education , a private nonprofit group based in new york leonard pramudinatha , a 22yearold graduate business student from indonesia , got a break when the university of denver deferred indefinitely the 6 , 000 quarterly tuition payments for students from the affected countries mr pramudinatha said he had never worried about money before , but now he plans to seek money for groceries from a 20 , 000 fund that business school patrons set up to help asian students with rent and food costs god knows when this whole thing is going to get better , he said it s so scary jimmie white , a lawyer for the office of international students and scholars at the university of california in los angeles , said his office had given loans of up to 4 , 000 to about two dozen students from the affected countries he said that two graduate students one from south korea and one from japan had had to drop out of school because of money problems tied to the faltering stock and bond markets in those countries they were sad about leaving , mr white said this was a major disruption of their studies , and they had a fear that they would not be able to come back most institutions will not know the full effect of the crisis until final spring enrollment counts come in over the next few weeks most students arrived last fall with enough cash to pay their way through the spring semester , officials said but some officials worry about the fall semester , if students do n't return from summer break and new recruits ca n't find the money for study in the united states colleges are feeling the impact both in students not returning and not in the pipeline , said linda heaney , president of linden educational services , which organizes recruitment trips overseas she estimated that 200 to 250 colleges and universities actively recruit in asia , up from a handful 15 years ago we 're going to see enrollment from asia ratchet down a bit , ms heaney predicted aside from diversifying a college s student populations , foreign students also provide revenue for campuses and the cities where they are situated , contributing 7 billion to the national economy , according to the institute twothirds of the students pay their own way entirely , with the rest on scholarships provided by their governments or by corporations in their homelands , the institute said fewer than one percent receive financial aid under united states governmentsponsored plans at least two foreign governments are rolling back the number of students they sponsor in this country
new yorkers have always talked about the weather , but lately their meteorological ruminations seem to be taking on a new kind of urgency out in union square park on a recent monday , vendors in the greenmarket said they had been arguing a lot about why the weather had been so odd i think it s the pollution , the greenhouse effect , said david graves , a beekeeper who sells honey and jams anthony davis , who deals in film scripts , had another idea i do n't feel it s the greenhouse effect , he said i think it s another ice age maybe it s all the news stories about ozone and el nino that have people spooked or maybe it s simply that the weather appears to be so strange in 199495 , the city had its snowiest winter on record but last winter was the warmest on record , followed by the coolest june and that s just new york florida has had its fires , california its floods , texas its heat waves , and there have been enough twisters around the country to fill a hollywood epic people are wondering what is going on , said spencer christian , who does the weather for abc s good morning america program is it global warming \? is it the end of the world \? with all these big questions out there , it s no surprise that there has been an explosion of weather coverage on television in the last five years but while weather forecasters say they know a lot about the weather , they do n't know everything it s this mysterious quality that makes weather so fascinating my feeling is that the weather has become more central in our imaginations as the result of the world becoming more predictable , said david laskin , who wrote braving the elements the stormy history of american weather \( anchor press doubleday , 1997 \) weather is the last frontier when people have questions about the weather , they turn to newspapers , radio , the internet and television the weather channel , cnn and new york 1 deliver forecasts at regular intervals national and local news programs have been hyping weather mercilessly next month , some local cable systems will be adding msg metro , a 24hour weather and traffic station focusing on new york city add it all up and there is simply much more weather on television , said mike echert , the president of the weather channel , which is based in atlanta mr laskin said that when people tuned into a weather broadcast , they wanted not just for the forecast but to be reassured that all was well in the world , that the bad would blow over they also wanted to know what to wear the next day those are some reasons why local television weather forecasters are so important to people nine out of 10 people would cite weather as the most important element in the newscast , said jim willi , the president of audience research , a dallas company that has been doing viewer surveys for 25 years local weather forecasters make sixfigure salaries for their two or threeminute turns on television , and most of them have meteorological degrees but they all get their information from the same place , the national weather service , a branch of the federal government that is based in silver spring , md the nightly weather forecast begins each morning in the form of weather observations from satellites , ships at sea , balloons and volunteer weather enthusiasts all over the world the information is sent to the weather service and fed into a complex computer model that simulates the movement of weather over a nineday period there are other models , too , run by countries , including japan and britain , and some universities , like the university of washington and the university of wisconsin at madison \( no model predicts the weather exactly the same way \) the weather service , in turn , passes maps and charts derived from each model along with explanations to weather forecasters around the country go into any television station weather office and you will see reams of these charts pinned to the walls what remains for the forecaster to do is to choose the right model and finetune its predictions for the local area but as forecasting models become more accurate , the human element diminishes over the past five years , there has been very little wiggle room for somebody locally to add much , said louis w uccellini , the head of meteorology for the weather service our fiveday forecast is now as accurate as the threeday forecast was seven years ago this means that the differences between television weather forecasters is more a matter of style than substance storm field of channel 9 , the upn affiliate , who has been on the air in new york since 1975 , and whose father , frank field , was a weatherman for more than 30 years , said that most weather people fell into one of five style categories loosely translated , these are hunk hunkette , warm and fuzzy , expert , local guy or gal and funny character among the current crop of weather people who are on at 10 pm and 11 pm , which is considered the top weather slot in the local news business , nick gregory of channel 5 \( wnyw \) , bills himself as the most accurate forecaster , which he said is based on a new york post article and a highschool student s science project he could be considered the classic expert type mr g , he of the deep tan and bushy hair , does the local guy thing for channel 11 \( wpix \) \( his real name is irv gikofsky \)
albany , feb 27 as one of his key proposals for improving public education last year , gov george e pataki championed parentrun schools with freedom from many state rules and practices only to see the proposal blocked largely by his democratic rivals in the legislature amid opposition from school administrators and the powerful teachers' union but this year , the opposition bloc is weakening as black and hispanic lawmakers come under pressure from their constituents , innercity residents frustrated with the failures of public education these constituents have pinned their hopes on these semiautonomous schools operated under a special charter from the state rather than as part of a local school district these socalled charter schools , which report directly to the state and can bypass local unions , are often financed with public tax money at the expense of local school districts while it is unlikely they would defy their leader , the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , to back a republican proposal , minority legislators say they intend to push their leadership to back a charter school plan this year patricia lynch , a spokeswoman for mr silver , said in an interview today , the speaker is open to the concept of charter schools as another academic setting in the current public school structure but she added that there were several potential sticking points , including the question of how much independence the schools should be given , whether the state would pay extra for them and whether union rules would be waived in such schools , as they have in several other states nationwide , the issue of charter schools , a popular republican cause , has driven a wedge in the traditional democratic coalition , pitting black and hispanic parents from the inner cities against liberals , teachers and school administrators , who argue that such schools potentially undermine public education by siphoning off tax dollars , as well as the brightest students , from public schools from new jersey to massachusetts and pennsylvania to minnesota , texas and colorado , minority legislators and advocacy groups from the inner cities have been forging powerful alliances with conservatives to enact legislation that authorizes the charter schools many black and hispanic groups have lost faith in the traditional education system and are building these new alliances , said joe nathan , the director for the center for school change at the university of minnesota s humphrey institute of public affairs they believe that charter schools will make a difference for their youngsters supporters of charter schools , here and elsewhere , cite recent studies concluding that competition in public education does not create a system of haves and havenots but rather improves performance for students in both the alternative and traditional public school settings to date , more than half the states have enacted legislation permitting the creation of charter schools but in new york , the closest thing to charter schools is a new york city program of alternative schools that report directly to the board of education instead of being independent , as charter schools are in other states that approach has frustrated charter school advocates like roger green , a black democratic assemblyman from brooklyn , who contends that charter schools are most effective and creative when they are permitted to work outside the bureaucracy of the public education system , not within it if charter schools are allowed to work , they can create a demand for change in the other schools , said mr green , an influential member of the legislature s black and hispanic caucus who helped set up an alternative school in brooklyn a few years ago charter schools can serve as a healthy intervention but it is by no means assured that the advocates of charter schools will prevail in this legislative session , since they still face opposition from a range of powerful interest groups representing the public education system , the most formidable being school boards and administrators , as well as the teachers' union the standoff potentially reopens a fragile fault line among new york city democrats dating to racially charged battles that led to the 1968 decentralization of the city school system the fight pitted the largely white teachers' union and administrators against minority communities in the ocean hill , brownsville and bedfordstuyvesant sections of brooklyn these communities , frustrated by their exclusion from any role in running their local schools as well as a lack of jobs for members of minority groups , demanded more local control of hiring and management of their neighborhood schools by far the most outspoken opponents of charter schools have been school administrators who argue that they divert attention and resources from existing schools but the teachers' union , a group that wields far more influence in albany , has taken a more ambiguous public position while union leaders like sandra feldman , now head of the american federation of teachers , insist that they support the concept of charter schools , they have raised many objections and questions about how these schools would work
washington , may 26 when employees of the new york attorney general s office sat down last week to prepare the final draft of the multistate lawsuit accusing the microsoft corporation of monopolistic , anticompetitive behavior , they typed the document using microsoft word , the word processor installed on the office s computers as part of a group of business programs known as office we have windows 95 and the microsoft office suite , attorney general dennis c vacco acknowledged with a rueful chuckle so does virtually every other office in america , which is one of the reasons that mr vacco and 19 other state attorneys general have targeted office in their lawsuit dataquest , a market research firm , said that microsoft office now has 93 percent of the world market for the collections of business software known as suites the other 7 percent is divided between two other suites built around former industry heavyweights lotus smartsuite , has 4 percent of the market , and corel wordperfect suite has 3 percent in addition to word , microsoft office includes the excel spreadsheet program for financial analysis and management , and outlook , a personal information manager for keeping schedules and contact directories microsoft offers office in three versions standard , professional and smallbusiness editions various versions also include powerpoint presentation software for developing slide shows on a computer screen access , a database management tool for finding and analyzing information stored in large computer filing cabinets , or streets , a mapping and directions program the part of the states' lawsuit dealing with office accuses microsoft of using predatory pricing strategies to gain dominance in the market for office suites the justice department argues that microsoft s pricing policy for office leaves computer manufacturers the practical choice of installing microsoft s suite on all the computers they make or on none of them the result , the suit says , is that competition is threatened to be curtailed and foreclosed but some experts in the industry argue that the states are mounting a battle that may already be lost , since microsoft office already enjoys the same level of monopolistic dominance held by the company s windows operating system just three years ago , wordperfect was the world s bestselling word processor , with more than half the market lotus 123 , the venerable spreadsheet program , had a similar market share no one argues that microsoft s pricing strategies alone are responsible for the sharp decline of these competing suites most analysts say that microsoft gained its monopoly position in part by figuring out more quickly than others that most people want programs bundled in a suite and designed to work with and look like one another the company also produced updates that took advantage of technological advances far more quickly than competitors did as an example , dennis tevlin , microsoft s director of marketing for the desktop applications division , said that when windows 95 was released , lotus and wordperfect had ample time to develop updates but they just did n't do it so we were already on to our second generation when they were just shipping product corel assigns blame for wordperfect s decline largely to its previous owner , novell inc and a senior lotus development executive , who , under company policy declined to be identified , said that the many shifts in the industry the last five years , including the move to suites , brought the downfall of lotus 123 neither company placed primary emphasis on the pricing policy described in the states' lawsuit whatever happened in the past , said chris le tocq , an analyst for dataquest who follows this industry , it s very tough to see a way anyone could come in with a word processor or a spreadsheet and turn this around in the future and lewis e platt , chairman of the hewlettpackard company , said by now , it s over in that business most people find it more difficult to switch applications programs than to even switch operating systems even attorney general vacco , when told of the latest sales figures , said wow ! perhaps it has gone too far , but only the marketplace can provide an answer given a more level playing field , can another player compete \? i do n't know a senior government official involved with the state and federal lawsuits said , when a market tips as decisively as this , there s a real question whether or not it makes sense to try to generate competition microsoft , the state lawsuit said , offered computer manufacturers known in the industry as an oem , for original equipment manufacturer two choices when buying the office suite they can buy individual copies of the program for installation on some computers at a price of roughly 170 to 190 or , they can buy the program at a far lower price , roughly 125 , if they purchase it for installation on every computer in a company line the dimension series of dell computers , for example
louisville the cold night air flowed through the open doorways and circulated around the cavernous building , chilling stephanie anderson , 20 , and her coworkers as they recently stood beside the long conveyor belt as packages of various size and shape flowed down the belt , ms anderson glanced at the shipping labels when she saw a zip code in north or south carolina , she snagged the package and placed it into a large plastic trolley car behind her ms anderson is one of a few thousand people doing the same repetitive work on the midnight to 3 am shift at united parcel service s sorting center at the louisville airport but where some might see boredom and wretched hours , she sees opportunity by working this particular shift for this particular company , she is getting what she wants most a free college education it sure does n't seem worth it when i first walk in here , she said it s so cold , and the late hours and you 've just left a warm house to get here but it sure seems worth it when i'm registering for classes and i do n't have to pay anything ms anderson is one of about 1 , 000 nightshift workers at united parcel s primary sorting center who began an innovative program this fall that not only provides tuition at three local colleges , but a tailormade program for workers in what experts say is the first such cooperative arrangement of its kind , the company , the three colleges and the state have scheduled classes to fit the lives of employees who work in the middle of the night the main goal of the program other than the education of students is to help the company retain workers this is n't simply a matter of hiring people and putting them through college , said john kinney , human resources manager for united parcel s louisville sorting center it s a whole new way of doing college classes for the program , known formally as metropolitan college but more commonly as upsu , are set up for the late afternoon and early evening hours at the university of louisville , jefferson county community college and jefferson technical college courses ended for the year by thanksgiving so that students would be free for extra work over the holidays , the peak shipping season workers enrolled in the program get free bus passes for public transit and special bus routes have been set up paid for by united parcel that run each night from the three college campuses to the company s sorting center the program demonstrates the lengths to which companies must go to retain even semiskilled workers in economic good times and how much help state and local governments will provide major employers to keep them from relocating the idea came about when ups , the state s biggest employer , though its headquarters are in atlanta , passed word around louisville in november 1997 that it was thinking about moving its main package sorting center out of the state the company always had difficulty finding enough workers to staff its midnight to 3 am shift , hours mandated by flight schedules united parcel uses for its overnight delivery service indeed , in a typical year , turnover among the 5 , 500 package sorters is 100 percent \( there is also a threehour daytime shift \) the wages are well above the minimum 850 an hour and the company provides full medical benefits but since the basic work of the center is to unload overnight packages from incoming planes , sort the items on the basis of their destination and reload them onto outgoing aircraft , the work can only be part time and it takes place in the middle of the night , a fact that students a group that historically makes up a hefty percentage of united parcel s work force soon finds interfering with social and school life the student population , the folks who are looking for part time work , tend not to want to work from 12 to 3 in the morning moving packages , mr kinney said for the same amount of money they can work at mcdonald s or at a kiosk in a mall selling jewelry and united parcel officials foresaw even more trouble finding workers in the years ahead , as their plans call for expanding the primary package sorting center , whether in louisville or elsewhere the idea is to raise the center s handling capacity by the year 2005 to 300 , 000 packages an hour from the current 175 , 000 the center would need an additional 6 , 000 workers for the latenight shift state officials , who had already offered united parcel a number of other incentives to keep the center in louisville , like tax breaks , came up with the idea of helping the company fill its employment needs through the college program under the plan , united parcel pays half of a worker s tuition at one of the colleges and the state pays the other half we 've a pretty good history of doing things for businesses like improving the transportation system or providing tax incentives , said gov paul e patton in this case , none of that mattered if ups could n't get the employees it needed though it took some persuasion on the part of the governor to get the colleges to go along with the program , the heads of the three institutions say it has helped them stabilize their enrollments , which , like many colleges , have been dropping it brought in 450 students this semester , said dr richard green , president of jefferson community college , where enrollment dropped to

melbourne , fla , feb 26 if the florida marlins traded greg zaun to the mets , he would run the 72 miles to the mets' spring camp faster than it obviously takes gary sheffield to drive the 155 miles from his home in st petersburg to the marlins' camp here when the marlins worked out today , zaun was at space coast stadium today , eager to leave sheffield was not at space coast stadium , none too eager to arrive he should be there momentarily , jim neader , sheffield s agent , said at 11 20 am , 1 hour 20 minutes after the 61 million right fielder was required by the collective bargaining agreement to be in camp ready to work out but momentarily turned into more than three and a half hours everybody does n't know where i'm at every single second , sheffield said after he finally arrived , shortly after 3 pm i'm the only person who would know that s the way i like to keep it i'm a private person zaun is the marlins' backup catcher the mets have sought him as a temporary replacement for their starting catcher , todd hundley dave dombrowski , the marlins' general manager , declined even to acknowledge he was talking with the mets , but another team official said that talks had been progressing even zaun was aware of the mets' interest in him i 've known for a month and a half or two months , he said i'm keeping my fingers crossed zaun , a 26yearold switchhitter , who last year hit 301 in a limited role behind charles johnson , said the prospect of losing the regular job when hundley was fully recovered from his elbow operation did not dampen his interest in a trade i do n't have any problem with that , he said the chance for me to play every day for more than a week would be monumental for my career right now after spending parts of two seasons with the baltimore orioles , zaun was traded to the marlins in august 1996 he may be the bestsuited player to fill the deadend role on the mets he may also have a bright future in the majors because there is a catching bloodline in his family his uncle rick dempsey was a longtime catcher known for his grittiness and zany antics he got some big hits for us last year , jim leyland , the marlins' manager , said of zaun he did a great job for us he does his work when you call on him , when you go to battle , he s ready he s a competitor zaun said he felt that his performance in a supporting role last season earned him a shot at a starting job he knows that chance will not come with the marlins because johnson is the best defensive catcher in the national league and greatly improved as a hitter he s the everyday guy here , the 5foot10inch , 180pound zaun said i do n't have a problem with that when a team comes along and shows interest in giving you an opportunity to play every day , i definitely want to get out and get that opportunity if he goes to the mets , zaun added , at least i 'll have 200 , 300 times at bat to say hey , this kid can play or he ca n't zaun , however , finds himself in a bind the marlins want to pay him as a backup catcher , but in talking about trading him to the mets , they want the return value for a starter they think i'm such a valuable player , he said , they ca n't trade me for a bag of balls and a pitchback screen and they want some major player for me , but they wo n't pay me the top of the pay scale , which i think i deserve zaun said he has heard that the mets have offered pitchers like juan acevedo and brian bohanon , but he did n't know where the talks stood not eligible for salary arbitration , zaun has been offered a raise from 205 , 000 to 275 , 000 that s the equivalent of five days' pay for sheffield dombrowski said he would speak with sheffield before deciding whether to fine him for being late i think everybody would prefer that he was here , dombrowski said , adding we have a very young team i wish he was here in the sense of leadership sheffield , who disclosed he has been rehabilitating his back , said he considered himself on time dombrowski said he told sheffield s agent the reporting time , but sheffield said i told them i was going to be here thursday nobody told me what time to be here if somebody had given me the time , that s the time i would have been here as for dombrowski s mention of leadership , sheffield said they did n't give me 61 million as a leader i was a guy that was just on the team and they gave me 61 million , so i do n't think anybody can say you have to have the responsibilities to be a leader just because we gave you something they did n't give me nothing i earned it unlike zaun , sheffield does not want to be traded to the mets , or to any team when you talk about trading me , everything has to go through me , he said , alluding to the notrade clause in his contract i'm in total control of that it s not going to happen i do n't care what team they 're talking about this is where i want to be

uniondale , ny , jan 6 the islanders , surprisingly , showed none of the telltale signs of a slumping team tonight they had every excuse to hang their heads against the pittsburgh penguins , but they did n't instead , putting forth their best effort as a team in more than two weeks , the islanders came back twice against one of the elite teams in the eastern conference it still was n't enough the offensively challenged islanders lost their eighth straight game , 42 , at nassau coliseum it s tough on everyone right now , coach rick bowness said but there is only one way to get out of this , and that s to keep our heads up and keep working hard our chances to win games are there tonight s game was one the islanders \( 15235 \) needed to win , the first of a fourgame homestand two days after returning from an 04 road trip a slide comparable to this one , around the same time last season , effectively ended the islanders' hopes of reaching the playoffs we played a pretty good game , said goalie eric fichaud , who needed to make only 13 saves the pucks just did n't go in we have to find some positive things we did tonight the islanders outshot the penguins , 2617 they outworked the penguins for the entire 60 minutes for that , the islanders deserved at least a point but again , the result did not fit the effort for the third straight game , they played well enough to win , but came away with nothing we did everything right , said robert reichel , who scored his 17th goal of the season everything but put the puck in the net we should have won the last three games the islanders were 07 on the power play they had a 5on3 advantage for 1 minute 39 seconds late in the first period , and had four chances to gain the lead but on each opportunity , including a shot by reichel that rang off the inside of the goal post , they fired wide it was typical of a team with only six goals in its last six games it s frustrating , but you have to stay positive , said defenseman rich pilon , who was in the penalty box twice tonight when pittsburgh scored it s not like we 've lost eight games and we 're out of the playoff picture after tonight s loss , the islanders are eight games below 500 , but are still just 3 points out of eighth place in the eastern conference , the last playoff spot stu barnes opened the scoring with a powerplay goal for pittsburgh at 4 43 of the first period he knocked in a juicy rebound created by fichaud , who had just stopped kevin hatcher s blast from the point kenny jonsson s goal , his eighth of the season , tied the game at 11 he fired the puck past a surprised peter skudra , who happened to be screened by hatcher the islanders' confidence soared after jonsson s score , but diminished at 9 36 of the period when rob brown shot the puck off islander defenseman doug houda s skate for a 21 penguins lead as demoralizing as brown s goal was , the islanders managed another comeback reichel , a day after he was surprisingly left off of the world allstar team , tied the game a second time by scoring at 14 42 of the second period hatcher s goal with 511 seconds left in the period restored the penguins lead at 32 jiri slegr added an emptynet goal with 19 seconds left in the third , after fichaud had been removed for an extra skater slap shots travis green did not play and could miss thursday s game against the montreal canadiens he sustained a hairline fracture of the lower left shoulder blade on dec 26 against the devils at the meadowlands and has not scored a point since the injury bryan berard , who will represent the united states in the olympics next month , wo n't be representing the islanders , or north america , in the allstar game in vancouver on jan 18 he was left off the team when the squad was filled out on tuesday do i feel snubbed \? berard said no since i'm going to the olympics , it will be nice to get a few days off photo islanders' mike hough and penguins' kevin hatcher tangling as they skated after the puck last night new york lost its eighth straight game \( associated press \)
montreal he conceptual sculpture of the canadianbased artist jana sterbak has inspired reams of humorless , abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered metaphors unturned yet ms sterbak s work seductive , intensely physical and edged with dark absurdity delivers a mindbody frisson unknowable by intellect alone in art circles in the united states , she is perhaps best known for what could be called a piece of wearable art vanitas flesh dress for an albino anorexic , from 1987 , is an actual shift of raw , sewntogether flank steak , which , when fresh , was modeled \( but not by the artist \) and then left to hang , rank and wizening , in a gallery a wider view of ms sterbak s nuanced provocations will be furnished in a midcareer survey of her work at the museum of contemporary art in chicago , from saturday through feb 21 flesh dress , which will not be in the chicago show , was featured in several exhibitions about clothing and fashion or mortality in the bodyconscious climate of the late 80 s and early 90 s it was discussed in numerous art journal articles about those trendy subjects , thus fixing ms sterbak within the camp of feminist or body art in truth , her oeuvre is more subtle and less categorical , ultimately stemming from the human condition as seen through the eyes of a cultural nomad now living part time in montreal and barcelona , spain , ms sterbak , 43 , left her native prague as a young teenager , but not before absorbing an eastern european mix of existentialistinformed irony and a poetic touch with materials the extremes of political ideologies she experienced at an impressionable age , from that of dour , communistblock czechoslovakia to that of cheerfully capitalist canada , taught her to buy into none of them her distrust of dogma fits perfectly into these postideological times , says amada cruz , the former acting chief curator at the museum of contemporary art , who organized the show she has this weird combination of skepticism , which is also very timely , and yet an incredible faith in humanity , ms cruz says although her work does have a very strong point of view and does deal with issues that could be thought of as specifically feminist , she also deals with things universal in terms of just being a human desire , longing , the contradiction between one s will and the limits to what one can physically do ms sterbak agrees that her work comes more from life s currents than current events , and that body and aidsrelated art was a trend many artists were shoehorned into by critics and curators in many ways this interest in the body is misguided , she says what people should have been looking at , not only in my case but in that of other artists , is how the representation of the human has changed over time we are so far away from historical perspective , into a kind of theoretical language , that historical context is not discussed to ms sterbak , the critical condition for humanity today is that of the individual besieged by technology compared with , say , the greek model of the body filled with optimism , or the renaissance mix of religion and rationality my work has to do with the limits of the individual , limits that are defined as they always have been , and always will be , by our mortality , she says we have always tended to minimize this mortality , and are now encouraged to do so by technology whether it s medical advances that keep mortality at bay , or the personal limitlessness proffered by cyber communications systems , ms sterbak says that technology also needs to be rescued from such strictly utilitarian roles for it to be mostly functional is sad technology is in need of imbuing with a little poetry , she says literature and technology were both important to her early on corona laurea , 198384 , was an electrified stovecoil headpiece based on the medea myth since the late 1970 s ms sterbak s polymath methods have included traditional and mechanical sculpture , performance , video , photography and borrowed readymade objects injected into multimedia installations rather than art theory , she reads fiction and poetry and cites an international range of favorites including milan kundera , max frisch , paul bowles , heinrich boll , octavio paz and emily dickinson , often including passages of their writing in her exhibition catalogs i find the language of fiction more subtle than what usually gets written about artists , she says in fiction and poetry the meaning is communicated on many levels , and there is also craft , or style both form and content , as in my work form facilitates the ease with which a work of art can be approached while ms sterbak s early work seemed more personal , invoking highly charged , clashing sensations , her art since flesh dress seems increasingly extroverted , even lighthearted technology gets a playful break with baldacchino , a 199798 interactive work that will have its debut in chicago this headhigh , metallic , meshveiled canopy on wheels moves independently about the gallery , making seemingly random choices of viewers to hover over and follow about the hidden mechanisms have to do with reflective properties more than that the artist prefers not to say another piece she is developing for a show at the fabric workshop in philadelphia involves a tent made of spaceage fabric that blocks all electromagnetic waves , literally sheltering inhabitants from the pervasiveness of technology m s sterbak continues to be fascinated with electricity , a perfect metaphor for danger and seduction many of her works combine materials that conduct heat , light , electromagnetism or mild electrical shock a new incarnation of the medea piece is hot crown , a metal crown that becomes incandescent as viewers approach lowertech themes explore implied physical burdens and metaphors of wearisome tasks a group of late performance pieces involving husks or a cocoonlike apparatus suggests metamorphoses a la her czech compatriot franz kafka absorption , 1995 , is an arthistorical conceit involving the artist s desire to become a moth and consume all of joseph beuys s felt suits , making the implicit point that men s clothing art is regarded as humanist while dressrelated art is seen as feminist it was inspired by an actual mothinfested beuys suit she discovered in storage at the tate gallery in london condition , a 1995 video performance piece , required a man to walk in circles dragging a wheeled contraption resembling an insect exoskeleton portability is also a subtext , perhaps because of her peripatetic life style combat cricket compartment , 199397 , contains live crickets in a carved horn case , allowing the carrier to transport cricket songs of love and war in all her work , the compelling object seduces , while the implication or action surprises , shocks or amuses material presence is the way to know , she says it s important for my objects to have a definite physical presence , that they are physical in the way that we are , and that presence is our first access her materials , though as quotidian as flank steak and crickets , disabuse us of assumptions that we mistake for knowledge a quote by emily dickinson included in the catalogue of her forthcoming show offers a parallel in such everyday enlightenment to live is so startling , it leaves little room for other occupations photo excerpts from jana sterbak s 1995 video piece 'condition , ' in which a man drags around a large wheeled contraption resembling

purchase , ny may 1 the halogen haze that washed over coach jeff van gundy added to the surreal evening a year ago van gundy had been planted in front of television lights and microphones , under similar circumstances but this time , there was less outrage and more acceptance of the suspensions and fines handed down today by the national basketball association as a result of another fight in a knicksheat playoff game larry johnson and alonzo mourning were each suspended two games for throwing punches at each other in a melee that occurred with 14 seconds left in game 4 on thursday night at madison square garden and chris mills was suspended for one game for taking a few steps onto the court during the altercation and fined 2 , 500 johnson was fined 10 , 000 and mourning 20 , 000 none of the three players will be available for game 5 on sunday in miami once again two knicks will be watching a seriesdeciding game from a miami hotel room it is the same hotel in which john starks and johnson paced last year , when they were among four knicks suspended for leaving the bench because of a game 5 fight between charlie ward and p j brown as much of a flashback as it seemed , van gundy talked tonight about injustice and the mission of nine men again and it will be nine men two people within the organization said the knicks considered dressing patrick ewing , who is on the playoff roster but has not played since his wrist surgery in december , just in case there is an emergency because of foul trouble or injury but both van gundy and the team president , ernie grunfeld , dismissed that idea he s not going to play , van gundy said so he s not going to dress no ewing no johnson no mills the absences of johnson and mills seem unreal , considering the warnings that have been issued since last year s suspensiontainted ending to the knicks' season although johnson may have delivered the first shove as he locked up with mourning at the end of thursday s game , the knicks , once again , have been penalized more for their reaction than actions a guy who throws like nine haymakers gets two games , and a guy who takes two steps on the floor gets one game , said van gundy , comparing mourning s actions to mills s i think there is an inequity there i think mourning got off extremely light i think 5 or 10 games would have been more appropriate for him they say the reason they have an automatic suspension for going on the floor for is because it escalates things it never does when i 've seen it to me , they should look at each individual case on the other hand , everyone knows the rules you should stay where you should be by the time mills got back to the bench it was too late the league spotted him wandering a few steps off the baseline when the fight broke out he was shocked when his jersey was spotshadowed on msg on videotape usually , after a game , we got to the center of the court for prayer , mills said after the knicks practiced tonight at sunypurchase i thought the game was over but everyone was telling me that i had to get back someone told me that i might get suspended and i was shocked mills would not have been shocked if he had been around last year he was an offseason addition via a trade , but he will be missing in the most pivotal game of the season for the knicks but which team was shortchanged the most \? the heat will have to go without an allstar center who has averaged 193 points , 85 rebounds and 25 blocked shots a game mourning has been a force not only on offense but also as a defensive menace who stepped forward and had two blocks to seal game 3 for the heat with both teams missing their best lowpost players , there are plenty of guards left to pass around the knicks have allan houston and john starks to counter tim hardaway and voshon lenard the best guard duo probably wins but there is a wildcard factor although van gundy did not give away his new starting lineup , buck williams , who practiced as the starting center tonight , can provide some lowpost offense , and so can terry cummings chris dudley might get minutes , too , as a shot blocker against the heat s penetrating guards the heat could start a small lineup , using brown at center , jamal mashburn at power forward and keith askins at small forward mashburn poses the biggest problem because he can post up and shoot from the outside the two people who have shut him down this series \? johnson and mills if only johnson had restrained himself but is that possible or fair to ask when mourning threw the first punch \? i should have known better , johnson said after game 4 i should have been a punk and walked away van gundy did not condone what he did unlike last year , he did not offer verbose defenses of his players or take personal jabs at the heat he spoke of the unfairness of it all but there was little outrage van gundy had been through this before and he was well rehearsed this time i mean , larry knows i care deeply about him , van gundy said i like him i like everything about him , but he knows he made a mistake that does n't change my feelings for him , but it s a big loss certainly , i think you try to learn from past experiences it s very hard to walk away when someone is swinging at you but what we talked about with larry was , it would have been the right thing i feel for him he knows how valuable he is to our team now to move on without him and in doing so , van gundy uttered an all too familiar refrain we 'll play with the nine we have we expect to win and so do they there s no excuses photos jeff van gundy , back on his feet for practice after his game 4 foray on the floor , wants knicks focused for game 5 \( richard harbus for the new york times \) john starks , right , and his teammates trying to help coach jeff van gundy off the floor at the end of game 4 \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg c6 \) the series so far 4 games , 2 gestures , 3 suspensions 1 too much tim tim hardaway scores 34 points as miami races to a big lead and keeps the knicks at arm s length the rest of the night heat 9479 2 rubbing it in the knicks rebound , with chris childs getting everyone in miami agnry by making a slashing motion across his throat knicks 9686 3 rubbing it back miami prevails at madison square garden , and payback comes when miami s eric murdock does his own slash routine heat 9186 4 punching it out knicks win , but the game will be remembered for a lastsecond brawl between alonzo mourning and larry johnson knicks 9085 5 the deciding game buck williams the reserve forward who did not play thursday night , practiced with the first team last night will he start in place of larry johnson \?

oversaw the passage of financing for the truman doctrine and marshall plan as secretary of state he negotiated the establishment of nato , stood firm for the defense of south korea and put in place a security agreement with japan it is hardly an exaggeration to state , as james chace does in the subtitle of his new biography , that acheson was the secretary of state who created the american world in acheson , chace , the editor of world policy journal and the author of several books on international affairs , covers a great deal of familiar ground and does not present much new information on the period s historic controversies nor does he provide us with significantly clearer insight into the inner man than is available in acheson s own memoirs , morning and noon and present at the creation nonetheless , this biography is engrossingly good reading simply as a story of the dizzying sequence of monumental events in which acheson took part , and for what it tells us about what is required by way of character in an outstanding statesman at the core of acheson s achievement was an understanding that in a democracy great things can be accomplished in foreign policy , but only if the underlying rationale is carefully articulated and tirelessly promoted this was a lesson he first learned as an assistant secretary winning congressional support for the bretton woods agreement , and it is one that subsequent administrations have often failed to heed in view of acheson s reputation as an arrogant and effete elitist , it is ironic that many of his most outstanding triumphs lay in persuading an often niggardly , isolationist and \( between 1946 and 1948 \) republican congress to support a costly internationalist position for the united states like henry kissinger , acheson was extremely good at using the press to get out his side of the story and it is easy to forget how bold many of the initiatives with which he was associated actually were it was not a foregone conclusion that the united states would spend 400 million on aid to greece and turkey and even larger sums for the reconstruction of europe it was not obvious that the united states should help rebuild the economies of japan and germany shortly after their defeat nor was it easy to argue with the republicans in congress many of whom considered themselves what newt gingrich now calls cheap hawks that the united states should commit itself to a large peacetime buildup of its conventional forces rather than rely on nuclear weapons alone to create support for the truman doctrine and marshall plan , acheson employed rhetoric that he himself knew was excessively alarmist in its manichaean portrayal of the soviet union while many \( including chace \) argue that he was hoist with his own petard by legitimating the virulent anticommunism that senator joseph mccarthy later turned on him , such critics fail to appreciate the fact that carefully nuanced language often fails to achieve its underlying purpose chace s account of the early cold war reads strangely , because it fails fully to acknowledge , on the basis of material recently released from the soviet archives , that we now know , as the yale historian john l gaddis puts it , certain things about soviet intentions that were opaque to policy makers at the time in 1946 , for example , acheson was involved in drafting the socalled achesonlilienthal report , which would have put nuclear energy under the control of an international authority so that the soviet union would not feel threatened by this new and terrifying resource chace criticizes truman for turning this scheme into the tougher baruch plan , an initiative quickly dismissed by moscow , and he suggests that had roosevelt lived he might have been able to negotiate the mother of all arms control agreements , a nuclear duopoly with stalin many academic careers were made in the 1960 s and 70 s on the basis of similar speculations about how the cold war might have been averted through timely cooperative overtures to the kremlin but any such overtures were doomed to failure because , as gaddis puts it , we now know that as long as stalin was running the soviet union a cold war was unavoidable
new haven , aug 27 not many players have beaten steffi graf three times in one year but amanda coetzer of south africa is one of them , having defeated her in three of their four meetings last year , with two of those victories coming in grand slam events , the australian open and french open but that was before the 29yearold graf the dominant women s player of the late 1980 s and most of the 90 s underwent knee surgery last june tonight , playing in only her ninth tournament since returning to competition , graf found herself matched against the 27yearold coetzer again in the quarterfinals of the inaugural pilot pen international women s tennis championships for graf , the winner of 21 grand slam tournaments , but none in the last two years , it was payback time against the tenacious , nevergiveup 5foot2inch coetzer , who finished last year ranked third in the world but has slipped to 12th in 1998 after falling behind , 32 , when coetzer broke her service in the fifth game of the opening set , graf put on a vintage performance , winning the last 10 games of the match to prevail , 63 , 60 , and advance to friday s semifinals graf s semifinal opponent will be topseeded lindsay davenport , who downed unseeded anke huber , 63 , 63 , in tonight s second match graf holds a 53 edge over the 22yearold davenport but the 6foot 2inch californian who has captured her last three tournaments , and five over all this year , and risen to second in the world ranking has won three of their last four matches secondseeded jana novotna , the reigning wimbledon champion , advanced to the semifinals with a 61 , 76 \( 74 \) victory over 19yearold amelie mauresmo of france , who is ranked 32d , during the day session novotna will meet another relatively unknown unseeded player from france , julie halarddecugis , in friday s semifinal at 5 pm halarddecugis , 27 , who is ranked 31st , beat mary joe fernandez , 75 , 61 if it was not graf at her best , it was close , as the german overwhelmed coetzer during those last 10 games with her serve , powerful forehand and laserlike backhand helpless under the onslaught , coetzer , normally able to run just about everything down as she did in a dramatic comeback victory over 17yearold anna kournikova on wednesday lost her composure graf , whose best finishes this year have been as a semifinal loser in three tournaments twice to davenport was gracious in victory i did n't make many mistakes , and maybe she made more than usual , said graf , who yielded only 5 points in her last five service games and only 2 in the second set she did n't play her best and in the second set did n't have a game plan and seemed to lose control of what to do graf had a lot to do with that loss of control , as she played nearly flawlessly , moving well and showing no signs of having slowed down following her long recuperation from knee surgery that kept her on the sidelines for eight months my backhand worked very well , she said , and as the match went on , i started to hit deeper and i did n't have any letdown graf said that she was not trying to exact revenge for the three losses at coetzer s hands last year but she did say , it made me more focused than anything match points mary joe fernandez , playing in only her third tournament since undergoing surgery on her right wrist last december , defeated 17thranked sandrine testud of france , 63 , 46 , 64 , before losing to another frenchwoman , julie halarddecugis , later in the day the testud match had been suspended wednesday night because of darkness after testud and fernandez had split the first two sets photo steffi graf looked superb in upending her recent nemesis , amanda coetzer , 63 , 60 , in the pilot pen tournament at new haven \( associated press \)
for nearly three years , caterpillar inc has been banging its head against the clinton administration door , trying to get governmentsponsored loans for the sale of its big earthmovers to china beijing is buying them by the dozens to build the giant three gorges dam , which the administration considers damaging to the environment so the chinese have turned to suppliers in japan and europe , where governments are less concerned about the environment and more forthcoming with credit we 've only managed to sell the chinese a few offhighway trucks , a caterpillar official said that is hardly the description of a giant multinational ranging unfettered across the world for all the talk of economic globalization , the process is still in an early stage a few multinationals , such as ibm , royal dutch shell or imperial chemical industries , are ahead of the pack in spreading their revenues , research , financing , stockholders and management over many countries but the majority are more like caterpillar in america , the mitsubishi corporation in japan or volkswagen in germany for all their involvement in overseas sales and investment , nationality still binds them to home what we have is united states , european and japanese corporations trying to dress in global clothing , said william w keller , executive director of the center for international studies at the massachusetts institute of technology but if you conceive of globalization as being the rootlessness of corporations , that is a paradox you do n't have corporations without states attached to them when they need help , you find out who they really belong to many corporations have invoked the competitive pressures of an increasingly borderless global economy as the reason for moving operations and jobs abroad and to press for other concessions but a proliferation of treaty negotiations in recent months , aimed at setting rules for the global economy most of them favorable so far to business has raised a fresh question just how untethered are these companies and who , therefore , should have a voice in the rulemaking \? we have to keep separate that the mobility of corporations has increased from the notion that we are living in a completely seamless integrated world market that gives national government no bargaining power to set standards , said dani rodrik , an economist at harvard the latter has not happened some want to stop the process of globalization but others , including a reenergized american labor movement , are more interested in setting international rules of the road indeed , 12 different rulemaking negotiations are currently under way most are inspired by the north american free trade agreement and the treaty that set up the world trade organization , in which the united states and 116 other nations agreed essentially to recognize wto rulings as having the power of national law several of the agreements now being discussed would require senate ratification and would be similarly binding that would push the setting of global rules beyond the voluntary guidelines that have characterized most such agreements since world war ii thus far , the corporations , more than any other group , are shaping the new global regulations , said raymond vernon , an economist at harvard s kennedy school of government it is not that they are abandoning their countries for a global identity they are simply pushing abroad and arguing that if the obstacles are cleared away , they will produce enough for everyone and raise all boats the recent surge in rulemaking brings out strange bedfellows corporate america and the aflcio find themselves on one side , favoring an international stage , while the most visible advocates of those who want the rules made in america include patrick j buchanan , the conservative commentator and politician , and ralph nader , the liberal consumer advocate rather than international negotiations , the rules should be written through congress , where you can have discussion and debate , mr nader said as an example , he argued , congress can no longer effectively ban imports of products made with child labor because the wto does not specifically prohibit such trade , such a law could be challenged before the organization , which could then fine the united states american corporate executives see in the new wave of rulemaking not only the elimination of remaining trade barriers but also the removal of restrictions on investment abroad and greater freedom to purchase foreign companies for mr nader and mr buchanan , however , these are hidden tools to make the shifting of jobs abroad that much easier mr buchanan advocates protective tariffs to keep companies at home , while mr nader would discourage jobshifting by canceling tax breaks , imposing a social tariff and prohibiting exportimport bank loans for exports that contain too many foreign parts the bank once financed only those exports manufactured entirely in the united states but it has relaxed that rule in recent years and now , for example , provides credits to customers of the boeing company to purchase aircraft that have as much as 15 percent foreign content , and sometimes more
washington , dec 19 the only thing certain now is uncertainty the smart money shouts that president clinton will never resign , and he vows to serve until the last hour of the last day of his second term the smart money argues that the senate will never muster the 67 votes needed to remove the wounded president from office , which would require the defection of 12 democrats if all the republicans stand against him the smart money insists that someone will cut a deal soon to end all this maybe so but the smarter money whispers , remember remember that everyone in washington , including representative henry j hyde , the chairman of the judiciary committee , said the house would never , ever , vote impeachment along partisan lines wrong remember that all the pundits predicted democratic losses in the midterm elections , and when the opposite happened , they said impeachment was dead twice wrong and remember that in the new year the nation will travel down a road it has never traveled before one other president , andrew johnson of tennessee , has been tried by the senate , of course but that happened in a different country one with only 37 states , with primitive communications , with a simple economy based on agriculture , with minimal commitments abroad in the toxic politics of century s end in washington , the inconceivable has become the commonplace the wholly unanticipated announcement this morning by representative robert l livingston , republican of louisiana , that he would not serve as speaker and would resign from congress , after his equally unanticipated disclosure on thursday night of several extramarital affairs , only deepened the capital s profound sense of insecurity the deadly sweep of the scythe of neopuritanism appears unstoppable , at least for the moment , and mr livingston s forthcoming resignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise you 've set before us an example , the leader of house republican majority , representative dick armey of texas , told mr livingston today the example is that principle comes before power the democrats made the opposite point , arguing that the livingston case showed how wrong it was to savage people for personal failings one transcendentally important thing remains the same although surrounded by judicial trappings and presided over by the chief justice , the president s trial will be a political process , with power residing in the hands of politicians in addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence , the senators can weigh considerations of party , the nation s future , their own political wellbeing and anything else they care to weigh in reaching a verdict the longer they take , the more numerous the appeals for resignation are likely to be even before today s epochal rollcalls , 4 of 10 americans interviewed in the latest new york times cbs news poll said they thought that the president should step down if he was indicted even though a large majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings what lies behind that seeming contradiction is the fear that mr clinton , and the country with him , would be incapacitated no one took andrew johnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote but mr clinton , a man of powerful will whose whole life has been a series of comebacks , has already embarked on an effort to show that he can do the nation s business richard m nixon clawed his way back to respectability after leaving the white house mr clinton intends to reestablish his authority while still in office he has one great advantage twothirds of the american public continues to voice its approval of his political stewardship , whatever it thinks of him as a man for those americans and for congress , too , mr clinton , puffyeyed , set out an agenda late this afternoon in the rose garden he talked of social security reform , but also of negotiating a prompt solution that would end the impeachment crisis in a constitutional and fair manner the president will press hard , despite his muchreduced leverage , for a deal on censure indeed , in as fine a piece of political irony as one could ask for , he has already sought to enlist former senator bob dole , the republican he defeated in 1996 , as an emissary to the senate majority the numbers are not unpromising with the help of 6 republicans , the 45 democrats could end the trial at any time and pass a censure resolution that the house would surely take up there are enough republican moderates and sometime partybuckers to make that a plausible target but the republican senate leader , trent lott , who has made his unwillingness to take the president s word evident in recent days , is determined to fight such an arrangement it is clear that mr clinton s reputation has been stained forever , no matter what the senate does the spot will not out history will remember this man who so coveted a glowing legacy not as an impresario of economic growth , not as the moses who pointed the way to the 21st century , but as the second president ever to be impeached , if not as the first to be ousted that harsh word , impeachment , will cling to his name as surely as teapot dome clings to harding s
san antonio , march 26 from the lobbies of downtown hotels to the steps along the riverwalk to the alamodome , the hysteria of the final four shifted today to discussions about fixing games after two former northwestern basketball players were indicted on gambling charges one college coach almost dropped the phone when he was told the news , another said he felt nauseated about it and another called college gambling a time bomb so all the banners , shiny pins and souvenirs could not obscure a problem that has plagued college athletics for at least half a century and a problem that abruptly stole some attention from college basketball s marquee event kevin o'neill , who just finished his first season as coach of northwestern , said he did not know the school was being investigated before he accepted the job , but he would have taken it anyway o'neill called the four recruits who have chosen northwestern for next season and explained the situation he said none expressed interest in searching for another school i think it s tragic any time this happens because the young people get involved in things they ca n't handle , o'neill said that s the worst part of it that s tragic cedric dempsey , the executive director of the national collegiate athletic association , wore a tight expression because he wanted to talk about a thrilling tournament that has already featured 17 games decided by 3 points or fewer instead , dempsey discussed the possibility of enforcing a zerotolerance policy for future gambling violations , about adding to the one person who currently handles gambling issues for the ncaa and about how the fbi will address players competing in the final four on friday for the first time the meetings had been planned before the northwestern indictments were disclosed arguably , i think illegal sports wagering is probably the most critical issue we have in intercollegiate athletics today , dempsey conceded it cuts at the fiber of what competition is about if we find that we have a lot of point shaving going on , our public will lose confidence in what s happening , and then certainly what we see here in terms of interest will wane bill saum , the ncaa s representative for agents and gambling , held up a postcard with do n't bet on it across the front and telephone numbers for him and fbi agents on the back they will be given to players on north carolina , stanford , utah and kentucky in case they have concerns this weekend i do believe what we can do is educate studentathletes on this issue not being a victimless crime , saum said it s not the new recreation of the 90 s there are victims there are serious consequences in becoming involved in this activity dempsey said some studies have shown college students spend more money on gambling than alcohol and said that the fbi has told him that 80 billion to 120 billion is bet illegally each year , compared with 2 billion wagered legally the ncaa , which now has a computer in saum s office to monitor dramatic changes in betting lines since as much as 45 billion is bet on this tournament , hoped statistics like north carolina s 343 record would be the focus today , that was not the case while dempsey said he was uncertain if the timing of the arrests was coincidental , one athletic official from the big ten said he was told the announcement was purposely made two days away from the final four for the maximum impact we intend to use this as an educational tool , saum said it s a wakeup call for all of college athletics most coaches who were here for an annual meeting were sad , but not shocked , by the latest instance of gambling it s a bomb ready to explode , duke s mike krzyzewski said it can happen to anybody you would n't even know about it until it happened iona s tim welsh added any time things like this happen or come up , they put a cloud over college basketball i do n't think anyone thinks it can happen to them when it does , it s devastating

with contracts between the countyr and some of its unions having been expired for two years , the county is poised to rehire as a consultant its longtime labor negotiator , who received 50 , 000 in accrued vacation and sick pay when he retired at the end of last year michael wittenberg was one of many commissioners and deputies who left county government either voluntarily or otherwise after county executive andrew j spano , a democrat , in january succeeded andrew p o'rourke , a republican , who had been in office since 1983 according to the county s personnel office , about 14 million was collectively given to retiring employees , much of it to qualifying nonunion toplevel employees who had the right under county law to cash in a certain amount of their accrued sick time and vacation pay while mr spano says he wants to change the policy that allows retiring employees to take the extra compensation in lieu of time they could have taken off , the new county executive wants mr wittenberg back for now this man knows the history and is very good at what he does , susan tolchin , a spokeswoman for mr spano , said none of the county officials interviewed criticized mr wittenberg for what they viewed as a sincere effort on his part to retire entirely from county government they directed their criticism instead at the county law that allowed him and the others to convert accrued vacation and sick time into cash mr wittenberg became chief labor negotiator for the county in 1975 in the administration of former county executive alfred b delbello , a democrat from 1984 until the time of his retirement at the end of last year , he worked in a 95 percent capacity , officially considered parttime , with a salary of 95 , 500 a role he was willing to continue under mr spano , he said but the new county executive wanted mr wittenberg to work full time , and this , mr wittenberg said , prompted his retirement because he wanted to continue to pursue consulting work in the labor relations field mr wittenberg said it was not his original plan to be a consultant for the county government in fact , the county s ethics code forbids former employees from doing that kind of work within a year of their retirement from the government but at mr spano s instigation , mr wittenberg in late january formally asked the board of legislators for a waiver to the ethics code that request is before the board s committee on county officers and departments the committee chairwoman , suzanne r swanson , a conservative from thornwood , said the committee would ask mr wittenberg to appear before the committee to discuss the matter it could be we 'll save money this way , having him as a consultant instead of on a salary , she said not specifically before the committee is the issue of whether certain retiring employees should be allowed to cash in accrued vacation and sick time but like mr spano , george s latimer , chairman of the board of legislators , said that was an area in need of change the question is , is there a logical reason to give this waiver to wittenberg \? he said in this case , there seems to be a logical reason he has an institutional history that is very tangible the system is such that he got a nice cashout , and now andy spano says he needs him i have to err on the side of saying that that is the best strategy for getting these contracts settled mr wittenberg , hopeful that an ethics waiver will be granted , is continuing his work as the county s labor negotiator without pay even if the waiver is granted , he will not be paid retroactively for those hours if and when a waiver is granted , he will be paid up to 5 , 000 a month cheryl melton , president of local 660 of the civil service employees association , said she was glad mr wittenberg is still involved i think mike is good in a way , she said we may not always agree with him , but he knows the old history she said she was hopeful that his continued involvement would speed up settlement of the contract between the county and the county government unit of the civil service employees association , whose 3 , 700 members have been without a contract since 1996 most of the other unionized employees are also working without a contract they include teachers at westchester community college , whose contract expired aug 31 , 1995 , and members of the correction officers benevolent association , whose contract expired in august of 1995 at the end of last year , a proposed settlement with the teamsters union , who represent middlelevel managers , was rejected by the legislators because it included a provision for job security that union has been without a contract since the end of 1995 contracts with the unions representing the county police , police supervisors and the investigators for the district attorney s office expire at the end of this year , mr wittenberg said it remains uncertain if he will work on all those contracts for the moment the priority is the civil service employees and the teachers in cashing in his vacation and sick pay upon retirement , mr wittenberg did what many former county commissioners , deputies and others did as explained by paula redd zeman , the county s new personnel officer , managers have the right to carry over to a new year accrued vacation \( with the permission of the county executive and the personnel officer \) and sick days county law allows them to cash the days in for pay \( all of the accrued vacation and half of sick days up to 120 days \) when they leave , even if they have not reached retirement age , she said it would take action from the board of legislators to change that for rankandfile union employees , things are somewhat different based on various contracts all employees are given 12 sick days a year , which may be carried over indefinitely and accumulated but the days may be cashed in only when retiring from the county a total of up to 15 days of vacation pay may be carried over and cashed in when resigning \( before formal retirement age \) or retiring from the county the county has a collateral question to deal with , ms zeman said those employees who were dismissed last year when their jobs were privatized and who have now been rehired because of a change in county policy , want their accrued sick days restored if they had been returned to county employment in under a year , they would automatically have had those benefits restored , but because it has been more than a year the matter must be decided by the board , she said
labor unions often cringe at mergers because such combinations frequently portend largescale layoffs but the giant unions representing auto workers in the united states and germany see little to fear in daimlerbenz ag s acquisition of the chrysler corporation the reason there is little overlap in the production of the two companies , and as a result , union officials see little prospect of consolidation and layoffs indeed , some union leaders predicted that a combination would bring more opportunities than worries for instance , officials with the united automobile workers predicted that the acquisition would open the door to the union s organizing workers at a new mercedes plant just outside tuscaloosa , ala , a plant with 1 , 500 workers that has until now fought unionization and labor experts also said the deal could result in strong crossatlantic ties between the uaw and i g metall , the powerful union representing german auto workers perhaps creating a more formal alliance between a european union and an american one than has ever existed before at a news conference yesterday in detroit , stephen p yokich , president of the uaw , sounded anything but worried i do n't believe it weakens us not at all , mr yokich said we really do n't see any layoffs and the company did n't see any when we spoke to them even if the two unions have some major objections to the merger , some labor union officials acknowledged that such objections were unlikely to result in walkouts anytime soon because the two unions have pending contracts with chrysler and daimler in an interview with a german radio station , walter riester , vice president of i g metall , which represents about 160 , 000 auto workers at daimlerbenz , said his first reaction was to check whether the merger endangered production or jobs in germany to begin with , there is convincing proof that this is not the case , mr riester said the range of products at chrysler and daimler and mercedesbenz is very , very different and both operate in different markets philippe houchois , an automobile analyst with standard poor s dri in london , agreed the official line is there will not be any job losses or redundancies , he said it s a believable line because there is no product overlap an outgrowth of the chryslerdaimler deal could be the formation of the strongest crossatlantic alliance ever between two unions , several labor analysts said officials from the uaw and i g metall already compare notes and discuss strategies about coming problems , but as a result of the merger , that cooperation is expected to increase vastly this merger is good for business and good for labor , said lowell turner , a professor of comparative labor relations at cornell university it will also be a good stimulus for growing international collaboration among unions as they struggle to counterbalance the enormous power of capital in the global economy several analysts predicted that the deal , by having the unions looking over each other s shoulders , could prompt the uaw to begin demanding some of the goodies received by their german counterparts americans have n't really paid attention that the germans get six weeks' vacation because they see germany as a different universe , professor turner said but when they get pulled more closely together because of a merger like this , it s likely to affect bargaining demands for example , mr yokich said yesterday that it would be good if american unions could win the same rights that german unions have german law gives unions half the seats on the supervisory board of many companies and requires many corporations to have works councils , which are groups of union officials who can block some of management s moves , like layoffs , but not others , such as installing new technologies indeed , several labor experts suggested that since under german law , i g metall has half the seats on daimler s supervisory board that could make life easier for the united automobile workers in future negotiations or in future corporate decisions on plant closings for example , if daimlerchrysler had a showdown with the uaw over wages in american negotiations , metall might be able to pressure daimler , both on the supervisory board and on the factory floor , to give their american coworkers a better deal but karl e ludvigsen , chairman of ludvigsen associates , an automobile consulting firm in london , said he doubted the merger would strengthen either union s hand after all the international mergers i 've seen , none of the labor unions have really moved the need in being able to go to the headquarter country to try to get a better deal , he said there s much talk among the unions trying to use their leverage across international boundaries , but they have n't succeeded diane c swonk , an economist with the first chicago nbd corporation , said that as result of the merger , the united automobile workers would be more likely to select chrysler as its strike target in next year s round of bargaining the union might conclude it could get a better deal from a germanowned chrysler , she said this , she said , makes them a target because the union will think there s a tendency that daimler will roll over and play dead with the uaw more than chrysler would have

round of this grand slam tournament , and tonight , nine years later , kucera followed him there after pulling off a shocking 64 , 62 , 67 \( 57 \) , 63 upset of the man who has been the world s no 1 for the past five years it s anyone s ball game now , sampras , the defending champion , said of the men s title it is decidedly not sampras s ball game anymore kucera s victory was proof positive that nothing , not even the player deemed most likely to topple roy emerson s career record of 12 grand slam singles championships , is sacred anymore sampras had hoped to make this tournament his 11th grand slam title , which would have tied him with rod laver and bjorn borg on the men s singles honor roll instead , the 20thranked kucera squeezed the competitive life out of sampras with a masterful display of serving and ballstriking from the backcourt kucera outaced sampras , 187 , and broke serve in seven of the eight games in which he held break points you 're hoping something will crack , but nothing did , sampras said he played tough as nails he returned my serve as well as anyone ever does he played the match of his life and i just did n't come up with the goods it s pretty disappointing , but i just ran into a hot player who had nothing to lose , and i had a bad day i was just missing sampras made 46 unforced errors , more than twice as many as his challenger there s no excuses , he said my forehand was kind of going all over the place two hours 29 minutes , and 28 unforced forehand errors , after sampras marched onto the court intent on securing a semifinal confrontation with petr korda , he sat with his head in a towel and a heap of discarded racquets beside him it was not a sight anyone , with the possible exception of kucera , expected to see i did n't try something special i was just running for every ball , kucera said i was pretty cool , and it could be that he was a little nervous this is my biggest victory of my career kucera , a winner in just 1 of the 28 events last year , joked , my goal of this year is not to lose a match kucera did not lose many points in the first two sets of his first grand slam quarterfinal kucera broke sampras for a 54 lead in the opening set and converted his third set point when sampras blooped a backhand beyond bounds in the next set , sampras retreated instead of regrouping he dropped serve in the third game and , after losing a volleying war in which kucera seized the point with a reflex volley winner delivered from his belly , sampras sacrificed the fifth game as well when kucera s running forehand downtheline pass caught him flatfooted at break point that gave kucera a 41 lead that provoked a buzz of disbelief from the spectators , and with his ninth ace of the match , he pocketed a twosetstonone lead sampras had overcome dire deficits like this one four times in his career , twice at this event in 1995 but tonight , sampras could not steel himself to do more than scratch his way through the third set s tie breaker to avoid a sweep i did n't like the position i was in , sampras said i dug myself a hole , but i have heart , and i was n't going to let this guy just roll over me but it seemed like i was doing a lot of the work and i was on the short end of the long points i tried my best , but it was n't meant to be it was obviously meant to be for the sixthseeded korda , who pulled out a 36 , 57 , 63 , 64 , 62 comeback over fourthseeded jonas bjorkman of sweden in their 3hour3minute quarterfinal , the lefthanded korda balanced 75 unforced errors with 63 winners , nearly 40 more than bjorkman had , and the czech won the point on 29 of his 39 sprints to the net korda was not the only player to make a poor start only to finish with a flourish secondseeded lindsay davenport survived the loss of a 14minute first set against 17yearold venus williams in their quarterfinal and dug in for a 16 , 75 , 63 victory the match is n't over after the first set , everyone knows that , williams said you ca n't just say hallelujah and walk off the court while both players used their powerful ground strokes to advantage , neither was able to serve with any authority they split 14 service breaks my whole arsenal is much improved , but i really could n't hold serve , said williams , who added with typical tongueincheek bravado in the future , i do n't plan to be broken ever again davenport has now defeated williams in all three of their meetings , and this victory put her in a second straight grand slam semifinal williams was clearly disappointed by her loss to davenport , who has rankled her with public statements that identified her younger sister serena as the better player of the two sisters but venus williams said she was determined to leave her first australian open on an upbeat note i ca n't be so very unhappy , she said , because this is only my fourth slam most people do n't even have four slams sampras , however , made a decidedly disconsolate exit besides refusing to shake hands with the umpire , lars graff , a breach of etiquette he later regretted , sampras took umbrage when asked if he was not as hungry for grand slam titles as he used to be there s no question what i want the majors , sampras said this is what it all means to me , and i 've still got the desire , still got my tennis , and it s not like i'm getting up in the morning and wondering what i want to do in my life match points conchita martinez of spain , the 1994 wimbledon champion who collected no titles last year , reached the semifinals with a 63 , 62 victory against ninthseeded sandrine testud of france their 79minute match ended on a controversial note when a lineswoman called testud s final volley long , but overruled herself after the chair umpire had already pronounced martinez the victor there was nothing i could do about it , said the eighthseeded martinez , who faces lindsay davenport in the semifinals serena and venus williams played their muchpublicized duels with an obscure atp tour player , 30yearold karsten braasch of germany , the 230thranked qualifier whose habit of lighting up during changeovers prompted the men s tour s

ideas need champions and lee kuan yew , the patriarch and former prime minister of singapore , has proved to be a particularly effective spokesman for asian values , a notion that has gained a wide and receptive audience over the last decade the concept of asian values combines a work ethic , a respect for family and a deference to government authority a kind of protestant ethic without the western reverence for individualism to many westerners as well as asians , asian values have offered a convincing cultural explanation for what appeared to be the bestofbothworlds achievement of much of the region attaining high economic growth while avoiding the rising rates of crime , broken homes and outofwedlock births so common in the west even skeptics saw some merit in the concept still , the economic ascent of asia seemed to occur without a corresponding increase in personal liberty , an independent judiciary or press freedom the region s authoritarian tinge has been an apparent challenge to the more than centuryold western belief that free markets and political liberalism are inextricably linked , selfreinforcing trends mr lee and some others went further they defended the authoritarian arrangements in singapore and other asian nations as essential tools for promoting economic success thus the current asian economic crisis has precipitated a fallout not only in banks and financial markets , but also in intellectual circles , prompting a reexamination of the asianvalues concept and its implicit challenge to the linkage of capitalism and democracy this crisis has certainly taken the wind out of the sails of the asianvalues argument that authoritarian states have an advantage in promoting economic progress , said francis fukuyama , a professor of public policy at george mason university like other critics , mr fukuyama says the asianvalues concept was always too broad a generalization for a vast region of considerable diversity even the term was an overstatement , given that the advocates of asian values were usually speaking of east asia , specifically , the lands east of thailand , basing their cultural and economic arguments on the experience of japan , south korea , taiwan and tiny hong kong and singapore mr fukuyama is bestknown for his 1989 essay the end of history , in which he argued that the end of communism in the east bloc showed that the global drift toward liberal democracy was inevitable now , in an article in the february issue of commentary , he predicts that the economic shocks in asia will hasten political change in the region in short , mr fukuyama writes in commentary , what the current crisis will end up doing is to puncture the idea of asian exceptionalism the sometimes harsh laws of economics have not been repealed in asia , he adds , and neither have the laws of politics the welldocumented correlation between stable democracy and a high level of development surely applies to a region where rising educational achievements and the complex nature of industrial or postindustrial societies will increasingly favor the rule of law and greater popular participation the idea that democracy and capitalism are tightly linked was first presented as a political theory by 19thcentury english liberal writers like james bryce they were trying to explain the erosion of feudalism and the spread of democracy in europe as the industrial revolution was under way in the 1950 s and 60 s , american social scientists asserted that the link between democracy and capitalism helped explain the process of modernization , as many third world nations began industrializing in the midst of the postwar economic boom capitalism s rising wealth , it seemed , led inevitably to democratization , materialism and strains on the social fabric all the forces associated with modernization by the late 60 s , modernization theorists tended to question whether democracy and capitalism were as interrelated as once thought rising affluence clearly affected politics , but scholars observed that the linkage was complicated as samuel p huntington , a harvard political scientist , put it economic development makes democracy possible political leadership makes it real for the last two decades , cultural theorists have gained ground in the world of ideas and popular opinion the notion of civil society , broadly defined as a culture that promotes a healthy economy and society , has been advanced by politicians ranging from hillary clinton to pat buchanan and culture has been increasingly cited as the key determinant of economic and political outcomes culture is certainly the basis for most of what happens in terms of economic progress , said joel kotkin , the author of tribes and a senior fellow of the institute for public policy at pepperdine university and more broadly , it is the cultural virus that shapes most of what societies do and how they do it , politically , economically and otherwise a path similar to the west s in the cultureisdestiny camp , the asianvalues concept has been perhaps the most sweeping claim of all
dame catherine cookson , a determined dockside waif who spun the dross of a squalid childhood into gold as one of britain s most prolific and bestread novelists , died yesterday at her home in a newcastle suburb she was 91 and the author of more than 90 novels with a combined distribution of more than 100 million copies there s not much to be said for growing up coal poor in tyneside , the industrial banks of the tyne in northeastern england , even less for being shamed by an alcoholic mother and never knowing your father then again , by the time she was finished , dame catherine had said quite a lot about the grim life she knew as a girl and illuminated in scores of novels , almost all of them set in the same workingclass world she grew up dreaming of escaping british readers have not seemed to be able to get enough of dame catherine s gritty tales of family conflict , social despair and the debilitating effects of deprivation dame catherine has not only regularly accounted for a third of the books circulated by britain s lending libraries , but of the top 10 titles on last year s circulation list , nine were hers yet she would have been hardpressed to dream up a more unlikely heroine or a tale as compelling as the story of her own life who , after all , would believe that a woman whose childhood humiliations included frequenting pawn shops , collecting driftwood from the tyne , being sexually molested at 7 by her mother s boyfriend , and making daily runs to the pub to fetch her mother and tyrannical grandfather pails of beer would become a successful novelist \? or that a woman whose adult tribulations would include the pain of four pregnancies ending in miscarriage and stillbirth and a devastating nervous breakdown would make an emotional breakthrough at 40 , find salvation through writing and end up as britain s 17th richest woman , with a fortune estimated at 23 million \? even harder to believe is that dame catherine credited the spark that saved her life to her persistent belief as a girl that she was a lady it was a belief , she said , that was fired when an aunt mentioned that her father , a topic she could never discuss with her imperious mother , had been a gentleman and what sort of gentleman would take his pleasure , then abandon a woman he had got with child \? as the aunt explained , he wore an astrakhan collar , and he carried a silvermounted walking stick and kid gloves and , oh yes , he talked lovely \( dame catherine later speculated that her father had been a gentleman s footman \) the notion that she had been born a lady took a startling turn when dame catherine , then known as katie mcmullen , read in a novel that it was a lady s duty to be educated , which she took to heart , beginning a lifelong habit of reading great books she found her immediate escape from poverty by working in laundries , rising to supervisor , saving her money , moving to the southeastern city of hastings and opening a rooming house for men one of her lodgers was a shy , intellectual school teacher named tom cookson , and as dame catherine later told it , it was close to love at first sight when she asked him in for coffee after their first movie date , the two sat up talking until after midnight now , she said , whether it was him , or whether it was me who first leaned to the other i do n't know but we kissed and that was that after their marriage the couple were inseparable , but after experiencing a stillbirth and three miscarriages mrs cookson , who suffered from a lifelong blood disorder , endured years of suicidal depression until her husband suggested she try to overcome her despair by writing her first book , an autobiographical novel called kate hannigan , was published in 1950 , when she was 44 , and mrs cookson was on her way averaging two books a years , she achieved something of a breakthrough in 1968 with her 19th novel , katie mulholland , and her autobiography , our kate although none won literary acclaim , a number of her books , including the black candle , and the velvet gown , were made into television movies , and mrs cookson , an officer of the british empire since 1985 , was made a dame , the equivalent of a knight , in 1993 her husband is her only survivor photo catherine cookson \( associated press , 1991 \)
the legal contracts were potentially among the most lucrative ever granted by new york state , offering the dizzying prospect of tens of millions of dollars in fees fourteen law firms sought the work last year from the state comptroller , h carl mccall , and he retained three , deeming them the most qualified since then , the three firms have distinguished themselves in another way they have become major financial benefactors of mr mccall s reelection campaign the three firms and their lawyers gave a total of more than 165 , 000 to mr mccall , one of the state s most powerful democrats , in the seven months after he chose them in june 1997 , according to disclosure records those donations represented more than 10 percent of the campaign money he collected in that period the lawyers did more than write checks at two of the firms , they also organized fundraisers for mr mccall that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional contributions in an interview , mr mccall said that campaign contributions and political connections had nothing to do with the decision to retain the three firms but he also acknowledged that the money represented what he termed an appearance problem he added , though , that lawyers in his office selected the firms after rigorously reviewing the qualifications of the 14 that applied , emphasizing that he merely approved the choices there is nothing inappropriate about the money that has been given to me , he said it s all within the rules the lawyers in my office who made the recommendations to me had absolutely no knowledge of who gave me money or wanted to give me money the comptroller retained the firms , all of which have close ties to the democratic party , to represent the huge state pension fund in classaction securities litigation the job is so potentially profitable because the firms could reap enormous contingency fees from the lawsuits that they file on behalf of the 105 billion fund , which is controlled by mr mccall and has extensive stock holdings such fees can run as high as 30 percent of the damages awarded in the cases the firms denied that their contributions were linked to mr mccall s decision to retain them for the pension fund they are unrelated , said leonard barrack , a senior partner at one firm mr barrack of barrack , rodos bacine of philadelphia , was named finance chairman of the democratic national committee last february he is charged with overseeing the party s fundraising across the country while the three firms have experience in classaction securities cases and the comptroller described them as the best of the applicant pool , his office has declined to reveal the names of the 11 firms that were passed over , even though most state agencies routinely release such information and state law appears to require it mr mccall has collected nearly 5 million for his reelection campaign , among the highest totals for candidates for statewide office this year , and he has 35 million in the bank he is facing a littleknown republican , bruce a blakeman , a nassau county legislator who entered the race in early june and has just begun raising money like barrack , rodos , the two other firms that mr mccall selected are no strangers to democratic politics trial lawyers have long been influential in the party because they are among its largest donors but most of the donors from the three firms had not contributed to mr mccall s campaign before june 1997 melvyn i weiss , a senior partner at another of the three firms , milberg , weiss , bershad , hynes lerach of manhattan , was vice chairman of the new york delegation to the democratic national convention in 1996 , and gave a party for delegates at the state democratic convention in may the third firm is bernstein , litowitz , berger grossmann , one of whose partners , max w berger , has also been a big contributor to democratic candidates campaign contributions by lawyers to elected officials who control legal contracts have come under growing scrutiny in recent years , and some lawyers' groups are considering banning the practice , known as pay to play if they do , the groups would be following the lead of the bond industry , which tightly restricts political giving asserting that he was concerned about ethics in government , mr mccall said he favored a law barring donors who do business with the state from contributing to candidates for state office but he said that until such a ban exists , he would not unilaterally stop collecting such money any time that this happens , there is going to be an appearance problem , he said , contending that all prominent state officials face similar situations that is why we have to change the rules the retainer arrangements with the three firms do not include a fixed duration , so it appears that the comptroller can dismiss any firm at will each firm signs a new contract with the office when he asks it to pursue a lawsuit the comptroller has discretion in choosing which firms get cases , said steven greenberg , his spokesman barrack , rodos has received one case , and bernstein , litowitz has received two milberg , weiss has not yet received one because no cases are completed , none of the firms have been paid fees so far
ceibal , guatemala , march 29 to get to this remote mayan ruin deep in the heart of northern guatemala , a visitor must drive south for an hour and a half on a dirt road from the flores airport , ride a motor boat up la pasion river for close to an hour and climb for 20 minutes or so up a steep , narrow path through the jungle to the first clearing there the flat , round temple of the wind sits , crowned by a platform where mayan dancers performed ritual ceremonies some 1 , 200 years ago a little further on are more temples and many tall , carved limestone tablets known as stelae here and there , stone steps run up the side of a mound , signaling that another building in this still largely unexcavated city lies below for a growing number of tourists , the ruins of ceibal \( pronounced sayball \) are more than worth the rigors of the trip the trouble is , ceibal is even more rewarding for less benign visitors looters regularly attack it and hundreds of equally remote mayan ruins with picks , shovels , jackhammers and saws , seeking ancient objects and slicing off pieces of stelae for illicit sale in the international art market and each year guatemala s growing population clears more rain forest surrounding the ruins for farmland , robbing them of their natural protection from the strong winds and heavy rains that cause erosion in a drastic measure to halt the destruction , guatemala s minister of culture and sports , augusto vela mena , plans to move more than 200 stelae and some altars and other carvings from here and about 10 other sites in the petex batun region , which was the center of the mayan world in the classic period from ad 200 to 900 the uprooted artifacts will go on view in a visitors' center to be built in sayaxche \( pronounced sahyashchay \) , a small town nearby visitors to the ruins will see replicas instead of the real thing half the cost is being covered by a 160 , 000 gift from the guatemalan unit of the philip morris companies , the embattled american tobacco giant , whose business in guatemala is growing mr vela mena announced the initiative with fanfare on friday evening in guatemala city before leaving on a twoday publicity tour of a few sites the ransackers are not only stealing our artifacts , he said , they are stealing the history of our nation the mayan civilization , which spanned 3 , 000 years beginning around 2000 bc and covered territory in what is today mexico , belize , el salvador and honduras as well as guatemala , is considered to be the most important precolumbian culture in the americas most of what is known about the mayas was discovered by decoding the graceful glyphs that artisans carved on the stelae since his appointment two years ago , mr vela mena , who is half maya himself , has made saving the ruins , the vast majority of which have already been lost , into something of a crusade , with the new measure just one component some members of the army who are no longer needed , since guatemala s 35year civil war ended in december 1996 , are being trained to guard the mayan sites and mr vela mena is pushing to halt the export of artifacts , which has been illegal since the 1960 s , and to recover items that have left the country in an interview , mr vela mena said he had worked with united states customs service to take back more than 500 artifacts that dealers or collectors were trying to export illegally to the united states he has also made a claim on a collection of 137 maya items donated in 1987 to the museum of fine arts in boston the museum says the claim has no merit , but guatemala plans to continue pressing its case we need to destroy the market , mr vela mena said we want to discourage collectors from buying , on the theory that looting will continue as long as they can buy fine mayan pieces can fetch anywhere from 30 , 000 to 300 , 000 or more last may , sotheby s sold a mayan jade figure from around ad 200 for a record 322 , 000 in the united states , which has specifically prohibited the import of any mayan archeological material lacking an export license since 1991 , some of the illegal trading of freshly dugup artifacts has stopped , experts said but it is flourishing elsewhere we know there are different places in europe that are selling our treasures , mr vela mena said , though he declined to identify the countries like the united states , most european nations have signed the 1970 unesco convention to protect cultural objects from illegal trade , but mr vela mena said that was not enough we need bilateral agreements with all the countries in europe , he said so far , he has none in the meantime , the guatemalan government will start removing many of the best monuments from their sites , a plan that met a mixed reception among archeologists anything that can be done to protect the sites is desperately needed , said clemency coggins , an expert in mayan archeology at boston university she said the money would be better spent on site protection one of the best uses of money is to employ guards this sounds like a touristic enterprise , she added , though it s probably a good idea because stelae do deteriorate other archeologists said the most immediate need was to stabilize the monuments against further erosion with new conservation techniques mr vela mena said that his new plan was indeed intended to help develop a local tourism industry the government wants tourism , now second in economic importance to coffee , to be the no 1 industry by the turn of the century but the minister also said that the government could not possibly guard the 2 , 200 known mayan sites , which are spread over about 40 percent of the country only about 100 sites have guards , and they can only do so much against the bands of wellarmed thieves who roam the country last year , about a dozen looters shot and killed a guard who interfered with their pillaging of a ruin near the border with belize they got away , mr vela mena said here at ceibal , looters got the altar of the monkey , a round tablet once supported by three stone monkeys , last november a large group of armed bandits walked off with the only monkey that had not been eroded the two guards could do nothing at another nearby ruin , about threequarters of the 100 buildings have been illegally excavated , the minister said with few resources from the government for his crusade , mr vela mena wants to encourage other corporate donors and is not troubled by the tobacco connection we do n't mind getting money from the company that produces cigarettes , he said we think it s important for any company interested to help us preserve our country , because the mayan culture is for the whole world besides , the mayans gave the world tobacco mayan priests used it in ceremonies the gift is one of the first corporate donations to the mayan cause , although a german bank has contributed money for restoration at tikal , a huge mayan site that is a favorite of tourists and is protected as a national park the philip morris gift , though small by the company s standards , is 10 times the annual budget of the nonprofit organization that administers tikal besides ceibal , the sites whose most important stelae will be replaced with replicas are dos pilas , aquateca , altar de sacrificios , cancuen , tamarindito and punta chimino local artisans have already been trained to make the replicas photo culture minister augusto vela mena of guatemala with a vandalized monkey altar \( kimberly white for the new york

rye brook , ny , may 28 the state s democratic faithful had gathered this morning all primed for another day of partisan bashing of senator alfonse m d'amato and gov george e pataki , buoyant talk of their party s revival and woeful predictions about life under republican rule instead , they got an apocalyptic senator daniel patrick moynihan having come prepared to address the state democratic convention about the party s need to build support upstate , the state s senior senator instead veered off into a 20minute dissertation on the threat of nuclear war in south asia and the middle east as mr moynihan , a former ambassador to india and the united nations , recounted warnings he made 24 years ago about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , the halffilled hall buzzed with restless murmuring at one point , when the senator announced that he was almost finished , someone in the back muttered , thank god unfazed , or perhaps unaware , mr moynihan continued , every man , woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of damocles hanging by the slenderest of threads his aides said the senator had thrown away his partybuilding speech this morning after hearing that pakistan had tested five nuclear weapons on wednesday but eschewing a political stemwinder in favor of a meaty policy pronouncement is entirely in keeping with mr moynihan s style , which seems to be annoying some of his fellow democrats a former harvard professor , he was elected in 1976 without having worked his way up the party ranks and ever since has maintained an almost zenlike detachment from the nittygritty workings of the party organization for years , when the state was run by democratic governors , mr moynihan s lack of party involvement went little noticed and carried few consequences but today , with the democrats struggling to recover from the 1994 election of mr pataki under the guiding hand of mr d'amato , more democrats are wondering why mr moynihan has not done more to raise money and build grassroots support for the party and some democrats in recent days have begun invidiously contrasting mr moynihan to their archnemesis , mr d'amato , whose bosslike stewardship of the state republican party transformed it from a debtridden mess to a wellfinanced juggernaut people wonder why he wo n't just do basic fundraising , said one democratic official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity i'm not talking about the outrageous stuff d'amato does i'm just talking about baseline stuff , little events when asked by reporters on wednesday to compare mr moynihan s role in the democratic party with mr d'amato s leadership of the republicans , the state senate minority leader , martin connor , just threw up his hands and said , another day the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , dodged the same question with a wave of his hand the grumping grew so loud here that the westchester county democratic chairman , david a alpert , actually said that he would not endorse mr moynihan if the senator decided to seek a fifth term in 2000 he s done nothing , mr alpert said today asked about the senator s address , mr alpert said , it was a great speech for the washington press corps asked what he plans to do in 2000 , mr moynihan , who is vigorous at 71 , replied , i hope to be alive none of this sotto voce griping is new to mr moynihan i 've had 22 years of this , he told reporters last week when asked about the criticism but i keep getting elected , he continued it kind of helps when a reporter asked mr moynihan why he did not work as hard as mr d'amato for his party , the senator replied with a sheepish laugh , one reason is that i do n't have his skills during the news conference today , the city council speaker , peter f vallone , whom mr moynihan has endorsed for governor , came to his defense you 're being too modest , senator , said mr vallone , who stood beside mr moynihan at the microphone you also brought hundreds of millions of dollars back in transportation money to new york city later , mr vallone , a longtime friend who is among the few candidates mr moynihan has ever endorsed in a primary , said the senator operates in a different sphere from the hardscrabble world of state politics he s not the guy you call up to fix the pothole , mr vallone said you call al d'amato , and al d'amato will call someone like me other democrats said they have grown accustomed to mr moynihan s erudite digressions and that it was not what they expect from him anyway he s not a political person , said assemblyman herman d farrell jr , a manhattan democrat he was n't elected as a political person you elect him because he s the brightest guy down there and when all is said and done , they will see he is the best candidate for the party photo senator daniel patrick moynihan spoke to democrats yesterday \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
edgartown , mass , aug 22 some vacation president clinton fled washington on tuesday after the most excruciating day of his public life , seeking solace and solitude on martha s vineyard but instead of the relaxation he had found on previous summer vacations on the island , this time he confronted the unpleasant job of trying to repair the damage done to his marriage by his now painfully public affair with a young white house intern meanwhile , his staff in washington was trying to find a way to heal the breach of trust with the public from his monday night revelations and the opinion industry was debating whether mr clinton was the first figure in history to try to obstruct justice with a necktie then , in the small hours of thursday morning , he gave the final order to launch 75 cruise missiles against terrorist targets in the sudan and afghanistan president once again , and not just the prodigal husband in the doghouse and supplicant for national absolution , mr clinton donned a deep blue suit and flew back to washington to oversee the aftermath of the attacks he could concentrate on bomb damage assessment rather than on personal and political damage control the president is 'pooped' mr clinton returned to the vineyard on friday night , spent a quiet evening at home and slept late today the president is pooped , said his press secretary , michael d mccurry he s had a long week , mr mccurry said except for a quiet birthday dinner with vernon e jordan jr and his wife , ann , on wednesday , the clintons have not ventured from their borrowed estate on oyster pond on the south shore of the island no golf , no sailing , no parties , no kennedys the president had a very busy week and a somewhat stressful week , mr mccurry said today he s had a lot on his mind this week on multiple fronts today is the day he s finally doing what he came up here to do , which is relax and enjoy himself a bit he is definitely in vacation mode as for the family fencemending that is on the president s agenda for this vacation , mr mccurry said , he is working at it my guess is they still have work to do , mr mccurry said but , he added , they are doing it in private and i'm not going to give you a playbyplay account the first lady , hillary rodham clinton , was described by friends as embarrassed and humiliated by her husband s extracurricular behavior and the damage he has done to his presidency no one outside the family really knows what is going on inside the walls of the summer white house but a close friend of the president s who has witnessed previous family crises said that clintonian family healing is a quiet affair , with a somewhat sheepish president and a frosty first lady warily circling each other , waiting for an opportunity to engage as the clintons left the white house on tuesday , their daughter , chelsea , walked between her father and mother , holding each by the hand isolated in the vineyard in his address on monday night , mr clinton said he was prepared to do whatever it takes to atone to his family it is not yet known what that will be , but the early evidence is that mr clinton is being kept on a tight leash on the island prominent summer residents who have socialized with the clintons in past summers have not yet heard from them and none will say they are prepared to call the first family , given the circumstances i do n't sense there s a feeling among people that he s persona non grata or a pariah or anything else , said ron rappaport , a vineyard native who has attended parties with the clintons i think he s a welcome visitor who needs his vacation and needs his space there may be a reason the clintons have been reluctant to venture out virtually everyone here with access to a word processor and an oped page has hashed over the president s behavior in the past seven months jules feiffer , the cartoonist who has skewered the president repeatedly this year , does not expect to be invited to any events involving the clintons for some strange reason , mr feiffer said , he does n't come near me alan dershowitz , lawyer and author , had the chutzpah to show up at the airport to greet the clintons on tuesday , even though he has secondguessed mr clinton s response to the starr investigation in several opinion articles i was there for one reason , to show i'm not a fairweather friend , mr dershowitz said i 've been somewhat critical of the president in print i 've not followed the white house line i do n't think he should be impeached , but i do n't agree with everything he s done a word in a puzzle given that kind of support , it is not surprising that mr clinton is lying low , reading thrillers and working crossword puzzles but even the puzzles do not provide a complete respite as mr clinton was flying to martha s vineyard on tuesday doing the crossword puzzle in the new york times at warp speed , as is his wont , he was stopped cold by clue 46 down meal for the humble \? read the clue , calling for a fourletter answer the president laughed in a bemused way , said an aide sitting nearby here s one appropriate for today , the president said , and inked in the answer , crow

hempstead , ny , sept 29 two weeks ago , glenn foley s chances of playing through his rib cartilage injury were ruined when bill parcells sneaked up behind him and squeezed foley tried to hide the pain , which he said nearly caused him to collapse , but he winced that was enough to persuade parcells to hand the ball to vinny testaverde today , with two weeks of workouts around a bye week to allow him to heal , foley declared himself ready to return to the lineup as proof , he offered this solicitation to his coach i'm inviting him this week to do it parcells declined , at least in his news conference it s called the squeeze test , he said with a wicked grin , adding that the team s internist , dr elliott pellman , has joined him in endorsing the test my dr pellman says it s going to take the place of the mri it transmits more information quickly but just because parcells said he would keep his hands to himself does not mean that foley will not be tested with testaverde guiding the jets to a 446 victory over the indianapolis colts , parcells is confident that the backup can perform so it is up to foley to convince the coach that he is ready to perform at full capacity when the jets face the unbeaten dolphins in miami on sunday here s the thing i have to be concerned with as a coach , parcells said if a player has something whatever player , this is not just glenn foley if a player has something that is going to , or is capable of , affecting his performance to the point where it would be deterrent to you winning the game , you ca n't allow it to happen you ca n't allow it to happen as a coach parcells added certain things guys have a little something wrong and they can get by , playing their position , doing what they 're asked to do , and it s bothersome but it s not dysfunctional and it does n't inhibit your team s chances of winning now , am i going to know that before the game starts \? the answer to that is probably no i'm not going to know for sure but i know what i'm looking for in the game , and he knows what i'm looking for so if i see certain signs , then i have to react to them parcells said that the status of receiver wayne chrebet \( sprained ankle \) and linebacker james farrior \( sprained knee \) is similar to foley s they are all listed as questionable and cleared by doctors to play , but that they must prove themselves gameready as long as foley can show parcells on the practice field that he can place his performance ahead of protecting himself , he will very likely get the start on sunday but parcells said that testaverde would still receive half of the snaps in practice this week i'm ready to roll , foley said i had some time to heal up i did just that and i practiced full last week it s going to be the same this week we 'll just wait and see what he thinks i'm ready to go basically , i relaxed last week i was in here every day i'm ready i'm back facing the dolphins , who already are 30 , including a 20 mark in the american football conference east , is a challenge that parcells and the jets cannot afford to take chances with under jimmy johnson , the dolphins' defense has become a force , ranking first in the afc and second in the national football league in their last game , the dolphins shut out the pittsburgh steelers , 210 so testaverde , who played for johnson at the university of miami , is ready if the call comes to start or relieve i think stepping in last week and helping this team win its first game of the year , it helps me to feel accepted , to feel more a part of this team , testaverde said i feel good about that win now all that s behind me and we move forward the other thing is the players , when i'm on the field with them , they know what i'm like in a regular game situation they know what to expect that goes a long way parcells is making sure none of his injured players feels too comfortable they have got an excuse in place for not playing i do n't want players to ever have that , he said they ca n't have that everyone has one of these six weeks into the season everybody has got something that s bothering them are you cautious with some guys \? yes a little more aggressive with others \? yes but it depends on the job you 're asking them to do time is always better , but there s only 16 games and pretty soon the season is over extra points ray lucas will take snaps at wide receiver and quarterback this week and the status of wayne chrebet and glenn foley will determine how he is used the jets signed linebacker john munch , who was with the team in training camp , and waived lamont burns from the practice squad
twentyfour years after a school district in east harlem began one of the nation s most extensive experiments in educational competition , a study released yesterday found that the district s program of allowing students to choose what schools to attend had lifted achievement in all schools and had not created a system of haves and havenots the program , which has been used as a model throughout the country , nearly doubled the overall number of schools and created many small schools as alternatives to the traditional neighborhood school the study , by two political scientists at the state university of new york at stony brook , found that both reading and math scores began rising steadily after the schoolchoice program began in 1974 , at a time when district 4 in east harlem was ranked last in new york city scores have gone up in all schools , both the neighborhood schools and the new alternative ones , the researchers said , contrary to fears that a choice system would create a district in which some schools are unfairly favored and although the improvement leveled off or declined slightly in the late 1980 s , the district is still performing better on reading and math tests than schools in the rest of the city with similar concentrations of students from poor families who move frequently and do not speak english well the data show quite clearly that choice in district 4 has not produced any 'loser' school , said the report by dr paul teske and dr mark schneider to the contrary our data show most of these schools have improved over time , suggesting that choice has put competitive pressure on all schools to improve the east harlem experiment has been widely imitated by other innercity school systems across the country and cited as a model of school reform by william j bennett , the former united states education secretary but although school choice systems based on small alternative schools were viewed as the vanguard of reform just a few years ago , they have fallen out of the spotlight more recently , at least in new york city some critics have said the alternative schools engineer their own success by importing students from other districts , getting grants not available to neighborhood schools and skimming the best students dr teske and dr schneider said yesterday that they had looked at each of those objections and found that none of them were decisive factors in the east harlem gains instead , they found that the strongest factor was the number of new schools created , and the district 4 program did just that in effect , expanding the marketplace for every school created , scores went up about 15 percentage points in 1974 , when anthony alvarado , the district 4 superintendent , began the experiment , east harlem had 22 schools in 22 buildings , the researchers said over the next decade , it created more than 20 new schools reacting to the report , schools chancellor rudy crew who has been criticized for not supporting small schools as strongly as previous chancellors said yesterday he would like to see choice expanded in new york city we 're seeing evidence of true educational reform where there is a combination of local autonomy and central support , entrepreneurial spirit and a wise use of data , dr crew said improved student achievement is the net result of this kind of competition the study , which was presented at a lecture at the harvard club , was paid for by the manhattan institute s center for educational innovation , which has supported school choice systems , which allow any child in the district to apply to alternative schools seymour fliegel , a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and the first director of alternative schools in district 4 , said he saw the report as an affirmation of the ability of alternative schools to really save and protect public education , at a time when it is under attack by proponents of vouchers vouchers provide public money to send students to private schools noting that east harlem is one of the poorest communities in the nation , mr fliegel said the study showed that schools can excel even in poor neighborhoods and that it is unfair to blame poor schools on their students the study compared reading and math scores in district 4 with the citywide average at the same time , to ensure that results would not be skewed by different tests district 4 serves about 14 , 000 students in prekindergarten through ninth grade , the study said in 1974 , east harlem elementary and middle schools were performing about half as well as students in the city as a whole as choice expanded , test scores rose steadily , peaking in the early 1980 s at nearly 100 percent of the citywide average in reading and more than 90 percent in math reading scores declined slightly in the late 1980 s , which the study attributed to new district leaders' slackening interest in alternative schools nonetheless , the authors said , district 4 is now performing at more than 80 percent of the citywide average , nearly double its 1974 level , and improving to make sure that choice , and not some other factor was driving the improvement , the researchers looked at the ratio of students to teachers , the experience of teachers , the poverty rate , and the percentage of black and hispanic students in the district the data showed that by far the most decisive ingredient was choice east harlem schools also outperform schools in the rest of the city with similar demographics , including poverty , race , immigration and english proficiency , the study said in 1996 , district 4 schools scored 8 percentage points higher than similar schools on sixth grade reading , and 46 points higher on sixth grade math whether the schools were large or small did not make a difference , the study said the study noted , however , that in spite of its gains , district 4 still ranks low citywide 21st out of 32 school districts with a score of 393 percent of students reading at or above grade level on the city reading test it would be impressive indeed if we could argue that choice , or any reform , could break the relationship between test scores and parent socioeconomic status , the authors said no reform has yet been able to achieve that
you know the religious right is in meltdown when jerry falwell and ralph reed lend a helping hand to dreamworks , the clinton administration s favorite movie studio this week newsweek reveals that both men have joined the ranks of religious experts serving as behindthescenes sounding boards for the mogul jeffrey katzenberg , as he readies his hopedfor christmas blockbuster , prince of egypt remember mr katzenberg \? he was last seen hugging al gore from behind in a photograph taken in the white house the night of the tony blair dinner the picture showed him , the vice president and the first lady all campaigning to persuade elton john to plug a prince of egypt song now reverend falwell whose previous cinematic promotions include the clinton chronicles , a documentary accusing the president of murder and drugdealing has boosted mr katzenberg s film as elton john did not seduced by an advance screening , mr falwell has given prince of egypt described by variety as an animated life of moses from bullrush to exodus two thumbs up they have done a great job of making it entertainment , he exclaims to newsweek , though he stopped short of assessing val kilmer s and michelle pfeiffer s vocal performances in leading roles astounding as the dreamworksfalwell synergy is , it is only the most bizarre example of the religious right s recent erratic behavior others include the oncemighty christian coalition has been in free fall since mr reed abandoned it for the mammon of political consulting last april faced with declining contributions , it canned a fifth of its staff just in time for christmas , downsized its capitol hill office and dropped its highly publicized programs of outreach to africanamerican and catholic churches its finances are under investigation by both the federal election commission and the irs and last week , ominously enough , its founder , pat robertson , agreed to cough up huge penalties to settle another tax case involving his christian broadcasting network gary bauer , the family research council leader who aspires to fill the power vacuum left by mr reed , has proved to have a remarkable gift for selfimmolation his campaign to bully the republican national committee to cut off funds to prochoice candidates like christine todd whitman and rudolph giuliani lost handily in january the one house candidate he s backed with grisly partial birth abortion tv ads , in california , was defeated this month what to do for an encore \? the starryeyed mr bauer is dropping hints that he 'd like to throw away the rest of his money and credibility on an egogratifying kamikaze run for the presidency as reported by laurie goodstein on the front page of monday s times , religiousright leaders including mr bauer are so disheartened by the gop s post'96 cold shoulder that they have formed an independent political force to hound the party to ideological purity and whom did they select as chairman of this juggernaut \? paul weyrich , the guy you get when attila the hun is unavailable mr weyrich s methods of courting republican leaders have included publicly questioning trent lott s patriotism and accusing orrin hatch of having psychological problems none of this is to say that the religious right is dead as a political force it will continue to foment civil war in the gop over abortion in 2000 , as it did in '96 it still is ready , willing and able to beat up on homosexuals the christian coalition s only postreed victory has been to help defeat a gay civil rights measure in maine but if mr falwell and other religiousright peers give their all to help turn prince of egypt into the megahit dreamworks is praying for , they 'll be shooting themselves in another foot the film s potentially huge profits will accrue not only to mr katzenberg but to his dreamworks partners , steven spielberg and david geffen also major contributors to the democrats and liberal causes it just goes to show that in a country where no one can resist the siren call of hollywood , it s now entertainment , not politics , that makes for strange bedfellows by jumping on the prince of egypt bandwagon , jerry falwell , our foremost clintonhater , is already fattening the campaign chest for al gore
researchers at the memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york have found that a protein seems to predict which prostate cancers are likely to be deadly and warrant aggressive treatment and which can be controlled with less treatment or perhaps none at all the new findings , published this week in the journal of the national cancer institute , also support the current understanding that benign enlargement of the prostate , which occurs in many men as they age , is an entirely separate development from prostate cancer and does not lead to it the studies involve a protein called p27 , which other research suggests plays an important role in controlling the growth of many cancers that arise in lining tissues throughout the body studies in boston , seattle , toronto and england have linked abnormally low levels of the p27 protein to aggressive cancers of the breast , the colon , the lung and the esophagus this protein represents a common mechanism that helps to control and regulate cell growth , explained dr howard scher , who directs genitourinary oncology at memorial sloankettering it may help us predict who will be cured and who wo n't , and help determine who may need additional treatment to improve the chance of cure dr carlos cordoncardo , director of molecular pathology at sloankettering , said p27 acted like a brake that kept cell growth in check when levels of this protein are low or absent , cells are likely to proliferate rapidly rapid cell growth can increase the chances of genetic mutations that may allow a cancer to develop and grow uncontrolled dr cordoncardo explained that men with prostate cancer have a normal gene that regulates the production of the p27 protein but in those with an aggressive prostate cancer that is most likely to spread and be fatal , the tumor seems to have a professional blender that chews up the protein in men with less aggressive tumors that may be curable without extensive treatment , p27 levels are much higher , he said two tumors may look alike under the microscope , dr cordoncardo said , and yet one patient may go on for years without the cancer spreading , and the other may die of his cancer in two years if we can prognosticate at the time of diagnosis , we can determine who should be treated more aggressively in treatment of prostate cancer , the choices include radical surgery , radiation therapy , radioactive implants , hormonal control and chemotherapy , all of which involve varying degrees of both shortterm and longlasting side effects the emerging understanding of p27 s role in cancer grows out of previous work by dr joan massague and dr andrew koff , molecular biologists at sloankettering who first isolated and cloned the protein dr koff showed that mice without the p27 gene developed overgrowth of the prostate gland , similar to the growth that occurs in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia in men with this benign condition , the p27 gene is inactive , and little or no p27 protein is produced in men with prostate cancer , on the other hand , the gene is active , but in some cases the tumor has the ability to chew up the protein that the gene produces the degradation of p27 protein by cancers of the colon was first described last year by dr massimo loda of the danafarber cancer institute in boston and dr miguele pagano of new york university dr loda said that in colon cancer patients who initially had high levels of the protein but whose tumors spread years later , the protein was lost in the process of metastasis we also found that p27 protein was involved in lung cancers and breast cancers , dr loda said dr scher , of sloankettering , suggested that in the future it might be possible to identify a switch that would enable the p27 protein to remain active and slow the growth of tumor cells
most managers would have secondguessed themselves if not publicly , then most certainly in private but after san diego manager bruce bochy s biggest gamble of the national league championship series backfired , bochy not only stood by his decision to insert his ace starter , kevin brown , into game 5 with the padres nine outs from a trip to the world series , but he nearly did it again wednesday in game 6 do n't think i did n't think about it , a champagnesoaked bochy said amid the revelry in the visitors' clubhouse at turner field in atlanta after the padres had won their first pennant in 14 years i still think that was the best move i made and it did n't work almost everything else has for bochy this postseason the padres slumped in september after they had easily run away with the national league west but the padres defeated randy johnson twice in their threegamestoone upset of the houston astros in the division series and then the padres ran up a threegamestonone lead over the winningest braves team in the history of the franchise before taking the series , 42 , and earning bochy his first trip to yankee stadium when steve finley ran down michael tucker s fly to leftcenter field for the final out of the series \( tucker had hit the goahead homer off brown in game 5 \) , the padres had saddled the braves with the unwanted distinction of having the most regularseason victories \( 106 \) of any team that failed to advance to the world series in the aftermath of the padres' upset , the focus was on such players as sterling hitchcock , the overlooked lefthander who won games 3 and 6 to earn the honor of most valuable player of the series brown , who struck out a playoffrecord 16 batters in game 1 of the division series before tossing a threehit shutout in game 2 of the championship series , and tony gwynn , the eighttime batting champion and only remaining player from san diego s sole world series team , in 1984 but according to the players , coaches and general manager of the padres , the person most deserving of credit was one of gwynn s teammates on that 1984 team that would be bochy , a backup catcher in 1984 , who singled against the tigers as a pinchhitter in his only world series atbat bochy , now 43 , played in parts of nine major league seasons , all in the national league , including 17 games with the lastplace 1982 mets he has managed for four years , and he appears to be adored and respected by his team the closest thing bochy has had to a distraction this postseason has been jim leyritz s desire to see more playing time but even leyritz , who has campaigned for more playing time with every team he has been on , has made it a point to say that he wanted to get to the world series in part so everyone would see just how good a manager bochy is bochy , who is two regularseason victories short of becoming the winningest manager in the history of the padres franchise , seems relatively anonymous even though he has now guided the smallmarket padres to two division titles in the last three years , san diego general manager kevin towers remarked with wonder before game 6 at how bochy is still overshadowed by the managers in his own division , a list that now includes jim leyland , dusty baker and buck showalter boch s biggest quality is that he s able to deal with players in the 90 s , towers said earlier in the series he s probably one of the funniest guys i 've ever been around and he s able to keep people loose but he s not afraid to crack the whip and he 'll do it behind closed doors so as not to embarrass people he s great with the bullpen and he s a pretty good field tactician , too you 're not going to see him run out of players at the end of a game and i think boch goes a lot on his own gut instincts that much was clear when he summoned kevin brown in game 5 bochy went with his convictions in the face of the book when the padres won game 6 behind hitchcock and four relievers not named brown , the happiest people in atlanta were bochy s players and staff give him some credit , said dave stewart , san diego s pitching coach boch did a real good job of managing this club inside pitch the padres are scheduled to work out at yankee stadium at 3 pm today san diego manager bruce bochy announced yesterday that kevin brown would start game 1 and andy ashby game 2 he declined to name the rest of his rotation jim leyritz will almost certainly be the designated hitter for the first two games of the series photo nearly everything bruce bochy touches has turned to gold this postseason \( associated press \)

as the last few minutes ticked away last april 14 in philadelphia , bernie bickerstaff watched disgustedly from the sideline the rookie allen iverson , on instruction from his coach , had just hoisted another 3pointer in a game the 76ers would lose by 21 points bickerstaff , the washington coach , had had enough wanting the game to be over , he told his players to back away and let iverson , who was trying to keep his string of 40point games alive , shoot unguarded i understood what it meant for allen and the organization , but i just wanted to get out of there , said bickerstaff , whose team won the game , 131110 they kept calling timeouts to set up plays , and we were blowing them out i did n't understand that from grooved fastballs to frivolous timeouts to free layups , the notion of athletes and teams conspiring to bolster or break records is hardly new sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't often enough , there are bruised feelings perhaps nowhere is the phenomenon more prevalent than in the national basketball association , where several recent incidents have something in common with tuesday night s connecticutvillanova women s basketball game in that contest , uconn s injured star , nykesha sales , was allowed to come out on the floor with a ruptured achilles' tendon and , with consent from the opposing villanova team , become the school s careerleading scorer by putting in an uncontested layup but cooperation was n't the theme on jan 12 , 1996 , when the knicks were on their way to a comfortable victory over boston m l carr , then the celtics' coach , began calling timeouts to make sure that dana barros , who had made at least one 3pointer in 89 consecutive games , kept his streak alive don nelson , then the knicks' coach , did not mind the strategy , but he was going to have fun at boston s expense and make sure barros made the shot with a hand or two , or three , in his face in what deteriorated into bad comedy , he told the knicks to begin double and tripleteaming the small celtics guard barros took several offbalance shots from behind the 3point line none of which went in nelson and the knicks left the court like mischievous kids carr was incensed he asked an official for the game ball , walked toward nelson and lobbed it at his head from behind as he left the court it was a milestone for dana , just like it was a milestone for nykesha , carr said yesterday dana will remember that forever , but for different reasons than he should have two months after the barros incident , orlando s anthony bowie called a timeout with 27 seconds to go in a game that the magic had already wrapped up the reason \? bowie wanted one more assist to give him his first tripledouble detroit coach doug collins was so angry that he waved his team to the side of the court bowie got his assist , with no pistons in sight baseball has had its share of these episodes , too earlier this decade , commissioner fay vincent and the acting commissioner bud selig twice turned down the chicago white sox when they tried to get permission for the senior citizen minnie minoso \( born nov 29 , 1922 \) to play in a regularseason game the team was trying to stretch minoso s streak of consecutive decades of playing in a major league baseball game to six he had retired in 1964 , then came back with a wink to play three games in 1976 and two games in 1980 to keep the streak going but enough was enough , vincent and selig ruled on the other hand , in september 1968 , in the last month of mickey mantle s career , detroit pitcher denny mclain let mantle know that he would give him a pitch fit for a home run mantle , who had not hit one out of the park in four weeks , proceeded to put one in the upper deck for his 535th homer , thus passing jimmie foxx on the career list
when outoftown friends come to visit new york , phillip lopate puts down whatever book he is editing and laces up the sturdy walking shoes of a tour guide he leads the visitors through haunted blocks of williamsburg , from which he escaped his family s lurid quarrels , and into the artdeco towers of lower manhattan , their lobbies gilded and soaring beyond the imagination of his old neighborhood and he does n't stop for nuisance necessities like food or rest i was hungry , and he was making me look up and admire the detail , said his old friend , the novelist max apple , recalling a trip from houston he wore me out , showing me all these lobbies of buildings , but he does n't get tired he lives for walking the street mr lopate s knowledge of the city not just the interior life of new york dreamers , but the bricks and odors of an actual town is one of several reasons why he was chosen to edit the sweeping anthology of literature about new york just issued by the library of america , a special volume celebrating the centenary of the city s consolidation at more than 1 , 000 pages , writing new york includes essays , stories and poetry by 108 authors , from washington irving to vivian gornick , and each bit of pigment contributes to a portrait that none of them could have written alone if the publishers also suspected that mr lopate would be as indefatigable a reader as he is a walker , they may have been on to something he spent two years wayfaring through old newspapers , magazines and journals , searching for fresh insights into each epoch of the city and delighting like a literary archaeologist in unfamiliar descriptions thus the book combines familiar thoroughfares melville s complete bartleby , the scrivener and paeans from e b white , hart crane and walt whitman with winding sidestreets from writers little known to those who have not made mr lopate s journey there is , for example , nathaniel parker willis s closely observed description of the sidewalk in front of st paul s chapel on lower broadway , from 1843 there is charles dickens s outrage at conditions in the tombs in 1842 , and sketches from such visitors as jose marti , wong chin foo and celine dawn powell was both amused and appalled in her cocktailparty diaries of 1939 , and langston hughes had a swell time at houserent parties in harlem , even as he heard the growing bitterness shaking the floorboards there is also this line from edmund wilson s random thoughts in 1926 people on lexington avenue are wishing that they lived in a more cheerful street as a wellknown essayist who annually compiles essay anthologies for anchor books , mr lopate knew better than to search for breadth , for the overarching pieces that try to digest the city whole just as new york is a city of villages , so is the book new york is infinite nobody comes to the end of it , nobody can boast too well that they know all of it , he said , in his booklined brownstone in carroll gardens , brooklyn \( the line echoes a famous description of brooklyn by thomas wolfe , which is of course included in the book \) so the way to get at it is by colliding impressions , some geographical , some of it class perceptions you have henry james recoiling at the spectacle of immigrants pouring into ellis island , side by side with abraham cahan writing about his fellow jews casting their sins into the east river a few themes were consistent in writing through the two centuries , he said the contrasts between glamour and squalor , celebrity and alienation , density and loneliness the obsession with commerce , and what he describes in the introduction as the city s addictive , temptress quality , which ensnares newcomers and convinces them no matter how they may suffer at its hands that no place else will do the book , a departure from the usual format of the library of america s volumes , doubled in size from its originally planned 500 pages because of the wealth of material on the favorite city of american writers mr lopate argued with his publisher over including classics like bartleby , but despite extensive culling , most of his favorites stayed in if most of the pieces look backward rather than at the current moment , he said , it is because writers tend to conserve the past in a way the city itself does not mr lopate , who is 54 , did not include his own writing about new york in the collection , although it has been extensive having grown up in williamsburg and fort greene , the son of workingclass , bookloving parents \( leonard lopate , the public radio talkshow host , is his brother \) , he has been more adventuresome in his travels around the city than most in the literary world , writing extensively about architecture and urban planning he has also published a volume about his experiences teaching in a public school , and has a new collection of film criticism out this fall one of his books , which includes a song to bachelorhood , was contradicted in 1990 when he married cheryl cipriani , a book designer they have a 4yearold daughter most of his writing , like many of the essays he quotes , is personal in nature , a bit cranky one of his bestknown essays is against joie de vivre and direct in its search for authenticity though his speech is unaccented , the hometown of his writing is unmistakable photo phillip lopate has edited

with its special power and responsibility in the world , the united states has to be free to act unilaterally in urgent circumstances we cannot wait for international approval before responding to terrorism president reagan was right to attack colonel qaddafi s headquarters after an apparent act of libyan terrorism and president clinton was right to strike at the afghan operations of osama bin laden , reported mastermind of the bombing of us embassies in kenya and tanzania but in deciding whether to act alone , a president and his advisers have to factor in the price of doing so it is not likely to be costfree the very menace of international terrorism lies in its elusive nature no single strike can stamp out a terrorist enterprise like mr bin laden s fighting it requires international cooperation over the long term it is essential , for example , to deny terrorists safe haven and the us obviously cannot do that alone we need the agreement of others to keep terrorists out , and to shun any countries that accept them so when we consider acting alone , we have to keep in mind the need for future diplomacy to that end cooperation is necessary for other reasons the 1986 reagan raid on libya required the agreement of the british government for us planes to take off from british bases planes or cruise missiles striking at terrorist targets will almost certainly overfly other countries , with the possibility of political repercussions there or consider the current imbroglio over saddam hussein s barring of united nations weapons inspectors president clinton has been severely criticized for not responding forcefully there is an understandable sense of frustration at saddam s brazen violation of security council resolutions and of his own promises to comply but the security council is plainly not willing to authorize punitive measures against iraq if the united states acted alone and struck at iraqi targets , would that solve the problem \? would saddam stop his blocking of inspections \? and what about the consequences elsewhere in the arab world \? the clinton administration s unwillingness to challenge prime minister netanyahu of israel on his undermining of the oslo peace accord has already turned public opinion in even moderate arab states more antiamerican president bush launched the persian gulf war only after working over many months to secure the support of arab countries , most crucially saudi arabia now the saudi government , fearful of dissenting domestic forces , would surely distance itself from a raid on iraq over the inspection issue would we want to risk upsetting the political balance there \? none of that proves that we should not act , in iraq or anywhere else that poses an urgent security threat it merely shows that a decision to use force is not simple we have to consider the opinions of others even when acting alone that point applies in a particular way to the other raid ordered by president clinton last week , on what us officials described as a chemical weapons plant in the sudan in the weeks since the raid some of the american intelligence statements have proved wrong the plant was not in a guarded site if it made poisonous chemicals , it also made medicines for the sudan osama bin laden seems not to have financed it the united states has resisted the call by the sudan for international inquiry but why should we \? a proper inquiry would clear the air and we should offer to pay compensation if we were wrong that course would preserve the credibility that the united states must have for the cooperation of other countries in the fight against terrorism there is a cult of toughness in this country nowadays armchair strategists who think the automatic answer to problems is military strikes reality is more complicated in my last column i wrote that kenneth starr continues to earn millions for himself in private practice the sentence should have been in the past tense after four years as independent counsel , mr starr announced july 31 that he was taking a leave from his private law firm
levittown , ny at a kitchen table at 99 meridian road , three women hunch over a map of their town , best known as a synonym for suburban tract housing they mark the streets with red dots , each one representing a case of cancer within sight of no 99 , the home of harriet haake , who has uterine cancer , the women know of four cases of breast cancer and one each of cervical and brain cancer on the cross street , solar lane , there are three more neighbors with breast cancer within the northwest quadrant of levittown , there are 26 red dots and those are only the people we know , said carol kopf , the only healthy woman of the three , who has been keeping an unofficial tally for years , ever since her children seemed to be going to too many funerals for their friends' parents or their coaches' wives if you rang any doorbell , they might find another one , mrs kopf said i hear my nextdoor neighbor she breaks off in midthought but we only talk about flowers beth wall , a 36yearold mother of five who has breast cancer , grabs the telephone to call a friend who is a repository of neighborhood history listening , mrs wall s jaw drops it seems the prior owners of mrs haake s house both had cancer why did i ever come here \? mrs haake wails , weakly she is 54 and wearing a nightgown printed with teddy bears recently , she learned that she had exhausted all treatment the scientific community is all but unanimous in discounting the notion that cancers clusters can be traced to environmental causes but grave illness is not merely about science it is about fear and about a deep longing to impose order on chaos , to have a reason for this unreasonable turn of events in levittown , a ghastly kind of order emerged in midjune , with the report of 15 cases of cancer , and 8 deaths , in the 50 homes on ramble lane since then , residents all over town have been reporting their own worrisome findings on normal lane , in two adjacent houses , couples died of breast and pancreatic cancer on bud lane , the next street over , there have been three breast cancer deaths all of this could be mere coincidence but since the ramble lane report in midjune , state and county politicians have acted , some say in an electionyear nod to nervous constituents a survey designed for the county and state by the breast cancer advocacy group one in nine will be mailed next week to all 17 , 544 homes in the 11756 zip code data from that survey will be used to map the incidence of disease here , then overlaid with locations of known and potential carcinogens the next town to be mapped is rockville centre , then the rest of nassau county and eventually the entire state , the new york state health department said we 've got to find out what we 're sitting on and eating and breathing , said geri barish , head of one in nine , who lost a son to hodgkin s disease and has breast cancer she lives in baldwin , in a house where the last two owners had cancer , too in rockville centre , colette cohen s doctor compares her breast cancer diagnosis to buying a new car and suddenly seeing the same model all over the road but the women at harriet haake s kitchen table believe otherwise yes , they are more aware of illness but they are also persuaded that there is something in the water or the air this town was once a vast potato field , sprayed with ddt there is a superfund site a mile or so north , where grumman aircraft used to be and there is a pungent plastics factory nearby all of these factors or none of them could matter , the women acknowledge it may be just as bad on cape cod or in arizona but the place you live is supposed to comfort and protect you believing otherwise , whatever the scientists say , challenges the rightful order of things mrs haake , mrs wall and mrs kopf were all asked what came to mind when they heard the word home they replied in unison , with one word , as if on cue safety , the three women said , then fell into a troubled silence
xiamen , china , oct 10 from the bluffs along the edge of this booming chinese city , you can easily peer into taiwan s western frontier , a small island only half a mile away from the early 1950 s to 1979 , artillery here ritually pounded the nearby islands of jinmen , known in the west as quemoy , and other locations on these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that repeat , for the benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west with binoculars , china s proposal for luring renegade taiwan back into the fold one country , two systems to reunify china across the water taiwan , in response , has put up a huge white billboard calling for reunification according to the three people s principles propounded early this century by the founder of the republic of china , sun yatsen nationalism , democracy and better livelihood the dueling signs , erected last year , express the continuing test of wills between china and taiwan a struggle that will enter a new phase on wednesday with the first highlevel contact in five years between the two sides although taiwan and china these days exchange symbolic gestures , even smiles , rather than artillery shots , the visit of a senior taiwan official to shanghai and beijing is so sensitive that the two sides have not publicly agreed on what they will discuss wary officials on taiwan insist on calling this a visit , not talks they may agree on little more than to talk again in the future but because the stakes are so high , people on both sides of the taiwan strait , and in washington , will be scrutinizing every inflection china sees recovering sovereignty over taiwan as the unfinished business of the civil war that brought communist victory on the mainland in 1949 china ceaselessly calls the recovery of taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal taiwan , which has created prosperity and democracy , no longer claims , as it once did , to house the true government of all china more and more , its 22 million people say they feel an independent identity taiwan s leaders , mindful of the glowering colossus nearby , still profess to want reunification some day far in the future , when china , too , is prosperous and democratic for now they insist that china and the world must recognize taiwan as a separate entity in a typical speech on saturday , the president of taiwan , lee tenghui , called for a gradualist approach toward unity we are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the taiwan strait based on the reality of divided rule , he said , promising continued efforts to break

lee s visit to a class reunion at cornell university , seen as a perfidious effort to bolster taiwan s independent status the next year , relations became more tense when china conducted missile tests near taiwan during the island s presidential election and the united states sent aircraft carriers into the region since then the united states , worried about being dragged into a conflict , has encouraged both sides to resume talks despite their diverging goals , both sides may feel that their interests are served by meeting , said a western diplomat in beijing for taiwan , if china is talking it s not attacking , and for china , if taiwan is talking then it s not declaring independence , the diplomat said china has called for immediate discussions of the political future , offering a deal looser than hong kong s in which taiwan could keep its democracy and even its army but come under chinese sovereignty taiwan wants to fend off political negotiations , limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and immigration disputes complicating the matter , china and taiwan are increasingly intertwined economically and socially , a process china encourages and taiwan is struggling to limit the ties are apparent here in xiamen , one of china s thriving special economic zones that is host to many taiwan factories , real estate developments and tourists in the last few

executives and tourists from taiwan visit china each year , and some 50 , 000 live here , the western diplomat said in contrast , taiwan strictly limits visitors from the mainland taiwan s investment and trade in the mainland are large and climbing , even as its government tries to enforce its slogan of go slow be patient the taiwan government has refused to allow large , showcase investments like multibilliondollar petrochemical and power projects in fujian province that were planned by the giant formosa plastics group many taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy , and the formosa group s chairman , wang yungching , has publicly urged his government to relax it we fear we will lose our opportunity in china , he said in a recent speech most important , taiwan does not allow direct transportation , postal or communications links with the mainland this slows crossstrait business by adding costs and forces travelers to spend hundreds of extra dollars looping through hong kong or macao capt yao mingfu of the taiwanowned ship unipioneer , in xiamen harbor this weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go to japan or southeast asia , expressed the frustrations of shippers and businessmen taking goods directly from here to taiwan s main harbor takes about 12 hours , he said but his ship can only carry chinesemade goods for reshipment onward none can be imported into taiwan transporting chinese goods to taiwan itself requires a 24hour boat trip to hong kong , some bothersome paperwork , then another 14hour journey to taiwan , said captain yao his parent company , the evergreen group , is one of the world s largest shippers taiwan officials have not been able to contain smallscale direct commerce in both directions among islands around xiamen , and people from taiwan even make one to fiveday visits across these waters , say local press reports and scholars how long this strange dance between china and taiwan can continue is unknown china has warned that if taiwan formally declares independence , it will mount a military attack a regional catastrophe short of such a declaration , what action by taiwan might touch off a harsh response \? how long will china s patience hold \? major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely , fan xihou , director of the taiwan research institute of xiamen university , said in an interview but after that , he suggested , time will be against taiwan as china s military and economic strength builds taiwan , for its part , hopes that it can continue mustering enough strength at home and abroad to

san diego , oct 10 no matter how much he denied it afterward , greg maddux looked very much like someone trying to deliver a message to jim leyritz and the san diego padres today when he hit leyritz on the left shoulder with a pitch in the fourth inning and no matter how much they refuse to believe it , the atlanta braves , winners of 106 games in the regular season and three consecutive in the first round of the playoffs , are on the brink of calling it a season that s because the padres , perhaps awakened by maddux s pitch to leyritz , sent the braves to their third consecutive defeat in the national league championship series , 41 , and moved a victory away from reaching the world series for the first time in 14 years if the near beaning was intentional leyritz and maddux had very differing opinions on the matter it did not bring anywhere near the desired effect for atlanta an inning after maddux nearly hit leyritz with a fastball after leyritz had asked the plate umpire , tom hallion , to check the ball for an illegal substance , the padres erased a onerun deficit and never trailed again when trevor hoffman came on to strike out pinchhitter javy lopez with two out in the eighth , the suddenly punchless braves had not only left the bases loaded for the third time in five innings , but also had opened the way for the padres , who responded by scoring twice in the bottom of the inning , to put game 3 away , much to the delight of 62 , 779 kerchiefwaving fans in the process , san diego had done the unthinkable in taking a commanding threegamestonone lead over the heavilyfavored braves no baseball team has ever come back from a threegame deficit to win a series after hoffman recorded the final out in the ninth , there were chants of sweep ! sweep ! sweep ! ringing in the balmy southern california air i was n't throwing at him , maddux protested , long after the fact i have n't thrown at anybody in 10 years the ball just got away i do n't care what he said i'm telling you , we tried to come in and it just got away leyritz was not so sure he did it on purpose , the former yankee said , arguing that maddux even shook off his catcher , eddie perez , more than once but even if the ball just did get away , it could not overshadow the fact that over the last four days , the underdog padres have now overcome , in succession , john smoltz , tom glavine and maddux and now tony gwynn and his padres have joey hamilton set for the clincher sunday night , against denny neagle of the braves , and the atlantakiller kevin brown is waiting to pitch a potential game 6 we knew we were playing atlanta going in , said gwynn , who is the only player remaining from the 1984 padres , san diego s only world series team but i would n't have ever imagined getting up , 30 there is no way the braves would have ever have imagined they would be down the same but nothing has gone the braves' way in a series in which they have scored just three runs if the braves needed any further proof that this year would not be theirs , it came today when their ace could not stop the padres in a game atlanta had to win i left one ball up to steve finley , said maddux and it ended up costing us the game the padres felt that the pitch that hit leyritz might have been just as important i'm sure he had a little intention on that ball , said finley , whose runscoring double an inning after the leyritz incident had erased a 10 atlanta lead it gave us a little extra incentive , that s for sure maddux delivered the message pitch with two out and nobody on in the bottom of the fourth , three innings after he had fanned leyritz with the bases loaded to end the first by striking me out in the first inning , i think he did a pretty good job of sending me a message there , leyritz said by the time leyritz came up again , the braves had a 10 lead it could have been more but after atlanta opened the scoring in the third on walt weiss s first hit of the series , the padres left fielder , john vander wal , playing because of greg vaughn s quadriceps injury , ended up throwing weiss out at the plate when it was leyritz s turn to hit again , it was still a 10 game it probably did not help that leyritz , who serves as the personal catcher for sterling hitchcock and was making his first start this series , asked hallion to check the ball after leyritz said he saw maddux go to his cap and then to his mouth before the catcher s time at bat so when maddux sent a firstpitch fastball in the direction of leyritz s head , hitting leyritz on the left shoulder , it was clear to leyritz that maddux had thrown the pitch with bad intent perez immediately jumped between the two as leyritz took a step toward the mound and maddux moved toward the plate but if maddux , who then struck out vander wal to end the inning , had been trying to serve the padres notice that the braves were not intimidated , his actions seemed to backfire the padres , perhaps rejuvenated by a strong fifth from hitchcock , scored a pair of runs off maddux in the bottom of the inning to take the lead for good hitchcock started the rally with one out with a firstpitch , oppositefield single between short and third he took second when quilvio veras hit a chopper back to maddux and then finley lashed a hanging change up to the gap in left center to tie the score , 11 maddux wanted no part of the next batter , gwynn , who was walked to bring up game 1 hero ken caminiti with runners on first and second on a 10 count , caminiti grounded a runscoring single up the middle , and the padres had a 21 lead they would not relinquish i do n't know if he hit him on purpose , but the way leyritz reacted fired me up , caminiti said leyritz was screaming in the dugout for at least two or three innings i do n't think maddux heard him too bad that turned out to be the message sent to atlanta photos atlanta s walt weiss failed to knock the ball loose after he crashed into catcher jim leyritz in the third inning \( reuters \) \( pg 1 \) steve finley being greeted after scoring the padres' second run , which put them ahead of the braves for good \( associated press \) \( pg 4 \)
down a cascade of steel steps in the halfbasement chinese video store in elmhurst , queens , shi jiehua methodically glued labels onto black plastic cases one recent afternoon as a chinese soap opera murmured on a small television suddenly , her husband , cai qingling , burst through the door , joking , chatting , then pausing a moment before breaking into song a short , shivery aria from the 16thcentury opera the peony pavilion this shoe box of a store has become a gathering place for some of the greatest chinese opera stars part of a growing diaspora of opera performers who have come to the united states from china , often initially to perform , but then to stay they come seeking freedom for themselves and opportunity for their children but unlike many artists from western countries whose celebrity follows them here , the performers from china find themselves plunged into the austere world of new chinese immigrants , a world of menial jobs , spartan housing and little contact beyond the immigrant community for many chinese , the sight of shi jiehua shelving videotapes or cai qingling delivering takeout food is akin to the notion of luciano pavarotti scrubbing pots at a pasta joint in little italy but virtually no chinese opera star in this country can survive on performing and teaching alone still , in the last 10 years , a network of opera societies , workshops and private patrons has evolved in cities across the united states , especially in new york amateur opera buffs can study with master teachers legendary singers from shanghai , here at the invitation of local chinese arts centers , spend afternoons mingling with opera greats who have immigrated one group scours china for talented performers , trying to lure them to live in the united states some wealthy chinese here , evoking the practice in the late ming dynasty of having individual opera troupes attached to great households , even sponsor stars from china to come and sing for them and their friends in intimate gatherings on friday night , anna yip , a native of hong kong who has been in the united states for decades , hired alice tully hall at lincoln center to stage three scenes from beijing operas , performed by opera stars living here and one flown in from beijing as well as by mrs yip herself i'm an opera nut , she said , adding , you come to america and you start to get homesick when opera resumed in shanghai in the late 1970 s , after the decadelong devastation of the cultural revolution , mr cai and ms shi returned to the stage as two of the 10 pillars of the city s celebrated kunqu theater troupe but in 1988 , while on a tour of this country , they decided not to return to china a colleague , chen zhiping , who has most recently worked in a chineseowned garment factory and who also passes time at the elmhurst video store , followed a year later people have a lot of individual reasons for coming , explained mr chen , who spent three and a half years in prison during the political terror of the cultural revolution children , marriage , political reasons today , if i say i want a day off because i'm tired , i take a day off on the mainland , you ca n't do that but the basic reason , he added , is we do n't want our children to be raised in that repressive atmosphere year after year , opera stars from beijing , shanghai , guangzhou and dozens of other cities across china filter into the united states , some through performingartist visas , others through defecting from visiting opera companies so great is the influx of talent that , unlike anywhere in china , new york regularly has performances of china s four major opera traditions by stars of the first magnitude we have 21 professional resident artists , said anna chen wu , the president of the kunqu society but none of them are fulltime some do n't even speak any english many of them work in garment factories , restaurants , small jobs like that but they are some of the best opera musicians and singers in the world for ms shi , 51 , whose name was known in every shanghai household during the peak of her career , leaving china meant forsaking fame and entering an unknown world what did we know about the us \? she said when we came , there was almost no one here but we had to do this for our son so what if we are not famous here \? in flushing , queens , agnes ho and her husband , steve , have turned their redbrick house into a nerve center of chinese opera a dining table is heaped with immigration documents for opera singers , grant applications to federal and state arts agencies , invitations to opera troupes in china a basement walled in mirrors serves as a practice room from here , mrs ho , 61 , runs the tung ching chinese center for the arts , a nonprofit group that has sponsored more than 50 opera stars to come to live in the united states all these opera stars stay here because in china they neglect culture , she said we 're trying to keep this alive we devote all our time to this
the best team in baseball chases greatness , and enjoys watching others try , too the recordchasing yankees sit in the dugout , and look for hints on the scoreboard , omens from chicago , st louis and seattle everybody s talking about it all the time , luis sojo said yesterday in the yankee clubhouse we see a run go up in st louis , and we say , 'mcgwire s got another one' i ca n't wait until we get to the middle of september do opposing players root \? yes , they do it s amazing to see , a month and a half to go and guys closing in on 50 , bernie williams said after the yankees mugged minnesota again , this time by 112 , once more affirming george steinbrenner s claim that their neighborhood is not very safe i'm definitely rooting for them both of them three of them in one of those weekly baseball publications , vin scully , the dodgers' announcer , said this week that he does not wish to see roger maris s 61 home runs surpassed by more than one player , in that it would cheapen the record and the achievement of breaking it with all due respect to a venerable baseball traditionalist , i look at it as williams does if maris is going down , let it be by committee , by stampede maris beat babe ruth s 34year record of 60 home runs in 1961 , but the ruth legend only deepened its mythic footing because his spikes were firmly planted in the american dream , rags to home runs to riches now at the far end of the 20th century , in a country with stillpainful racial wounds , we have a white man , a black man and a hispanic man in this contest of men chasing maris if mark mcgwire and sammy sosa remain on pace , if ken griffey jr can get hot again in the next couple of weeks , then sojo is right september will be a month to remember , the fitting conclusion to a season when baseball has moved to reclaim its place as the american game of the people do n't count junior out , said sojo , the reserve middle infielder i played with him three years in seattle he can go into one of his streaks , and then , it s like every other atbat it s a home run luis sojo , from venezuela , and bernie williams , from puerto rico , go to the morning paper with a special interest in sosa , out of the dominican republic , who stands to emerge from this assault on the most famous of sports records in the most ruthian place of all hank aaron already broke ruth s career home run record ruth remains the standard for transcendent power presence the hispanic major league community , increasing in numbers and dominance year after year , still awaits its rightful home run king if they all did it , the impact would be more for the latinos , as far as the pride of having one of our own doing that feat , williams said it s an understatement to say that that would be the greatest thing that s happened in latin baseball since clemente up in the press box , roberto clemente jr took a moment from his preparation for the spanish broadcast of the latest yankee rout to smile , in agreement , with gratitude then he talked about how sosa approached him at the allstar game in denver last month , with a sense of history that took him by surprise i watched films of your father when i was young , sosa told him i always tried to emulate him on the field it was , clemente jr said , the perfect illustration of why sammy sosa s life is going to change like he never imagined , even if he hits 62 and mcgwire 68 the man , whose puerto rican father died when his plane crashed on a relief mission to earthquakestruck nicaragua , said we are all brothers from different countries when my father was alive , he tried to improve conditions for all latino players he fought for equality it s not there yet , but it s getting closer and closer if sosa passes maris , it will change the image of the latin ballplayer forever ruth changed the way the country looked at all ballplayers , only none of them were black sam lacey , the 94yearold baltimore afroamerican sportswriter inducted last month into the hall of fame , told me recently that he never wrote a single word about babe ruth my readers had no interest in anything white on white , he said that was a society we were n't part of maris s run came with much of the country struggling with the prospect of imminent change in the early 1960 s most people rooted against him that s not the sense now , with mcgwire , sosa and griffey all the more reason that three for the price of one , swinging deep into september , would be bigger and better , in ways that ca n't be measured by number photo bernie williams \( barton silverman \)
manhattan , kan , nov 11 their quarterback has been muzzled and their most decorated player is a 5foot9inch argentineborn kicker their coach prefers chief executive officerstyled power suits over the warmups sported by most members of his fraternity he does n't eat until midnight , when his workaholic day is over , and he acts as if he would rather play the most important game in his program s history on friday just the kansas state wildcats against the nebraska cornhuskers in an empty stadium instead , bill snyder and his kstate players have been found out the eyes of the college football world and the national television cameras have turned to this windswept prairie town in the northeast part of the sunflower state to see whether the wildcats are the best team in the nation , as the coaches have voted , or a pretty nice squad puffed up to 90 on a diet of nonconference rice cakes everyone will know on saturday , when kansas state plays host to nebraska , a team that already has two losses this season , but also holds a huge psychological advantage over the wildcats the cornhuskers have beaten them 29 straight times this is not a makeorbreak game for this program , snyder said if you lose , it means you 're 91 if you win , you 're still undefeated in a profession that finds comfort in cliches , snyder , 59 , fields questions the way bill gates gives senate testimony pointedly , defiant and utterly confident in fact , what snyder has done for kansas state is the college football equivalent of what the microsoft chief did to the computer industry ten years ago , snyder was the offensive coordinator at iowa when kansas state brought him in to do something , anything , for a program considered the worst in college football the wildcats were 340 in the four previous seasons , averaged about 20 , 000 in attendance less than half of capacity and had facilities worse than some junior colleges snyder rebuilt , however , with attention to detail rather than inspired genius he got his assistants' salaries doubled , offered to write a 100 , 000 check to help finance a new football facility and insisted wildcat football operate on a minutetominute schedule practices , meetings , even pregame introductions i believe we 've got it to four and a half minutes , snyder offered , though no one asked , on how long it would take to introduce his 25 seniors for their final home game on saturday in his first season , 1989 , kansas state was 110 but the wildcats are 74271 since then , have won at least nine games for six consecutive seasons , and have won 17 consecutive games the nation s second longest streak , only one behind ucla s 18 now , ksu stadium is consistently sold out at 42 , 000plus and soon will be expanded to 50 , 000 with 31 luxury suites jack vanier , a kansas rancher , came up with the money to build a weight room and resource and office center so snyder did n't have to still , the vanier football complex is a monument to the coach s fastidiousness , down to the doormats ordering visitors to wipe their feet coach is all about business , said martin gramatica , who is closing in on his second lou groza placekicker award , is a consensus allamerican and has kicked field goals from 55 and 65 yards this year he pays attention to things others do n't think about he wants us to do the same i guess you can say we 're efficient so far , the wildcats have been deadly efficient they are ranked in the top 3 nationally in special teams and total defense their offense , led by the voluble and , by all accounts , combustible quarterback michael bishop , averages 4784 yards , 10th in the nation on a roster filled with good players you 've never heard of , bishop may be the greatest you may never hear from at least for the rest of this year he has 10 rushing touchdowns and 18 touchdown passes against only one interception and is the nation s sixth most efficient quarterback last season , at the fiesta bowl , college fans saw why pro scouts predict a terrific national football league career for the 6foot2inch , 205pound quarterback he threw for 317 yards and 4 touchdowns and ran for 73 yards and another score in a 3518 victory over syracuse one statistic , however , says more about bishop s makeup and is responsible for the silence snyder imposed on him after kansas state s fifth game this season bishop is 441 as a starting quarterback , including two perfect seasons capped by national championships at blinn community college in texas he is maniacally competitive heading into the colorado game in boulder last month , bishop publicly predicted a big day for wildcat running back frank murphy , comments that the buffaloes turned into bulletinboard fodder bishop proceeded to struggle through a 9of25 passing performance , throwing his only interception of the year , and the wildcats barely escaped with a 169 victory worse , in the course of the night , bishop berated himself and his teammates for their poor play after the game , snyder told him he could no longer talk with reporters it was not the first time bishop had been silenced last year , after a 5626 loss at nebraska bishop s only collegiate defeat the quarterback questioned his teammate s heart and quickly found his media privileges revoked mike is a supernice guy , said wide receiver darnell mcdonald , who leads the team in catches but he is hyper he screams and yells before and , sometimes , during the game he hates to see us play badly but he s our guy he s our leader snyder does not apologize for making his leader unavailable , explaining matteroffactly it is a distraction kansas state does n't need there will be no muddy footprints trampling on the wildcats' concentration his team , too , has taken on his businesslike character none of them were highly recruited all of them have settled into the anonymity of this town of 43 , 000 at a school more renowned for its veterinary school than football like bishop , mcdonald came from junior college gramatica was unearthed in florida after a single high school season of kicking both acknowledge the nebraska game is one they have been waiting to play their whole careers they are locked in on a goal yeah , people do n't know who we are and they question our schedule , said mcdonald , referring to nonconference games against indiana state , northern illinois and northeast louisiana but that is n't what it s about we 're just a bunch of fellas who came here to play for each other we work hard and have unity we know who we are future national champions \? we win , we 're still undefeated , said mcdonald , echoing his coach we got a lot of days left before we can say we took care of that business photos michael bishop , a junior college transfer , is 441 as a starting quarterback but his biggest victory could come tomorrow when the wildcats face nebraska \( stephen dunn allsport \) \( pg d1 \) coach bill snyder has turned a loser

here is a selective listing by critics of the times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in new york city denotes a highly recommended film or series ratings and running times are in parentheses an index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 8 now playing amistad , starring djimon hounsou , anthony hopkins and matthew mcconaughey directed by steven spielberg \( r , 150 minutes \) irrefutably worthy in its attention to a longoverlooked chapter in american history , this story of a slave mutiny and subsequent trial is still a film whose zestiest character is john quincy adams \( played by mr hopkins \) it has great earnestness , impeccable credentials and mr spielberg s great storytelling power what it lacks is an oskar schindler , a flawed , threedimensional character through whom the atrocity of slavery can be understood the best moments in this long , instructive tale are those that simply bring the slaves' pride , fear and outrage to life mr mcconaughey , the weak link in casting that includes nigel hawthorne as martin van buren , should cease and desist from playing any more smart lawyers \( janet maslin \) the apostle , starring robert duvall , farrah fawcett and miranda richardson directed by mr duvall \( not rated , 110 minutes \) in a gutsy , gripping film that is unmistakably a labor of love , robert duvall gives the performance of his career he plays sonny , a southern preacher of vast charm and volcanic energy , as serious in his faith as he is flawed in nature driven to violence by trouble with his estranged wife , sonny assaults her lover and finds himself on the run in the rural south as he rebuilds his life , mr duvall defines the man s very essence in unhurried , luxuriantly watchful scenes that capture the full flavor of sonny s spiritual world real southern parishioners contribute immeasurably to the churchgoing scenes in a film that never condescends to its subject or setting \( maslin \) as good as it gets , starring jack nicholson , helen hunt and greg kinnear directed by james l brooks \( pg13 , 133 minutes \) nobody does a better job of backing characters into happiness than mr brooks does , especially when those characters are so highstrung that happiness is almost out of the question echoing the quirky appeal of his broadcast news in a more conventional sitcom atmosphere , this zingerfilled comedy a trois features high spirits , strong acting and tart writing mr nicholson , whose other recent performances have been virtually phoned in , is back in fine form playing an obsessivecompulsive misanthrope his appalling , awfully funny wisecracks account for much of the film s spiky humor , especially after he winds up with the companions he deserves a gentle gay painter \( mr kinnear \) and a lovely , longsuffering waitress \( ms hunt \) who is his own personal alice kramden complications ensue \( maslin \) the boxer , starring daniel daylewis and emily watson directed by jim sheridan \( r , 107 minutes \) this tender , wrenching belfast drama takes a far more reflective view of northern ireland s troubles than the director s more fiery in the name of the father did but it has no less passion or grit with prison and fighting as strong central metaphors , it casts mr daylewis in the title role of a loner who has served a 14year jail term and now wants the impossible a peaceful , quiet life the magical star of breaking the waves plays his estranged exsweetheart , now another prisoner s wife and also the daughter of an ira leader you have to get rid of him or you 're going to find him in a pool of blood , he tells his daughter when the boxer returns home and rekindles the romance galvanized by such tensions , mr sheridan tells a story of bravery , love and renewal with the stirring conviction that such things are possible even in perpetually embattled places \( maslin \) deconstructing harry , starring woody allen and kirstie alley directed by mr allen \( r , 96 minutes \) private life caught up with woody allen several years ago , and now , with rancorous brilliance , he returns the favor this savage , liberating comedy is one of his funniest films , and it also has a detached wisdom that transcends autobiographical trivia love , lies and the saving grace of creative imagination are at center stage here , as mr allen weaves a dizzying plot around real events and a writer s selfserving , wickedly fictionalized versions jump cuts , frank profanity and an unapologetic taste for vice give the film an invigorating honesty , and mr allen is brazen in making the most of it to those who would take offense at the nastiness of this , the film offers a ruefully mature answer tough \( maslin \) fallen , starring denzel washington and john goodman directed by gregory hoblit \( r , 120 minutes \) as a police detective who helped capture an extrascary serial killer , mr washington falls into a highconcept nightmare stylish but seriously farfetched , with a literate noir screenplay by nicholas kazan , the film brings back the killer s spirit postexecution , makes him a demon and gives him a taste for the rolling stones the film s gimmick , that the evil can pass from person to person , and that any stranger singing time is on my side with a smirk must be stalking the detective , is clever at first but not easily sustained still , mr washington brings warmth and credibility to this film from the director of primal fear , which has much the same brooding intensity since this is another of mr washington s platonic roles , embeth davidtz has the film s only notable female role , playing a theology professor who knows all about angels \( maslin \)
to the editor the flaw of people like john meriwether , the founder of longterm capital management , is that they start to believe they are bigger than the market \( editorial , sept 25 \) however , as someone who taught me how to trade said , with enough money you could be king , but for only five minutes none of these fund managers seem to run worstcase scenarios on their positions if they did , they would have learned when to run for cover robert klein villas , nj , sept 28 , 1998
at a time when the clinton administration is urging the nation to invest in children s wellbeing and many states are spending their budget surpluses on early childhood initiatives a new study of early intervention programs for disadvantaged children has found that they can yield substantial benefits , both in better lives for the participants and lower costs for the government a rand corporation study of nine early intervention programs found that participants in most had higher longterm school achievement than similar children who did not participate some helped keep children out of special education , and made it less likely that they would become delinquents , spend time in an emergency room or depend on welfare but the results of the study released on wednesday were mixed most of the programs did not increase iq scores over the long term , improve children s behavior or decrease the odds of teenage pregnancy or having to repeat a grade the good news , said lynn karoly , an author of the report , is that we know something about programs that work with atrisk children to improve their life outcome these programs have the potential to generate savings to government and produce benefits to the rest of society so that they 're justifiable on economic grounds the caution is that what we know is drawn from a limited base of scientific studies , so , particularly as we look at programs on a larger scale , or in different models , we 're less sure about outcomes early intervention is a catchall term for a broad array of programs that may provide anything from prenatal home visits to preschool classes the nine programs in the rand study none of them still functioning in their original form were chosen because they were among the few relatively large programs that did research on their participants' experience , used a control group for comparison and followed participants , and reevaluated them , for years after they left the program the rand report found strong costbenefit advantages from the two programs that followed participants the longest in the mid1960 s , the perry preschool program enrolled 123 disadvantaged black children in a program that included weekly home visits by the teacher those children were followed until they were 27 , and according to the report , every 12 , 000 spent on the program yielded 25 , 000 in future costs avoided the children in the program were more likely than others to graduate from high school and less likely to have been involved in crime in the other program , the elmira prenatal early infancy project , 400 disadvantaged , mostly white families were visited at home by nurses from pregnancy through their child s second year children were tracked until age 15 for the higherrisk ones those with single mothers and low socioeconomic status the study found that for every 6 , 000 spent , there were savings of 24 , 000 in future costs for the lower risk children , the money was not recouped what we do n't know about the effects of early childhood intervention may exceed what we know , the study said nonetheless our review supports the proposition that , in some situations , carefully targeted early childhood interventions can yield measurable benefits in the short run and that some benefits persist long after the program has ended
memphis the conveyor belt deposits a tray holding a halfbuilt computer and a stack of parts in front of sheila roby wielding an electric screwdriver , ms roby installs the arrayed circuit boards , memory chips and disk drives within five minutes , she is ready to snap on the beige cover , emblazoned with a gleaming red compaq logo as that machine glides away , it is replaced by another chassis and another package of parts for ms roby to assemble but this time , the logo on the cover is blue , and it says ibm it has been six months since ingram micro inc , the world s largest wholesale distributor of computers , snaked a conveyor belt threequarters of a mile long through this converted warehouse and already , it is producing computers for compaq computer , ibm , hewlettpackard , apple computer and acer as if doing assembly work for archrivals that together control more than onethird of the nation s computer market were n't enough , ingram has also grabbed a piece of the action traditionally reserved for retailers thick yellow wires dangling from ceiling racks are hooked up to the finished pc s to install both software programs and codes that will enable the users to tap into their employers' networks finally , ingram packs up the computer and ships it directly to the customer with a label that makes the box look as though it came from a local dealer indeed , ingram wants to do almost everything computer dealers do it will set up world wide web sites for them , answer phones in their name and turn bill collectors loose on their deadbeat customers our job is to handle more and more of their back room , said jerre l stead , the chairman and chief executive of ingram , which is based in santa ana , calif here , in this warehouse big enough to house a fleet of jets , is a glimpse of the future of american industry , where manufacturers do n't make anything and retailers do n't touch the goods they sell ruthless competition whether from cheap foreign labor , new superstores or the internet is forcing every player in the production process to question old ways of doing things and to look for new ways to make money and if that means invading somebody else s turf , so be it it s becoming truly unclear who is doing what on what day , said fadi chehade , a former ingram executive who is now the chairman of rosettanet , a trade group creating standards to aid computer sales the consumer does n't care if all the computers were made on the same production line the only thing that matters is who will stand behind it the blurring of lines among manufacturers , distributors and retailers is occurring in industry after industry , from energy to medicine but the computer industry is in many ways in the vanguard of these shifts manufacturers now merely design products and advertise their brands , assigning the actual assembly to others the dominant theory of production is moving beyond just in time , the inventoryreduction method pioneered by the japanese in the 1970 s , to on someone else s time , where inventory is foisted on another player in the chain retailers face whole new classes of competitors , from internet sites that never touch products to the manufacturers who are bypassing retailers to sell to their customers directly and the middlemen those wholesalers and distributors who were supposed to be squeezed out by the new efficiencies are in fact thriving when they 're not building products , they 're often taking over from manufacturers and retailers all the logistics of storing and moving goods consider the online music business valley record distributors in woodland , calif , a wholesale music distributor , holds all the inventory and mails all the compact disks to customers on behalf of three of the biggest internet stores n2k s music boulevard , cd now and total e of columbia house similarly , while travel agents continue to be squeezed , central reservations systems like the sabre group thrive as they provide the computerized back office for a new generation of internet travel services what is driving the computer industry to reorganize itself faster than nearly any other is the relentless pace of technological change , which causes today s hot model to become next month s doorstop the value of a pc falls by 1 percent a week getting somebody else to hold an inventory of computers or parts or simply making inventory vanish by producing pc s only to order can give a huge bounce to any company s bottom line computer inventory is like fresh fish on the table , said henry bertolon , chief executive of necx , one of the largest online computer stores it tastes great the first day , but the longer it sits the smellier it gets using distributors like ingram , necx can undercut local stores and simply has no inventory the computer industry was forced into its costcutting mania by the rapid growth in the early 1990 s of dell computer and other manufacturers that sell directly to consumers dell s buildtoorder system just about eliminated the need for inventory and enabled it to undercut the big guys' prices by 10 percent to 15 percent as the computer market

it was the most indelible image of the 1994 gubernatorial campaign a newspaper photograph of george e pataki being led , literally by the hand , through a crowded fundraising dinner by his political patron , senator alfonse m d'amato mr pataki s opponent , gov mario m cuomo , seized on the picture , using it in television ads , as democrats derided the republican candidate as an empty suit , the puppet on mr d'amato s string mr pataki contributed to the image of himself as a cipher , running on a railthin platform of cutting taxes and restoring the death penalty , assiduously avoiding saying what else he would do if elected critics in both parties predicted that he would not amount to much they were wrong the candidate may have seemed like little more than the anticuomo , but he was being quintessentially himself mr pataki has made a career of being underestimated , and a habit of defying expectations and in the four years since that day , he has done just that , with considerable success helped substantially by a cooperating economy , he has emerged as a shrewd political operator he grappled successfully with the legislature on issues like crime and spending , and now is expected to win reelection easily no small feat for a republican in a heavily democratic state he is even mentioned as a possible candidate for national office in 2000 he is a far , far better politician than people expected , said gerald benjamin , dean of the college of liberal arts and sciences at the state university of new york at new paltz , who closely studies state government in large measure , the governor has surprised people by giving them very little idea of what he aims to do , beyond one or two themes of his choosing keeping expectations at a minimum consistently allows him to defy or exceed them and as with another republican , ronald reagan , the fuzziness in mr pataki s public positions , once seen as a great weakness , has made him adept at getting his way on some issues , while continually repositioning himself to his advantage on others four years ago , mr pataki was widely painted as an archconservative a view that helped prompt his fellow republican , mayor rudolph w giuliani , to endorse mr cuomo but he has since crafted a more moderate image , especially in the second half of his term he healed the political wounds he suffered from his early budget cuts with later spending increases his 1996 environmental bond act seized the initiative on an issue that democrats had long thought of as theirs alone and he has cultivated at least a tenuous alliance with the mercurial mr giuliani to his allies , that adaptability is the governor s wily way of getting what he wants to democrats , it proves that he lacks any real convictions beyond his own political advancement but these days , even those democrats will admit with frustration that there is something , however opaque , inside that gray flannel suit people badly underestimated him all around , said state senator martin connor of brooklyn , leader of the senate s democratic minority but i do n't think anyone does still consistent strategy saying less is better by 1994 , new yorkers had wearied of mr cuomo , the protean figure with the milewide agenda mr pataki made the shrewd calculation that not being mario cuomo was enough to get elected , and that the less he signaled of his views the better that strategy of sticking to a few simple themes is a trademark of mr pataki s campaign consultant , arthur finkelstein , and the candidate was seen as following someone else s script but he has governed in much the same way he has taken positions on a wide range of issues , but often quietly , and often only when he had to he changes positions and adopts his adversaries' ideas as his own and he has made a virtue of evading questions and issues , sticking to his chosen answers or nonanswers with the discipline of a monk it seems as if he sees any strong stance as a threat to distract and entangle him even as he campaigns for reelection , he says almost nothing about his plans for a second term it s conscious in the sense that i want to be free to look at those issues that are critical in january of 1999 , as opposed to saying , in october of '98 , that x , y or z is going to happen , because i'm very , very committed to doing what i said , mr pataki said his evasions are often inelegant , and if that hurts his standing with reporters , he clearly does not care , confident that voters will not , either in february , mr pataki had an audition of sorts with the national press corps , a breakfast with reporters in washington , and said he knew nothing about the mccainfeingold campaign finance bill that was consuming much of the capital s energy his performance was widely derided by newspaper columnists and his fellow politicians as disingenuous , amateurish , or both how could a governor be so ignorant of a major , much publicized piece of legislation on a critical issue \? turns out he was not he had discussed the issue with reporters just a few weeks earlier but he clearly did not want to be drawn into a discussion of it with washington journalists
an example of mike shanahan s intellect , a hint of his now infamous bravado , surfaced almost 20 years ago , long before his amazing knack for coaching offensive football would lead the denver broncos to the doorstep of immortality in 1982 , shanahan was a 29yearold coach at the university of florida , with a handsome mug and a mind like a nuclear physicist he infused a new level of sophistication into the offense multiple formations , new and dazzling plays and the courage to call them one afternoon , florida was at home playing southern california , at the time a huge game for the gators with florida at its own 5yard line , shanahan , the offensive coordinator , made a daring play call southern cal had them pinned and mike called a slant play , said george henshaw , now an assistant coach with the tennessee oilers , who was the offensive coordinator for florida state at the time now that s a bold call , because if the pass is intercepted , it s a touchdown it was n't that pass from quarterback wayne peace to wide receiver dwayne dixon went for 47 yards and was a key play in florida s 179 victory a safe play would have been to run the ball , but he called for the slant , it worked , and it turned the game around , henshaw said you know what \? ninetynine percent of coaches would not make that call , but that s mike he had the smart play , and he was n't afraid to use it shanahan was just getting started sixteen years later , his broncos playbook now resembling the encyclopedia britannica , shanahan has shown that smarts and guts do not fade with age last week , denver trailed kansas city by 3 points in the fourth quarter and faced a thirdand1 at the chiefs' 24yard line the safe call would have been to send running back terrell davis diving into the middle for the first down if that does not work , then kick the tying field goal that was shanahan s first call but after a timeout , he changed the play from a davis run to an end zone pass to tight end shannon sharpe it was a risky move , because the chiefs had played mantoman coverage on sharpe with zone coverage behind it , limiting him to zero catches to that point but the playaction pass to sharpe caught the chiefs by surprise and went for a gamewinning touchdown another successful shanahan strategy any search for a reason the broncos , the defending super bowl champions , are 130 heading into their game with the giants today and flirting with the first perfect season since the 1972 miami dolphins , starts and ends with shanahan , the man some in the national football league simply call the genius mike will work harder than the next guy to find your weakness , dennis green , coach of the minnesota vikings and a friend of shanahan s , said it may take him a minute , a day , a week , a month , but he 'll keep trying until he finds something on your defense to exploit shanahan s plays are a combination of simplicity and elegance he will run them from three , four , sometimes more formations defenses ca n't keep up his nose for player talent is second to none davis , whose 59 touchdowns are the most in league history for a player in his fourth season , was a sixthround draft pick his practices are crisp and efficient he makes his offensive players sprint an extra 30 or 40 yards after a catch or run , as if they were running away from a defender in a game that is why the broncos do not tire in the fourth quarter combine all of these things with shanahan s great instincts and playcalling courage , and it is easy to see why denver has scored 30 or more points in 10 of 13 games this season , a team record , and why a victory over the giants would be the broncos' 19th straight , an nfl record more important , they are the reasons denver has a realistic chance to go 190 this season , something that has never been done in the nfl mike has done the best coaching job this year , without a doubt , giants coach jim fassel said where did shanahan get his football smarts \? even though he was an offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the broncos before becoming their head coach , as well as a head coach with the oakland raiders , it was his three years with the san francisco 49ers , from 199294 , that made shanahan the coach he is now and the broncos the team they are i tried to hire him after he had been with the 49ers for one year , said the broncos' owner , pat bowlen but i think the best thing that happened to mike and this organization was that he stayed in san francisco for a few more years when i finally did hire him , he was very well rounded shanahan , who was offensive coordinator under george seifert , watched the way the 49ers practiced with no pads or heavy hitting , so as to preserve players' bodies the way they went after free agents you can never have too many good ones the way they dealt with players treating them like men , not serfs most important , shanahan completely devoured the west coast offense then he added his own twists , like more deep passes it is no coincidence that when he was the coordinator , the 49ers led the league in offense in consecutive seasons \( 1993 and 1994 \) for the first time in team history mike was always good with strategy , green said , but after being around that system , he just went into another dimension shanahan said that he had a great background with the 49ers and i learned so much there i 've tried to incorporate what i learned with some things of my own , he said
washington the exhibition degas at the races at the national gallery of art here confirms again that in whatever he did , edgar degas \( 18341917 \) was one of the most daring and original figures in the long history of european art his powers of observation and his reserves of human sympathy grow stronger and more pertinent the older we get we ourselves may age , but his work does not with its 116 items , this is not a large exhibition by present standards of gourmandise , but it leaves us more than ever appreciative of the lessons that degas has in store for generations yet to come the show starts with two enormous advantages one is that it can draw substantially on the collection of paul and bunny mellon , longtime benefactors of the gallery this is evident in major matters , as when the mellons' scene from the steeplechase the fallen jockey , begun in 1866 , is shown in company with the equally intimidating fallen jockey begun in 1896 , which has been lent by the kunstmuseum in basel , switzerland as portraits of fatality , each is enriched and supplemented by the other the mellons have also lent 14 of the 19 sculptures of individual horses that are in the show it is a curiously intimate experience to correlate these sculptures with the paintings to which many of them are related quite soon , we realize that the installation distills the findings of a lifetime of research by the show s curator , jean sutherland boggs dr boggs is routinely and quite rightly described as the doyenne of degas studies but there are doyennes \( and deans , too \) who have grown both weary and querulous with dr boggs , there is none of that on every page of her catalogue there is both a sense of wonder and a generous delight in the achievement of others she does n't get stuck in the classroom , either in describing an early drawing by degas \( not in the show \) , of a donkey harnessed to a cart , she does n't stint on the donkey s servitude but , she writes , the leaflike ears are as perky as antennae , the dark eyes large and soulful , and the nostrils , by contrast , so old and resigned , that this donkey is perhaps a poor imitation of a horse , but a better reflection of certain human beings if she takes her time getting to the racecourse , it is because degas did , too never nature s horseman , he schooled himself by working hard on the lessons of benozzo gozzoli and other italian old masters even so , it was a long time , by his own account , before he could feel the workings of the horse in his fingers' ends in his late 20 s he tackled the subject of the young alexander taming the great wild horse , bucephalus did he show alexander wrestling the fearful stallion to the ground \? not at all he figured out that the horse was frightened by his own shadow when alexander shaded bucephalus' eyes from the sun , the horse was as mild as could be degas did n't show much of bucephalus , as a matter of fact , but it made a stately scene in 186768 , degas got nearer to a real live horse , but it was not in the open air , let alone on a racecourse it was in the immensely seductive though not always quite coherent painting \( lent by the brooklyn museum of art \) called mlle fiocre in the ballet 'la source' eugenie fiocre was a big star in her day , and among the people who came to the dress rehearsal of la source were a great composer , giuseppe verdi , and a great painter , jeandominique ingres what they got out of the ballet cannot be guessed from degas s painting , where the action \( or lack of it \) appears to take place in the open air the artist includes the horse on which mlle fiocre made her first appearance onstage in the ballet , although she is not on it in the picture the scene has , in fact , the kind of oddity that shakespeare took in his stride degas had still not got the horse quite right , and the three young women are far gone in reverie backstage at the paris opera was never like this but , just to keep faith with the title , degas put a beautifully painted pair of ballet slippers between the horse s forelegs an irrational magic pervades this very large painting when degas finally got to the racecourse , he did not lie in wait for the fortissimo finish of a classic race , with jockey after jockey beating the hide off his mount his jockeys at epsom \( 186162 \) has nothing to do with the epsom derby degas bunches them up in the foreground , but he was clearly quite as interested \( and amused \) by the english horsefanciers who stood or sat at a safe distance \( two of them them even stood on top of their carriage to see better \) the point about degas is that he was not there for the sport he was there for the spectacle and he broke down the spectacle , vivid as it was , into a series of studies in professionalism he was as interested in the trainers as in the jockeys he liked the horses more and more , the better he came to know them , but he was not there to study form , and still less to place a bet what fascinated him about the racecourse was that it was a parallel world , with its own landscape , its own costumes , its own successes and its own failures , its amateurs and its professionals degas loved a true professional , and in that category he found the racehorses as individual as the stable boys , the whippersin , the jockeys , the trainers , the owners and the gamblers he also lingered over the people who came just for a day in the country from which something agreeable , or profitable , might come degas the student of society was always on the alert but there was also degas the painter , and it emerges more and more clearly from degas at the races that what captivated him at the racecourse was not the formalities of the start and finish of the race nor was it the scene in the newly built grandstands , though he enjoyed the nervous elegance of their architecture what he cherished were the moments at which nothing much was happening and the horses and their riders were within nudging distance of each other every jockey wore his owners' racing colors those colors , or silks , were individually outrageous the more so to stand out in the tumult of the race itself but when five or six riders were at close quarters , filling in time , the combinations of color were something that had never before presented itself as an element in the life of the open air they were wild beyond belief , and yet esthetic ambition played no part in them they were just there , for the taking the ballets of the time could not compare with them in the 1880 s and 1890 s degas could handle these colorclashes as well in pastel as in oils he could also handle the horses with what dr boggs calls a liberated ease after a long , slow start , degas came to identify so strongly with thoroughbred horses that he even wrote a sonnet to one of them , in the style of his friend , the poet stephane mallarme it is not easy to translate , but the catalogue includes an english rendering by the art historian linda nochlin that would be hard to improve upon it begins , you can hear his coming , his pace checked by the bit , his breath strong and sound paintings , pastels and drawings in this show all rhyme with those words degas at the races remains at the national gallery of art , fourth street and constitution avenue nw , washington , through july 12 it received financial support from first union national bank photos identifying with horses at the races the start \( 186162 \) by degas fascinated by a parallel world with its own successes and failures scene from the steeplechase the fallen jockey by degas \( photographs from the national gallery of art \)
washington all over southeast asia , people are complaining that a cabal of heartless bureaucrats at an institution many have come to loathe the international monetary fund is worsening their economic misery here in washington , the imf is n't a lot more popular , but for very different reasons almost every night in thailand , a stream of television commentators chafe at the humiliation of witnessing their country s leaders negotiate every element of national economic policy from interest rates to budget deficits with economists who work largely in secrecy out of the imf s offices off pennsylvania avenue here outside a mcdonald s in jakarta , indonesia , last month , a clutch of young professionals argued that the fund , which had just forced president suharto to terminate government subsidies that kept the price of fuel and food low , is simply a tool of an american , treasury secretary robert e rubin there s a rumor that this is all a game started by america , said a 27yearold advertising executive named doli , repeating a version of an oftheard conspiracy theory in which washington secretly plotted to destroy asian competitors america should not have let the rupiah keep dropping , he said , dismissing suggestions that indonesia might bear some responsibility for the 80 percent plunge in its currency indeed , throughout asia these days , people talk about the imf as if it were a branch of the clinton administration , and as if it with washington s connivance aspires to run the region today the way gen douglas macarthur ran it a halfcentury ago around asia , one hears variants of the same lament the fund is imposing too many conditions , often the wrong ones , and providing too little real financial support in asia s moment of need seven thousand miles away , on capitol hill , the imf is also a target of growing criticism but for exactly the opposite reasons here , the call is for far more american intrusiveness in imf programs , and a far smaller american contribution to solving asiastyle crises at the extreme ends of both parties , there are calls to kill off the imf altogether while that is hardly likely , congress has the opportunity in the next few months to send a message that will be heard in markets around the globe it will be debating the question of whether the united states should fulfill its commitment to provide 18 billion in additional contributions to the fund so that it can handle new outbreaks of the kind of the economic contagion that is still whipping through asia if congress balks , few doubt that the rest of the world will , too rarely in its 52year history has the fund been under such concerted attack from so many quarters liberals complain that its actions in asia chiefly benefit the likes of citicorp and j p morgan , to say nothing of japan s biggest banks , often at the expense of workers both abroad and in the united states whose jobs are threatened by its policies conservatives say that the emergency help for south korea , indonesia and thailand interferes with free markets , and that they undercut american jobs by encouraging the afflicted countries to export their way out of trouble many economists say the imf s prescriptions are only making things worse , though because they are economists , they disagree forcefully on what prescriptions would make things better caught in the uncomfortable middle is mr rubin for three years , since the united states stepped in to rescue mexico , he has been struggling to get nations around the world to prepare for future crises by bolstering their contributions to the imf and agreeing that international consortiums , not the united states , serve as the lender of last resort in asia , the imf has taken the lead with plenty of behindthescenes coaching from mr rubin and his deputy , lawrence h summers although the united states has committed several billion dollars in backup financing , called a second line of defense , to south korea and indonesia \( none has been disbursed \) the backup financing is chiefly an exercise in market psychology , intended to reassure investors that the united states is willing to play a big role in stabilizing markets but that same act of symbolism only incenses many american lawmakers , who ask why taxpayers should bail out faraway nations the administration fears that the more it supplements the imf , the greater the risk that congress will pull the plug on contributions altogether the public case for deeper american participation was made by president clinton in his state of the union address on tuesday , when he argued that a prosperous asia would help american exporters these countries are our customers , he said , and if asia sinks into recession , they wo n't be able to buy the goods we 'd like to sell them the private case , one of mr clinton s top aides noted recently , will have to be made by mr rubin basically , it comes down to this , the aide said bob is going to have to say 'if the asian meltdown comes to wall street , do you want the blame \? ' on the streets of bangkok , jakarta and seoul , the imf era looks pretty grim and the popular sentiment , right or wrong , is that the imf is making it grimmer

washington , july 5 after two congressional elections that were seen as referendums on the direction of the nation , this year s battle for control of the house is being fought the oldfashioned way candidate by candidate and district by district in a year marked by a proincumbent contentment with the economy , only 65 house races are even considered by the political parties to be truly competitive yet with the republicans holding one of the slimmest majorities of this century , the democrats need a net gain of just 11 seats to reclaim control of the house those numbers mean that representative newt gingrich s longevity as speaker could depend less on sweeping political themes than on a chain of local circumstances the decision by representative wes w watkins , republican of oklahoma , not to retire after all , or the question of whether voters in hawaii decide to punish democrats , like representative neil abercrombie , for the local economic recession this time you do n't have a presidential race going on and you do n't have a national wave one way or another , said representative martin frost of texas , the chairman of the house democrats' election committee so it s really trench warfare , district by district candidates across the nation are still striking certain common chords democrats , for instance , are riding the overhaul of managed health care as a central campaign theme there are key issues out there that are going to have an impact , said representative frank pallone of new jersey , one of the democrats the republicans consider potentially vulnerable this year the one i'm focusing on is managed care reform and i think people will respond because they think this is a donothing congress that is not focusing on key issues mr gingrich sent his incumbents out to campaign over the july 4 congressional recess on a message of taxcutting representative john linder , the georgian who heads the republicans' reelection effort , said his party will be stressing that we have balanced the budget with tax cuts and put people back to work who had been on welfare but for the first time in almost a decade , the words of the late house speaker thomas p o'neill seem most apt all politics is local strategists for the two parties sense none of the antiwashington animus that gave a national cast to recent elections , when voters rallied against a recession , entrenched incumbents or legislative overreaching ninetyfour was an election where the republicans did n't want to talk about anything but bill clinton , said geoffrey garin , a democratic pollster , ninetysix an election where democrats did n't want to talk about anything but newt gingrich ninetyeight will be a different kind of election where candidates talk about each other there s not a single issue that s driving the election from border to border and coast to coast in their drive to hold the majority that they won in 1994 , republicans have history on their side traditionally , the party in the white house loses seats in its sixth year in office and republicans are forecasting at least a 10seat gain in november some republican incumbents , though , are being forced to struggle for their seats representative constance a morella , a moderate maryland republican , is thought to be facing the strongest , most wellfinanced challenger of her six terms in ralph neas , the former executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights mr neas has accused ms morella of moving to the right during her years in office after appearing at a fourth of july parade this weekend , however , ms morella said that by putting an emphasis on health care , technology issues and education , she was a good mirror of my district democrats see several reasons why they may be able to defy history , starting with the fact that the year s retirements from congress left them with fewer vulnerable open seats than the republicans they also boast some wellfinanced candidates who may be able to overcome the republicans' usual advantage in raising money even republicans concede that the voters' sixyear itch for change may have come four years early , in 1994 , when republicans took control of the house for the first time in nearly 50 years and , since 1980 , no president has had coattails guaranteed to sweep a marginal candidate into office with an 11seat margin , one or two breaks the right way can make the big difference , said mark mellman , a democratic strategist there is no better barometer of how small events can make a difference in the electoral math this year than the sharp mood swings among house republicans they started the year confident of a serene election , then began to panic in late spring that they could lose the house now , they have been bolstered by a handful of recent developments that have even nonpartisan campaign handicappers like stuart rothenberg and charlie cook calling it unlikely that the democrats can take the majority for one , republican leaders made a successful appeal to mr watkins of southern oklahoma to reconsider his plans to retire mr watkins , a longtime democrat who changed parties and ran for congress as a republican in 1996 , was considered the sole republican who could hold a seat so democratic that his district was long ago dubbed little dixie

newark you said you needed some water \? ellie h cooper asked a visitor who had just stepped inside the newark museum and was looking around for a fountain after 23 years of standing in the museum s main foyer as a security guard , mr cooper has developed a sixth sense for what visitors want when they enter he is one of 85 security guards and attendants employed by the museum , all of whom wear crisp uniforms and look after the art and the patrons with equal care \( the main difference is that guards work full time and attendants part time \) and although none of the guards interviewed are sneaking off to ateliers after work to paint or produce video art , they have , in their own ways , fallen under the spell of the art that surrounds them every day of their working lives a parade of people it s a beautiful job , mr cooper said at his post near the front doors , underneath a skylight that made the cool gray and beige walls appear salmon pink that day you meet people from all over the world , he said , his fingers resting delicately on the clearplastic donation box it makes your day go good his biggest pleasure as a guard , he said , has been seeing the many vip s who have walked in during his reign at the museum s old entrance on washington street \( before the renovation and expansion by the princeton architect michael graves \) and at the new one on the south side of the building , which opened in 1989 there , he has met the writers alex haley , maya angelou and nikki giovanni , and he has seen many politicians walter f mondale , mayor sharpe james , governor whitman and two of her predecessors , thomas h kean and jim florio he remembers when mr graves frequented the museum during its fouryear renovation speaking of the architect and his work , mr cooper is typically laconic he s a nice gentleman he did a good job even better , he added , the renovation introduced airconditioning to the museum it made a big difference , he said mr cooper s own gentlemanly manner was shaped by his childhood in south carolina , where he still heads every year , no doubt refreshing the southernness in his voice but most of his life has really been newark and the museum the two are so intertwined in mr cooper s mind that he is a quiet local hero , having appeared not so long ago in the starledger as the focus of an article about his recuperation from a bypass operation on the arteries in his legs for poor circulation \( not related to his job standing in the museum , he said \) although mr cooper , 66 , now lives in east orange , his heart lingers in newark , where he moved from south carolina in 1959 i came for a job at a carwash manufacturer , he says it went out of business , and i came here in 1976 as a security guard his wife , willie mae , died in may , a fact that leaves him looking stricken every time he talks about it she was a teacher in the newark public schools , and they had three daughters ojetta c townes , who lives in hackensack , and janice and gwendolyn , who live with their father being surrounded by old and contemporary paintings and sculptures so many refined objects has given mr cooper a permanent taste for the museumgoing life when i travel around , i go to museums now , he said , mentioning a recent trip to denver and its art museum they had an exhibit on silver , and we had one once our museum is better a long silence trailed his remark then , above him to his left , a calder mobile suddenly shifted , as if an invisible hand had brushed by no , he said , answering a question , art has not changed my life mountains in the atrium down the hall , to the back in the north wing , stands margaret jenkins , a security guard at the museum since 1989 in her corner , it is so still that the earth seems to have stopped rotating i like the sound of the kids , ms jenkins says the galleries are normally hopping with schoolchildren , she adds , but not when the public schools have closed for the summer she clearly misses the hubbub of young visitors but is nevertheless pleased with herself and , most of all , her job this is a nice spot , she says of the north wing atrium , where another skylight illuminates the walls , this time paleyellow marbleized ones i like the view of the grand canyon i love mountains , she adds , referring to the grand canyon , a large 1911 painting by william robinson leigh that hangs at the other end of the gallery s hallway no matter how many times i go through here , i see the art different each time , she says of the three floors in the north wing , home to american paintings and sculptures and asian artwork i 've got to know the art well almost i know where everything is at besides her north wing post , ms jenkins patrols the ballantine house , the restored 1885 mansion attached to the museum , where she assumes the air of a modest but knowing mistress of the manse as a girl , she and friends walked to the museum on sundays to travel through the african and tibetan galleries i collect little pieces now , she admits after much prodding little african wood statues that i bought mostly from the museum gift shop and art books , including one on picasso the tour comes to a dead stop in the ballantine house s rather grandiose dining room , where the table is covered with fine china , crystal and silver it s so peaceful , so pleasant in here , she adds in a whisper it s quiet , secluded , a still place then it s time to go back to her post in the atrium , not far from the grand canyon faith and a window

aviano , italy , feb 6 a top united states military official acknowledged today that the jet that sheared ski lift cables in northern italy this week was flying well below the approved minimum altitude , and that the pilot reportedly said he came upon the cable too suddenly for evasive action the accident , which occurred on tuesday at a ski resort in cavalese , just west of here , sent a cable car hurtling to the ground , killing all 20 passengers it has created an uproar in italy because of differing accounts by italian and american officials as to how it occurred until today , the pentagon had only conceded that the marine corps jet , which was on a lowaltitude training mission , appeared to have been flying far below minimum safety levels the american military official , brig gen guy m vander linden , who is in charge of naval operations in southern europe , said the plane was definitely flying too low , but he reiterated his position that it was on course he said the aircraft appeared to have stayed within its assigned 10nauticalmilewide flight corridor but he acknowledged that the plane had strayed from its pointtopoint flight track according to accounts widely reported in italian newspapers today , the pilot of the plane , capt richard j ashby , told an italian defense lawyer provided by the marines that the plane s altitude equipment appeared to be malfunctioning and did not give off a warning signal that the jet was flying too low according to an account reported in many italian papers , the pilot told his lawyer that cable just suddenly sprang up in front of my eyes i did everything i could to avoid it i swerved to the left i hit it with the right wing and then with part of the tail fin the plane , a sophisticated electronic surveillance jet known as the ea6b prowler , later made an emergency landing at a nato air base here none of the fourman crew were injured the united states military officials did not dispute that account today another lawyer for captain ashby said the pilot had not spoken to any reporters or investigators however , he said the captain had a private conversation with his italian lawyer , bruno malattia , before he met with local law enforcement officials and did not answer any questions a reporter for il corriere della sera , a leading italian newspaper , said the newspaper stood by its account of captain ashby s remarks , saying they had been supplied by mr malattia no one answered the phone at mr malattia s office in aviano this evening marine aviators familiar with the jet disputed the idea that the aircraft was flying too low because of an altimeter failure while the plane has three altimeters , none are useful at very low altitudes , they said at such low levels the human eye is best but the standard cruising speeds for such lowlevel flights are between 414 and 483 miles per hour , which means that a cable might not be visible until an eighth of a mile away , a distance the plane would cover in a fraction of a second the issues of altitude and flight path were just two of several disputes that prompted angry responses between american and italian officials and in separate statements , prime minister romano prodi and president clinton intervened to try and calm the waters mr prodi , in a speech in bologna , gave assurances that the accident does not cast into discussion either our friendship with the united states or our loyalty to nato but he added that the accident had been provoked by an indisputable violation of the law in washington , mr clinton reaffirmed that the united states intends to conduct a noholdsbarred , full investigation of the incident the dispute , and charges by an italian investigating magistrate that american and italian air force officers withheld the plane s flight recorder and that its contents may have been damaged , prompted charges of a coverup by local law enforcement officials on thursday , a marine spokesman said the plane had no recording devices but today officials in aviano said it is equipped with a mission recorder that detects direction , altitude , speed , latitude and longitude they said , however , that the jet has neither a flight data recorder , known as a black box , or a cockpit voice recorder , as civilian aircraft carry francantonio granero , the chief magistrate of trento , capital of the region where the accident occurred , said today that american military officials had placed the recorder in the custody of the italian member of the joint americanled investigating commission looking into the reasons for the accident but mr granero , speaking at a news conference in trento , said he was not satisfied that the recorder s data were intact members of the americanled investigating commission had begun to decode the recorder on thursday , he said , and had found that parts of the coded data were illegible because the pilot had removed the recorder before the plane s power circuits had been shut down he said investigators would resume decoding on saturday to determine what information the device could provide officials of the air force and the marines at the base here could not respond to the assertion that the contents may have been damaged asked why the recorder had been impounded three days after the accident , an air force official said the recorder had the ability to store classified information that had to be removed map of italy showing the proposed route of the training flight the american jet strayed from its pointtopoint flight track

hicksville , ny , aug 19 top officers of the long island lighting company who received large severance checks when the utility merged with marketspan have been told they must return the money if they expect to keep their jobs at marketspan , company officials confirmed today if the executives decide to return their severance pay , marketspan will offer them stock options and other longterm benefits if they do not return the money , officials said , they will be fired marketspan is not desperate to keep some of its employees in fact , various other packages are also being developed in an effort to slim the ranks of the merged company , robert catell , the new chairman and chief executive officer of marketspan , said at a news conference intended to educate the press on hurricane preparedness , mr catell was repeatedly asked about the executive compensation issue he declined to discuss the payout recall , but did not deny that the demand had been made as a means of recovering some of the 67 million that was promised to 26 lilco executives just before the merger in may the payouts aroused the anger of the utility s customers and gov george e pataki , when they were disclosed in documents filed after the long island power authority s partial takeover of lilco this issue remains a sore spot for many long islanders and clearly you want to get this behind you , mr catell said at the news conference but mr catell would not discuss the details of the payback demand , which were first reported in tuesday s issue of newsday it would n't really be appropriate for me to comment on that at this time , mr catell said but he did say that he expected the matter to be resolved shortly the bulk of the payout money , or 42 million , went to the former chairman of lilco , dr william j catacosinos , who was forced to resign on july 31 after governor pataki and other state leaders criticized him for misleading them about the payouts mr catell said at the time that he , too , was unaware that mr catacosinos had built the lucrative severance payouts into the merger dr catacosinos has declined to return the money , saying that it was for his pension and other legal entitlements under his contract and that the benefits had been disclosed in public documents utility officials declined to discuss how the payouts or possible reimbursements might affect any of the numerous investigations of dr catacosinos , or their impact on pending shareholder suits and other suits brought by opponents of the merger twentyfive other former lilco executives were paid a total of 25 million at least two of those executives decided not to join the new company several others , regarded within the utility as close allies of dr catacosinos , were not asked to join marketspan , the company formed by the merger of keyspan the parent of brooklyn union gas and part of lilco but at least six of the former lilco officers who received payouts in their cases ranging from 400 , 000 to 800 , 000 each now work for marketspan carrying out its longterm contract to manage electric service for the long island power authority none of the executives returned phone calls richard m kessel , the chairman of power authority , said today that he did not expect the severance pay dispute to affect the authority s ability to provide service to its customers i'm confident there are plenty of talented and experienced people to manage the system efficiently and effectively , he said i expect a lot of them will decide to stay we 'll just have to wait and see what happens the original purpose of this morning s news conference was to discuss marketspan s preparations for the coming hurricane season in attendance at marketspan s headquarters here were mr kessel , mr catell and michael e wyllie , a meteorologist for the national weather service who advises the power authority and marketspan on potential weatherrelated problems mr wyllie noted that it was seven years ago today that hurricane bob swept past the eastern end of long island it was a near miss , but it still caused an awful lot of damage , he said by far the worst storm to hit long island was the hurricane of 1938 , and we 're long overdue for another big hit he said water temperatures along the atlantic coastline all the way up to long island were three to four degrees warmer than normal , which should allow the hurricane season , which is generally most active from midaugust to the end of september , to extend into midoctober the warmer temperatures are a lingering effect of el nino , he said both mr catell and mr kessel promised that should a storm hit , they would be on hand at the command center here mr catacosinos was on a european vacation when hurricane gloria struck on sept 27 , 1985 he did not return to long island for four days , and this aroused much of the public s initial anger against him photo from left , richard m kessel , chairman of the long island power authority robert catell ,

jerusalem , jan 23 having survived another political tussle with the palestinian issue , prime minister benjamin netanyahu must now confront another one of the conflicts that have bedeviled him since he came to office 19 months ago conversion on sunday , a committee headed by finance minister yaakov neeman is supposed to hand mr netanyahu a proposal for resolving the dispute among orthodox , reform and conservative jews over procedures for conversion to judaism but after seven months , more than 70 sessions and 150 hours of deliberations , signs are that the committee has failed to come up with a compromise that the orthodox chief rabbinate council will agree to sign the deadline for the committee is jan 31 , and none of the participants seem ready to agree to another extension so if the rabbis refuse to sign , neither will the reform or conservative branches , returning all sides to the political and legal confrontations that the neeman commission was set up last june to elude the basic proposal of the committee is to set up a joint panel of the three major branches to prepare candidates for conversion , though the actual ritual of conversion would be carried out by orthodox rabbinical courts , as it is now a preamble to the report notes that the composition of the panel reflected a desire for cooperation among the movements but even that appears to be too much for the orthodox rabbis , who view the americanbased reform movement , in particular , as a departure from jewish law in its readiness to ordain women as rabbis and to sanction samesex marriages , and in its untraditional interpretation of jewish dogma in recent months , the issue has raised passions at least as deep as the question of giving the palestinians land the reform and conservative movements are centered in the united states , and many american jews have seized on the issue as a challenge to their legitimacy both sides have waged fiery campaigns reform and conservative groups have lobbied assiduously among jewish politicians to convince them of the seriousness of the issue among americans , and of the potential consequences of a break with american jews supporters of the orthodox position have taken out fullpage ads in israeli newspapers , with dire warnings that quickie conversions could inundate israel with hundreds of thousands of foreigners whose only connection to judaism was the desire to receive full immigrant benefits at the taxpayers' expense alex lubotsky , a member of parliament from the russian immigrants' party who supports a compromise , argued in the jerusalem post today that opposition by the chief rabbis could lead to the same result as the action of rabbi joshua benperahiah , who , according to the talmud , pushed away a disciple named jesus and caused a historic rupture in the jewish people rabbi ovadiah yosef , the spiritual leader of the powerful shas movement , told a delegation of orthodox jews from the united states that his goal was not to foment hatred of reform jews , but our only intention is to distance their priests , who call themselves rabbis politically , the issue is at least as dangerous to mr netanyahu s government as peace with the palestinians , given the governing coalition s razorthin majority in parliament if the neeman committee s compromise is rejected , the religious parties in mr netanyahu s coalition may demand that the government pass a conversion bill institutionalizing the orthodox monopoly on conversion secular members of the coalition would oppose the action , once again threatening a war in the cabinet , and the potential collapse of the government should any of the parties pull out according to an unofficial poll of the 120member parliament by israeli television , 54 members would vote against the conversion bill and 27 in favor , with the rest undecided on their side , if the neeman proposal is rejected , the reform and conservative leaders are likely to revive suspended court actions seeking recognition of their conversions unless these leaders agree to a further postponement , the supreme court will demand that the state explain by feb 11 why it has not registered as jews several adopted children who were converted by the conservative movement complicating the matter is the fact that mr neeman plans to leave the country for a vacation on sunday , and will be away when the chief rabbis present their response on monday mr neeman issued a brief statement today , saying the wording of the recommendations was agreed on by all committee members , but still required the agreement of the chief rabbinate when we receive this approval , we will meet for a final discussion and sign it , he said

playwright martin mcdonagh has come up with something exotic in today s world of selfconscious , styleobsessed theater a proper , perfectly plotted drama that sets out above all to tell a story as convincingly and disarmingly as possible this work , performed by the four sterling actors who created their roles for the druid theater company in galway , ireland , is on many levels an oldfashioned , wellmade play yet it feels more immediate and vital than any new drama in many seasons the basic plot sounds familiar , like a bucolic cousin to the heiress a plain middleaged woman , trapped in a life as a caretaker for her infirm but ironwilled mother in rural ireland , is offered a last chance at love but mr mcdonagh and the director , garry hines , are masterly at building up and subverting expectations in a catandmouse game with the audience there s not a single hole in the play s structural or emotional logic , yet it constantly surprises and even as the plot grips and holds you , the performances engage you on a darker , deeper level \( 2 10 \) walter kerr theater , 219 west 48th street , \( 212 \) 2396200 tuesdays , thursdays and fridays at 8 pm wednesdays and saturdays at 2 and

which has been taken more or less whole from the movie , and the show is strong on neither suspenseful narrative nor affecting characterization but ms taymor , working with everything from shadow

two transit workers were seriously injured in a brooklyn subway tunnel early yesterday morning when a drill they were using to repair a broken track came in contact with an electrified rail , causing a small explosion , the authorities said eight other people were treated for smoke inhalation after the 4 am explosion , which left a manhattanbound a train stuck in the tunnel near the broadwaynassau stop for nearly an hour and half none of the 58 passengers on that train were injured , said leroy b spivey , vice president for system safety at new york city transit he said service between the jay street and west fourth street stations was suspended for about two hours after the explosion but resumed around 6 am the two workers who were injured were taken to new york hospitalcornell medical center , where they remained in serious but stable condition last night , said kathleen robinson , a hospital spokesman they were identified by transit officials as joseph kripaitis , 49 , and thomas roberto , 29 , both of brooklyn a spokesman for the fire department , richie cadotte , said eight other people , including two other workers , were taken to new york hospital and long island college hospital in brooklyn and treated for smoke inhalation spokesmen for the two hospitals said all eight were later released it was unclear last night whether the other six people were workers or riders mr spivey said the explosion occurred inside an area known as the fulton cranberry tube , which connects manhattan and brooklyn he said the blast was apparently caused by contact between a drill , used by a fourman crew to fix a 30foot segment of the brooklynbound rail that had cracked , and the third rail , which was packed with 600 volts of electricity the contact resulted in a ground , which produced an arc followed by an explosion and a ball of fire , mr spivey said termaine garden , a spokesman for new york city transit , said the men were drilling holes at each side of the cracked rail and installing braces when the explosion occurred but he said it was not immediately clear just how the drill , which was bolted to the rails , had come in contact with the third rail he said mr kripaitis , the crew foreman , was burned on the hand , and mr roberto , a track worker , suffered injuries on his arms and legs mr garden said that the third rail had been covered with a protective mat before work began after midnight and that the cracks had been discovered the evening before during a routine inspection he added that electricity was not shut off during the repairs because trains were still arriving about every 20 minutes and that the crew was working in between
johannesburg , oct 17 the anonymous caller to the police claimed that there were many illegal immigrants working at the galaxy clothing shop downtown but among the cardboard boxes of cheap blue jeans and polyester shirts , the police found only one likely suspect a neatly dressed young salesman with the sharp features , dark skin and wavy hair of a northern african when he could not produce identity papers , the immigration officers quietly escorted him to their prison bus on the street , pedestrians quickly recognized the arrest for what it was and began to applaud then a taxi driver started chanting , pumping his fist out the window of his van go home ! he shouted go home ! soon it was a fullfledged chorus , loud enough to drown out the screech of the rusting bus door closing behind the prisoner the ninth to be collected on a recent morning drawn to president nelson mandela s new democracy and an economy that dwarfs all others on this continent , illegal immigrants from all over africa , many of them destitute , are pouring into this country in ever greater numbers , experts say but they are hardly finding a welcome mat the economy here is failing to grow as fast as predicted , and majority rule has failed to produce enough housing , health clinics and good schools so south africans are growing increasingly resentful of the new arrivals , seeing them as thieves of scarce resources many of the apartheidera efforts to keep the country s borders secure have been relaxed but current hardship and past isolation have left the country ill prepared to deal with this growing problem surveys suggest that antiforeigner attitudes , particularly against blacks , are deepseated and widespread among all races and violence against immigrants is growing last month , an angry mob killed three foreigners on a commuter train outside pretoria after accusing them of stealing jobs from south africans two of the victims , both from senegal , were electrocuted when they climbed onto the roof to escape being lashed with cattle whips the third , a mozambican , was thrown out the window and killed by an oncoming train the incident was hardly the only recent brutality against foreigners in cape town , at least 10 died in the last year in assaults that the police believe were related to antiimmigrant sentiments in downtown johannesburg , local hawkers have repeatedly demonstrated against foreign ones , and each time some foreigners are beaten and robbed in alexandra township , inside the wealthy suburb of sandton , armed gangs have assaulted immigrants and marched them to the police station to clean the area of foreigners and in the eastern province of mpumalanga last summer , a gang calling itself the unemployed group ambushed and burned at least six trucks as part of what it called a torch campaign to force companies to give jobs to locals concerned about the pattern , the human rights commission sponsored a symposium this week to get business and community leaders thinking about the issue even with the pretoria train attack , the reaction was very muted , said jody kollapen , a commission member who describes animosity toward immigrants as having risen sharply in the last five years there was very little public outcry that silence is of great concern to us recent surveys show that south africans are among the world s most xenophobic people twentyfive percent want a ban on immigrants , according to one survey , taken last year by the institute for democracy in south africa , a nonprofit research group based in cape town just two years earlier that number was 16 percent foreign blacks face greater antagonism the same survey found that about 80 percent of those polled said they had little or no contact with foreigners moreover , both black and white south africans prefer white immigrants , viewing newcomers from europe and north america more favorably than they do africans there is a debate about what may be behind such attitudes one of the authors of the institute s survey , dr robert mattes , says he thinks the intolerance may have grown out of a society that for decades carefully separated races and encouraged the denigration of blacks there is a very paternalistic and antagonistic view of blacks north of the border , dr mattes said they are seen as wetbacks , yokels , rural folks they are definitely not like us but others argue that the xenophobia may simply be a passing mood the country is feeling as it forges a new national identity and copes with difficult economic times whiteruled south africa strictly controlled the number of immigrants allowed in as cheap labor borders were patrolled and mined an electric fence its voltage set to kill stood between south africa and mozambique but such restrictions have eased under the government of the african national congress , which in many ways owes its very existence to its neighbors many exiled anc leaders sat out the apartheid era or plotted their guerrilla attacks in neighboring countries that risked the vengeance of an oftenbrutal apartheid government
hempstead , ny , dec 23 it is not a highstakes game , but there is plenty to be gained for the jets and patriots , the clash of wills and egos and the bumping up against history will play a role on sunday , just as surely as the benefits of a victory might accrue to new england the patriots have a chance at a homefield wildcard game if they win and miami loses at atlanta the jets are riding a fivegame victory streak the best teams i 've ever had were all playing well going into the playoffs , coach bill parcells said today i 've studied the situation going back a few years , and teams that rest their regulars get beat going into the playoffs i just think it creates a noncompetitive mentality also , there are eight former patriots on the firstplace jets , not to mention one former patriots head coach and the presence of parcells cannot be minimized as the patriots face their onetime leader he did , after all , help guide them to the super bowl two seasons ago some of those patriots who went to the big game were then cut by the current coach , pete carroll ray lucas was among them even a role player such as lucas , a backup quarterback who nevertheless runs up and down the field on special teams , stops smiling when he thinks of how carroll treated him after parcells left one guy s in your face , but tells you the truth , he said of parcells , and the other guy comes in and tells you something else the jets also want this game because they can become the first in the club s 39 seasons to produce 12 victories moreover , said linebacker bryan cox , you do n't want to have a club come in and beat you at home and then have them again in the playoffs and they 're thinking , 'well , we 've already beaten you at home before' a victory gives the jets a sweep of their major east division rivals , a combined 60 record against new england , miami and buffalo we 're seeing the makings of a great rivalry in this division , carroll said today there s been a lot of interest in it , and i really like those kind of settings it might become a classic matchup in this division , and i 'd like to see that the quarterback the jets will face will not be drew bledsoe , who is resting his surgically repaired right index finger , but scott zolak last sunday , zolak played in what he described as the first meaningful game of my life he was the starter in the patriots' crucial victory over the 49ers zolak has been in the league since 1991 , and this will be only the seventh start of his career he played four seasons under parcells and his staff thus , said the quarterback , he knows the kind of havoc the linebackers , coached by al groh , will try to create , and the pressure it will bear did this give him an edge \? it s tough to say that you have an advantage like that , but i think they know us as well as we know them , zolak said it s a situation where it may be equal on both sides , so it just might come out as a draw as the patriots' secondstringer behind bledsoe , he used to play the opposing quarterback he saw defenses that groh , and then bill belichick , helped devise against those quarterbacks maybe it does give him an advantage , said jets linebacker chad cascadden obviously he s not going to remember everything we threw at them the first game we played he probably has a small advantage over other guys , i 'll grant him that a small advantage yet parcells continues to drop hints that he believes his club has advanced to the stage where it knows how to play in the clutch games the jets let slip away in the past do n't seem likely to be repeated in the last five games alone , the jets' special teamers have benefited from 15 penalties by the opposition while committing none they 're battlehardened , parcells said of the jets' success in the difficult afc east that helps all the clubs , but it especially helps us because we were able to beat two of them on the road the jets' last two victories were at miami and buffalo so games , whenever they are played , have significance to parcells , who is believed to have the best exhibitiongame wonlost record of any coach with at least 10 seasons meaningless \? parcells growled , contemplating sunday s affair only people who do n't understand the game say it is extra points the jets and vinny testaverde made a major contract move to keep talks alive during the club s playoff run , but the complicated deal remains incomplete in an important bookkeeping procedure , several million dollars in incentives he already has earned this year will be placed in the option contract he has for next season that eases the 1998 salary cap , and includes 15 million for taking 45 percent of the plays \( he is 111 as a starter \) , and 500 , 000 for making the pro bowl according to a jets' statement , this will allow both sides to continue to negotiate , with the hope of reaching an agreement before or during the freeagent period , which starts feb 12 also , the club said of the 35yearold , both sides will continue working diligently to continue to reach an agreement with testaverde so that he can retire as a jet he was to earn 15 million this year and 45 million next the contract has to be approved by the league , and both sides are trying to tailor it to league rules curtis martin admitted that the quadriceps injury he sustained in game 4 against miami affected him for almost half the season still , martin has carried a teamrecord 340 times for 1 , 185 yards
the bestselling author tom clancy , who wrote the hunt for red october , now has a national football league franchise dead in his sights that is because paul tagliabue , the nfl commissioner , flatly rejected a claim yesterday by roger headrick , the minnesota vikings' president , that he has a right to match clancy s offer to buy the vikings at a price slightly more than 200 million tagliabue s ruling has cleared the major roadblocks to clancy s purchase of the vikings i would have preferred it went a little faster , but that s the way it goes , clancy told the associated press from his home in maryland some small hurdles remain for the author his ownership must be approved by 23 of the 30 league owners few in the nfl expect clancy to have any difficulties getting the approval clancy also is a minority owner of the baltimore orioles and he would have to sell his interest in that baseball team before officially becoming the owner of the vikings he will most likely do that the vikings have long been run by a quarrelsome group of 10 owners who have fought internally over how the team should be run tagliabue was forced to intervene in the latest dispute when headrick , who said he would not appeal the commissioner s decision , contended that he had the right of first refusal and could match clancy s bid headrick attempted to buy the team with a bid of 185 million but in an 18page opinion released yesterday , tagliabue wrote that headrick s right to match did not apply in this instance because there was no commitment for any current vikings owner to be part of clancy s group furthermore , the selling partners had agreed to sell 100 percent of the club in other words , since the owners had agreed to sell the team , none of them could then turn around and match an offer from a prospective buyer
if you have any doubt that life and laughter are still to be found in the seminal comedies of eugene ionesco , you ca n't afford to miss simon mcburney s splendid revival of the chairs \( 1951 \) , which is now in a limited run at the john golden theater the london hit has arrived safely , suffering no mal d'air en route its stars are still geraldine mcewan and richard briers , whose performances mesmerized london last season even its astonishing breakaway set , designed by the quay brothers , remains intact ionesco \? the chairs \? you thought they were footnotes to history \? it s time to reconsider the romanianborn french dramatist , whose other works include the bald soprano \( 1948 \) and rhinoceros \( 1959 \) , described the chairs as a tragicfarce critics would later associate him with , among others , samuel beckett and harold pinter as the playwrights principally responsible for the theater of the absurd a convenient label , perhaps , but a vast oversimplification the three share a skepticism about language as a means of communication , as well as the conviction that man s place in an irrational universe is essentially absurd after that , each goes his own way beckett s view is cosmic , pared down , minimalist a master of language , he seems to be working toward a theater in which language itself will be discarded mr pinter s theater is particular , grounded in the ferocity hidden within the minutiae of the mundane more than the others , ionesco exploits the robustly comic possibilities in the disconnection between reality as understood by his audience and the seriously lunatic circumstances faced by his characters at the center of the chairs , and virtually alone on stage from start to finish , are the old man \( mr briers \) , a fussy , somewhat pompous janitor given to selfpity , and his wife , the old woman \( ms mcewan \) , an ancient bag of bones who lovingly supports her mate as if on automatic pilot he s her poppet she s semiramis , often called pettypie some may find the chairs , too funny to be taken seriously , but ionesco is a grave humorist the old man and the old woman have been married for centuries , or maybe only 70 years there is talk about missed opportunities as well as about children , but no consensus whether they ever had any for all their disagreements , there is something bracing about the tenacity with which they try to make order out of chaos , about the way they confront the murk of lives no longer remembered their intimacy is terminal the setting a great , barren , multidoored space , possibly a lighthouse at the edge of a watery nighttime universe when the lights come up , the old man is looking out a window , facing the audience we hear the voice of old woman , who warns that he might fall in remember what happened to henry the seventh , she calls spare me your historical examples , he says not unkindly i'm sick to death of tudor history in this way the seductive ionesco hallucination begins the old man has prepared a message for mankind , his last will and testament , which will be delivered this night to an invited audience by a hired orator as the hour approaches , the old woman frets has he invited all the right people \?

san antonio , dec 29 he hardly looked like the heisman trophy runnerup for most of the game , and his team s pregame heartache over being shut out of the bigtime new year s bowl games seemed hollow michael bishop and the kansas state wildcats were beaten tonight by purdue , 3734 , in the alamo bowl the boilermakers overcame a talent gap and , finally , themselves to win their second consecutive alamo title before 60 , 780 fans perhaps 40 , 000 of them in the purple of kansas state purdue s sophomore quarterback , drew brees , made it official when he marched the boilermakers 80 yards on a lastchance drive in just 54 seconds they were down by 3430 but had driven to kansas state s 24yard line when brees floated a pass into isaac jones s hands with 30 seconds left for the winning score if kansas state was still heartbroken over a 3633 doubleovertime loss to texas am in the big 12 championship game , it had to be forlorn now the wildcats had scored 14 points in the final six and a half minutes only to be thwarted by brees \( 25 of 53 for 230 yards and 3 touchdowns \) kansas state \( 112 \) has nobody to blame for its free fall from national title contender to the alamo bowl behind bishop , the wildcats acted from the start as if they did n't want to be here in going through the motions , the wildcats collected 125 yards in penalties including a fourthquarter clipping penalty that negated a 63yard punt return , turned the ball over 7 times and amassed only 308 total yards and bishop , who grew up a few hours from here in the small town of willis \( population 3 , 500 \) , hardly showed a pulse for his return to texas he completed 9 of 24 passes for 182 yards with 3 touchdowns he ran for just 7 yards on 20 carries and showed none of the improvisational verve that made him 10th in the nation in total offense with more than 299 yards a game but it was his four interceptions , a fumble and a botched handoff that helped the boilermakers keep the more talented team at bay after purdue s long snapper , andy standifer , twice sent the ball over punter dan rogers s head the second time in the third quarter , when the wildcats recovered for a touchdown and to narrow the deficit to 1713 bishop and fullback brian goolsby muffed an exchange in their own end zone boilermakers tackle david nugent was there to fall on it for a touchdown and a 2413 lead on the next possession , he fired an interception into the numbers of purdue safety billy gustin his second of the night and returned it 27 yards to the wildcats 11yard line it was purdue s placekicker , travis dorsch , who nailed a 26yarder for a 2713 lead still , kansas state mounted a 7play , 64yard drive finished by david allen s 3yard plunge to cut the lead to 2720 but it was the other returning texan who kept getting off the mat brees , who is from austin , kept scrappy purdue \( 94 \) together with a nervy performance he set big ten records this season for attempts , completions , yards and touchdowns , and finally got around to imitating the quarterback who posted a 65 percent completion rate and threw for 3 , 753 yards and 36 touchdowns against kansas state brees ran three minutes off the clock as he marched the boilermakers 43 over nine plays it was proficient enough to allow dortch to drill a 37yarder but was it enough \? in bishop s one lightning strike of the night , he answered with an 88yard bomb to darnell mcdonald to bring the wildcats within 3027 it ignited the wildcats and looked as if it would let them snatch a respectable defeat from a horrible performance after purdue stalled , the return specialist david allen took a punt 32 yards down to the purdue s 27yard line the wildcats ran the ball and ran the ball until facing thirdand1 on the 2yard line , bishop rolled , found justin swift all alone in the end zone and it looked as if the wildcats' day would be saved but they did n't count on brees having one more chance in an excruciatingly sloppy first half , neither purdue nor kansas state demonstrated any skills to make them appear bowl worthy but their shortcomings were glaring for different reasons the boilermakers had the look of an overachieving team trying to press too hard the wildcats just looked disinterested , and that was enough to put purdue on top by 177
phnom penh , cambodia , aug 5 the ruling party of cambodia s leader , hun sen , was officially declared the winner today in last week s general election , but maneuvering continued over the shape of a coalition government even as the official tally was announced , giving the ruling party 414 percent of the 49 million ballots , the electoral commission was deep into a recount of several districts in response to complaints from mr hun sen s two chief rivals the closest contender was the royalist funcinpec party of prince norodom ranariddh , which won 317 percent of the vote , according to the announcement today by the national election committee in third place was the party of sam rainsy , a critic of the government , with 143 percent of the vote the remainder was divided among 36 small parties , none of which won enough votes to take a place in the 122seat parliament according to a complicated seatallocation formula , the cambodian people s party of mr hun sen was expected to secure 64 seats , meaning it will have to enter a coalition with at least one of its rivals to attain the twothirds representation needed to form a government funcinpec was expected to win 43 seats and the sam rainsy party 15 seats today s announcement confirmed official and unofficial projections based on partial results already the political focus has moved forward to a bargaining process that could take several weeks parliament is not expected to convene until sept 24 last week , mr hun sen offered to bring both rival parties into a coalition , a gesture that some political analysts here said had been proposed by king norodom sihanouk , father of prince ranariddh and the moral leader of the nation but mr hun sen said his party wanted to keep control of five key ministries defense , interior , finance , foreign affairs and justice prince ranariddh and mr sam rainsy publicly belittled any talk of a coalition while their protests of the vote continued they are asserting a range of irregularities that include manipulation during the voting and counting as well as intimidation of opposition voters before and after election day for the last three days the election committee has been recounting the votes of five small communes that the opposition asserts were the scene of irregularities some members of the opposition have demanded more wideranging recounts but a western diplomat said today that the initial evidence of the current recounts , and the scope of mr hun sen s victory , made it unlikely that the review of votes would substantially alter the outcome of the election what we 're seeing here is political theater , the diplomat said it s part of the bargaining process and it s also par for the course you do n't lose elections in cambodia you either win or the vote was stolen from you mr sam rainsy s influential wife , samora , who won a parliamentary seat in phnom penh , said last weekend that if the recount did not reverse the outcome , the new total could only be the result of further cheating cambodia s previous coalition government was formed in 1993 when mr hun sen refused to accept the result of an election won by prince ranariddh
mexico city , may 19 mexican officials sought today to belittle the results of a huge united states undercover operation that exposed the laundering of drug money in 12 mexican banks on monday a federal grand jury in los angeles unsealed three indictments against mexican bankers and their clients in drug organizations based in cali , colombia , and ciudad juarez , mexico more than 72 million in drug proceeds was seized during the threeyear undercover operation , which spread across six countries and involved about 200 agents from the united states customs service and other agencies three mexican banks bancomer , banca serfin and banca confia were indicted as institutions united states justice department officials said they felt that the pattern of moneylaundering through these banks was so systemic that it would not be enough to indict individual employees the indictments dealt a shock to mexico , disclosing a much easier and more pervasive movement of narcotics proceeds through the financial system than mexican officials have been willing to acknowledge the investigation showed gaping loopholes in american and mexican laws that allowed traffickers to move their proceeds relatively easily despite an array of customs regulations in both countries intended to insure monitoring of big cash transactions yet eduardo fernandez garcia , the president of the national banking commission , mexico s bank regulatory agency , dismissed the indictments as overblown i did n't like the way the united states authorities announced this , mr fernandez said in a television interview this morning they made it seem as though they were announcing something terribly important but i think this has been taken out of context it seems much more important than it really is mr fernandez noted that none of the mexican bank employees arrested were toplevel executives most of the 14 bankers arrested since may 16 were local managers and executives who worked in tijuana and guadalajara finance minister jose angel gurria trevino said that although millions of dollars passed through the moneylaundering scheme , the amounts were not large enough to pose any risk to the banking system as a whole the huge undercover operation exposed connections between several of mexico s most important banks and the top financial operator for the juarez organization , jose alvarez tostado mr alvarez set up a network of willing bankers and stockbrokers across mexico and eventually introduced them to undercover customs agents who were posing as brokers for colombian drug barons , customs officials said at the urging of the united states , mexico is preparing an arrest warrant for mr alvarez his top deputy in the juarez organization , victor alcala navarro , was arrested in las vegas on sunday the operation started in 1995 when customs agents in colombia were approached by members of the cali cartel who were looking for ways to bring home the profits from cocaine and marijuana sales in the united states , customs officials said the colombians introduced the undercover agents to mr alcala over time , as american agents gained the confidence of the juarez traffickers , they were contracted to broker millions of dollars in drug proceeds from sales in chicago , miami , houston , new york and los angeles , customs officials said we did not approach any bankers , a customs official said they all came to us he said the mexican bankers were all informed by the undercover agents that the money came from drug transactions in meetings that were secretly recorded on videotape because of this evidence , justice officials say they are confident that the defendants will not be able to argue that they were illegally entrapped the bankers stepped forward to offer their services to open accounts in mexican banks for fictitious corporations they set up , a customs official said in the united states , operatives for the colombian and mexican drug organizations collected cash profits from street sales of drugs undercover agents then turned the money over to american banks in the united states that were cooperating with the sting bank of america in los angeles was one of the main american conduits the american banks then sent the funds by internal bank wire transfers to the fictitious corporate accounts opened at banks in mexico mexican bankers working with the drug organizations then converted the funds into cashier s checks made out to fictitious individuals these checks are drawn on accounts belonging to the banks themselves , not to individuals , and so can be cashed all over the world they were sent on to cali drug operatives in colombia , or were stashed away in secret customs accounts american officials acknowledged that to keep the operation going over three years without arousing the traffickers' suspicions , they were forced to complete laundering transactions worth millions of dollars for mexican and colombian dealers customs officials said that , in all , 20 cartel operatives and 22 bankers or moneylaunderers were arrested in the final stage of the operation in the last three days the arrests include middlelevel drug organization officials , many based in the united states , who helped in moneylaundering operations the suspects include 24 mexicans who were lured to las vegas and san diego in sting operations to avoid the timeconsuming risk of asking the mexican authorities to detain them julie shemitz , an assistant united states attorney in los angeles , said that american officials did not share any information about the operation with mexico while it was under way out of fear for the safety of the undercover agents it s not that we do n't trust the mexicans , ms shemitz said we just did n't tell anyone this kind of operation is so dangerous , and you ca n't play games with the lives of the officers one customs agent working under cover was shot and wounded in a shootout between narcotics traffickers and police officers in new york city on aug 6 , 1997 money transfers by wire between banks , even when they cross borders , are not subject to any of the tight regulations that govern other cash transactions , ms shemitz said any transfer in or out of the united states of more than 10 , 000 outside of bank channels must be reported to federal authorities mexican bankers are permitted to issue cashier s checks without demanding any kind of identification from the buyer
to the editor re a fundraising frankenstein \( editorial , oct 8 \) it does not surprise me to hear that republicans and democrats alike work like the devil to raise money for their campaigns our democracy requires politicians to deliver their messages to all eligible voters , some 200 million people right now the solution to campaign finance reform is either to lift all restrictions except for public reporting of all donations , or to use public funds to cover campaign expenses i favor the second option , but i suspect that the general public is too cheap to pay the price needed to return campaigns and politicians back to public interests mark brandon new haven , oct 8 , 1998
boston , dec 16 in a case believed to be the first of its kind , a federal judge sentencing a black man for gun possession reduced the sentence because his lengthy arrest record , she said , reflected a tendency by the police to stop black motorists more often than whites local and state police forces in several states have been accused of pulling over black motorists for no apparent reason , or , as critics complain , for driving while black the judge , nancy gertner of federal district court , said the preponderance of minor traffic offenses on the arrest record of the man , alexander leviner , 33 , raised deep concerns about racial disparity because none of his motor vehicle charges involved erratic driving or other behavior likely to attract police scrutiny most were for driving after his license had been suspended the judge sentenced mr leviner on dec 3 her decision was first reported today in the boston globe in his most recent arrest , in september 1997 , mr leviner was a passenger in a car that was stopped while speeding with its lights off at the time , the police were investigating a report of shots fired in the predominantly black roxbury section of boston , and they found a spent shell casing on the car floor along with a handgun given mr leviner s prior convictions , which included minor drug possession charges , he was charged with being a felon in possession of a gun , a federal crime no charges were filed in the shooting under the rigid federal sentencing guidelines , which assign mathematical scores for a defendant s criminal record based on the length of time he has served in prison on previous convictions , judge gertner could have sentenced mr leviner to four to six years in prison instead , she rejected the guidelines and gave him just two and a half years in reaching her decision , judge gertner said she took note of a growing body of research that strongly suggests there is racial disparity in the rates at which africanamericans are stopped and prosecuted for traffic violations in a maryland lawsuit , robert l wilkins , a black public defender who was stopped on interstate 95 , learned through discovery that while blacks made up 17 percent of the drivers on the highway , they constituted 70 percent of the drivers stopped by the maryland state police david rudovsky , a professor at the university of pennsylvania law school and a civil rights lawyer in philadelphia , found similar racial disparities in traffic stops along interstate 95 just south of philadelphia , and won a class action suit against tinicum township , where the stops were being conducted huge differences have also been found as the result of lawsuits involving traffic stops in new jersey and florida , professor rudovsky said there is absolutely no question that minorities get stopped on the highways in a severely disproportionate way because of their race , he said in mr leviner s case , judge gertner found , the racial disparities in traffic stops were then compounded by the way the federal sentencing guidelines worked , because they required the judge to fix a sentence based on the length of prison sentences handed out in earlier cases by state courts by counting the imprisonment that the defendant has received for the prior offenses , the system effectively replicates disparities in sentencing in the state system , judge gertner wrote motor vehicle offenses , in particular , raise deep concerns about racial disparity , judge gertner said mr leviner had previously been stopped in three largely white boston suburbs , milton , brookline and waltham , and charged with driving after his license had been suspended judge gertner also found that the federal sentencing guidelines focused entirely on the sentences received for prior convictions and did not make distinctions based on the kind of offenses he had committed mostly motor vehicle violations in fact , she found , under the guidelines' arcane mathematical structure , an 18month sentence he received in 1997 for possession with intent to sell drugs was counted the same as if he had been given an 18year sentence for murder david a harris , a law professor at the university of toledo , said the decision was the first in the nation to depart from the sentencing guidelines because the defendant s record might have been inflated by racial disparities in traffic stops these disparities , felt by many black men , are having a corrosive effect on our criminal justice system and other government institutions , breeding cynicism and distrust , professor harris said traffic stops are the major source of contact between citizens and the justice system , and blacks feel they are being treated unfairly
do n't tell chuck and donna gulland that last monday s stock selloff was just one of those market dips of no lasting consequence the couple were supposed to close last tuesday on the sale of their home in sunnyvale , calif we had everything we owned packed , said mrs gulland , who expected to turn over the keys of her threebedroom , twobath home to antonitta and joseph blazina of san jose we walked in expecting to sign the last papers , mrs gulland said , and we were told the deal was off the 1 , 700squarefoot home was to have sold for 489 , 900 the blazinas balked , unnerved by the stock market s effect on prospective buyers of their own fivebedroom home a few weeks earlier , those candidates were competing to meet the blazinas' asking price of 589 , 900 behavior in keeping with the superheated silicon valley real estate market , where home prices have been appreciating at double the national average but as the stock market continued to slide from the peaks set in july , and after scores of prospects had walked through the home the weekend before monday s plunge , only a single offer 30 , 000 below the asking price was still on the table we got scared , ms blazina acknowledged there could be weeks of uncertainty in home prices , she said , fueled by the stock market turmoil so the blazinas chose to forfeit their 15 , 000 deposit and scrapped the gulland deal better to take the sure loss than maybe gamble , ms blazina said , and it could be more then the good times are n't over in silicon valley , or other enclaves where affluence rose with the raging bull market expensive homes are still being bought and cars and boats and baubles , too but stories like those of the gullands and blazinas are popping up in even the most comfortable circles , as bigticket purchases are reconsidered in light of the markets' tumble of the last two months for example , some clients of farid saatchi , owner of f s jewelry in manhattan , were less enthusiastic than usual last week he said one customer , who earns her living investing , changed her mind about buying 15 , 000 of unset diamonds she wanted to wait and see what happens , mr saatchi said people slow down on everything they get nervous and the market s whipsaw slowed the buying impulses of two serious prospects for business jetsolutions , a dallas company that sells ownership shares in private jets michael c riegel , a vice president , said both clients were executives in stock funds they asked to delay , said mr riegel , who valued the nowdormant deals at less than 500 , 000 apiece i think they 'll be back with us in a number of weeks mr reigel s optimistic outlook is widely shared in the ranks of the affluent or even the reasonably comfortable in fact , instead of putting the brakes on spending , some michigan consumers saw the stock market s weakness as a sign to buy cars , that is in recent years , some longtime customers of the pontiacoldsgmc dealer in frankenmuth , mich , had neglected their annual rite of selecting a new model most bought a new car every year , said michael d young , the owner of the dealership , adding that many customers are former auto workers , eligible for a manufacturer s discount he said one of the customers explained his absence as a consequence of the surging market why draw 20 grand out of the market when it s earning 20 percent \? within the last 10 days , though , four such customers came in with cash in hand , ready to buy they put it off because they wanted to put their money in the market , mr young said when it dropped , it put them over the edge garth blumenthal , general manager of fletcher jones motorcars , a mercedesbenz dealership in newport beach , calif , said it sold 90 new cars the last five days of august it s a pretty typical or betterthanaverage monthend , he said our business is n't affected by asia and russia , he said , referring to the regions whose financial crises may well have prompted the market s decline interest rates play a very strong role , he said then there were those who left the market before the plunge gary r clifford , a luxury yacht broker for richard bertram company in fort lauderdale , fla , said his customers were n't troubled by recent market turmoil because a lot of people are already liquid some buyers favoring bertram s italian boats were already in cash , anticipating that the dollar would weaken against the euro , europe s new currency , when it is adopted next january , he said mr clifford said he personally sold three yachts , for more than 17 million each , in the last month , and overall sales at bertram have been normal no one s canceled bertram s confidence is reflected in its inventory , which includes an 88 million , 118foot benetti yacht that is to be displayed at a boat show in january for us to put these very expensive products in stock means we are very aggressive , mr clifford said far from fort lauderdale , wayne w crosby , a real estate broker in midland , mich , ignored any losses in his stock portfolio and was set to complete a purchase sometime this week of a 40foot pleasure boat costing 300 , 000 with low interest rates , you ca n't own it any cheaper , he said william b brennan , coowner of brennan marine sales in bay city , mich , who is selling the boat to mr crosby , said i do n't ever recall it making a difference in our sales people do n't sell stock to buy a boat they sometimes do , though , to buy jewelry , according to alfredo j molina , a jeweler in phoenix my product is looked on as diversification of assets , mr molina said we 've had a record year a lot of people have been taking profits last monday and tuesday , for example , mr molina said , customers bought a 60 , 000 fivecarat emerald ring , a 450 , 000 rubyandsapphire bracelet and a 145 , 000 diamond necklace while buying jewelry can be seen as a flight to hard assets during uncertain times , mr molina said he thinks his customers justify their purchases for a different reason they believe in enjoying their money , he said none that i 've talked to are running for cover nor is he mr molina is expanding his shop by 4 , 200 square feet and adding spanish jewelry by carerra y carerra , chopard swiss watches and cartier accessories finding merchandise is the biggest challenge , he said an equally bullish appraisal for luxury sales came from anthony j d'ambrosio , executive vice president of tourneau inc , the swiss watch retailer whose line includes 3 , 000 rolexes and 75 , 000 patek philippe timepieces the reality is , the best products we ca n't get enough of , he said from his manhattan office , adding that tourneau customers enjoy showing off their financial success you ca n't take your van gogh into the boardroom , or a restaurant or to the beach , mr d'ambrosio said people who do well in the market are people who are experienced it does n't affect their spending photo donna gulland and her husband , chuck , were preparing to move out of their home in sunnyvale , calif , when a potential buyer backed out because of the drop in the market \( peter dasilva for the new york times \)
the tube in my hand would have earned an f in glassblowing class it was thick and ungainly with stubby limbs extending at odd angles and was painted a kind of mustard yellow that guldens would reject as unappetizing i thought it was beautiful what elma \( pem \) farnsworth had just dropped into my sweaty palms represented the dreams of her husband , philo , in 1926 , when he was 19 years old it was his first attempt at a picture tube after being told by experts in the growing television field that his plan to create an allelectronic system \( as opposed to a mechanical system \) was impossible on his limited budget , not to mention that this was a boy without a college degree who had barely got his first nicks from a straight razor and at first they were right the tube did n't work but the experts underestimated farnsworth s genius while they were still toying with their mechanical systems , farnsworth and his plucky team produced the first allelectronic television picture on sept 7 , 1927 it was n't the first time the term popular wisdom would be reduced to an oxymoron oh , that was some day , recalled mrs farnsworth with a gleam in her eye in the living room of her modest salt lake city home i was just so excited afterward , we sent a telegram to the backers it just said that the thing worked mrs farnsworth s continued devotion to her husband , who died in 1971 , and his legacy had her audience an interviewer and a twoperson camera crew wiping their eyes we were videotaping her for the academy of television arts and sciences' archive of american television since april 1996 , the archive has been sending video crews around the country in a race against the actuarial clock to interview the dwindling stock of television pioneers eventually the videotapes will go into a special library , which will be open to the public , in los angeles the list includes not only the berles and the caesarcocas but also the technical geniuses like farnsworth and the unrecognized heroes of television s early years like charlie andrews , whose quirky genius inspired the widely influential chicago school of television that brought , among others , studs terkel , dave garroway and hugh downs to national prominence terkel s show , studs s place , was truly remarkable it was a live comedydrama set in a bar , adlibbed back then , that kind of risk taking was typical that s what makes the stories so important to preserve they recount a time when creativity , intelligence and the ability to think by the seat of one s pants was paramount out of that came the golden age of television it was all about risk taking and freedom at a time when the television industry seems as desperate for good programming as viewers are , these veterans have something important to say like mrs farnsworth , the earliest pioneers vividly recall the thrill of exploration , of building something from nothing , to please not some corporate sponsor but themselves nobody knew what television was or would be , so there were no molds to fit into mostly , they proceeded on curiosity and raw intelligence and a willingness to experiment in an atmosphere that not only tolerated resourceful thinking but depended on it it is this thread that runs through nearly all the interviews for the archive the enormous dividends that are accrued by allowing creative people to create under conditions in which there is no margin for error you heard this repeatedly because no spare parts were available , arch brolly used a pickle jar to complete his transmitter and keep wbkb , chicago s most important station , on the air during world war ii when brolly s boss , the redoubtable captain bill eddy , needed a camera base that could be raised and lowered , he created one from a barber chair when eddy desperately needed a show to fill his schedule , he called a staff meeting while puffing on his pipe \( which doubled as a hearing aid \) , eddy recalled a young puppeteer he worked with at the 1939 world s fair , and kukla , fran and ollie was born eddy was a master at this he created the first microwave network because it was the only way to bring notre dame football to chicago lighting was a major hurdle in television s earliest days cameras were so insensitive that tons of light had to be poured on the subject to get a picture eddy wrote the book on television lighting we knew we had enough light when the model s hair began to smoke , he later joked eddy , who is virtually unknown today , was also one of the first to regularly televise wrestling and it was the popularity of gorgeous george and his crowd , not milton berle or ed sullivan , that sold television to the american public noel jordan worked with eddy at rca before the war he recalls the excitement of just being there everybody worked 60 to 80 hours a week , said mr jordan we slept in a firstaid room where they had a couple of cots we felt pretty cocky about being in the forefront of something new farnsworth literally worked while he slept , his wife said she told the archive interviewer how her husband had trained himself to dwell on a problem in his sleep so he would have it solved by the time he woke up
you did n't have to be a baseball fanatic to get swept up in the emotion of watching mark mcgwire s 62d home run clear the leftfield wall at busch stadium the other night , or seeing him skip around the bases and hug his son at home plate but surely the emotion that so many americans felt at this moment was not just about a great record broken , by a nice guy no , the whole way in which mcgwire and sammy sosa have handled themselves , and the whole way in which baseball fans have responded giving the baseballs back for free is such a reminder of how much we need role models , how sorely they are missing now , and how much good they can actually do when they appear what was so striking about mcgwire was how a man with a rocky past grew to understand that breaking this record made him a role model , like it or not , and therefore imposed upon him a special obligation to both his historic predecessors namely babe ruth and roger maris but also to the fans and because he brought out the best in himself , in both words and deeds honoring the maris family , signing endless autographs and giving endless interviews he has brought out the best in the fans as well mcgwire has had one day off in the past two weeks , on which , according to the washington post , he spent 10 hours filming a public service announcement , paid for by himself , on child abuse unselfishness begets unselfishness the fan who caught the 61st ball , mike davidson , who works a 60hour week , turned it over to mcgwire , saying , it would mean more to him and baseball than it would to me the only thing he wanted was an autographed shirt from mcgwire and a chance to shake his hand forget the 1 million groundskeeper tim forneris returned the 62d home run ball with the same spirit it s not mine to begin with mcgwire just lost it , and i brought it home i'm just a regular joe think of how mcgwire could have handled himself he could have said that a legally accurate interpretation of his contract would indicate that he does not have to sign endless autographs for free he could have said that even baseball superstars have private lives , and therefore he does not have to answer any questions about musclebuilding supplements , his divorce or his son , and has no obligation to uphold the historic office of america s home run king in due time , no doubt , he will reap some very lucrative endorsement contracts but for now he has virtually none , even though he could be out there hustling every longdistance phone company , or signing a quickie book deal for , say , 45 million from rupert murdoch , while telling us that professional athletes have short careers so they have to cash in while on the job tim forneris could have said that since there is no controlling legal authority governing home run balls hit into the bleachers , he was entitled to sell mcgwire s 62d home run ball to the highest bidder no , in their own way , this poor dominican street kid named sammy and the welltodo dentist s son from southern california named mac are giving the country the civics lesson it needs most reminding us that a democratic society is not just about the letter of laws , but about the spirit of laws it is not just about rules , but about norms it is not just about legalistic job descriptions , but about role models it is not just about the entitlements of me and now , but about the obligations to those who came before and those who will come after it is only for a brief shining moment , but the mcgwiresosa home run race is just the right antidote for washington today it is n't wag the dog , it is n't wag the dow , it is n't monica lewinsky , it is n't ken starr and it is n't bill clinton all bringing out the worst in us it s just two nice guys bringing out the best in each other in a way that brings out the best in the country the other night st louis fans kept giving sammy sosa standing ovations that is truly unusual the cubscardinals rivalry goes back years it is one of the rivalries in baseball they never give each other standing ovations but seeing sosa run in from right field and leap into a bear hug from mcgwire after his 62d , the fans just responded in kind what mac and sosa convey is that their passion and respect for the game , and each other , is even greater than their passion for which team wins would n't it be nice if democratic and republican leaders treated the country with the same respect \?
louisville , ky , april 28 nick zito , the boy from the big city who twice in the decade of the 1990 s came to the bluegrass country and won the kentucky derby , stood outside barn 42 at churchill downs on this cold morning and contemplated the whims of fate he admitted he had a reasonable chance of winning the derby for the third time on saturday with halory hunter but he added quickly that the real reason why he had come to love kentucky was this personal you have to go where you find inner peace inner peace has not normally been considered a priority with zito , who in many ways personifies the brash exuberance of his hometown i get good vibes in kentucky , he said i'm from new york , and i 'll stay there as long as kenny noe and his people are running the show i find inner peace in kentucky that s what it s all about , is n't it \? in kentucky derby terms , zito has quickly become one of the reigning trainers popular , assertive , an extrovert bob baffert , who lost the derby by a nose two years ago but won it by a head last year , is even more of an extrovert they represent a contrast to bill mott and shug mcgaughey , quietspoken types who tend to be conservative about subjecting horses to the turmoil surrounding the derby i'm not sure i have a knack for the derby , zito said i think it s more of a priority , and that s where the knack comes from the priority we give the kentucky derby trainers like baffert and wayne lukas and zito have had some success in the derby because we give it such a priority at the barn this morning , zito and halory hunter were joined by the horse s owner , rick pitino , the coach of the boston celtics they met 10 years ago , and became friends after zito dropped in to watch a couple of practice sessions at the university of kentucky , where pitino coached for eight years before leaving a year ago to become president and coach of the celtics together , they bounced out of the barn and walked to pitino s black cadillac parked outside the coach , wearing a green jacket inscribed boston celtics , opened the trunk , which was filled with dozens of tshirts and green jackets , all inscribed boston celtics , and with buff baseball caps inscribed celtic pride stable with zito prompting , pitino poked through the stacks of clothing until he found the correct sizes , then handed them to zito , who presented them to several stablehands as gifts of appreciation from the coach when the draw for post positions is conducted wednesday evening , owners and trainers will for the first time make the selections themselves in the past , post positions were drawn by lot the change was instituted by churchill downs to accommodate espn in an effort to boost ratings so , who will call the shot for the celtic pride stable , owner or trainer \? nick will have everything to say , pitino replied but when zito was asked the same question , he said diplomatically rick will make the call but i told him , zito added , we need the 456 or 7 slot that should n't be hard one of those is the one i 'd like and if we 're late getting our pick in the draw , and only inside and outside posts are left , i 'd take inside zito first flashed his knack for the derby in 1991 with strike the gold , who went off as third choice at odds of 51 and finished with a memorable charge from sixth place go for gin , off at 91 in 1994 , ran second briefly but took the lead before they had gone half a mile and held it the odds on halory hunter will probably be somewhere in between , more likely closer to strike the gold , whose laterunning style he favors halory hunter is a frisky chestnut colt who was bred by jack kent cooke at elmendorf farm in lexington the colt , whose grandsire was the renowned mr prospector , derives his name from his sire , jade hunter , and his dam , halory he made his debut last august by running fourth at saratoga , then won twice at belmont park then he lost five in a row over the next six months , but ran in the money every time behind horses ranked as derby contenders at the time third behind grand slam in the champagne stakes , second behind coronado s quest in the remsen , second in an allowance to lil s lad , third in the fountain of youth to lil s lad , third in the florida derby to lil s lad he finally broke the losing streak when he won the blue grass at keeneland three weeks ago , defeating lil s lad by two lengths now , because of injury or temperament , none of the horses who outran him is a derby candidate any longer , and zito proclaims every day that his horse in peaking at exactly the right time the blue grass , the trainer said , leveling his hand at his shoulder , put him on a different level photo nick zito is seeking his third kentucky derby crown in this decade saturday with halory hunter , whom zito helped to bathe yesterday \( andy lyons allsport \)
the president stood to speak to about 100 dissidents gathered in the us embassy he said this to them while we press for human rights through diplomatic channels you press with your very lives , day in , day out , year after year , risking your jobs , your homes , your all and then this coming here , being with you , looking into your faces , i have to believe the history of this troubled century will indeed be redeemed in the eyes of god and man president reagan said many things during his visit to moscow that may of 1988 , but those passages will be remembered by fighters for freedom willing to risk their own and by those privileged by their own liberty to help them a decade later , president clinton , in beijing , could make no such statements this president , born and raised under liberty , elected in liberty , had no meetings with dissidents , spoke no words about political prisoners by the thousands existing on gruel and beatings , and workers by the millions slaving in reeducation prisonfactories this president , who proclaims love for children and women s rights , did not mention what confronts every chinese woman the need for official approval to deliver a child he did not mention the punishment for carrying to birth more than the allotted one , or sometimes two forced abortion it may take a village to raise a child , as mrs clinton wrote , but in the china they admire it takes only one official to order the child extinguished in the womb no choice beijing gave mr clinton air time before censoring replays when he called his friends in the us to ask howmidoin' back there , they said he was a smash he was the us press has been spun so often that now it sometimes just spins itself the clinton openness we heard and read about was to candor as torquemada to tolerance he arrived bearing payoff to china he offered the chance to make tibet disappear forever into china , without any beijing concessions president jiang zemin of china said he would talk with the dalai lama , maybe the dalai lama praised both men he fears that if the chinese never allow him to return to tibet , when he dies beijing will choose and rear the next dalai lama or simply eliminate tibetan buddhism completely in tibet , dreams of national and religious freedom will not long survive any clintonjiang deal , nor will tibet s international support groups but perhaps at least the honored memory of the halfcentury struggle by tibetans and the dalai lama against genocide will endure despite decisions that china and the us force upon them in the debate heard by chinese , it was president jiang who openly laid down realities to them and the world the communist justification for the tiananmen slaughter stands objecting chinese can go to jail on foreign complaints about human rights none of your business and nothing , particularly not the presence of this us president , can save a chinese dissident from arrest when the police choose mr clinton he concentrated on concealment when he had the chance to use public time to speak up against the arrests of roman catholic and protestant clergymen and congregants who do not accept the official patriotic churches or beijing s dictates about liturgy , sermons , clerical appointments and disavowal by catholics of papal authority and appointments , the president was mute nor did he speak of the millions who attend underground house churches rather than accept beijing s rule over god and in all those public meetings mr clinton kept his mouth shut about chinese sales of nuclear weaponry , and beijing s thefts of american missile technology on the chinese economy , he said nothing about the various special efficiencies that so smartly increase production , profits and exports 17centanhour labor , no unions , iron factory discipline , forced labor , the waiting cell all now handsomely financed by western investment , and imports a smash the beijingus axis was forged , based on politburo concepts about the role of human rights and political democracy zero and then then , mr clinton announced that china s economic and freedom course was morally right he said that the president will go home on sundays he will go to church the bible will be in his hand , and on his soul will be that judgment
washington , march 10 it was a brief and mild statement that underscored but left unspoken a thousand couldhavebeens about the clinton presidency with one sentence passed on by a spokesman , president clinton today accepted the apology of the man who wrote the article that mentioned the woman named paula , who hired the lawyers , who filed the subpoenas that led to monica s lewinsky , whose relationship to mr clinton now threatens his presidency mr clinton was responding today to an article by david brock expressing mournful regret for starting that chain reaction with an investigation of mr clinton s sex life the president read the article , said jim kennedy , a white house spokesman , and he appreciates and accepts mr brock s apology he left unaddressed the possibilities of a paulajonesless presidency in a december 1993 article in the american spectator , mr brock in passing mentioned a woman who he said was remembered only as paula but who came to be remembered as so much more in an article examining mr clinton s sex life when he was governor of arkansas , mr brock said the woman named paula had had an encounter with mr clinton and then volunteered to be his girfriend after the article appeared , paula corbin jones , a former arkansas state clerk , identified herself as the woman , said that she had rejected an advance by mr clinton , and declared that she would clear her name mr clinton denied the account and refused to apologize the rest is still becoming history a fact , mr brock said , that has become deeply troubling to him it s really bizarre , he said today i think i made a major misjudgment , in retrospect in addition to forswearing his investigation , mr brock said he should have omitted the name paula in his article this week , published in esquire , mr brock addressed the president as he wrote as the first reporter who leered into your sex life , i do know that i did n't learn a damn thing worth knowing about your character delighted with the extensive television coverage on monday of mr brock s mea culpa , the white house , in releasing mr clinton s statement today , insured a second day of news media attention , forcing everyone to rewrite the whole story again , in the gleeful appraisal of a clinton adviser r emmett tyrrell jr , the editor in chief of the american spectator , said today that mr brock s article for his magazine was accurate and legitimate , because it dealt with abuse of power by mr clinton as governor i do n't care if bill clinton did this pursuant to his stamp collection , it s still wrong , he said but in an interview , mr brock said that , fundamentally , the story was about his private sexual behavior and so was not , he now believes , fair game a more recent pivotal moment for mr clinton is also being secondguessed within legal circles , there has been growing criticism of the supreme court s 9to0 opinion last may that the jones case could go forward in part because it was highly unlikely to become a major drain on the president s time the sense in the legal community is that the justices undervalued the potential interference the lawsuit would cause with the regular activities of the president , said thomas e baker , a professor of constitutional law at texas tech university school of law before oral arguments were heard in the case , professor baker analyzed the jones v clinton briefs in the preview of supreme court cases published by the american bar association the most pointed criticism has come in a new book published by the library of contemporary thought in no island of sanity , vincent bugliosi , a former prosecutor , argues that the supreme court badly underestimated the toll the case would take on a sitting president none of the sensational allegations in today s headlines about president clinton s alleged affair with monica lewinsky would be there if it had n't been for the supreme court s clearly erroneous ruling in the paula jones case , wrote mr bugliosi , who is best known for his prosecution of charles manson friends and advisers acknowledged , however , that mr clinton contributed to his woes by conducting some kind of relationship with ms lewinsky , which he has yet to fully explain he has denied a sexual relationship with her rather than approaching the case as a genteel argument over the separation of powers , mr bugliosi says the court should have balanced ms jones s right to a speedy resolution of her civil claim against the right of millions of americans to have a focused , undistracted president professor baker also said the justices had badly underestimated how much of a distraction the jones case would become and how severely it would drain the white house s energies what the justices were taking into account were the courtroom proceedings , the stuff that takes place in law offices , he said they took a narrow , lawyerly view mr baker said the justices live in a kind of cloister , adding that they were naive about the press coverage and the notoriety of the case when they were figuring out their calculus rahm emanuel , a senior adviser to mr clinton , said of the justices looking at the last two or three months , and looking at the opinion , you can see how off the mark they are but laurence h tribe , a harvard law professor who signed a friendofthecourt brief arguing that the justices should postpone the paula jones case , pointed out that the supreme court stressed that the trial judge could take the president s needs into account by limiting discovery and other legal maneuvering the court may have overestimated the degree to which the trial judge would take the hint , he said in its ruling , the court explicitly spared mr clinton one hassle it said that he could not be compelled to appear at the trial , and that his deposition given to ms jones s lawyers should suffice for his testimony but mr clinton s advisers are still weighing whether mr clinton should go to little rock to testify in his own behalf in the trial , which is to begin may 27 the decision , a clinton adviser said , will be made based on what is happening in the trial and what is happening in the world

hoping to confirm the status of law as a noble and honorable profession , the new york state office of court administration recently adopted new rules dealing with the conduct of lawyers the rules , most of which go into effect in march , are aimed at reducing frivolous lawsuits , insuring courtroom civility and making sure clients understand their rights , carla d glassman , president of the westchester women s bar association , said the women s bar group will sponsor a meeting on jan 21 titled the new rules of ethics affecting every lawyer speakers will include gary l casella , chief counsel to the grievance committee for the ninth judicial district janet a johnson , its chairwoman , and antonio galvao , the law secretary to judge jonathan lippman , chief administrative judge for the state the event will take place at 6 pm at sam s gedney way in white plains the westchester chapter of the women s bar association has about 500 members , including men its purpose is to promote justice for all , regardless of sex , in the study and practice of law to advance the status of women in general , to expand opportunities for women in the law and to raise the level of competence and integrity in the legal profession the number to call for information about the event or the association is 4222619 mrs glassman , a resident of edgemont , is in private practice , specializing in trusts and estates and law governing the elderly here are excerpts from a recent conversation with her q what are the new rules aimed at \? a there are three particular issues that are being addressed the first deals with sanctions for frivolous lawsuits and frivolous conduct what is going to happen is that an attorney , or a litigant who is not represented by an attorney , is going to have to sign every paper that is served or filed in a civil action he or she is going to have to certify that to the best of that person s knowledge which they have formed after reasonable inquiry that what is said in the paper and its contentions are not frivolous q and if they do turn out to be frivolous , what does that mean \? a there will be sanctions imposed and those sanctions will be onerous how onerous \? there is presently a 10 , 000percase limit on costs and sanctions that may be imposed that is going to be replaced by a 10 , 000perincident limit q who pays this \? a it depends who does the frivolous conduct if it s a selfrepresented party , then apparently that party if the lawyer was found to have done it , then apparently the lawyer now there have been sanction rules in federal courts these rules apply to actions in the state courts and civil cases q from your experience , are these needed \? a it s a little hard to answer i personally think and this is not a bar association position , but my own it might be one more area for controversy i do n't do a tremendous amount of litigation is there some frivolous conduct \? occasionally but what i would like to stress and what i believe the chief administrative judge has stressed is that it is only the smallest , smallest minority of lawyers who may need these things most lawyers do the right thing most lawyers will not be affected by this could it have a chilling effect \? i think i have that concern , but all one is being asked to do is certify that they have reasonable reason to believe what is in the papers and it is not frivolous q where does civility enter into this is that a separate area \? a the standards of civility that have been adopted are aspirational they are set forth as guidelines and will be published in a brochure again , the vast majority of us believe we already adhere to them these are basic courtesies and seek to prevent unreasonable delay in litigation they request that lawyers be courteous and civil in all professional dealings with people they ask that you attempt to avoid litigation and resolve litigation that has already commenced in as efficient a way as possible they say a lawyer should respect the schedule and commitments of opposing counsel consistent with the protection of their client s interest they say throughout protect your client s interest they ask for courtesy with respect for requests for adjournments just things that reasonable people would do , for the most part q does that in any way preclude a very aggressive style in court \? a there is a fine line between advocacy and aggression i think that common sense will dictate there are stories of briefcases being flung have i ever seen anything like that \? no for the most part the people i have dealt with are courteous and respectful every now and then you meet an unpleasant person but i do n't think it s any different than for the population in general we have a contentious society out there two or three years ago none of us had ever heard the term road rage for the most part , the vast majority of lawyers are good , hardworking ethical people who serve their clients well and these rules may in part be an attempt to react to the incredibly negative public perception that there is of lawyers again , those of us who are hardworking people are at a loss to understand where it comes from with all respect , the press does n't always help us we do so many good things we , as a bar association , have so many projects we 're involved with we do a tremendous amount of community outreach work q what is the third area of new rules \?
washington , nov 15 president clinton today all but called for a coup against saddam hussein , vowing to work with iraqi opposition groups until a new government took power in iraq president bush did much the same at the end of the 1991 persian gulf war , calling on the iraqi people to rise up and force saddam hussein the dictator to step aside thousands of iraqis died trying to heed that call and in the seven years since the gulf war , thousands more have faced prison and death the central intelligence agency has come up with at least six different plans to undermine the iraqi leader coups against dictators are harder to do than to talk about , in the words of gen john shalikashvili , the former chairman of the joint chiefs in the case of iraq , it may be much harder senators and representatives have been talking openly all year about the need to topple president hussein the cia s overseers in congress have debated how best to carry out a coup two weeks ago , the president signed an unusual 97 million bill that proposes to unify the deeply divided iraqi opposition the cia has spent nearly that much money since the gulf war backing four different groups trying to subvert president hussein kurdish dissidents in northern iraq , iraqi military defectors in jordan , shiite muslim groups in southern iraq and a coalition of exiles based in london none proved effective they were plagued by internal divisions and , in some cases , infiltratation by iraqi intelligence agents their weakness was exposed in september 1996 when president hussein crushed a cell of dissidents run by the cia inside iraq the operation was destroyed because a kurdish opposition leader , massoud barzani , betrayed it as part of a power struggle with a rival this past september , the state department brokered a settlement between the two factions , both of whom had been backed by the cia this year , at the request of the white house , the agency has twice drafted plans for covert action against the iraqi government , only to see them blocked by skeptics in the administration and congress the more ambitious of these plans , drafted in february , would have mounted a major campaign of sabotage inside iraq , enlisting kurdish and shiite agents to blow up government broadcast stations and utility plants the plan was leaked to the new york times by a senior government official who opposed it , effectively removing the element of surprise the plot was not finally approved by president clinton this fall , congress passed the 97 million iraq liberation act , which president clinton signed on oct 31 it authorizes the president , but does not require him , to give guns , money and political support to the fragmented iraqi opposition gen anthony c zinni of the marines , the american commander in the gulf , opposed the act i think a weakened , fragmented , chaotic iraq , which could happen if this is n't done carefully , is more dangerous in the long run than a contained saddam is now , he said i do n't think these things have been thought out iraq s deputy foreign minister , tariq aziz , today condemned the statement by president clinton , calling it a flagrant violation of the security council resolutions as well as international law but mr clinton said he would carry out the iraq liberation act as best he could over the past year we have deepened our engagement with the forces of change in iraq , reconciling the two largest kurdish opposition groups , beginning broadcasts of a radio free iraq , he said we will intensify that effort and then , correcting himself in midsentence and tacitly acknowledging how difficult the job would be , the president said washington would work to make sure the opposition or to do what we can to make the opposition a more effective voice
if anyone needs another indication of how great a season the yankees are having , look no further than randy johnson the intimidating pitcher had been scheduled to face the yankees in seattle tonight for the first time since the 1995 playoffs , but now the only way they 'll have to see him is if they play the houston astros in the world series in the most stunning development of a day loaded with 13 trades involving 48 players , the astros acquired johnson from the mariners 10 minutes before the nonwaiver trading deadline friday night the yankees and the cleveland indians had been considered the leading contenders for the 34yearold lefthander , but the astros snatched him with a package of three minor league players that was as surprising as their success in getting him one player is to be named the other players are freddy garcia , a 21yearold pitcher , and carlos guillen , a 22yearold infielder , both products of the astros' stateoftheart venezuelan development program although gerry hunsicker , the houston general manager , had pursued johnson for the past month , it took a series of half a dozen telephone conversations friday to get what he wanted , a no 1 starter for the team s rotation it was not an easy day woody woodward , the mariners' general manager , spent much of the time in his conversations with hunsicker trying to get two of the astros' best young players , outfielder richard hidalgo and pitcher scott elarton hunsicker resisted and made a counter offer at 11 o'clock new york time , i did n't think we had a chance , hunsicker said by telephone from houston then at 10 after 11 , i decided to make one more call that stimulated discussion , and they called back 10 minutes later and said they were seriously interested in our offer but as the clock seemed to move rapidly toward midnight , woody woodward , the mariners' general manager , did not call back when i had n't heard from him at a quarter to 12 , i was certain we were n't going to get it done , hunsicker said i figured one of the other teams jumped in and increased their offer but at 10 minutes to midnight , woodward called and accepted the astros' package it was such a close call that when hunsicker , following procedure , called nancy crofts , the national league s executive director of player records , to report the trade , she told him that her clock was precisely at midnight a minute later , she said , and she would have to get permission to allow the trade it was a trade that prompted praise from other baseball people but also wonderment that the mariners accepted all minor leaguers they had expressed a desire for a major league starting pitcher , hideki irabu , from the yankees , dave burba from the indians , for example , but now they had settled for none i was surprised to see that houston got him , said tommy lasorda , the los angeles dodgers' interim general manager , who made a sevenplayer trade with the montreal expos friday all the talk was it would be the yankees or cleveland that was a shock when i heard houston got him the thing i do n't understand is what they got after what they were asking hunsicker somewhat took exception to the suggestion that the mariners settled for players of little ability he said that garcia is considered one of the best half dozen or so minor league pitchers and that guillen could have been the astros' starting shortstop or third baseman in a year or two meanwhile , johnson , who will start against the pittsburgh pirates today , is their no 1 pitcher , and it is now the other nl contenders who will face what american league teams had been accustomed to and dreaded the chicago cubs have the most immediate concern because they are trying to catch the astros in the nl central assuming the astros do n't suffer a total breakdown , though , the atlanta braves and the san diego padres , the league s best teams all season , will encounter the johnson impact in the postseason if we get to the postseason , hunsicker said , we did n't want to have to do it without a no 1 pitcher johnson , who had a 910 record after having compiled a 7520 record the previous five years , has sulked his way through the season in seattle because the mariners had not honored his request and traded him after they decided last winter they were not going to keep him after this season johnson , now that he has gained his wish , is expected to revert to the consistently dominating pitcher he has been for the mariners
princeton photographs as museum treasures \? and as subjects for art historians' phd dissertations \? these concepts seem normal now , but peter c bunnell remembers when they were almost unheard of in 1972 , mr bunnell was appointed to the nation s first endowed professorship in the history of photography , the david hunter mcalpin chair of the history of photography and modern art at princeton university he is also curator of photography at the university s art gallery , where a special exhibition , photography at princeton celebrating 25 years of collecting and teaching the history of photography , opened yesterday in 1964 , when mr bunnell was a graduate student in art history at yale university , he became the first student there to undertake a dissertation on the work of alfred stieglitz , the great american photographer and promoter of modernism his department nominated him for one of the prestigious fellowships offered by the samuel h kress foundation to support dissertation research the foundation replied that its mission was solely to underwrite research in the fine arts the implication being , of course , that photography was no such thing since then , the kress foundation has changed its view of photography , but mr bunnell never completed his dissertation , having been sidetracked by a job offer from the museum of modern art in manhattan the fact that photography is no longer seen as the poor stepsister of the arts is due in part to the efforts of a few pioneering scholars like him having first studied at the rochester institute of technology in upstate new york , where he received technical training as a photographer , mr bunnell sees himself as something of a hinge between the first teachers of the history of photography , often practitioners whose fascination with their medium had motivated them to study its history rather than academically trained scholars , and a subsequent generation whose background is in art history rather than in the craft of photography the way the history of photography has developed into a selfsufficient discipline after starting out as a sideline parallels a change that came over photography itself around the turn of the century in mr bunnell s view , many of the greatest photographers of the 19th century were individuals who came to photography from other mediums and either left that medium or went back to it , he said i look at these individuals as individuals as phenomena thanks to them , the field developed and people began to enter it based on their respect for the medium they accepted the medium as such and attempted to articulate it to some public purpose it may seem surprising that mr bunnell found his niche at princeton , a university not necessarily associated with such innovations , and one whose art history department is on the whole better known for producing medievalists than modernists one former student , ellen handy , now curator of collections at the international center of photography in manhattan , remembers mr bunnell as a fascinating and incongruous presence at princeton , breezy and informal amidst all the decorum photography s unexpected prominence at the university is mostly owed to mr mcalpin , one of the most active and impassioned collectors of photography from the 1930 s through the 1980 s , who died in 1989 because he was an alumnus of princeton , the university became a focus for his efforts to engender greater recognition of the art yet his offers to donate his collection to the art museum and to subsidize teaching in its history were at first rebuffed after princeton finally accepted mr mcalpin s generosity in 1971 , it recruited mr bunnell i was terribly conflicted about it , he said i went through one of those walkonthebeach moments , and i realized that as much as i loved working at moma , if we were going to move the field of photographic history forward , we needed the strength of a great university behind it mr bunnell sees the dual missions of teacher and curator as intertwined the collection is above all a teaching tool the public is more than welcome , he said , but the idea is for the students to be able to see the breadth of the medium these photographs are used they do n't just sit around in boxes i teach all the discussion sections of my courses with only original photographs , no slides to be able demonstrate what it is that makes atget so remarkable , a reproduction wo n't do eugene atget was the french photographer who , at the dawn of the century , made an astounding documentation of the streets and the architecture of paris perhaps even more important to mr bunnell than having created an outstanding collection is the fact that he has developed a cadre of graduate students to follow in his footsteps and spread the word about photographic history those students are all the more precious for being few we 've produced six doctorates in the history of photography , with seven more under way at various stages of development , he said that means that if all goes well , in the end i can hope to have placed about 15 phd s in the field each doctoral student is an individually wrought product , like the fine photographic prints mr bunnell loves
new delhi , nov 29 as vote tallies piled up here today in a series of important state elections , the humiliating defeat of the hindu nationalists and the stunning resurrection of india s oncedominant political force , the congress party , became ever more starkly apparent voters outraged by the spiraling prices of onions , tomatoes and potatoes essentials of the indian diet swept the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party from office by landslide margins where it had been deeply entrenched the party lost in delhi , the district that includes the nation s capital , and in the hindi heartland state of rajasthan even more surprising in a year marked by an antiincumbent mood among voters , the congress party managed to hold on to power firmly in the central indian state of madhya pradesh , the country s largest political analysts said it was likely that voters there blamed the national government , led by the hindu nationalists , for price increases , not the state government two regional parties beat out congress in the small northeastern state of mizoram , the other state where elections were held , but its results were not considered important to national politics while the hindu nationalists alienated leaders all over the world in may when the government conducted secret underground nuclear tests , polls indicated that it was rising vegetable prices that cost them dearly with voters at home the repudiation of the hindu nationalists in the state elections , which were held on wednesday with the votes being counted over the weekend , will further undermine the 18party coalition government they lead at the national level the eightmonthold government is already plagued by squabbles that range from the farcical to the serious while some of the bharatiya janata party s partners openly criticized it this weekend for its failure in the state elections , none have yet withdrawn from the coalition , which has a narrow majority in parliament but one political commentator quoted a saying by chanakya , the indian political sage from ancient times , to question how long the party s allies will remain loyal when a tree falls , the birds wo n't sit on it still , the arithmetic of the hindu nationalists' hold on national power is unchanged for now prime minister atal behari vajpayee admitted on saturday that he was taken aback by the depth of his party s loss , but he said the coalition would prove it still has a majority when parliament convenes for its winter session on monday he has also begun owning up to his mistakes , a partywide process that was in full swing by today at a meeting of state officials on friday , mr vajpayee acknowledged that his government should have moved more quickly to import onions when a shortage caused the prices to rise , and to remove all duties on them before the elections , he had blamed mother nature and vegetable crop failures for surging prices the bjp had an image as a cohesive , disciplined , wellled party and all that fell away , said pran chopra , a political analyst at the center for policy research in new delhi prices became the crystallized image of the incompetence of the bjp government jubilant congress party workers celebrated in the streets on saturday night , but the party s president , sonia gandhi , had a more sober reaction to victory this morning yes , she said , the results are a gain , but she told a television reporter that she was still in no rush to topple the hindunationalistled coalition congress party leaders and political analysts said her caution was wise congress has even fewer votes in parliament than the hindu nationalists only 141 of the 272 it would need to form a majority it would have to join with a number of other political parties that are unified mainly by their opposition to the bharatiya janata party and what they see as its attempt to impose a narrow vision of hinduism on the rich religious diversity of india for example , the communists , who have governed the state of west bengal for two decades , are eager to join with congress in what they call a secular front , but the communists and the congress party have long been divided on economic issues the congress party like the hindunationalistled government favors a gradual opening of indian markets to foreign investment , while the communists favor more protectionist policies murli s deora , a congress party leader from bombay who is chairman of the finance committee in parliament , said the congress party , just like the hindu nationalists , would find it almost impossible to govern effectively and difficult to survive politically if it assumed power now the congress is not up to power just now , he said he and others said the party should wait on the assumption that the hindu nationalists' coalition will fall apart , then press for new elections that might return a strengthened congress party to govern with a clearer public mandate there s no way to form a majority in the present parliament without facing the same problems as the bjp , said yogendra yadav , a political scientist with the center for the study of developing societies it would be foolish of the congress to form a government now it is not yet clear just how much this election was a rejection of the hindu nationalists and how much a victory for congress , the party whose founders led india to independence in 1947 mrs gandhi is the unlikely inheritor of the congress party mantle an italianborn roman catholic in majorityhindu india , she is the surviving member of the nehrugandhi dynasty her husband s grandfather , jawaharlal nehru , was india s first prime minister her motherinlaw , prime minister indira gandhi , died in her arms after being shot by sikh bodyguards and her husband , rajiv , was assassinated in 1991 by a sri lankan suicide bomber while he was campaigning to win back the post of prime minister mrs gandhi , who lived a private life after her husband s death until she emerged this year as an aggressive , confident campaigner , has read her speeches in hindi to huge throngs in recent weeks but has granted no sitdown interviews to reporters with her shoulderlength flip of dark hair , she is the public face of the congress party , but she has yet to expose herself to searching questions nonetheless , she led congress to its biggest victory since 1985 , the year after her motherinlaw s assassination and political commentators here say she has asserted control over the party hierarchy and may yet become prime minister of india in her own right photo the congress party held on to madhya pradesh in state elections the party s leader , sonia gandhi , wore a garland in new delhi yesterday \( agence francepresse \)
the teacher raised his hands and pleaded for calm hold on ! let s catch our breath here , people ! but the student in front was determined to finish his account of being menaced with a kitchen knife two classmates were laughing at him a fourth student launched into a fullthroated attack against human nature and the evils of bureaucracy and marched angrily out of the room i have a bad heart , she yelled from the hallway i 've got to cool down in almost any other classroom , someone would have been in big trouble but this was landlord school , and the 25 new york city landlords who had gathered in the basement of a brooklyn bank were already in big trouble sometime this winter , city housing inspectors found that they were not providing their tenants with heat or hot water or both , one of the most serious violations of city housing law instead of paying a fine , though , the landlords had chosen an unusual out they were going to school and learning to be better landlords in a city of more than four million renters , it might sound like the stuff of fantasy , a tenement morality tale from the pages of bernard malamud but the experimental program , begun in january 1997 and confined for now to brooklyn , has produced real results none of the 100 landlords who took the ninehour course last winter have been cited for denying tenants heat or hot water so far this winter they 're not the people you think of when you think of a slumlord , said anne pasmanick , who runs the community training and resource center , a tenant advocacy group that created the program with the help of the courts , landlord groups and the city these are people , for the most part , who are not malicious , but just ignorant and struggling themselves and when they get fined , they usually just get mad the fines do n't make them say , 'what can i do to solve the problem \? ' those who have passed through the class , officially known as the landlord training program , are certainly not a casting agent s idea of slick new york city landlords most have fulltime jobs apart from real estate and spend nights and weekends attending to the intricacies of boilers , breaker switches , clogged toilets and leaky roofs nearly twothirds of the landlords were born outside the united states and many are recent immigrants who have a hard time with english their tenants tend to be recent immigrants themselves , many of them working class or poor also , the class is open only to smalltime landlords who own fewer than 20 apartments , a group that has long been on the economic ropes , struggling with worndown buildings , low rents and what they contend are crushing taxes and regulations citywide , the group is essential to the affordable housing market according to 1996 census bureau figures , perhaps as many as half a million people live in buildings of this size but when asked , almost all the landlords in the class swear that if they were given a chance to go back and invest the money elsewhere residential real estate would be nowhere on the list are you kidding \? asked kwei yang , a nurse in her late 40 s who owns two buildings on tough streets in east new york i had no idea what i was getting into it has turned my hair gray that is not to say , however , that the landlords are the innocent victims they often portray themselves to be while they are all firsttime offenders of the heat and hot water laws , a survey of last winter s class of 100 landlords found that more than half the owners had at least 30 violations recorded against their buildings , ranging from faulty wiring to broken windows to roach and mice infestations and there is a good chance that many of the landlords have not fixed these problems in spot checks of repairs , the city s department of housing preservation and development has found that landlords lie about correcting violations in about 35 percent of the cases many owners also readily admit to being active participants in the landlordtenant duels that have become as ritualized in new york city as kabuki theater there was this one guy who came up to me and said , 'i turned off the heat and hot water , ' ms pasmanick of the tenant advocacy group recalled he said , 'i wanted to get these people out of there , and this is how i did it' no qualms about doing it or saying it more often , though , the owners simply do not know how to run their buildings , a fact that led the city s largest landlords' group , the rent stabilization association , into a rare alliance with the tenant advocates to promote the program everybody thinks you 're an automatic maven , an expert , when you buy a building , said joseph strasburg , president of the landlord group it s just not the case on a recent night in landlord class , the students were amazed , for example , to hear that apartments consume almost twice as much energy as the average american house , because they are generally overheated many had never considered that when their fueloil salesman is also their boiler repairman the potential for finagling exists , or that many of their shower heads still spout 6 gallons of water a minute instead of 25 gallons , the federal standard this item alone could cut your fuel bill for hot water in half , said andrew padian , an energy efficiency expert who addressed the class
with an announcement that is already producing applause and handwringing , doctors at a fertility center near washington will report today that they can substantially stack the odds that a couple can have a baby of the sex they choose the method , developed by the genetics ivf institute in fairfax , va , involves sorting sperm by the amount of dna they contain and then using them for artificial insemination it capitalizes on the fact that there is only one difference between sperm that carry the y chromosome , which produces males , and those with an x chromosome , which produces females sperm with a y chromosome have about 28 percent less genetic material the investigators report that if they select for xbearing sperm , they end up with sperm samples in which 85 percent of the cells have an x chromosome if they select for ybearing sperm , the result is a sperm sample in which 65 percent of the cells contain a y chromosome in a paper being published today in the journal human reproduction , the investigators , led by dr edward f fugger , report results for couples who wanted girls of 14 pregnancies that progressed far enough for doctors to determine the fetus s sex , 13 fetuses were female ten out of the 11 babies born so far were girls dr fugger said that the group had produced about the same number of pregnancies for couples who wanted boys and that the results were consistent with what the sperm sorting would predict but , he said , the investigators are not releasing the results of those pregnancies until they are published in a medical journal of course , sex selection techniques have been promoted and marketed for decades but , said dr alan decherney , the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of california at los angeles and the editor of the journal fertility and sterility , nothing worked until now the genetics ivf institute , a private , forprofit medical center , is a leader in fertility research and prides itself in being among the first to offer new reproductive techniques dr fugger noted that hundreds of animals of a variety of species had been born after sperm sorting before his group began using the method and that there was no evidence that sperm sorting caused birth defects but other fertility experts raised questions about the ethical quandaries opened up with a decision to provide sex selection and about whether the animal tests were adequate to show safety in humans sex selection has been used for millennia , with folk remedies that supposedly guaranteed a baby of a particular sex , female infanticide and , more recently , the abortion of fetuses because of their sex decade after decade , so many groups have claimed that they had a method for sex selection that the entire field became tainted , said dr richard rawlins , the director of the in vitro fertilization laboratories at rush university in chicago most recently , claims that male sperm could be separated because they swim faster were found to be without scientific basis to sift sperm , researchers at the genetics ivf institute stained the dna and then used a cell sorter that lined up sperm individually in a stream , where each sperm s dna content was measured and the xcontaining sperm separated from those with a y chromosome the scientists said it took most of a day to sort the approximately 200 million wriggling sperm of a single ejaculate as they pass single file through the machine s dna detector dr joseph schulman , director of the genetics ivf institute , said most of the couples wanted to choose their baby s sex for family balancing a few wanted sex selection because they were at risk of having babies with genetic diseases that afflict boys almost exclusively , he said dr schulman said that , so far , the institute was not offering the method to couples who have no children and want a first child of a particular sex , but he did not rule out that use monique collins of gainesville , va , was one of the first to have sperm sorting , in march 1995 she had two sons , who were aged 2 and 6 , and urgently wanted a daughter having a daughter for me was like having a baby for some people that s how important it was , she said she and her husband , scott collins , had a girl on aug 13 , 1996 , after mr collins s sperm was sorted at the institute the virginia researchers are using a technique whose development began 16 years ago , when dr lawrence a johnson , a scientist at the department of agriculture s research service in beltsville , md , began working on a sperm separation method his goal was to do sex selection for farm animals dr johnson labeled the dna in sperm cells with a temporary , nontoxic , fluorescent chemical once that chemical was in the sperm cells , they would glow blue under a laser light the more light that was emitted when the laser shined on a sperm cell , the more dna the cell contained that gave dr johnson a way to detect small differences in dna content he modified a cell sorting machine so that it would detect it
take andres galarraga out of the rocky mountains and he 'll become an ordinary hitter put him in turner field and he 'll become even more ordinary walt weiss \? sure , he 'll cover more infield ground than jeff blauser , but he wo n't provide as much offense what are the braves to do with all those great pitchers if they ca n't score any runs for them \? so went the offseason questions and doubts about the changes atlanta made in the lineup that had been together and had been successful for so long all right , the skeptics said , the team would still be good enough to win its seventh successive division championship because the division would n't offer much competition , but beware of the offense it just might be too puny a leagueleading 67 home runs and 242 runs later , the braves once again have proved that they know best not only do they continue to have an awesome corps of starting pitchers , but they also have a band of hitters that terrorizes other pitchers the hitters most notably tied a major league record by hitting home runs in 25 consecutive games and , before last night s game in houston , had failed to hit home runs in only 6 of their 42 games contrary to the dire predictions of the skeptics , galarraga leads the team with 15 home runs , 7 of which he has hit at turner field he did n't hit one there last season when he visited as a member of the colorado rockies you 'd think the home runs would drop off a little , bobby cox , the atlanta manager , said , but watching him every day , his home runs are 450 , 430 all of his home runs would have been out of the biggest park in the world weiss , who like galarraga moved from colorado to atlanta as a free agent , has hit none of the braves' 67 home runs he only entered yesterday s games hitting 374 , five points better than the perennial batting champion tony gwynn and 116 points ahead of his career average this guy is an onbase machine , cox said of the shortstop , whose onbase percentage was second in the league and 100 points higher than his batting average even when he does n't walk , the pitcher s going to throw six pitches it s going to be 32 i knew he was good , but i did n't know he 'd be this good galarraga , weiss and chipper jones are in the top 10 in onbase percentage galarraga , jones , michael tucker and javier lopez are in the top 10 in slugging percentage jones , galarraga and lopez are there in runs batted in , galarraga , jones and lopez in home runs and so forth and so on when the recordtying home run spree began april 18 , the braves were tied for first place with the mets when it ended thursday , the braves were in first place alone with an 8 1 2game lead in that period , in which they won 20 games and lost 5 , they hit 45 home runs galarraga hit 10 of them , including 5 when his was the only atlanta homer in the game cox acknowledged that the number of home runs has surprised him i have to be surprised , he said the ball s been jumping really big time in atlanta we 've never hit the ball like this or scored runs like this with home runs i know we have n't but the braves are not strangers to the home run in the past six seasons , they finished either first or second in the league in home runs , reaching a high of 197 in 1996 if they were to maintain the pace at which they have hit them , they would hit 258 seattle set a major league record with 264 last season the rockies hit a national league record 239 last season galarraga contributed 41 to that total cox apparently ca n't get enough of his new first baseman ernie banks says let s play two , the manager said this guy would play three sudden impact home runs produced another story last week this one seems to occur at different stages every season players who had not hit a home run hit not just one but two or three or four gregg jefferies of philadelphia did not hit a home run in his first 33 games then he slugged one in each of the next three games , wednesday , thursday and friday mark grace of the chicago cubs went 36 games without a home run , then connected for one last monday , one tuesday and two thursday bernie williams of the yankees played 31 homerless games , then went beyond the fences in successive games tuesday \( righthanded \) and wednesday \( lefthanded \) greg norton of the chicago white sox did not play as often as the others but was still seeking his first home after 18 games then he hit one tuesday and two thursday then there s chris widger of montreal he did n't hit his first home run last week , but he did hit his fourth and fifth wednesday , giving him five in seven games after not having hit any in his first 27 games brosius is showing them in 1996 scott brosius hit 304 for the oakland athletics , then plummeted 101 points to 203 last season now the yankees' third baseman , he is hitting 325 so what is this guy , a 200 hitter or a 300 hitter \? i think it s pretty apparent from my career that i'm not a 200 hitter , brosius said last year was last year it was a struggle , but there s nothing i can do to change it i can sit and beat myself up trying to figure it out or i can put it behind me a lot of things went wrong when the season was over , i looked at it , took what i could from it and left it there brosius , who has a career 248 average , said he knew he would not repeat last season this season getting off to a good start is nice , period , no matter what kind of year you 're coming off , he said but i did n't feel i had to come in and do something more to put it behind me i wish it had n't happened i wish i had n't gone through it but maybe i learned something from it and it will help me out down the line somewhere the yankees obtained brosius from the athletics for kenny rogers , who has turned his poor seasons in new york into a promising one \( 62 \) in oakland brosius said he did n't think he was traded because of his performance i think the trade would have happened anyway , he said i think it would have happened before the offseason if i had had a better year last year if anything , struggling made trading me more difficult teams used that to try to drop the terms of the trade they said look at the year he s having now look at the year he s having quiet behind the scenes tom grieve obviously was not a typical little league father a former general manager of the texas rangers , grieve is n't a typical major league father either i read about a lot of the relationships that parents of baseball players have with their kids , grieve said , how they 'll watch a game on tv and call up and say you 're not doing this , you 're not doing that ben grieve receives no such telephone calls from his father the athletics' rookie right fielder is hitting 306 with 4 home runs and 24 runs batted in without his father s tips we do n't talk baseball , said the elder grieve , who is now the rangers' television analyst i ask him things like , is he eating well , who his roommate is , is he taking care of himself , are you playing hard , do you like it , are you happy , how are the bus rides , how are the plane rides \? grieve attributes his approach to his experience in baseball having been in the farm department and seeing kids who were instructed by wellmeaning parents and some who were instructed by parents who were pro players , i think you create more problems than you solve , he said you deliver a different message you might be talking about the same thing , but it s a little different way the last thing i want is for him to go up to denny walling or art howe and say , 'well , you know , my dad' right away , 'oh , oh , one of those' i think he needs to trust his instruction , trust his manager and get his baseball information from there the system seems to be working just fine for the rookie photo andres galarraga leads the braves with 15 home runs this season \( photograph by associated press \)

manville i call mia sorella ristorante for directions , and a young man named anthony di aniello carefully tells me how to get there he seems excited that i want to make the trip and assures me that the meal will be worth it because i 've heard that mia sorella is an intimate , momandpop italian restaurant with homemade everything , i cannot get into the car fast enough anthony and his sister , adele , are at the door as we enter , asking if the directions were adequate and expressing joy that we have chosen their restaurant for dinner before ordering , we learn from the pair \( in tandem \) that their older brother , jerry , is the host at mia sorella on friday nights that their mother , rosa di aniello , and her sister , adele debiase , developed all of the recipes , and that their father , vinny , is in the back making fresh mozzarella while one of my companions runs down the street to buy some merlot \( the restaurant is byo \) , the rest of us take a moment to soak up our surroundings as we read the menu , anthony delivers a plate of bruschetta slices of homemade bread , some topped with roasted tomato and garlic , other with eggplant , celery and onion a bowl of extravirgin olive oil , infused with rosemary and oregano freshly picked from the herb garden beside the restaurant , accompanies the bruschetta the simple tomato version is wonderful , with a fresh , clean tomato flavor , an aggressive amount of garlic and a crisp sourdough base a cold antipasto special is as fresh an appetizer as i 've tasted since august homemade mozzarella , wrapped around prosciutto , is laid over slices of vineripened tomatoes and justpicked arugula , and drizzled with aged balsamic vinegar from modena the fried calamari is an equally appropriate starter , gently battered and fried in a very clean oil , and served with a light tomato sauce only two appetizers are letdowns in the large portion of eggplant rollatini , the eggplant does not meld with the fresh ricotta cheese or with the chunky sauce similarly , a warm antipasto special , a portobello mushroom almost the size of my plate topped with bread crumbs and sage , though dramatic and original , lacks a binding sauce to give it cohesion and creaminess a special salad baby mixed greens with granny smith apples , caramelized red onions and gorgonzola in a cider balsamic vinaigrette is truly memorable , providing an unusual , sugary contrast to the hearty italian fare to come adele and anthony appear to invite the diners at a few tables to see vinny s mozzarella demonstration in the kitchen in addition to a lesson in shaping bocconcini , we are all given a taste of mozzarella , fresh out of the boiling water , that is warm , creamy and salty a pure delight upon our return to our tables , our hot appetizers reappear , having been kept warm in the kitchen and refreshed with new sauces our first entree , mia sorella s risotto of the day , is exceptional although this dish is often poorly prepared , here the textures of the salmon , striped bass and swordfish perfectly match the creaminess of the rice , working together with a rich , lobsterinfused stock to produce a risotto that is neither fishy nor gummy , but simply smooth a special consisting of grilled shrimp , swordfish and striped bass over winter greens and rice pilaf elicits an equally positive response it delivers the clean , uncomplicated taste of each individual fresh fish , sprinkled with olive oil , lemon juice , salt and pepper the one entree at mia sorella that i did not particularly fancy was the lasagna in that dish , the same dry , heavy ricotta found in the eggplant rollatini separates layers of gamy meat in a marinara sauce , all of which never really mesh but the veal saltimbocca and the cavatelli and broccoli , both regular menu items , are remarkable the veal is lightly breaded , topped with prosciutto and very fresh mozzarella , placed over a bed of emeraldgreen spinach , and coated with a thin but powerful veal sauce made with red wine and freshly picked shallots \( from the garden \) similarly , the cavatelli and broccoli combines homemade and homegrown ingredients into one cohesive meal blanched broccoli spears , roasted garlic and chunks of tomato blend in a light wine broth over homemade pasta , with a few flakes of red pepper adding a final , appreciated sparkle as we eat rosa s masterly creations , her husband , vinny , goes from table to table chatting with guests about the merits of homemade pastas and cheeses , and homegrown herbs and vegetables in his musings , he takes us on a romantic journey to naples , ischia and the amalfi coast before we can hear more , vinny dashes across the street to attend to his pizza parlor , manville pizza , which has been open 30 years although we are already full , we do n't dare miss out on rosa s desserts the cannoli s ricottaandmascarpone filling is as fluid and flavorful as the best vanilla frosting , while the tiramisu is light , rumsoaked and creamy , with each taste and texture standing out on its own the ricotta cheesecake makes the best use of the fresh ricotta at mia sorella , as its dry texture is perfectly suited to a fluffy cheesecake , although the overly sweet base could use less oil with its incredibly personal service , family history , morethan manageable prices and a few real masterpieces , it is not surprising that mia sorella ristorante has won numerous awards i only hope that this review does not prevent the di aniellos from having the time to entertain me on my next

\) the shadow was , he says , the oddest and wealthiest of crimebusters it was almost as if donald trump were to lead a secret life fighting crime in new york dressed in fruity blue tights and boots in discussing the green hornet , he wonders , why a hornet \? and why green and not yellow \? then there is the mystery of the lone ranger , called the long ranger in mr nachman s schoolyard you only ranger left , said tonto in the first episode after rescuing the lawman from a massacre what if the show had been called the only ranger \? tonto , by the way , was played for many years by an elderly shakespearean actor , who , we are told , tended to doze off during episodes , once leaving the masked man \( brace beemer \) to improvise a monologue radio was the land of the color blind and the ageless , where two white actors could personify amos 'n' andy , and where mel blanc and other clowns with limber voices could move from show to show and create a galaxy of contrasting characters with sitcoms , special mention is reserved for eve arden s prefeminist our miss brooks , the first bright , independent , unmarried , working female comic character on the air , someone who did n't need mr boynton to make her life complete even while he quotes bob and ray twitting one man s family as one feller s family , mr nachman recognizes the reason for the longevity of carlton e morse s serial , which , he says , was inspired by the forsyte saga it depicted the daytoday life of an average family with a naturalness and a reasonable degree of sophistication as the author demonstrates , the most memorable shows , like the jack benny show and dragnet , broke the mold , a lesson still not learned by television at the same time , he is clear about the arc of broadcast history , how charlie mccarthy led to kermit the frog , how duffy s tavern begat cheers radio programs were ineluctably identified with their sponsors and their announcers as the author says , nearly every radio baby can still sing or whistle the peppy rinso white tune and dozens of other jingles among the fascinating sideline characters are anne and frank hummert , writers and producers who filled daytime radio with everything from just plain bill to mr keen , tracer of lost persons mr nachman links the writers arch oboler , norman corwin and himan brown as theatrical giants of radio himan who \?

clinton administration officials insist that this time , for sure , no kidding , absolutely , positively , the mideast peace process is entering its endgame either yasir arafat and benjamin netanyahu say yes to the us compromise plan for tying up all the outstanding issues before finalstatus negotiations or else or else or else what \? the or else that clintonites have been hinting at is that they will make their compromise proposals public and then let the parties fend for themselves and since it is mr netanyahu who has been resisting the us plan for a roughly 13 percent phased israeli withdrawal from the west bank in return for phased palestinian fulfillment of security and political commitments the threat is directed primarily at him alas , though , mr netanyahu does not seem to be quaking in his boots give bibi his due for all his fumbling , he understands power he can smell weakness and for now he clearly detects an imbalance of power in his favor , which is why he keeps calling the clinton team s bluff what does bibi detect \? he detects that the us defeat of the soviet union and iraq have left the arab states with no military option they can huff and puff , but none of them will bring any military weight to bear on behalf of the palestinians both the arab and palestinian middle classes have , for the moment , opted out of the arabisraeli conflict he detects that with gasoline at 1 a gallon in the us and american oil companies diversified outside the middle east , the arab oil lobby in washington today is dead so now when the israel lobby calls senators , like connie mack and joe lieberman , and tells them to jump , the only question they ask is how high \? senators mack and lieberman sponsored a senate letter effectively demanding that bill clinton abandon america s balanced mediator role in arabisrael negotiations which produced the 1973 disengagement accords , camp david and the madrid breakthrough and instead use america s weight to pressure mr arafat to accept whatever mr netanyahu offers mr netanyahu detects that mr clinton and al gore have no stomach for any politically explosive showdown with him he detects that the president s national security adviser , sandy berger , is more willing to bring domestic political calculations into us foreign policy than any previous nsc adviser and he detects that secretary of state madeleine albright , though she got off to an excellent start in the middle east , has lost her nerve partly because she is always uncertain of how much mr clinton will back her and partly because she has yet to articulate any coherent framework for us foreign policy and the national interest , and therefore she has been unable to extract arabisraeli diplomacy from domestic us politics the question is what will mr netanyahu do with this imbalance of power \? he seems to think he has two options option one is to use his leverage to cut a good deal , a better deal than the labor party ever could have gotten , a deal that whittles the palestinian demands \( for this secondphase withdrawal \) down from 20 or 30 percent of the west bank to 11 or 12 percent but a deal that still leaves the palestinians with enough gains to want to continue oslo and cooperate with israel on security this option would cost bibi some support within his own rightist coalition , but would make him a hero nationally option two is to assume he can use the imbalance of power to cram whatever he wants down the palestinians' throats such as less than full sovereignty over less than half the west bank and if the palestinians wo n't accept that , so this option assumes , he can live with the stalemate at no cost , because the us will not punish him , because the arabs will never get their act together , and because israel s labor party is too weak to mount any domestic challenge but there is a third option , one mr netanyahu may not see it s option two with a different ending one in which everyone does n't just bow to this imbalance of power in this option , the usisrael relationship slowly erodes the arab cold war against israel reemerges israel gets reghettoized in the region and eventually exposed to a hot war with unconventional weapons and the palestinian middle class gets reradicalized and starts killing again first its own leaders and then israelis beware of option three
rifton , ny in a region filled with monasteries , churches and religious retreats of every stripe , one might think a christian conference center could slip in with barely a ripple but as neighbors here began to chat among themselves about what was going on at the old goddardriverside community center campground , quiet concerns grew into nagging worries , because the site was turning into a sprawling christian complex rifton , a tiny hamlet of 150 people in the ulster county town of esopus , consists of a post office , a general store and a small library if tom mahairas has his way , it will also be a nextdoor neighbor to his citivision conference center , a yearround religious retreat playing host to as many as 700 people for banquets , concerts , fundraisers and prayer groups in his literature , pastor mahairas , as he calls himself , has advertised the site as a camp for city children and a meeting center for all manner of religious activities related to ministries he has founded to his neighbors , however , he has insisted that the 174acre site , with its stunning mountain views , private lake and majestic trees , will be a place for meditation , quiet reflection and communion with nature it s going to be a positive , hopeful place , a joyful place , he said the neighbors are not so sure noise from six teenage boys tearing across claude samton s property on allterrain vehicles this summer led mr samton , a new york city architect , to take a look for himself after the boys said they were from the youth camp up the road there were a dozen bulldozers up there , and i realized that this was not just a youth camp where he s building a few bunks , he said that s a joke this is a huge project it s a religious theme park legally , mr mahairas may do what he wants on the site as long as he continues to use it the way goddardriverside did , as a rustic camp for children the question is does a 700person compound open year round with a wild , wild west fort , heated dormitoriess , a chapel , a banquet hall and a hoop heaven of nbasized basketball courts qualify \? a growing number of neighbors and town officials think not mr mahairas is not new to town fifteen years ago , he said , he bought land seven miles away in esopus with plans to open a religious center for men with lifecontrolling problems officials , however , remember the proposal differently it was an abandoned children s camp and they just moved in and took it over , saying they were going to reestablish it as a boys' camp and bring youth up from the city , said marilyn coffey , who was the town s supervisor at the time but it was not a youth camp by the time we realized what was going on , it was a men s drug and alcohol rehab center the center remains in operation based on that experience , she said she would watch mr mahairas s latest enterprise closely to mr mahairas s supporters in town , that and a host of other complaints are simply transparent excuses for religious prejudice among ultraliberal treehuggers , as one man called the pastor s angry neighbors some residents in this predominantly democratic community have hinted that mr mahairas may be closely aligned with the religious right wing he refuses to say where the money to finance his 1 million enterprise has come from , but counts the rev billy graham and the rev jerry falwell among his friends we 've got two issues here , an issue of religious prejudice and of prejudice against children , said ira weiner , a former town board member and political commentator on the local cable television program , focus on esopus any time a religious group comes around here , the word 'cult' seems to crop up mr mahairas , 49 , a new york city native , speaks compellingly about his conversion from drugaddicted teenager to preacher of the gospel he claims ties to more than 400 churches and pastors around the country and says he has founded a halfdozen ministries in new york city over the last 25 years , including the manhattan bible church , the manhattan christian academy , the transformation life center , new york gospel outreach and the love kitchen he envisions rifton as a place where the branches of all his ministries will meet his enthusiasm overflows , yet mr mahairas is skillful at tailoring his message to whoever might be listening walking around with a television crew from focus on esopus television , he avoided showing dormitory rooms with comfortablelooking double beds , focusing instead on the spartan bunks next door when he candidly announced to the camera , we want to expand , the show s producer , greg gulbrandsen , who supports mr mahairas s mission , urged him to use another word and taped the segment again \( mr gulbrandsen said later that he wanted to keep the focus on mr mahairas s immediate plans \) i just want to maximize what s there , mr mahairas said with a shrug it s not like i 've got some devious plan he said that the site had been a camp for various organizations since 1924
birmingham , england if orchestras have lips , then on the lips of many of them at the moment , in this country and in europe , is the same name simon rattle they want mr rattle some have been wanting him for years the reasons are obvious he is an outstanding musician though he may not succeed in quite everything he takes on , he is probably incapable of giving a dull concert he works brilliantly with orchestras he comes to rehearsals thoroughly prepared , and he comes prepared to listen he has a huge range of sympathies , and his sympathies are intense he loves rameau , and he loves gershwin he loves stravinsky and mahler , haydn and boulez , szymanowski and mozart , wagner and such british contemporaries as mark anthony turnage and judith weir he is in the process of discovering how to love beethoven he is a thinker , and he is a showman he proves a treat for audiences , as well he might at his best which is to say , about 98 percent of the time he can persuade you that his performance of a piece is not only fuller , richer and stronger than any other you may have heard in the concert hall but also pretty much definitive for the present age he is , even so , modest and determined there are many musicians he admires , and he tries to work with most of them at the age of 43 , he is a learner conducting music is one of his ways of learning as well as a way of passing on what he has learned now , after nearly two decades with the city of birmingham symphony orchestra , he wants to take time off and learn more away from the podium still , the offers may be hard to resist as he noted in a recent conversation here , the more he says he is not looking for a post at the moment , the more pressing the invitations become some wellwishers are hoping that he may be persuaded to stay in britain , where he is surely needed he might be the man to sort out the sorry mess that is covent garden if he could refashion it as an institution giving both opera performances and concerts , with enough financing not to be socially restrictive \( his work in the theater , especially in mozart , wagner and janacek , has been thrilling \) there has also been talk of founding a new orchestra and a new hall for him in london the likelihood , though , is that sooner or later he will be taking charge of one of the great american orchestras when mr rattle and the birmingham symphony visit avery fisher hall this afternoon for the first of two concerts on their farewell tour , the orchestra will not be what it was when he took over as music director 18 years ago while he has , in the natural course of events , grown older , his orchestra has gotten younger whereas in 1980 he was a 25yearold conducting musicians twice his age and more , now most of his players are younger than he is threequarters of the personnel have been replaced during this time the orchestra he leads is now his but that is not the whole story it would be truer to say that the orchestra he leads is now simply better not only better equipped in terms of players but also better managed , better experienced and better housed those who complain that the birmingham orchestra is not in the same league as the cleveland orchestra or the vienna philharmonic miss the point what has mattered in the last 18 years has been the advance this orchestra has made , from being a minor player even among britain s provincial orchestras to becoming a superb , versatile and enthusiastic body of musicians what has mattered also has been the example set in birmingham of what a modern orchestra might be willing to take a fresh approach to haydn or beethoven or mahler , eager to investigate new repertory , intent on taking its audience into an artistic partnership , and intent , too , on contributing vigorously to the life and pride of its city none of this could have happened without mr rattle , but none of it could have happened , either , without the strong support given him by the orchestra s administration under its chief executive , edward smith because of that support , mr rattle could give programs unimaginable anywhere else in 1991 , for example , he and the orchestra embarked on an extraordinary project to offer a retrospective of 20thcentury music in the century s last 10 years , moving forward decade by decade each year that meant , in 1996 , a concert of some of the knottiest music from the knotty 1950 s stravinsky s agon , messiaen s chronochromie and stockhausen s gruppen earlier this year came a program of pierre boulez and , again , messiaen , and another of works by tippett , harrison birtwistle and oliver knussen \( his third symphony , which is included in the second fisher hall concert \) the audience may not like everything , mr smith said immediately before the tippettbirtwistleknussen evening , but at least they 'll go away talking about the music this could be where the birmingham phenomenon has the most to teach because mr rattle has conducted only music in which he believes , passionately , the audience has come to trust him there is a buzz in birmingham people know that their music director is not only an expert musician but also an explorer , and they feel embraced in his journeys , whether into new works or into older music , like the rameau to be played this afternoon a suite from the composer s last stage piece , les boreades why rameau \? because , mr rattle explained , i was there at the first performance

andrew s grove , a founding father of the personal computer industry , is stepping aside as the chief executive of the intel corporation , the company announced yesterday mr grove , 61 , will remain a fulltime employee as intel s chairman in an interview , he characterized the move as an orderly passing of the top executive position to a wellgroomed successor , craig r barrett , 58 , intel s president and chief operating officer , while freeing mr grove to focus on the challenge of maintaining intel s extraordinary pace of growth since its founding in 1968 , intel has had three chief executives , with each of its three founders robert noyce , gordon moore and mr grove serving for about a decade stepping out now , mr grove said , fits the company s pattern of chief executive tenure it s time , mr grove said craig barrett is ready , and i'm ready the changes are expected to take effect on may 20 the slender , combative mr grove , whose management credo is only the paranoid survive , was treated for prostate cancer three years ago intel directors and mr grove said yesterday that his health was in no way an issue in the announcement and i hope it wo n't be , mr grove added with his trademark bluntness under mr grove s stewardship , intel has thrived in the face of challenges , including upanddown cycles in the technology industry , clone chip makers and rival microprocessor designs , like the power pc , a joint venture of international business machines , apple and motorola none proved to be an obstacle to intel s remarkable rise in 1987 , the year mr grove became chief executive , intel reported profits of 248 million on sales of 19 billion last year , the company s profits reached nearly 695 billion on sales of 25 billion its microprocessor chips serve as the silicon brains in more than 80 percent of the world s personal computers the grove years have been rewarding for intel shareholders , as well since 1987 , intel s value on the stock market has increased roughly twentyfold , to 128 billion for his part , mr grove , who came to the united states from hungary in 1957 with a few dollars in his pockets , speaking little english , is worth an estimated 300 million today wall street took the news that mr grove would relinquish the job of chief executive in stride , as intel shares rose 19375 , to 781875 the company also announced yesterday that its board had authorized the repurchase of an additional 100 million shares as part of a stock buyback program mr barrett , 58 , takes over as chief executive at a time when intel is facing a fresh set of challenges the surge in sales of lowercost personal computers , which are priced at 1 , 000 and below and now account for about 35 percent of sales , is eating into intel s profit margins for more than a decade , the average selling price of intel s microprocessors was about 235 a chip today , the average price is below 200 , estimates drew peck , a managing director of cowen company in boston by the end of the year , mr peck estimates , the average selling price for intel processors could fall to 150 a chip mr barrett , who joined intel in 1974 from stanford university , where he was an associate professor of materials science and engineering , is known as a manufacturing expert and for the next year or so , analysts say , intel must revamp its manufacturing operations to produce a higher volume of chips , each of which will bring less profit for intel as prices continue to fall intel is facing one of its greatest challenges in the last 10 years , mr peck said and barrett should be the right person for the job he s a real manufacturing guy as one sign of its nearterm difficulties , intel warned wall street earlier this month that firstquarter sales would be about 10 percent below the expectations of a few months earlier even so , david b yoffie , a harvard business school professor and intel director , said that while the company did face new obstacles , it had managed to move nimbly to adapt to market shifts in the past its challenge now is in a sense the winner s curse finding sufficient future growth to continue its success , mr yoffie said mr grove said that pursuing new growth opportunities would be his priority as both chairman and chief executive , he said , he spent more than 50 percent of his time in staff meetings of various kinds we 're a disciplined company , mr grove said , and to some extent , as chief executive you become beholden to that scheduling discipline now , i want to be able to go where my interest takes me and my interest is market growth the goal mr grove is pursuing , he says , is having one billion computers connected to digital communications networks , like the current internet that growth , he said , is a decadelong evolution that began about three years ago today , mr grove estimates that about 150 million computers worldwide are linked to networks future growth , he said , will require alliances , investment and persuasion in fields outside intel s direct control , like encouraging the creation of satellite networks for data communications influencing this broader industry ecology requires reaching out beyond the pc industry , cajoling , arguing , pleading and begging , he said inside the company , intel is embarking on a program of designing , producing and

frankfurt , sept 10 faced with a new lawsuit over the use of slave labor during world war ii , volkswagen ag is to announce plans on friday to set up a fund of about 12 million to compensate surviving workers it will be overseen by shimon peres , the former prime minister of israel , according to people working with the company the move comes at a time when american lawyers have filed classaction suits over slave labor against volkswagen and many other german industrial companies most of the companies acknowledge that they used slave laborers during hitler s third reich , but they say they were forced to do so by the government it is considered unlikely that volkswagen s decision will persuade people to drop their classaction claims a suit filed last month proposed to recapture a share of each company s accumulated profits that can be attributed to slave labor if the suit against the companies is successful , it would mean compensation in the billions of dollars volkswagen , along with most other german companies , continues to deny any legal responsibility for its actions during the hitler years but volkswagen announced nearly two months ago that it would create a compensation fund at the time survivors' groups had not filed their lawsuit against volkswagen but were threatening to do so hoping to put the conflict and bad publicity behind them , volkswagen executives abruptly reversed their policy and acknowledged a moral responsibility to survivors of slave work the new plan will be announced at volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg after a meeting of the company s supervisory board , according to those familiar with the plan company executives warned that they did not want to be pinned down to precise numbers on the size of the new fund but they estimate that between 1 , 000 and 2 , 000 forced laborers are still alive and that a fund of 12 million will be enough to provide compensation the total would work out to an average payout of about 12 , 000 or less for each survivor but the most dramatic revelation on friday will be the role of mr peres , who presided over much of the peace talks with palestinians before being defeated in 1996 by benjamin netanyahu mr peres , according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity , will head an independent board that will evaluate all the claims and decide how much to pay each survivor volkswagen officials are calling the new board a curatorium though many if not all of the other board members have yet to be chosen , company officials plan to make sure that none of the board members are volkswagen executives volkswagen , along with most of the other german companies being sued , continue to deny any legal responsibility for their actions during the hitler years but the pressure on them has increased since switzerland s three biggest banks reached a 125 billion settlement with jewish organizations last month over money and gold that belonged to holocaust victims and was never returned on the issue of slave labor , a group of lawyers in new york and munich has sued all the german car manufacturers , including bmw and daimlerbenz electronic companies , including siemens steel companies , including krupp , and chemical companies this will not get volkswagen off the hook in a legal sense , said rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon wiesenthal center , a jewish rights organization in los angeles that was active in lawsuits against swiss banks and has been watching the slave labor issue closely but if in fact they go ahead with this agreement , it is an important step because it will put pressure on the bmw s and all the other companies to stop hiding behind legal objections volkswagen is expected to announce that the board being set up will be able to decide how much compensation should be paid to each survivor of forced labor at the company and how it should be dispersed the company is also expected to say that payments to survivors could begin before the end of this year the plan will almost certainly not end the widening arguments over compensation for forced labor other german companies , like daimlerbenz , have offered the idea of setting up a large pool of money for survivors to which companies and the german government would make contributions but chancellor helmut kohl rejected that proposal last month , arguing that germany had already paid out more than 60 billion to jewish causes and to israel since the end of world war ii volkswagen officials are expected to say that they may contribute to a broader compensation fund if german companies ever reach an agreement with the government
new orleans is known for mardi gras , dancing in the streets and cajun cooking but beneath its festive facade , the city is having a nasty time with racial issues dating back to slavery that most cities have long since put behind them the newest battle centers on a school board policy that encourages schools named for slave owners to take new names , on the theory that the old names are offensive to a predominantly black student body whites who venerate the confederacy see the policy as an attack on their history and in some cases , on their own families and have subtly worked against it the black community groups that launched the plan will eventually win , but have hurt themselves by bending history and casting even reasonable critics as racists meanwhile , africanamerican teachers and students who must approve some of the new names are attached by habit to the old ones and in no hurry to vote them away the story line is straight out of antebellum new orleans , where the slavers and the enslaved were more closely entangled both by blood and material aspiration than anywhere else in america a school named for , say , a ku klux klansman would certainly bear renaming but it is delusional on a grand scale to think that new names alone will lift some of the worst urban schools in the country or disentangle the most byzantine racial legacy in the south many cities were founded on slave labor , but none so utterly as new orleans , whose seaport received loads of slaves for sugar cane farming , a brutal , lifeshortening job new orleans society complicated the matter by institutionalizing relationships between white slave masters and free mulatto women who often rated lavish , separate households and explicit agreements of support at a time when it was illegal to teach negroes to read , mixedrace children grew up close to high culture and books mulattoes became america s first black middle class they became slave masters , too by mid19th century , the national census showed that of people of color who owned more than 50 souls each , nearly all were louisianans who planted cane in the region around new orleans nearly half of the city s public schools were named for slave owners those who want the old names expunged argue that all slave masters were equally and irreparably evil and deserve neither forgiveness nor any place at all in the public esteem the view is politically understandable but it is also simplistic lessaffluent black slave owners often purchased relatives to keep them from being worked to death or sold into other states in louisiana , the rules by which a slave could be freed changed often and were often difficult or expensive to comply with at times , it was illegal to free a slave under 30 at still other times , a freed slave had to be shipped out of the state or perhaps even to africa to free someone , then , meant to send them away this may well have been the reasoning of marie couvent , a black slave owner who left a great deal of money to educate catholic negro orphans and for whom a school was named until her name was expunged the slaves she owned may well have been relatives bought for benevolent reasons this theory is supported by the fact that her husband won freedom for at least two slaves in the state supreme court slavery was indisputably evil but the case is far more ambiguous when historic inquiry shifts from the practice to specific individuals the black electorate has a right to new names if it wants them but given the dismal quality of many city schools , community groups have spent enormous political capital chasing ghosts to help rebuild failing schools , they will need to make peace with a painful past and focus their energies on the here and now
new york city is enriched by people from every part of the globe who come bringing their energies , entrepreneurship and optimism half of the residents of this city are foreign born or have a foreignborn parent but some immigrants are also among the poorest and most vulnerable in the city the social isolation is especially hard on families escaping war or persecution in their native lands any crisis , like the loss of a job or a child falling ill , can be devastating for people without english language skills or community contacts the seven private charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund offer these newcomers a lifeline the need is particularly evident this winter now that 50 , 000 immigrants in the city have been cut off from food stamps under the federal welfare law while the state offers some food assistance to children and the elderly , many hungry immigrant families have turned to food pantries , supported by the fund , for help in addition to providing emergency food and shelter , bilingual workers in these agencies form a critical link between these families and public services the ujafederation of jewish philanthropies of new york , a beneficiary of the fund , has assisted thousands of families from russia , ukraine and other parts of eastern europe a recent report in the times chronicled the tragic killing of a 19yearold ukrainian liverycab driver who supported his parents and was their only connection to the englishspeaking world his murder left his parents desperate and utterly alone the jewish board of family and children s services , a ujafederation agency , is there with rent money , translation services and counseling to help them survive their grief the catholic charities of the archdiocese of new york , another fund beneficiary , provides english and citizenship classes and jobreadiness workshops for thousands of newcomers , along with emergency aid more than 40 percent of the people helped by the catholic charities of the diocese of brooklyn and queens , another beneficiary , are foreign born its staff runs day care and head start classes for immigrant children and jobtraining programs for their parents these charities help immigrants adjust to life in a new society so that they can become productive , selfreliant citizens a donation to these agencies honors new york s immigrant history and is a wise investment in this city s future contributions are taxdeductible to the extent permitted by law none of the money donated is diverted for administrative expenses checks should be made payable to the new york times neediest cases fund and mailed to po box 5193 , general post office , new york , ny 10087
the river warren by kent meyers 271 pp st paul hungry mind press 21 the easygoing quiet of the midwestern farming town of cloten is suddenly shattered when twospeed crandall , at the wheel of a semi filled with leo gruber s cattle , accelerates down a hill , threads his way between two trees , sideswipes the mayor s new house , destroys the facade of the bank , crashes through angel finn s hardware store and plows head on into the barbershop twospeed , his wife , louann , and most of the animals are dead on impact the surviving cattle are so grievously wounded they must be shot before being wrenched from the remains of the trailer the slaughter tears tranquillity from the town in much the same way the semi tears the facing from all those buildings borrowing both from our town and rashomon , kent meyers uses his first novel to dissect cloten and its citizens as they try to make sense of the disaster while they do , in a narrative occasionally overweighted with symbolism \( the realism turns magical too often as a local river becomes prehistoric , filling with prehistoric fish \) , he moves cleanly from the event itself to an insightful inspection of local life and its discontents before anything else , twospeed s former neighbors share a deep uneasiness about him a magician at the wheel and a brute with a cattle prod , he was also a drunk , a layabout and a schemer , as disliked as he was feared by those who had dealings with him but even though he s no longer among them , none can seem to forget him , however much they try why should someone who had no claim on us when he was living , leo gruber s wife , elizabeth , asks , come into our lives now , when we have no way to make him leave the reason is that although everyone has an opinion about twospeed , no one has any certainty about him arlene schuh , the gossip with a conscience \( it s not polite to intrude on someone s strangeness \) , thinks there s less to twospeed than meets the eye \( he never did much of anything while making it look to everybody else like he did all sorts of stuff \) the retarded innocent , pop bottle pete , mutilates himself rather than confess what he thinks he shares with his friend twospeed the philosophical fisherman angel finn comes closest to understanding the man s shallows knew him down to the bones just , there was nothing there all the citizens of cloten have glimpsed twospeed s edges none appear to have got to his core the only one who ever has is his son , luke reflective , curious and cynical , he recognized early on that dad could always turn what was into what was n't , and what was n't into what should have been , and what should have been into some reason to get drunk but even luke did n't really figure out his father until their final confrontation just before the crash although he theorizes that children want most of all to change their parents , this son never imagined that the change he forced on his father would turn out to be so conclusive he never imagined that uncovering twospeed s deepest , most closely held secret would so unhinge him , so effectively strip away his father s veneer , that he 'd be forced to see himself clearly for the first time and what he saw was so disruptive of his carefully constructed selfimage that it ultimately sent him and his semi plunging down that hill the narrative of the river warren circles around the elusive personality at its center , yet never quite reaches him because , perhaps , twospeed s evasions make it impossible as luke eventually realizes \( and others suspect \) , the real truth of his father s existence is written in lowercase still , it s a truth surrounded by mystery and acknowledging that mystery is the novel s central point people are afraid of what they ca n't understand , and even a man as totally without substance as twospeed crandall can dominate the thoughts , the most primitive fears , of those who knew him he dominates , in fact , precisely because he is so empty
washington , nov 19 following are excerpts from kenneth w starr s remarks about the conduct of the investigation of president clinton from his opening statement to the house judiciary committee yesterday , as recorded by federal news service , a private transcription service i had said that it was in august of 1994 that i took over the madison guaranty investigation from robert fiske over the ensuing years , i have essentially become independent counsel for five distinct investigations for madison guaranty and whitewater , for fosterrelated matters , for the travel office , for the fbi files matter and for the lewinsky investigation , as well as for a variety of obstruction and related matters that arose out of those five major investigations a very brief overview of those investigations may assist the committee in its assessment of the president s conduct first , some statistics the chairman noted that the investigation has resulted in the conviction of 14 individuals , including the former associate attorney general of the united states webster hubbell the thensitting governor of arkansas , jim guy tucker , and the clintons' two business partners , jim and susan mcdougal we are proud , not only of the cases that we have won , but of our decisions not to indict to take one wellknown example , the senate whitewater committee sent our office public criminal referrals on several individuals the committee stated in its june 21 , 1996 , public letter that the testimony of susan thomases was particularly troubling and suggests a possible violation of law but this office did not seek charges against her apart from indictments and convictions , this office has also faced an extraordinary number of legal disputes on issues of privilege , on jurisdiction , substantive criminal law and the like by my count , at least 17 of our cases have been decided by the federal courts of appeals , and we have been fortunate in prevailing in all 17 one privilege case arising in our travel office investigation went to the dc circuit , where we prevailed by a 21 decision and then to the supreme court , where we lost by a 63 decision we had to litigate in the courts as our investigation ran into roadblocks and hurdles that slowed us down it is true that the administration produced a great amount of information but unlike the prosecutors in the investigations involving presidents reagan and carter , we have been forced to go to court time and again to seek information from the executive branch and to fight a multitude of privilege claims asserted by the administration , every single one of which we have won in sum , the office where i serve has achieved a superb record in courts of law of significant and hardfought convictions , of fair and wise decisions not to charge , of thorough and accurate reports on the vincent foster death and the monica lewinsky matters , of legal victories in various courts we go to court and not on the talkshow circuit and our record shows that there is a bright line between the law and politics , between courts and polls it leaves the polls to the politicians and the spin doctors we are officers of the court who live in the world of law we have presented our cases in court , and with very rare exception , we have won the center of all this , the core of our arkansasbased investigation , was madison guaranty savings and loan madison was a federally insured savings and loan in little rock , ark , run by jim and susan mcdougal like many savings and loans in the 1980 s , madison was fraudulently operated we garnered a number of guilty pleas in my first year one was from webster hubbell , who had worked at the rose law firm and was knowledgeable about its work with madison , including that of mrs clinton as a lawyer at the rose firm in august 1995 , a year after i was appointed by the special division , a federal grand jury in little rock indicted jim and susan mcdougal and the thensitting governor of arkansas , jim guy tucker the case went to trial in march of 1996 amid charges by all three defendants and their allies that the case was a political witch hunt some predicted that an arkansas jury would never convict the sitting governor these expectations were heightened when president clinton was subpoenaed as a defense witness in governor tucker s trial the president testified for the defense from the map room of the white house during his sworn testimony , the president testified as a defense witness , that he did not know about the susan mcdougal loan nor had he ever been in a meeting with hale and mcdougal about the loan he also testified that he had never received a loan from madison this was important testimony its truth or falsity went to the core issues of our investigation on may 28 , 1996 , all three defendants were convicted jim mcdougal of 18 felonies , susan mcdougal of four felonies and governor tucker of two felonies after his conviction , jim mcdougal began cooperating with our investigation we spent many hours with him gaining additional insights and facts he informed our career investigators and prosecutors that david hale was accurate

mood rings for 3 \? elegant soapstone sculptures from kenya \? a 35 ecuadorean sweater \? these and much more are available at columbus park in brooklyn , next to borough hall , from vendors who pitch their alabaster tents there every friday on other days , the caravan moves on to other parks , including the battery and bowling green in lower manhattan it is all part of an explosion of commerce in new york city parks , from greenmarkets that offer apples , peppers and friendly conversation with soil tillers to a permanentlooking chinese shopping mall smack in the middle of sara delano roosevelt park on the lower east side from the spirited outdoor markets of paris to the flower market that once thrived in union square park , al fresco vendors have long been a vibrant part of the urban scene frazzled city dwellers , it seems , are suckers for the chance to eat , shop or simply dawdle outdoors among those seeking to lighten their pocketbooks and what better place than a park for such breezy commerce \? the good thing is that there s no tax , jill hartzog , a computer technician , said as she examined an african mask in columbus park , brooklyn i do n't think i 've ever paid tax for any item here you ca n't get better buys two belts that look like leather for 10 , said vincent russo , a court clerk who lives in new jersey to get this kind of traffic in a shopping mall , you 'd have to pay very , very high rent , said rose goldman , who journeys from west palm beach , fla , to peddle watches in columbus and other new york parks but others think that buying and selling belong in shopping malls green spaces , they say , are too special to be sold to the highest bidder , even temporarily although no one expects billboards to sprout on central park s great lawn , park advocates nervously note that the city s revenue from parks concessions has increased to 38 million a year , from less than 3 million in the last 20 years for park purists , the mercenary sting is sharpened because almost none of the money from the concessions fees goes directly back to the parks department the markets , of course , are part of a wellestablished municipal tradition of generating cash from parks but while no one questions concessions directly connected to park uses , like rowboat or skate rentals , the city s more unusual efforts have come under fire , because they stretch the definition of what a park is these efforts have been as varied as profiting from the recording of garth brooks s concert in central park to premiering a disney movie on the great lawn to turning bryant park into a temporary cadillac showroom it is with concessions and private promotions that the new york department of parks and recreation really takes park watchers' breath away , said peter harnik , author of a recent study on park finances for the trust for public land , a land conservancy and openspace advocacy group new york seems to be pushing the envelope more than any other city to those who study parks , the issues are far from simple for one thing , financing for parks is almost always a problem in part , the parks department aggressively pursues concession money because city hall has indicated that the income may help offset budget cuts though parks commissioner henry j stern admits the effect has been minimal some park experts suggest that it is time for purists to move past the traditional idea of parks as bucolic refuges and accept new models , including energetic commercial ones having food for sale in parks is important , said kathy madden , director of the project for public spaces , which studies parks and other open areas and , clearly , lots of people like markets they 're fun , said joanne g imohiosen , the parks department s assistant commissioner for revenue parks are supposed to be fun but they are also supposed to be parks the department routinely rejects clearly unacceptable proposals like opening a doctor s office in a queens park or a driving range in the sheep meadow but most of the time , it strives to strike a balance ms imohiosen said a step in this direction was her current campaign to keep what she considers schlock out of markets like columbus park in brooklyn we called the vendors in and really had a fit , ms imohiosen said we 're trying to get rid of the junk no sunglasses no lipstick to some critics , the nadir of park commercialism is the market in sara delano roosevelt park on the lower east side of manhattan since the middle section of the park was leased to century 21 real estate three years ago , vendors who have rented space from century 21 have settled in , building elaborate stalls of wood , steel , metal and cement the bazaar , named dragon s gate market , has signs advertising century 21 and sells everything from boxes of noodles to large screwdrivers there is even a large indonesian restaurant century 21 pays the city 26 , 000 a year and charges vendors 350 to 700 a month , far less than a shopping mall calvin lee , the manager , said vendors epitomized immigrants' pursuit of the american dream , and accused the critics of dragon s gate of having an upperclass perspective toward what he called a ghetto area the city needs a lot of places like this where new businesses can start with very minimal capital , mr lee said his ghetto characterization might be fiercely debated in an area where business is brisk and rents are rising quickly but there is little doubt that the park , named for franklin d roosevelt s mother , is impoverished it was carved from tenements by mayor james j walker and then sat vacant for years before robert moses finally made it a park even as the northern and southern parts of the park underwent repeated renovations , the middle , where the market is , languished the local community board and businesses worked with the city to fill the void with a market it quickly became a plausible solution gone bad , as the vendors resisted repeated orders from the parks department to scale back their buildings neighbors did what they could they tilled community gardens , collected trash and built birdhouses in the tiny section of the park where chinese men gather in the morning to listen to birds sing the neighbors complained again and again to elizabeth a cooke , executive director of the parks council , a research and advocacy group , sara delano roosevelt park is emblematic of what happens when parks are not properly financed and commercial ventures are brought in to fill the void it s a case study in failure , she said commissioner stern has been convinced , though hardly as quickly as critics might have preferred he is pulling the plug , and not renewing dragon s gate s lease when it expires in april it was an experiment , and we 've grown increasingly dissatisfied , he explained but mr stern made clear his conviction that there are no easy answers , and that each case needs to be addressed on its own merits lately , thousands of supporters of city greenmarkets , where farmers sell fresh produce in 18 parks , have been concerned that plans to enlarge the green area of union square park will drive out farmers now selling on the concrete the union square greenmarket is one of the great urban areas of the city , the place where urbanites and farmers meet said m david distler , a lawyer who is chairman of friends of greenmarket , a community group they are the potbellied stove of the city mr stern said he loves greenmarkets , particularly the one at union square but he added that there must be a balance between the city s need for green space and the farmers' need for space a park has to be more than an unloading platform for vegetable trucks , he said but the greenmarket has nothing to worry about photos vendors at the dragon s gate market , in the sara delano roosevelt park on the lower east side , have built elaborate stalls of wood , steel , metal and cement items for sale include noodles and screwdrivers an explosion of commerce is sweeping the city s parks , including battery park , above a caravan stops here and at other parks \( photographs by chester higgins

ask tricia zwilinske why she used to smoke marijuana every day , why she failed all her classes or why rebellious behavior led to her being dismissed from four high schools and all she offers is a wan smile and a sheepish shrug everyone else was doing it , tricia , 15 , said haltingly as she played with her bangs it was the thing to do in some ways , tricia managed better than many peers , some of whom became addicted to major drugs , gave up on school or ended up in jail her last boyfriend is in jail for dealing crack in fact , none of her friends at sheepshead bay high school , she said , made it to graduation everyone is running wild , she said that account is not uncommon in a nation where nearly 30 percent of the eighth graders said in a study last year that they had tried illegal drugs , mostly marijuana at 11 , tricia was drinking , and by 12 she had smoked her first marijuana cigarette her mother recalled that she could not understand why tricia s grades were plummeting or why she would arrive home at night sullen and moody one minute she 'd be fine and the next she 'd be screaming and punching holes in the wall , her mother , lori zwilinske , 38 , said i knew something was bothering her but she would n't talk about it perhaps it was because mrs zwilinske was juggling attending nursing school with raising four daughters and a newborn grandchild , all in the family house in gerritsen beach , brooklyn i think tricia got lost in the shuffle , mrs zwilinske said maybe she was n't getting the kind of attention she deserved instead , tricia received attention from older men , sometimes 10 years older her boyfriends , for the most part , were abusive i guess i let guys walk all over me , said tricia , who could easily pass for a 20yearold stammering in a voice that seemed trapped in her throat , she told about a boyfriend who pushed her from a moving car and left her in a dangerous neighborhood miles from home mostly the abuse was verbal , but sometimes she covered the bruises with makeup before going to school in july , tricia hit bottom she considered suicide , she said , and started picking fights with other girls , spending more time with drug dealers and frequently finding herself in menacing situations one night in july , a teenager jabbed a gun in her stomach and stole her bicycle later that month , after having taken ecstasy at a rave , an allnight dance party , tricia read a magazine article about how hallucinogenic drugs could impair a woman s ability to have children that really freaked me out , she said the next day , she confessed everything to her mother and begged for help on the recommendation of a family friend , tricia was referred to breakfree , a program run by the jewish board of family and children s services that helps adolescents with substanceabuse problems the board , an affiliate of the ujafederation of new york , is one of the seven charities that the new york times neediest cases fund supports when tricia went to her first counseling session , she had trouble talking about her problems it was almost like she was mute , her social worker , lisa gallagher , said in addition to onceaweek therapy , tricia joined a peer group that meets four days a week having other kids say how dangerous your behavior is really brought her down to earth , ms gallagher said it has been nearly three months since tricia has used drugs her aggressiveness has vanished , and she plans to return to school this month she also has a new boyfriend , who does not keep tricia under his thumb if anything , she s in control , her mother said he even does her laundry for her for the first time , tricia said , she can imagine a future , adding that she wants to teach in a nursery school , and to run her own someday that is a huge step for someone who used to pepper her conversation with , i know i'm stupid , but yesterday , breakfree held a graduation ceremony for members of its peercounseling group mrs zwilinske baked a cake for the event , in the agency s office in nearby brighton beach after passing a glass bead around the room , tricia put it on a string around her neck and giggled then she stood up and fumbled for words thank you for getting me through this rough time , she said , looking at her feet i do n't know if i would have made it without you how to help checks payable to the new york

boston whatever there actually was of a division race came to an unmerciful halt yesterday in the visitors' third inning , with bret saberhagen on the mound and chuck knoblauch at the plate metaphorically , it may as well have been mike torrez facing bucky dent dale sveum was on second , joe girardi on first there were none out david cone and the yanks were trailing , 20 and joe torre was in no way interested in moving his runners along , conceding an out , the way his red sox opposite , jimy williams , had the inning before with two on , none out , resulting in one measly run torre must have found that strategically hilarious , the equivalent of shaking a fist in the face of godzilla true , knoblauch is not the no 9hitting lou merloni , the rookie williams had lay down the sacrifice , but that s not torre s problem , either there are no lambs in his lineup knoblauch , one day removed from a grand slam that officially introduced boston to the monster that is eating the american league east , would not even bother to fake a bunt at that point in the game , i'm not trying to tie the game , said torre , talking tough with george steinbrenner s bank book behind him does n't do you much good here saberhagen , returning this season from pitcher s oblivion but looking of late to be working with a roundtrip ticket , ran the count to 21 then he threw a fastball on the inside part of the plate that knoblauch hit so high and hard to left that the same breeze that aided his grand slam to right field saturday merely kept this ball from intercepting a potential killer comet knoblauch s fourth home run of the season struck the cocacola bottle display attached to the light tower behind the green monster , drained whatever carbonation there was in saberhagen s right arm and delivered for the yankees the following adieu to their nearest competitors in the al east so long , soxers good teams bounce back , torre said after a 144 victory gave the yankees the weekend series at fenway park , 21 , and eight games on the red sox in the loss column you have to assume they 'll do that forget about it forget that the red sox are due in new york next weekend for another four cracks at the 3310 yankees , that they did not pitch pedro martinez in this series and were without their young star shortstop , nomar garciaparra now that the yankees have followed saturday s 123 pasting with yesterday s brutal beating , the red sox should immediately turn their attention to the wildcard berth sorry , wishful thinkers there will be no reenactment of 1978 , or any other contentious yankeesred sox marathon , not unless they meet in a short , anythingcanhappen playoff series the most symbolic blow struck between these ancient rivals this regular season will be the one yesterday by knoblauch another home run over the wall by another yankee middle infielder off another aging righthander who formerly pitched in new york \( all right , so this is a bit of reach because saberhagen was a met \) i know nothing about the longstanding yankeered sox thing , said knoblauch , a yankee veteran of two months this is my first taste of it welcome to the expanding yankee club of boston bashers once knoblauch had given the yankees a 32 lead , the floodgates of bad red sox memories opened derek jeter singled to center paul o'neill singled through the vacated secondbase hole on a hitandrun tim raines looped a hit to leftcenter scott brosius smacked one off the wall seven runs were soon in scattered fans began streaming out we saw chuck s ball go out and we jumped off the bench it was like , 'yeah ! ' said bernie williams we were pumped knoblauch , no puny leadoff man , is simply pumped up , 170 sculpted pounds with a wrestler s upper body concerned that he had n't been driving the ball as well as he can , knoblauch altered his stance last week by dropping his hands and promising himself not to swing at anything above the plane of the bat since then , he has walked a halfdozen times he drove in eight runs in the two victories here knoblauch at second base derek jeter at short it is almost cruel that the yankees , with the kind of offense they have at traditional power positions , can get such muscular production from the middle of the infield two good bets to stay on a record pace against watereddown pitching staffs mark mcgwire and the yankees once the red sox fall back into the wildcard pack , there will be no more spurious showdowns to hype until october , they will only compete against history , against their predecessors in pinstripes oh , it s too soon to say we 're this or that , williams said it s not even the allstar break it is may 25 , but what we saw the last two days looked like the boston massacre of september 1978 the red sox sure looked as thoroughly outclassed as the orioles were earlier in the week it sure looks as if only a comet can stop the yankees now
keebler foods is hoping to work some of its elfin magic on investors this week , keebler , the cookie company symbolized by a band of elf bakers inside a hollow tree , is expected to make an initial public offering worth up to 275 million with the newissues market feeling skittish these days , nothing may be more reassuring than the debut of this enterprise , which is 145 years old and measures its sales in billions of dollars indeed , the offering , which consists of about 115 million shares at 21 to 24 each , may be smart as well as fortunately timed flowers industries certainly seems to think so flowers , a publicly traded baked goods company in thomasville , ga , is one of three companies that bought keebler in a leveraged buyout in 1996 the two others , the private investment firms artal luxembourg sa and bermore ltd , are selling some of their shares in the offering flowers will buy enough of those shares to increase its stake in keebler to 57 percent , from 45 percent like other investors , flowers may be drawn in part by the company s famed names the keebler name is widely recognized , and millions of consumers know keebler brands like hydrox chocolate sandwich cookies , pecan sandies , cheezit and carr crackers and ready crust frozen pie crusts oreo s is a powerful name , but it s associated with one product , said mark s basham , a research analyst at standard poor s , referring to nabisco s wellknown cookie but the keebler brand has universal recognition it s not associated with a specific product in addition , keebler , which had 1997 sales of 154 billion through oct 4 , is the only cookie and cracker company besides nabisco with its own national distribution system this puts keebler employees in supermarkets several days a week , which allows them to keep close track of inventory , to identify fast or slowselling items and to spruce up displays keebler wants to capitalize on these significant advantages by expanding its distribution network to mass merchandisers and discount shopping clubs then there is keebler s acquisitions strategy its purchase of sunshine biscuits in 1996 is an example of how keebler has extended its famous name to more brands and increased its share of the 4 billion cookie market , where it now ranks second with 166 percent gobbling up other cookie companies also makes fuller use of keebler s manufacturing capacity , which is running at only 82 percent even after the sunshine purchase given these idle production lines and keebler s distribution system , such acquisitions can confer their advantages at little cost to the company if the truck driver goes to the local a p and brings keebler and sunshine , he can bring other products , too , said mr basham , who added that there was much potential for new acquisitions in the cookie business and once keebler is a public company , it can use its stock as currency to make these strategic acquisitions , said linda killian , a portfolio manager with the renaissance capital corporation in greenwich , conn the public offering looks reasonably priced , too , mr basham said at the 2250 midpoint of the expected price range , the stock would be selling at about 26 times its estimated 1998 earnings per share that is slightly higher than the 24 multiple of nabisco , but mr basham said keebler s famous brands , acquisition strategy and other advantages more than compensated for the difference i think the level of sustainable earnings is much higher than the 1997 level because of these advantages , mr basham said through oct 4 of last year , keebler earned 364 million but a purchase of keebler is not without risks first , the company operates in a mature market in which the growth last year was just sixtenths of 1 percent international markets may offer opportunities for future growth , but such sales are not a big part of the industry and keebler is not pursuing them aggressively thus , any revenue increase must come from grabbing competitors' market share or , in keebler s case , trying to buy those competitors as a result of the 1996 leveraged buyout , from united biscuits for 500 million , keebler also has debts that equal about 58 percent of its total market capitalization , said gregg tenser , director of equity research at federated investors that burden the average in the packagedfoods industry is 50 percent means that keebler has less financial flexibility than it otherwise might keebler cannot use the proceeds of the offering to pay these debts that money will go to artal luxembourg and bermore ltd , the buyout partners who are putting up the shares but keebler has been working to erase some of its red ink , mr basham said at the end of the third quarter of 1996 , keebler had 484 million of debt by the end of 1997 it had reduced its debt to 303 million moreover , this company is throwing off cash like crazy , mr basham said one of the things it could do with its cash is lower its debt even further given the recent decline in interest rates , keebler may also seek to refinance its debt and lower its borrowing costs in that way , he added as for the fact that none of the cash from the offering will go to keebler , mr tenser sees offsetting factors here , too normally you would like to see the ipo bring their interest expense and debt down , mr tenser said but it s less of a concern when you see the management incentive after the offering , keebler s senior executives will have a stake of about 10 percent in the company , and their annual bonuses will be based on the stock s performance , he said mr basham agreed , adding , i would be bothered if it were a small startup ipo where the founders were getting out but flowers , the third buyout partner , is instead increasing its stake a move that analysts say is both a good move for flowers and a good sign for other investors still , problems can arise when a single shareholder like flowers has majority control of a company and although keebler is in the relatively defensive food industry , if the economy cools enough , cookie sales may taper off the cookie and cracker industry is extremely competitive , too , as keebler acknowledges in its prospectus , and all its companies face the risk of rising prices for sugar and other ingredients and materials nonetheless , most still believe the company is a winner , albeit a staid one you 're not going to make a killing , but it s going to go up , said mr basham , who forecasts a stock increase to 27 within six months in any case , the elves may have arrived just in time if you asked a money manager to come up with his idea of a perfect ipo in early 1998 , with all of the market uncertainty , he would probably come up with keebler , mr basham said photo

trouncing his opponents in the democratic gubernatorial primary , peter f vallone , the new york city council speaker , who has never won office outside his queens district , propelled himself yesterday into a far more daunting struggle against gov george e pataki mr pataki , a firstterm republican , enjoys wide popularity and faces none of the voter unrest that sent scores of incumbents into retirement in 1994 mr vallone has less than 1 million left in his campaign treasury , while mr pataki , one of the most prodigious fundraisers in the nation , has well over 10 million and mr vallone does not have the liberal party nomination , without which no democrat has won statewide office in half a century as a moderate on social issues who preaches fiscal conservatism , mr vallone , 63 , is his party s most centrist gubernatorial nominee in a generation or more , a potential advantage at a time when many democratic voters have turned away from the left but he enters the general election campaign with less stature statewide than any democratic gubernatorial nominee since at least 1966 since then , the party s standardbearers have been arthur j goldberg , a former justice of the supreme court , hugh l carey and mario m cuomo such obstacles did not temper mr vallone s enthusiasm as he lit into mr pataki in a victory speech to supporters at the grand hyatt hotel in midmanhattan , and tied the governor to his lesspopular mentor , senator alfonse m d'amato in the last four years , pataki has increased the state s debt by 20 billion , he said we have to put our fiscal house in order and end the days of george pataki and al d'amato s fiscal recklessness with a tweak at mr pataki s paid speechmaking , he said , i challenge you to one debate for every outofstate speech you 've given mr pataki s campaign manager , zenia mucha , issued a statement labeling mr vallone a liberal career politician who had imposed billions of dollars of tax increases on working families with 96 percent of precincts reporting , mr vallone had 397 , 486 votes or 56 percent lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross had 148 , 547 votes or 21 percent the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes , had 110 , 385 votes or 16 percent , and james l larocca , a former state transportation commissioner , had 55 , 125 votes or 8 percent ms mccaughey ross , a constitutional scholar who entered politics just four years ago , conceded defeat at 10 pm to her supporters at the intercontinental hotel in midmanhattan but she claimed a victory of sorts in focusing the race on issues like prekindergarten schooling , health care and child care this gubernatorial contest is better for what we have already done , she said the entire gubernatorial contest is more relevant to the lives of families , of working men and women and their children , than it would have been if we had not entered this race she said there was no question she would continue campaigning as the nominee of the liberal party , which would earn her the animosity of many democrats many of the democrats who worked for her campaign planned to abandon it if she lost the primary ms mccaughey ross never shook off the images left by her unorthodox political career , or her wellpublicized money troubles in the stretch run her campaign was also hobbled by dissension that saw several top officials depart in an effort to seize the interest of voters who seemed either distracted from the contest or bored by it , ms mccaughey ross turned in the final week to attacking mr vallone , questioning his commitment to abortion rights and education the attacks were part of an overt appeal for women s votes , but exit polls conducted by edison media research showed that she fared little better among women than men in the exit polls , 9 out of 10 primary voters said that more women should be elected to government but only onefifth of those said they had voted for ms mccaughey ross in the primary for lieutenant governor , sandra frankel , a town supervisor from the rochester area , easily beat charlie king , a manhattan lawyer , and clyde rabideau , the mayor of plattsburgh , whom mr vallone had called his preferred choice with 96 percent of precincts reporting , ms frankel had 50 percent of the vote to 33 percent for mr king and 17 percent for mr rabideau mr vallone s victory was strikingly broad , cutting across divisions of race , sex , age , income , education , religion and region exit polls indicated that he even defeated ms mccaughey ross by almost 2 to 1 in upstate new york , where he was virtually unknown six months ago the council speaker may actually be better known than mr pataki was at this time four years ago , when he was a firstterm state senator but mr vallone lacks a crucial advantage mr pataki had in 1994 the backing of mr d'amato , who helped his fellow republican raise 14 million mr vallone carries into the sevenweek general election campaign the burden of the assumption , shared even by many in the party , that the governor is unbeatable
my sister life the story of my sister s disappearance by maria flook 353 pages pantheon books 25 the profusion of violent events and extreme relationships that animate maria flook s fiction might lead readers to suppose that she possesses an overactive gothic imagination , a heightened sense of the nightmare side of life in family night \( 1993 \) , a highstrung woman and her stepbrother form a triangle with a recovering sex addict in open water \( 1995 \) , a boy who watched his mother die in a bizarre choking accident becomes a morphine addict and in the short story prince of motown \(

experiences ms flook and her sister survived as girls indeed , the family portrait ms flook draws in this harrowing book must rank up there , on the horror scale , with mommie dearest \( though with none of the campy excesses of that film \) , just as its depiction of youth on the lam often seems like something out of an early gus van sant film my sister life begins with a startling sentence my sister karen disappeared when she was 14 years old and from there hurtles toward its conclusion , cutting back and forth , like a movie , between her own experiences at home and karen s experiences on the road the runaway karen falls in with a petty thief and hustler named james , who uses her as a maid and sexual plaything , and james s friend ruth , who runs a porn theater and brothel in norfolk

killed in the road , a neighbor child s death from meningitis these are the details of life that capture her morbid imagination i resided with my parents , but i no longer felt safe at home , she writes i thought what happened to karen could happen to me such fears had been cruelly nurtured by her mother , veronica , who used to tell maria and karen the story of the andrea doria s fatal shipwreck she told them that their own family had booked passage on the illfated ocean liner but later switched to another ship two sisters occupied the cabin that maria and karen were assigned one of them was killed , the other was found trapped in the wreckage pulling out her original ticket vouchers for the doomed ship , veronica would say , you girls would have died , as though , writes ms flook , a plan , greater than her own making , had been foiled we could n't have saved you , veronica would continue ray and i would have been dancing in the belvedere lounge there s always a big party on the last night of the crossing little girls would have been in bed the steward kept your names on a card as ms flook tells it , such acts of malice were routine on her mother s part , confusingly mixed in with occasional acts of motherly kindness and indulgence a narcissistic beauty who looked like a sultry vivien leigh , veronica apparently never got over the failure of her first marriage to a handsome , faithless man who worked as an arrow collar model , and she took out her frustrations on her second husband , the hapless ray , and their two daughters veronica made both girls feel they could never compete with her own beauty , and she constantly pitted the sisters against one another she would chastise karen about her weight , then make her give her halloween candy

survive by the end of the book , ms flook has not only left us with a fierce , uncompromising picture of her family s painful disintegration , but she has also managed to fit together the fragments of

created their roles for the druid theater company in galway , ireland , is on many levels an oldfashioned , wellmade play yet it feels more immediate and vital than any new drama in many seasons the basic plot sounds familiar , like a bucolic cousin to the heiress a plain middleaged woman , trapped in a life as a caretaker for her infirm but ironwilled mother in rural ireland , is offered a last chance at love but mr mcdonagh and the director , garry hines , are masterly at building up and subverting expectations in a catandmouse game with the audience there s not a single hole in the play s

when new york city promised in federal court last week to build a huge filtration plant for the most troubled portion of its water supply , the pledge did not end the long struggle over the plan it simply opened a new chapter in the story for one thing , despite the promise , which settled a lawsuit by federal environmental officials , the city still says it hopes to avoid filtration , which it says could cost up to 1 billion perhaps more daunting , if it does move to construct the plant , there is likely to be a bitter battle over where to put it four of the seven sites being studied for the plant are in westchester county , but the county executive there has flatly declared that none of them are even remotely acceptable and new york city s big unions and construction interests are appalled at the notion of such a big project being built outside the city on the other hand , bronx residents and their politicians vow to oppose the other three sites , all in that borough and they continue to maintain that filtration is unnecessary people are viewing a filtration plant as if it were an incinerator , said eric goldstein , senior staff attorney for the natural resources defense council nearly forgotten in the battle is the fact that the federal environmental protection agency sued to force filtration for health reasons , particularly the risk that microorganisms including cryptosporidium , for which a formal standard has never been set can be dangerous or even lethal for people with immune deficiencies only in eight instances , each involving an exceptionally pristine watershed , has the epa allowed a city to avoid filtration of surface water to hold back on the only thing that will make the croton water safer is ludicrous , said daniel a okun , an environmental engineering professor emeritus at the university of north carolina who in 1993 headed a blueribbon panel on the city s water the croton watershed usually supplies onetenth of the city s drinking water , but as much as 30 percent of it during droughts opponents of the filtration project have contended that the city can devise a plan for the croton watershed similar to the one agreed to last year for its two larger watersheds , the catskill and the delaware that plan involves protecting the water by buying and preserving adjacent lands and reducing pollution from septic tanks and other sources but westchester and putnam counties , home of the croton s 13 reservoirs , are considerably more developed and polluted than the catskill and delaware watersheds if filtration cannot be avoided , the issue of choosing a site will come to the fore as the city s department of environmental protection holds environmental impact statement hearings for each of the seven sites officially under consideration , the same concerns are raised repeatedly a project lasting more than five years , replete with dust , noise , ceaseless truck traffic and rats culminating in an intrusive industrial plant chlorine and other chemicals would be used in large quantities close your eyes and picture a ninestory building on 50 acres , said the westchester county executive , andrew j spano it s hard to hide the most vigorous , bestorganized opponents live around jerome park reservoir in the northwest bronx there are 50 , 000 neighbors living in highrise apartments and brick multifamily homes there are also 25 , 000 students in eight schools from elementary schools to the bronx high school of science it was the opposition of jerome park residents that prompted mayor rudolph w giuliani to delay the project in 1995 in order to review other sites at that point , the other proposed site in the city was croton woods in van cortlandt park but park supporters brought in researchers from yale university s forestry school to study the trees there , who judged the trees virtually irreplaceable a third possible bronx site grew out of the efforts of frank schonfeld , a resident of amalgamated houses near the jerome park reservoir a retired painter , he read in his union newspaper that labor was throwing its weight behind the jerome park site , which had been the prime candidate for a filtration plant since the idea was first broached in 1911 with the help of tom fox , an environmental consultant , he hit upon shandler recreation area at the northern end of van cortlandt park the area has two baseball fields , a picnic area and a large parking lot mr fox worked out a preliminary plan in which these features would all be replaced on the roof of the new plant after construction the major deegan expressway extends right to the site , meaning trucks would not rumble through neighborhoods woodlawn cemetery is on one side the only people you 'd be disturbing are dead , mr fox said in fact , the shandler site is heavily used for recreation by residents of nearby neighborhoods that s the only open space the kids have , said fay muir , a filtration plant opponent mr fox suggested that the schools around jerome park reservoir make their playing fields available on weekends to give shandler users a place to play he has also proposed that jerome park be made into the 150acre park it has never been in anything but name , as a tradeoff to the bronx community union leaders are desperate to keep one of the largest city building projects in years in the bronx they contend that is foolish to pay to acquire land outside the city and then pay taxes in westchester county not to mention sacrificing 2 , 500 construction jobs we cannot allow these jobs and the resulting taxes that they generate to be lost to the city , said thomas p maguire , president of the international union of operating engineers this could be the catalyst for reviving the bronx one advantage to the bronx sites is that they are directly along the aqueduct leading from the croton watershed proposed westchester sites in greenburgh and mount pleasant are a mile or more away from the aqueduct , and it could cost as much as 250 million to connect them , according to some estimates yonkers officials have objected to building the plant at the defunct yonkers raceway , preferring housing and other development people in and around yorktown vigorously oppose building the plant in a cove in new croton reservoir all of westchester county has significant undercurrents of environmentalism , said david gordon , a lawyer for the hudson riverkeeper , an environmental organization that stresses watershed protection but is not against filtration the city has the power to condemn land in the watershed , whether in westchester county or the bronx , and is committed to finding a site by the end of the year it is being held to a rigid timetable to begin operating the plant in 2007 or face fines of 25 , 000 a day and the public health arguments , if anything , are getting stronger opposition to siting the plant wo n't be reason for for not doing it , said jim tripp , a lawyer for the environmental defense fund who is convinced the croton watershed is deteriorating something will have to be done photo frank schonfeld and anne marie garti oppose building the city s water filtration plant near jerome park reservoir mr schonfeld suggested a site near van cortlandt park , one of the locations under consideration \( chris maynard for the new york times \) map of

shirley povich s sports column ran in the washington post on friday , which was not unusual , since his columns have appeared in the washington post for 74 years , or since he began working there in 1924 , at age 19 mr povich s column friday , headlined recent baseball feats require footnotes , was literary yet earthy , opinionated yet generous , topical yet filled with historical perspective , and a pleasure to read , none of which was unusual what was different was that it was his last shirley povich died of a heart attack thursday night at his home in washington he was 92 while he retired 'officially' in 1974 , an editor s note that preceded friday s article said , he continued to write columns for the newspaper there were more than 15 , 000 of them over seven decades in the final column , which he wrote on wednesday , mr povich questioned , among other things , whether mark mcgwire , the hulking , slugging first baseman for the st louis cardinals who has hit 414 career home runs , is a greater home run hitter than babe ruth that seems a growing sentiment , but it was not a popular one with mr povich , who covered ruth and his exploits to judge mcgwire a better home run hitter than ruth at a moment when mcgwire is exactly 300 home runs short of the babe s career output is , well , a stretch , he wrote and he underscored the opinion about ruth with a firsthand anecdote that almost no one but mr povich could have provided walter johnson once said when asked to compare the babe s swats with those hammer blows of lou gehrig and jimmie foxx and hank greenberg 'lemme say this , those balls ruth hit got smaller quicker than anybody else s' mr povich , 5 feet 8 inches , trim and always neatly attired , was widely admired by generations and was considered one of the country s best sports columnists if it had n't been for his friend red smith , jerome holtzman , the chicago tribune sports columnist said , shirley would have been regarded as the best sports columnist in the country in his unobtrusive manner , and with a quiet new england way of speaking that this maine native never lost , mr povich was also considered one of the finest gentlemen in the sometimes inelegant world of sports he was known , read and enjoyed by a wide range of people including presidents , starting with calvin coolidge in the 1930 s , the washington post was the fourth paper in circulation in a fivepaper town katherine graham , whose father , eugene meyer , bought the post in 1933 , became the publisher herself years later she once claimed that mr povich , then writing his this morning column six days a week , was responsible for onethird of our readership mr povich , like many fine newspaper columnists , was on the side of the underdog he regularly took the owner of the washington redskins , george preston marshall , to task for not hiring a black player on one occasion mr povich wrote jim brown , born ineligible to play for the redskins , integrated their end zone three times yesterday marshall finally did hire a black player , bobby mitchell , in 1962 mr povich and his wife , the former ethyl friedman , whom he met on a blind date in 1930 , were married for the last 66 years he is survived by his wife and three children david , a lawyer in washington maury , the television talk show host , and the youngest , lynn , a managing editor with msnbc it was a very male family , as you might expect , but being the only girl , dad really tried not to leave me out of things , lynn povich said mr povich won numerous prizes for his writing , from the grantland rice award to election to the writers' wing of the baseball hall of fame he was cited for outstanding service as a world war ii war correspondent with the marines in the pacific in 1945 surely , the strangest acknowledgment he received was when he found himself listed in the initial volume of who s who in american women , in 1958 the editors had lifted a paragraph on him from who s who in america , although it plainly said he was married to ethyl the next year , he recalled with amusement , they dropped me , like they used to do in the new york social register if you had married a stripper the snobs the name shirley for a boy was not uncommon in maine he was born on july 15 , 1905 , in bar harbor to parents who were orthodox jewish immigrants from lithuania his father later owned a furniture store in bar harbor mr povich was the eighth of 10 children and was named for a grandmother , sarah , or shirley , as it was loosely translated into yiddish as a youth , he got a summer job caddying at a country club that catered to wealthy vacationers who owned mansions in bar harbor edward b mclean , then the post s publisher , suggested that mr povich , 17 , come to washington where there would be two jobs for him , one as caddie on mclean s personal golf course at 20 a week and the other as a copy boy at the paper at 12 a week mr povich , who had never been on a train , had never been out of maine and had never owned a pair of long pants , accepted his first task was to carry the bag of mclean s friend , warren g harding , president of the united states at the post , mr povich rose first to police reporter and then to a position in the sports department , all while studying law at georgetown university his first byline came on aug 5 , 1924 , above a report on the washington senators in 1926 , at age 21 , he was named sports editor , the youngest sports editor of a metropolitan daily in the nation and he went on from there , covering events as diverse as the famed jack dempseygene tunney long count heavyweight championship fight in 1927 to the olympics to ruth s called shot in the 1932 world series \( he did n't really call the shot , mr povich said of ruth he was pointing at the pitcher , charley root , for quickpitching him , and he was calling him names \) at 91 , he attended a washington bullets national basketball association game he was never enamored with basketball , and wrote , they do n't shoot baskets anymore , they stuff them , like taxidermists mr povich said the following to holtzman , in the book no cheering in the press box despite the fact that i was a precocious young sports editor , i would describe myself as a late bloomer maturity came late to me i was about 30 when i discovered i was n't a clear thinker i was a hero worshiper , a romanticist , highly sentimental and entirely impractical i was constantly overwriting , often attempting to make the event and the game more exciting and dramatic than it was in his 1969 autobiography , all these mornings , mr povich described how he suffered two fractured vertebrae on okinawa in world war ii he was taken off a ship that was headed for combat

buffalo , aug 27 b thomas golisano is rousing a somnolent race for governor like a drumroll of thunder on a placid day if not quite scaring anyone , he is at least getting people s attention and threatening a little rain on gov george e pataki s reelection parade mr golisano , a very wealthy rochester businessman , is making his second run for governor as the candidate of the independence party , though his campaign was so quiet until recently that the average voter would hardly have noticed it but in the last week , he has been everywhere , leaping into the race with an advertising attack on mr pataki , a republican , that is so wellfinanced that democratic party challengers can only look on in envy mr golisano , 56 , has bought advertisements on every network television station , every major radio station and nearly every newspaper of any size across the state spending 4 million of his own money , so far , in an effort that he says will grow to 10 million the ads , without calling mr pataki by name , accuse the governor of fiscal mismanagement , noting the rise in state spending and a sharp increase in state debt since mr pataki took office that has turned heads in a campaign whose only television presence has been warmandfuzzy images from mr pataki and the democratic frontrunner , peter f vallone but can all that money improve on the 4 percent of the vote that mr golisano drew in 1994 , when he spent 66 million \? unlike then , when gov mario m cuomo was wearing out his welcome , the incumbent this year is popular , and voters show none of the anger they displayed four years ago as the candidate of a minor party that is just four years old , mr golisano must continually fend off questions about what he really hopes to accomplish , the assumption being that his candidacy will go nowhere our goal , our incentive here , is to get as many votes as we can and to win the election , mr golisano said at a campaign stop today in downtown buffalo , where he announced a new round of ads he said he would begin next month to put out a detailed platform , particularly on education just attacking and discrediting is not enough to win , he said some political analysts surmise that his real aim is to build support for his fledgling party , whose platform is fiscal conservatism combined with social libertarianism on issues like abortion and gay rights the real question , they say , is whether he will simply fragment the antipataki vote , burying any hope the democrats might have , or whether his relentless attacks on mr pataki could help the democratic nominee some people speculate we take more votes from the republicans , we take more from the democrats , mr golisano said i have no idea , and frankly , i do n't care john zogby , a pollster and political analyst , says that the success of thirdparty candidates relies heavily on dissatisfaction with the incumbent our polls show last time , his vote came 2 to 1 from pataki , because they were splitting the anticuomo vote , mr zogby said this time , he s going to cut into the democrat but for some democrats , mr golisano has emerged as an unexpected political godsend cashstrapped democrats could not afford the kind of attack in the news media that mr golisano has mounted against mr pataki , in which ads strike at the heart of the governor s record and his claim to being a fiscal conservative who has tamed albany s excesses if he spends millions of dollars attacking george pataki , one would think that ca n't be good for george pataki , said david eichenbaum , a democratic campaign consultant it could provide an opportunity for a democrat zenia mucha , mr pataki s campaign manager , said she was not concerned by mr golisano s ads , whose message she disputed ms mucha said she expected him to be no more a factor in this race than in the last one it s a very risky thing to underestimate the intelligence of the voter , she said and having a person who s willing to spend millions of dollars to disseminate a message that is not true does not make people think it s true mr golisano says that he knows little about the leading democratic contenders , mr vallone and lieut gov betsy mccaughey ross , and that he has no plans to turn his sights on them in 1994 , mr golisano had the endorsement of ross perot and the support of mr perot s reform party in the space of just a few weeks that fall , his deeply tanned face , framed by silver curls , became a familiar sight to new yorkers he drew more than 217 , 000 votes , well above the 50 , 000 needed to win the independence party an automatic place on state ballots for the next four years but it is questionable whether the party , without mr golisano s name recognition and deep pockets , would have been able to top 50 , 000 this year early this year , mr golisano did not seem eager to run again , but the party leaned hard on him to be its standardbearer mr golisano s wealth stems from a chance he took in 1971 , when he was a 29yearold employee of a payroll processing company he looked around his workplace and decided he could do a better job than his bosses he quit his job and founded his own payroll company , paychex he focused on the small employers that he saw other payroll processors ignoring , and now 300 , 000 of them are clients mr golisano s stake in paychex , which went public in 1983 , is worth about 600 million , and he has large holdings in several other companies asked if he was a billionaire , he said no , but that he was close he is on the forbes magazine list of the 400 richest americans his quest to be governor follows essentially the same story line as the one he used in his business life he sees how state government runs and thinks he can improve on it my mentors have all been negative , mr golisano said in an interview i saw a lot of people doing things wrong , and that inspires me tycoonscumpoliticians frequently find the going rocky , at best , as mr perot , lew lehrman and al checchi can attest they are debilitated by the press scrutiny , the constant secondguessing of their actions and motives , the need for building a consensus and their own unwillingness to keep some thoughts to themselves but mr golisano has the unruffled confidence of the selfmade man , and as others before him who made the foray into politics , he insists that all government needs is a dose of businessstyle management referring , for example , to the partial takeover of the long island lighting company advocated by mr pataki , he said , no business would have made that deal he cheerfully admits his ignorance in many policy areas , but suggests in the next breath that it does not matter of the state s high medicaid costs , he said , i do n't pretend to be an expert in that area , but something that large , there s got to be room to cut mr golisano concedes that most social issues do not concern him much he says he favors abortion rights because most of the country is prochoice he says that he does not feel strongly about legalizing casino gambling , and that the issue should be decided in a referendum he makes it clear that the only issues that matter deeply to him are education reform and fiscal policy and that , he insists , is enough i'm in it to win , he said people will tell you i ca n't win , but they 're wrong photo b thomas golisano

northampton , mass talk about an offer you ca n't refuse the one that gov john rowland of connecticut made to the owner of the new england patriots to lure the football team to hartford was so generous and encompassing as to put the recent sports giveaways in tampa , baltimore , st louis and cleveland to shame the deal , which the state legislature will consider dec 15 after a hearing next wednesday , includes , at connecticut s expense , a riverfront stadium for at least 280 million , 70 million to acquire and improve the site , 25 million to 100 million for environmental cleanup , land for a pavilion and hotel , a 15 million practice site , 26 , 000 parking spaces , 170 million in a fund for future improvements and assorted state guarantees in return , robert kraft , the team owner , would pay no rent for the 30year life of the deal and keep all revenue from ticket sales , luxury suites , parking , concessions and so on all told , mr kraft s stadium income could be 100 million a year the state would get only a 10 percent ticket tax with such an alluring offer , one might think that mr kraft needed enticement far from it the team s current home in foxboro , mass , is an hour from boston and surrounded by inadequate access roads the 1971 stadium has virtually none of the amenities or revenuegenerating accouterments of newer parks and massachusetts and boston have done little to try to keep the team so why did governor rowland have to cut the worst deal in the history of the national football league \? he did n't but it is easy for small cities like hartford to lapse into a biddingwar mentality where nfl franchises are concerned , for two reasons first , far more than in other sports , the nfl has extensive revenue sharing among its teams teams split all regular and postseason television revenue equally , as well as all licensing and sponsorship income they also split 40 percent of net gate sales as a result , the top revenuemaking team in the nfl might earn 50 percent more than the bottom team , while in baseball the top team earns three times as much as the lowest second , an nfl team plays only eight regular season home games a year the patriots in hartford would have to sell only 680 , 000 seats \( counting exhibition games \) a year a baseball team would have to sell about four million seats to sell out thus the nfl has dozens more cities ready to bid for its teams than other sports have , and it capitalizes on that dynamic public subsidies tend to be much larger in the nfl than in other sports there is an argument for some public subsidies of stadiums if nothing else , a sports team can build community pride if connecticut believes that such benefits , largely intangible , warrant spending of 35 million to 65 million a year on debt service and other costs , then it should support mr rowland \( the 10 percent ticket tax would generate 5 million to 7 million a year , but much of that would only replace sales tax money lost elsewhere in the state the deal is decidedly not revenue neutral , despite claims by mr rowland and a new peat marwick study \) connecticut , however , should not support the plan if it expects the patriots to create jobs or raise per capita income all experience with new stadiums and new teams suggests that the patriots would not have a significant impact on the connecticut economy indeed , mr rowland s largesse portends either higher taxes or reduced services hartford might enjoy a bit of a revitalization but this would largely consist of shifting economic output toward hartford and away from other parts of the state in any case , if hartford s welfare truly concerns the governor , things like tax incentives for industry and increased spending on education would provide more bang for the buck if connecticut legislators are determined to have a football team , they would do well to try to modify mr rowland s deal there is , for instance , no reason the state should guarantee 175 million of premium seat revenue annually in other nfl leases , any such guarantees are usually arranged through business associations that some legislators have begun to ask questions is a good sign connecticut has more leverage than mr rowland thinks , and should use it

triumph of justice the final judgment on the simpson saga by daniel petrocelli with peter knobler 644 pp new york crown publishers 2595 at least 50 books have already been published on the o j simpson case now daniel petrocelli , the lawyer for the goldman family in the civil trial , adds to the pile with his account of how he led the team of lawyers that persuaded a jury to find o j simpson liable in the deaths of ron goldman and nicole brown simpson , and to award the families of the victims 335 million in damages triumph of justice is a 644page doorstop yet even if you are sick of everything connected to the simpson case , you might want to look at it for not only does it contain a dramatic , emotionally charged narrative \( petrocelli s coauthor is the very professional peter knobler , who has collaborated with james carville and mary matalin , william bratton and kareem abduljabbar , among others \) , but it also gives us something that no other book on o j simpson does it gives us o j simpson he was always the silence at the center of the storm while in jail he put out a volume of letters from wellwishers and others , with his comments and responses it was called i want to tell you , but apparently all he wanted to tell us was stuff like i do believe that god was trying to get my attention and this trouble is god s way of getting my attention he claimed that he desired only to say my piece to the world , but he did not testify at his criminal trial johnnie cochran explained that the defense had decided against putting simpson on the stand because after the mark fuhrman episode , after the glove that did n't fit , the prosecution s position was hopeless but in the civil case simpson had no choice he could be compelled to take the stand and he was surprisingly , the lawyers for the plaintiffs were n't certain they were going to force simpson to testify one attorney pointed out that after petrocelli interrogated simpson , the defense would carefully lead him through his story a second time the jury will have heard simpson twice he gets a double shot i'm really worried about the double shot but what finally seems to have clinched the argument was the mock trial that the petrocelli team ran one month before the real thing in most respects the mock trial was a disaster a total of 33 people , representative of the jury pool , heard hourlong presentations by petrocelli speaking for the plaintiffs and a colleague speaking for the defense petrocelli went through all the evidence the colleague offered what was essentially a johnnie cochran defense fuhrman , fuhrman , fuhrman ! before the mock trial began , the jurors had been polled 55 percent thought simpson was guilty 45 percent thought he was innocent petrocelli believed he had done a good job , but when the jury took a straw vote following the presentations , 57 percent voted for conviction , 43 percent for acquittal after all the arguing we had only managed to move the jury 2 percent , petrocelli writes i was devastated still , the analysis of the mock trial turned up a crucial fact as part of its argument , the defense ran a portion of the videotape that simpson had made to accompany i want to tell you , and at that point even his most ardent defenders expressed reservations the circumstances of the tape could not have been more favorable to simpson , and yet people could sense that he was not being truthful he appeared coached he seemed to be acting there could be no doubt about it simpson would take the stand petrocelli knows what he has with the simpson testimony fully onequarter of his book is devoted to it petrocelli does n't simply report what is contained in the trial transcripts he will quote an exchange , then annotate explaining why he asked a particular question , what simpson s response revealed , how the combat was progressing sometimes he is an avenging angel he was a killer , and i intended to treat him like one sometimes he is a cat playing with a mouse as well as the first day had gone , i wanted to destroy him on the second this would be the fun part sometimes he is lieutenant columbo by the way , petrocelli says at the start of one question , and promptly warns his readers that you 've always got to be wary when a lawyer begins a question with 'by the way' the petrocellisimpson encounters came in two parts the first was a sworn deposition the second was the actual testimony at the trial the deposition was the first time simpson had ever testified under oath about the murders , and petrocelli grilled him for 11 days there were hundreds of questions simply about the cuts on his left hand it was , in petrocelli s words , a scorchedearth deposition petrocelli s strategy at the trial itself could not have been more straightforward a term had been coined at the criminal trial for impeaching a witness , to hang someone out to dry to 'fuhrmanize' the paradigm was 'i did n't say the nword in the last 10 years' boom , here s the tape of you saying it we were going to 'fuhrmanize' simpson the process of fuhrmanization began with the subject of domestic violence simpson declared that he had never hit nicole petrocelli asked about the friends who reported that she repeatedly told them he had struck her she was lying , simpson responded nicole had written the same thing in her diary again , she was lying to her diary then petrocelli put up police photographs of a bruised and battered nicole from 1989 simpson continued to deny ever hitting her the most he would say was that i feel responsible for every injury she had but that was not good enough , and petrocelli dug in , refusing simpson the space to claim that he was responsible yet not responsible
san francisco hightechnology companies are so desperate for programmers , according to recent reports , that they are luring students out of the classroom with wellpaying jobs it s the schools' fault , say people in the industry and some computerscience professors students are n't being taught the skills they need and therefore do n't see the point of getting a degree but critics are forgetting that the very idea of the computer science degree is a relatively recent point on the short time line of the computer industry historically , most programmers had plenty of education , but little of it came from computer science departments the problem is not the technical curriculum , but the undergraduate computer science degree itself computer programming has always been a selftaught , maverick occupation except for a brief moment in the late 1980 s and early 90 s what i think of as the dilbert era no one thought that programming was something you should learn in college prospective programmers spent a great deal of time in school , but they typically studied something other than computers aside from a few famous dropouts like bill gates , steven jobs and stephen wozniak the profession has always attracted the very wellschooled physicists and mathematicians created the industry just after world war ii and became the first programmers as the need for such skills grew in the 1970 s , business and government had to look beyond people with doctorates fortunately , that demand coincided with the end of the 1960 s , when all sorts of overeducated people were on the loose , looking for a way to earn a living that s where i came in i'm a member of the generation that came to computing as a second , third or fourth vocation my first boss had two master s degrees in social science and had spent years as a sufi dancing disciple my next boss , a former bartender , had a master s degree in library science the head of technical services at the same company had a phd in anthropology , and she hired people who had completed all but their dissertations in linguistics , archeology and classics in this crowd , i felt like the dunce with my undergraduate degree in english we had all taught ourselves computing for us , it was just one more difficult subject to learn no one was intimidated by learning another computer language or anything else for that matter what we knew was how to learn , which is all that one can hang on to in a profession in which change is relentless the generation of programmers who followed us were , well , disappointing they had engineering and computer science degrees , and none of them seemed to have read anything but technical textbooks they stood mute among us when we said the occasional phrase in french they looked confused when we alluded to shakespeare or proust if today s wouldbe programmers are fleeing the sort of education that these people received , well , that s wonderful a good friend of mine finished engineering school in the late 1980 s he managed to get his degree without having studied much of what some still call western civilization poignantly , he knows he s missed something he is now a principal of a startup company developing email services for the world wide web my friend is building connections around the planet , and he is ashamed that he has never even studied a foreign language i do n't mean for these stories to persuade aspiring programmers to drop out of school quite the contrary , i hope it might make students and professors realize that programming instruction can take place in a few classes , and students can spend the rest of their time studying foreign languages , literature , linguistics , philosophy and history of science schools might as well give up on teaching the latest skills , since those skills will soon become obsolete anyway instead , they might stress subjects that foster a flexible and open mind programmers seem to be changing the world it would be a relief , for them and for all of us , if they knew something about it drawing \( ward sutton \)
after the polarizing impeachment proceedings of the house , it is heartening to see the senate already taking a more measured , less partisan approach to bill clinton s serious misconduct an early and partial sampling of senate sentiment yesterday suggests there are the makings of a bipartisan deal that would bring this matter to a just and speedy resolution by severely censuring mr clinton while allowing him to complete his term for the first time since impeachment barreled out of control in the house , there may actually be some leaders in congress willing to negotiate an endgame agreement with the white house as the house amply demonstrated , bringing the clinton case to a fair denouement is exceedingly difficult in the politically supercharged atmosphere of washington the senate should have a better chance of success for several reasons , including the wise constitutional arithmetic that requires 67 votes to convict mr clinton and evict him from office with that outcome considered highly unlikely in the absence of compelling new evidence against mr clinton , alternative solutions will get the serious consideration they never received in the house former presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter outline a plausible blueprint for censuring mr clinton on today s oped page it was fairly music to the ears of a pained nation yesterday to hear four senators orrin hatch and mitch mcconnell , both republicans , and christopher dodd and patrick leahy , democrats talk about the senate s obligations in a judicious , thoughtful way in a joint appearance on nbc s meet the press , the four men spoke of the need to place the national interest above party interests , and none of them , including the usually partisan mr mcconnell , excluded the possibility of censure translating that constructive spirit into action will require a number of statesmanlike decisions by mr clinton and the senate as the four senators , as well as mr ford and mr carter , suggest , mr clinton must finally give up the concoction that he did not lie under oath in his august grandjury appearance all settlement possibilities flow from that confession , and without it mr clinton will force the senate and the country to endure an extended trial that will not serve the national interest and will further weaken an already shriveled presidency with it , mr clinton can unlock the door to a censure package as senator robert byrd has noted , the constitution leaves little doubt that the senate must open a trial when presented with articles of impeachment by the house but there is no requirement that a case be carried to conviction or acquittal by a simple majority vote , a trial can be suspended or ended at any time as mr ford and mr carter properly propose , a censure deal would likely require a pledge from kenneth starr to refrain from prosecuting mr clinton once he left the white house while the white house must prepare to defend mr clinton in a senate trial , it should initiate early , serious discussions with senate leaders about the potential shape of a censure deal mr clinton would do well to select former senator george mitchell to handle this work and to direct his defense the senate , for its part , must move energetically to engage mr clinton s representatives the indispensable element in all this is the commodity most lacking in washington at this troubled time seasoned leadership at both ends of pennsylvania avenue it is time for mr clinton to end both his yearlong estrangement from the law and his refusal to help settle the mess created by his recklessness , and for congress to bring this case to a close
bernie williams had conceded on tuesday that his recent aloofness had made it seem as if he was not there , a distance that caused joe torre to meet with him one on one while williams also said there was nothing personally wrong with him , a yankee official said that the center fielder was grappling with a personal matter and that is why he has been so estranged recently after yesterday s workout at yankee stadium , williams was asked if he wanted to comment on any undisclosed personal issues and he sharply said , none of your business even though williams obviously did not want to discuss anything about his life off the field , he had said on tuesday that everything was fine and that he was simply trying to finish the season with a world series title williams elaborated on baseball questions and dodged personal questions yesterday once you 're here in new york , you have your life kind of dug into a little bit , williams said i 've always taken a lot of pride in keeping my private life private i do n't see why it should n't stay that way since williams can become a free agent after the season and is likely to demand at least 11 million or 12 million a year , it is very possible that he could be playing in his last games with the yankees williams said he was not pondering the future , but he offered a revealing answer when asked if he would like to see the yankees' remarkable season never end we 're having so much fun that it will be hard to look back in the off season and say it was an incredible year for us , williams said so it is kind of sad to have it end like this i'm just going to try to enjoy the most out of the opportunity that i have right now and just have a lot of fun with it photo bernie williams has seemed aloof and unhappy for most of the postseason \( barton silverman the new york times \)
san diego look at the body language , someone was saying in the press box as the atlanta braves took the field for the bottom of the eighth inning saturday afternoon looks like their best friend died even worse , under the circumstances it was their hopes that appeared about to be deceased , for the san diego padres were administering yet another beating of this remarkable team , and this remarkable franchise there was chipper jones , the third baseman , looking as though the distance between his dugout and nearby third base was six miles and andres galarraga looking as if he were walking uphill to first base and poor gerald williams , trekking to right field , which had to be in idaho the padres were about to go up by three games to none against the team that won 106 games during the regular season , whose pitchers have a slew of cy young trophies gathering dust on their mantelpieces the team has spent so much time in the playoffs and world series in this decade that their fans have demonstrated an uncommon ennui well , we can make it interesting , said bobby cox , the braves' manager , after saturday s game win tomorrow , win the next day , and go home with two you can still make it really , really interesting , i think i think ! what a qualifier it was the difference between the eternal optimist and the realist no team in baseball history has come back from a 30 deficit in a postseason series and for huge chunks of last night s game it seemed the braves were cooked but not so fast they demonstrated the heart of a champion twice they fell behind to the padres , in the third and sixth innings , and twice they battled back to tie the game and then their batters finally decided to mean business , and they scored six runs in the seventh , highlighted by a leadgaining slap single by the ancient shortstop ozzie guillen , and a grand slam by galarraga in fact earlier , both guillen and galarraga were guilty of hurting rather than helping guillen , starting for the first time in this series , did n't adequately play a ground ball in the third , which led to the padres' first , and lead , run galarraga has foundered at the plate , batting 091 going into game 4 , and was less than spectacular in the field and on the bases but suddenly it was 83 for the nearly defunct braves suddenly the noisiest crowd in the national league championship series , the gathering of 65 , 045 faithful in qualcomm stadium that had been chanting sweep ! sweep ! to the certain delight of the braves' players , became as quiet as a canyon and then there had to be alarm in the hearts and cueball heads of some of the fans in honor of a few padres players who had shaved their heads for postseason play , they also had a razor taken to their locks a local television station had sponsored barbers setting up shop on the street beyond center field and were doing a brisk business the shaving cream was flying one after the other came out looking like curly of the three stooges , or at least michael jordan now they , and the padre personnel , were looking at the conceivable return of three of baseball s best pitchers john smoltz tonight and , if andy ashby ca n't hold the braves in this game , then tommy glavine will materialize on the mound in game 6 in atlanta and it will be greg maddux redux in the finale but that s all supposing , of course they 're an outstanding team and , they proved it again tonight , said jim leyritz , who irritates the braves with his mouth as well as his bat his homer in the sixth gave the padres their second lead of the game and his exulting gave them a headache we did n't think they 'd roll over for us but i 'd rather be up , three games to one , than down , three to one we 're still in the catbird seat denny neagle , the braves starter last night , had said before the game if this is going to be my last start of the year , i'm going to pitch my type of game sure there s pressure , but i'm not going to want to be home over the winter and think that i was n't the pitcher i know i can be he added , i 'll throw the way i always do , and hope that we can score more runs than they do he was true to his word , pitching decently in his five innings and keeping the braves in contention just when it appeared , in the words of one of their native laureates , that they were gone with the wind as the braves departed their dugout to take the field in the bottom half of the ninth inning last night , with that pleasantly plump 83 lead , chipper jones bounded out to third base and galarraga was at first in a flash and for gerald williams , right field had magically moved out of idaho and back to san diego photo carlos hernandez had no play as chipper jones scored in the sixth \( associated press \)

washington , dec 2 after only two days of deliberation , a federal jury today acquitted mike espy , the former agriculture secretary , of corruption charges , ending an independent prosecutor s fouryear investigation into gifts of sports tickets and other favors from companies he was supposed to regulate it s cost a lot , it s been tough but i knew from day one that i would stand here before you completely exonerated , mr espy , a former congressman and once a rising star in the democratic party , told reporters outside the courthouse the jury took barely 10 hours to reject 30 counts brought by donald c smaltz , an independent prosecutor the trial judge had earlier dismissed eight other counts as he savored his swift and thorough redemption , mr espy made it clear he thought his case bolstered criticism of investigations conducted by independent counsels and underscored what critics say are troublesome aspects of the independent counsel law congress is expected to hold hearings early next year on whether to renew the law , which expires in june there is little expectation that it will be extended as many officials in both parties , wearied by highprofile investigations from irancontra to whitewater , say the law gives too much power but no oversight to overzealous prosecutors mr espy made it plain that when congress holds hearings , he hoped his ordeal would seal the law s fate i would like to be the first witness mr espy likened mr smaltz , who spent more than 17 million investigating him over a fouryear period , to a schoolyard bully page a26 both mr espy and mr smaltz , in comments to reporters after the verdict , neatly crystallized the debate over the wisdom and effectiveness of the ethics in government act , the postwatergate law that provides for independent counsels to investigate accusations of wrongdoing against senior administration officials the independent prosecutor , mr espy said , was someone with all the money , all the power , very little supervision , no timetable and able to unleash powerful hordes of prosecutors on you and your family , summarizing the arguments that will be heard in congress from the law s opponents after mr espy and his jubilant family departed , mr smaltz appeared and first told reporters that he accepted the verdict but then , in his prepared statement , mr smaltz appeared to continue to argue the case he had just lost , saying a public official s acceptance of gratuities goes to the heart of the credibility in the performance of his duties when a public official accepts gratuities , it calls the impartial execution of his judgment into question when he has matters before him that affect the gratuity givers mr espy was charged with receiving an illegal gratuity , not bribery prosecutors said he took about 34 , 000 worth of tickets and other favors like luggage in presenting 70 witnesses over nearly two months , mr smaltz portrayed mr espy as eager to ask companies he regulated for tickets to sporting events including the united states open tennis tournament , and games played by the dallas cowboys football team and the chicago bulls basketball team mr espy did not take the stand and presented no witnesses in his defense , resting his case after the prosecution presented 70 witnesses ted wells , one of mr espy s lawyers , sought to demolish mr smaltz s case in closing arguments , telling the jury that the prosecution presented no witnesses who said his client ever made a decision based on anything he received mr wells said that many of the gifts mr espy received were the result of longstanding friendships with people who were lobbyists and that the law allowed federal officials to accept items in those circumstances william s noakes , an associate independent counsel , said that with the conclusion of the espy trial , mr smaltz s office has only a few matters remaining and will soon close mr smaltz took the opportunity to offer a both a valedictory and a defense of his work , saying that his office had gained more than a dozen convictions and garnered some 11 million in fines and criminal penalties , mostly from companies that were charged with making illegal gratuities to mr espy if our investigation and prosecutions dissuade corporations from giving gifts to their regulators , and the regulators from accepting gifts from those who are regulated , i believe that the costs we have incurred are worth the price , he said he also said that despite the acquittal , there was value in prosecuting mr espy because it would discourage other officials from behaving the same way the actual indictment of a public official may in fact be as great a deterrent as a conviction of that official , he said throughout his tenure , mr smaltz had been a focus of critics who complained that he personified the problems with the independent counsel law , that he was excessively ambitious and eager to expand his jurisdiction beyond his original mandate at times , he faced even more criticism than kenneth w starr , the independent counsel for whitewater matters who has told congress that president clinton may have committed impeachable offenses a few weeks after his appointment in september 1994 , mr smaltz stunned many in official washington when he subpoenaed flight logs and notes of pilots working for tyson s foods , a large poultry and food processor based in arkansas whose owner , don tyson , has been a longtime supporter of mr clinton mr smaltz was trying to find out if mr tyson had arranged for cash bribes to be ferried to mr clinton when he was governor of arkansas when lawyers from tyson s protested that none of the matters were within mr smaltz s jurisdiction , a federal judge agreed and ordered mr smaltz to stop mr smaltz also suffered a setback when a federal judge threw out charges he had brought against henry espy , mr espy s brother , saying they were unrelated to the prosecutor s mandate but mr smaltz has had successes as well his two most notable victories were having tyson s foods agree to pay 6 million after pleading guilty to making illegal gifts to mr espy he also got sun diamond growers , a california cooperative for growers of nuts , raisins and other dried fruits to pay a 15 million fine for illegally condoning gifts to mr espy by its lobbyist but a federal appeals court in washington overturned the conviction of sun diamond and the case is on appeal to the supreme court , one of the remaining items of business for mr smaltz s office the case involves the meaning of the unlawful gratuity statute , which makes it a crime to give , offer or promise anything of value to a public official because of any official act performed or to be performed mr smaltz had argued that the law was violated any time a gift was motivated by the recipient s position but in overturning the conviction last march , the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said the gift had to be motivated not only by the recipient s position , but by some official act , either a reward for a past act , or an inducement for a future one photo mike espy with a friend after the verdict

he asked when the chicken arrived the way he smiled and the way the chicken tasted made me feel as if i could trust this man forever the decor and sometimes the food , however , are less consistently wonderful although comfortable and calm , the dining room is dull the same erte prints that were on the walls in 1992 , as well as the crystal chandeliers and the grayness everywhere , need rethinking the dessert tray displayed at the entrance does n't do justice to the desserts since food , like the rest of us , wilts with age still , barry squier , the talented chef who has overseen the kitchen since 1984 , is fanatical about ingredients , as is evident in the chicken and in the greens and herbs that brighten other dishes you can eat well and happily at girafe , but you might no longer view the restaurant as the wonder it was when more interesting restaurants were rarer in somerset county the wine list , however , continues to be an asset none of its selections are terribly old , but the overall list contains reasonable selections like a marimar torres chardonnay at the low end for 32 you 'll like it better than either of the complimentary hors d'oeuevres served recently , the bruschetta or the roquefort spread on toast the bread in the basket also lacks greatness order the pate , and your confidence in the kitchen will grow mr squier is known for his pates , which these days include one with duck liver and madeira a country version combining veal , pork , green peppercorns and cognac and a venison pate fortified with port wine and tangy cranberries that steals the show the grainy mustard is properly feisty , but every other garnish , a homemade onion marmalade and the chowchow pickle mix , are sweet , even for relishes the sauteed maryland crab cakes are also favorites it s not even crab season , but i ca n't take them off the menu , says mr squier , who prepares his colorful version with confetti corn salsa , a remoulade of mayonnaise and sour cream , and tomatoes that have been cooked on the restaurant s smoker the light , crunchy crust and smoky aftertaste are the most interesting aspects of the dish if only it tasted more of crab meat the oysters also feature interesting frills , a deliciously creamy creole mayonnaise , and a crisp bluecornmeal crust that is never greasy but in this case also the accessories mask the main ingredient since they are oysters from fisher s island off long island , their absence of flavor is even more distressing mr squier features entrees that are as resolutely nonitalian as his appetizers , which makes sense in a state where italian reigns but with few exceptions , the nouvelle cuisine dishes on the menu no longer seem nouvelle or exciting it s hotel food , one diner commented , and even though this rendition benefits from fine ingredients and a firstrate chef , it needs a fresh injection of greatness one exception is the duck a gorgeous creature , the halfbird is glazed with a caramellike mix of hoisin sauce and ginger and then roasted until the skin is crisp and the meat irresistibly juicy it s wonderful , although the oriental rice flour pancakes beside it are dull and mushy i 'd prefer rice , my companion says the plain broiled freerange chicken and poached salmon also underscore the kitchen s dexterity girafe caters parties and winetastings in its upstairs dining rooms , and still it poaches salmon beautifully but the fussier , more complicated entrees falter fat marred the rack of lamb one night , and although the halibut served as a special was nicely crusted with pine nuts , it was n't the fresh , moist , delicate fish that you dream about for days afterward the tuna is also carefully cooked but uninspired white chocolate macadamia pie is the signature dessert , but others are more interesting the mango truffle , a giant bonbon of hardiced white chocolate around mango sorbet and ice cream , is a trip to the tropics , and the butterbrickle ice cream terrine , riddled with pecans , is even more magnificent melted when girafe opened in 1983 , john rader , who still presides , was a lone restaurateur in a largely residential area hence the name i felt like i was sticking my neck out , he said over the years , customers donated statues of giraffes from around the world looking at the collection on display in an upstairs party room , do n't you wish that girafe would stick its neck out again \?

a brooklyn school where a 16yearold girl was struck and critically injured by falling bricks last friday will be open for classes today , encircled by new wooden scaffolding to guard against further mishaps , school officials said yesterday as workers shored up the school , city building inspectors examined 41 of about 150 other school construction projects around new york city to look for conditions similar to those that injured the girl , yanahan zhao ilyse fink , a spokeswoman for the city s buildings department , said that inspectors issued eight citations to contractors for construction irregularities but that none involved safety hazards the remaining inspections should be completed in a week or two , she said investigators are continuing to look into whether negligence by the contractor performing masonry repair on the brooklyn school , public school 131 in borough park , may have contributed to the bricks' falling four stories from a scaffold , where they appear to have been used to secure a tarp little new information was available yesterday about the contractor , espo construction of the bronx , which was performing its first job as a general contractor for the school construction authority the company s contract for the school and a second at another school were canceled as a result of the accident several calls to the company s offices were not returned yesterday earl brown , a spokesman for the authority , said the company s president , bernardo esposito , had been the head of another company , bernardo esposito construction , before forming espo in 1988 in 1994 , espo sought school masonry jobs and passed integrity examinations conducted by the authority to insure that the company had no criminal background or history of problems in a check of its records yesterday , the authority found no outstanding safety violations against the company for its work as a subcontractor on three earlier school repair jobs in brooklyn and on staten island , mr brown added a spokeswoman for the brooklyn district attorney s office would say only that the accident was under investigation the injured girl suffered a fractured skull when two bricks and a construction helmet plunged from the scaffold on friday afternoon just after classes were dismissed she remained in critical but stable condition yesterday at kings county hospital center a younger girl who was also injured received 10 stitches at maimonides medical center and was released on friday
san juan , pr , dec 11 on a balmy evening this week , the caravan of dozens of cars snaking around the workingclass neighborhoods of carolina , a city east of here , brought its deafening honking , sirens , music and shouts of equality for puerto rico ! right to jose manuel molina s doorstep mr molina , 65 , and his wife , blanca , 61 , rushed out of the house and began hollering , in delight number 3 ! number 3 ! they yelled , referring to a prostatehood ballot measure that is one of five options in a referendum on sunday on puerto rico s political status in decades of voting for the prostatehood party , mr molina said , this is the first time he feels puerto rico has a real possibility of joining the union as a state this is not for us but for our youth and our children , said the retired telephone repairman , who has 3 children and 15 grandchildren this is for them , mrs molina agreed it will bring better jobs and schools we 'll learn more languages there will be stricter laws , more order sunday s vote , the subject of heated campaigning that ended today with big rallies in the san juan metropolitan area , is a bid by the administration of gov pedro j rossello to measure the island s support for statehood and prod congress into authorizing a future binding vote on statehood here the house this year passed a bill that would have allowed a federally sponsored referendum on puerto rico s status this year , which marks the 100th anniversary of the takeover of puerto rico by the united states from spain after the spanishamerican war but the proposal stalled in the senate both members of congress and clinton administration officials say the results of sunday s vote would be viewed as a serious indication of which political status option puerto ricans prefer independence , statehood or some other form of association with the united states the vote is likely to start a new legislative process in washington to seek a final status choice puerto ricans remain at odds over whether to cement their ties with the united states with statehood or seek more autonomy , but most are united in holding on to three elements of their identity spanish language , latin american culture and american citizenship congress , in turn , is sharply divided over whether to accept puerto rico as a possible state , and previous bills on selfdetermination have bogged down on questions about the political , cultural and economic cost of incorporating an island with 38 million latin americans as the 51st state but a consensus is growing in washington that puerto rico s current commonwealth status , which opponents call a vestige of colonialism and even supporters want modified to give the island more selfgoverning powers , is a transitional state the commonwealth or free associated state created in 1952 gives puerto ricans here american citizenship but denies them equal rights and obligations it grants the island selfgovernment in local affairs and subjects it to federal law , like states but unlike residents in the states , including puerto ricans who live in the mainland , puerto ricans on the island do not pay federal taxes , cannot vote on federal elections or elect congressional delegations , and they do not receive federal benefits comparable to those received on the mainland those who advocate a 51st state say the commonwealth status denies full rights to puerto ricans even though they are american citizens the governing prostatehood new progressive party has crafted the ballot measure as a petition to the united states government under the first amendment to define in a conclusive manner the political condition of the people of puerto rico and the extent of united states sovereignty in order to resolve the current territorial problem of the island after 100 years of political subordination some political analysts here say such language amounts to an exercise of the constitutional right to petition the federal government for the redress of grievances , in this case the grievance of colonialism , that gives the vote more weight and is meant to prompt a federal response governor rossello said in an interview today that , legally , congress cannot be forced to take action but certainly it will be a strong statement that i do n't think congress can ignore with five options on the ballot , however , newspaper polls here indicate that none is likely to get a majority the vote is further complicated by an option called none of the above which is supported by commonwealth supporters as a form of protest against the referendum the leadership of the procommonwealth popular democratic party argues that the definition of the status quo as drafted by the prostatehood majority in the legislature and as it appears on the ballot is misleading it calls united states citizenship statutory rather than irrevocable and inviolable as in two previous plebiscite votes , for instance , in order to scare puerto ricans to vote for statehood , the party says we need a process of selfdetermination because there are many perspectives , said mayor sila m calderon of san juan , a leader of the popular democrats , but this is not fair and square in addition to commonwealth , statehood , independence and none of the above , the ballot includes a free association option appearing for the first time on a status referendum in puerto rico it calls for a selfgoverning nation that delegates certain powers to the united states under treaties , like defense and national security the relationship would be similar to the arrangement the united states has already with pacific territories like the marshall islands , federal officials said it is uncertain what sunday s plebiscite vote would do to advance the cause of selfdetermination for the island with a congress equally divided over whether to open up the opportunity for puerto rico to join the union governor rossello said he would consider a plurality of the vote a victory and enough of a mandate to take to congress to start a transition plan to implement statehood under the bill approved by the house this year , such a transition would take no longer than 10 years and require another referendum for final approval if statehood wins , it would be the first time that such option garners the most votes in puerto rico in a 1993 referendum statehood lost to commonwealth , 46 percent to 48 percent the third option , independence , got 4 percent some members of congress have said a plurality , in the absence of a 50 percent plus 1 majority , could suffice to start a process for congress to define the terms of a yesorno vote on statehood republican senator connie mack and democratic senator bob graham , both of florida , said in a joint written statement they would act to implement the chosen option by a majority but would disregard the none of the above votes because such a vote conveys no message to the federal government that may leave statehood with a clear majority among only four options instead of five
julien levy portrait of an art gallery at the equitable gallery , is the ideal endofsummer show it is a tumult of ideas , every one of which has been picked over for the occasion by two gifted and youthful enthusiasts , ingrid schaffner and lisa jacobs there is a great deal to see , almost all of it is worth looking at , and none of it goes on for too long even more than the portrait of an art gallery , it is the portrait of an art dealer levy , who died in 1981 , did not choose with an eye to the market , though the market in time got the point of what he had done he chose by instinct , and to satisfy a curiosity that never flagged adventure , not calculation , governed his every move he traveled fast , he traveled light , he went straight to the sources of what he wanted , and he was lucky in his timing when in paris in 1927 , he asked man ray how he could get some of the photographs in which eugene atget had recorded paris as a motionless and almost unpopulated dream city levy at that time regarded photography as the supreme expression of our epoch , and atget as its great old master , by then barely alive easy , said man ray atget lives just up the road go and knock on his door atget at that time did not have many requests for his work , and he was delighted to see levy he lived as if walled up among thousands of his photographs , and he was ready \( according to levy s memoirs \) to sell him prints for 40 cents apiece when levy opened his gallery at 602 madison avenue in november 1931 , it was at first devoted almost entirely to photography as a high art very few people at that time wanted to pay real money for a photograph , but within a year , levy had presented everyone nadar and atget in 19thcentury paris , americans from paul strand , alfred stieglitz and clarence john laughlin to walker evans and berenice abbott , and an elite born or based in europe that included man ray , laszlo moholynagy and henri cartierbresson \( who made his american debut with julien levy \) this initial obsession with the camera could have overbalanced the present show , which in point of fact comes in many guises and succeeds in nearly all of them it was therefore an inspiration on the part of the curators to divide the available space with the curved inner wall that levy had had in his gallery no one before had ever shown works of art on a wall that snaked its way along the middle of the room , but levy is said to have liked it for two reasons first , the curve reminded him of the shape of a painter s palette second , it allowed him to make the images follow one another with the effect of a cinematic narrative as a result , the present show takes on an intimate character if works whisper to us , we can hear what they say furthermore , they have for the moment our entire attention , as distinct from the sliding glance that a long flat wall often encourages the subject matter may change in a flash from photographs to paintings and collages , or from surrealist objects to newspaper cartoons , or from stage designs to plans for photomurals as big as a house , and onward to the books and magazines that made magic in paris in the 1920 s and 1930 s \( the iconography of chess is not forgotten , either \) it could feel jumpy , but the transitions give us a smooth ride multitudinous as the choices may be , they literally hang together as the products of a single highly energized fancy at a time when the honor roll of living artists was still being tabulated , levy got in early with one after another among them almost all of them had links of some kind or another with surrealism levy showed sculptures by giacometti in 1935 , when they started at 100 \( nothing was sold \) he also showed max ernst , dali , de chirico and magritte when no one else in new york was making a fuss over them sometimes the paintings were monumental by the standards of the day ernst s stolen mirror \( 1941 \) shows him in his most imperious form the tramway of 1946 , by the belgian painter paul delvaux , has a grand , stubborn weightiness once we have seen it , the brussels tramways will never look the same again with new artists , levy had phenomenal luck a nondescript young man who hung around at his first show turned out to be joseph cornell , a softspoken magician who was before long to make some of the most memorable objects among them the portrait of levy in the present show that luck \( or that superior insight \) continued a young american painter , dorothea tanning , said of levy in the 1940 s that his temperament gave him the air of an extraterrestrial emissary , fascinated and amazed by everything he saw and heard and read the offbeat , the occult , the enigmatic , the happenedon treasure of the day and we can see from tanning s haunting portrait deirdre \( 1940 \) , with the subject s stately features and shock of hair \( made of sharppointed evergreens \) , that he knew how to find someone whose vision was entirely her own levy was also a passionate enthusiast for the movies in this , as in all else , he cut a wide swath the present show includes a twohour loop of experimental silent films , mainly sponsored by levy himself in some of these , ernst and others take part at a far extreme from these are the two original sketches from the walt disney studios at the time when snow white and the seven dwarfs was in production levy also presented avantgarde movies in the gallery among them were leger s ballet mecanique , duchamp s anemic cinema and un chien andalou by dali and bunuel none of these movies would have been made without input from surrealism some of the works by minor surrealists in this show now look both feeble and contrived but when we bend over the microcosmographies of ernst in this show , we marvel that so much that has aged not at all could be packed into so small an image so it may well be , in the end , that levy s adventures in surrealism were the ones that have lasted best certainly the museum of modern art s survey of fantastic art , dada , surrealism in 1936 can be read as a careful replay of levy s more headlong forays levy closed the gallery in 1949 , shortly after the suicide of his close friend arshile gorky for an original and heartfelt estimate of levy , i recommend the brief memoir by norman mailer that is part of the catalogue \( due out soon from the mit press \) julien was not an easy man to love , he writes but i think i have some real love for him , because he had one gift he gave you he was a terribly stingy , quirky , odd , offbeat man in about every way but one which is that he had wonders to offer levy did have those wonders , in abundance , and many of them are in this show julien levy portrait of an art gallery remains at the equitable gallery , 787 seventh avenue , at 51st street , manhattan , through oct 31 photo dorothea tanning s deirdre \( 1940 \) , at the julien levy exhibition \( equitable gallery \)
washington , oct 5 almost every member of the house judiciary committee paid some tribute to the constitution and the founding fathers today many said portentously that their debates and votes would be remembered for generations the muse of history was obviously working overtime true , it was only the third time that presidential impeachment has been formally considered on capitol hill but only in that limited sense was the approval of a fullscale impeachment process historic it was by no means decisive , no matter how much the legislators huffed and puffed this was only a first step along a rocky road whose length is not known not by president clinton , not by the public and not even by committee members \( although the chairman , representative henry j hyde , republican of illinois , said this weekend that he hoped the house of representatives could finish its work before year s end \) the constitution provides our compass , said representative edward a pease , republican of indiana i intend to follow it but neither he nor his colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point meeting in the same room where richard m nixon s fate was sealed a quartercentury ago , republicans stressed parallels to that era this case is about lawbreaking , they said , and not about illicit sex to which representative john conyers jr of michigan , the committee s senior democrat , retorted this is not about watergate it is about an extramarital affair that is the fault line , so far unbridgeable , between the two parties people in washington universally assume that the house as a whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee s decision the republicans have the votes to prevail but if only republicans support the procedural plans set out by their leadership , as was the case in the final vote tonight , the decision will be seen by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition that next rollcall will help set the tone for what lies ahead if only a halfdozen democrats join the republicans , the image of trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will begin under something of a cloud if 50 or 75 do so , the vote will confer a greater degree of legitimacy the more the average voter thinks that the republicans are ganging up on the president , his strategists believe , the better his chances of surviving of course , consensus or something approaching it may develop later only well into the final stages of the committee s 1974 hearings on the impeachment of nixon did significant numbers of republican members join the democrats in concluding that nixon had committed impeachable offenses the fact that they finally did led people on both sides to judge its actions fair in the other case of presidential impeachment , andrew johnson survived a senate trial because just enough members of the opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him once this week s votes have been taken , attention will shift to the midterm elections on nov 3 the conventional wisdom in washington has shifted rapidly in recent days , from a belief in the days before the release of kenneth w starr s report that changes would be minimal , especially in the house , to a suspicion that democratic losses would be large , which took hold in the days before the tape of president clinton s grand jury testimony was released now there is a growing conviction that the republicans erred by releasing the tape , creating a backlash that could help marginal house democrats two caveats seem in order , however while the president s troubles seem less likely to influence senate races , democrats were in big trouble in those without any drag from washington a number of independent analysts see republican gains of four to six seats major losses in the house are still possible , too , perhaps 20 or more seats if republican voters turn out en masse and democrats do not differential turnouts are n't really very common , you know , said a senior republican senator on capitol hill but this year , democratic voters seem to be in a sulk , and the republicans act like they 'd turn out even if it snowed on election day big gains might embolden republican legislators in their pursuit of president clinton but the political terrain is tricky after november , both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate larger , spread more broadly across the economic scale , and less intensely partisan and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of the republicans in congress the detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry , and how it is developed , will have an impact as well unshakeable as the preconceptions of many committee members sounded today , experience suggests that over a long period , some of them and some others in the house will change their minds if president clinton and monica s lewinsky are called as witnesses , their deportment will certainly influence some representatives how they and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well mr clinton is a formidable persuader , and any attempt to break down his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would sense disrespect for the presidency a foreign crisis a genuine foreign crisis , as opposed to one that the administration would be suspected of inventing could radically change the context of the inquiry , too republicans might find themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chief from important security responsibilities and what of the topics other than ms lewinsky that mr starr has investigated \? mr hyde insisted tonight that the independent counsel was still pursuing the original whitewater matter and other controversies one of the committee s ranking democrats , representative barney frank of massachusetts , insisted that no more would be forthcoming from mr starr ambiguity keeps the pot boiling wrapping up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the house inquiry all of those ideas , all of those possibilities will be in the air as the house debates impeachment in november and december depending on how they coalesce , the republican leadership might or might not be receptive to a compromise , either before a committee vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment , before ratification by the house as a whole at any time , of course , mr clinton could change his mind and decide to resign nixon s decision to quit came after the committee had voted but it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence more than the vote itself , plus the belief he could not win in the senate mr clinton s aides say he would rather be a second andrew johnson , surviving in the senate by a tiny margin , than a second richard nixon as things now stand , he would appear to have a good chance of getting the 34 votes he would need \( onethird of the total plus one \) to win a senate trial but that is not chiseled in stone , either the republicans could have 60 seats by the time the case reached the senate in that case , if they lost none of their own partisans , a switch of only seven democrats would doom mr clinton a remote possibility , certainly , but then so much of what has happened so far in this case seemed highly improbable until it happened
one minute before 8 on thursday evening , 9yearold melissa morgan was sitting on the floor of a walmart in brick , nj , crowded together with 200 other keyedup children , waiting to scramble for balloons with prizes inside two minutes later , she was sprawled on her face as adults trampled on her and the other youngsters , desperately grabbing for balloons like the dozens of other children hurt , she emerged scratched and bruised , but without serious injuries people were going crazy , melissa said i was squished and thrown down somebody stepped on my foot and i could n't get up it was like being in a movie a really bad movie it was really scary there was blood all over the floor the event was supposed to promote the store s toy department and raise money for the children s specialized hospital in nearby mountainside about 300 adults and children were charged 2 each to take part children ages 3 to 12 were directed to a small , ropedoff area of floor near the front of the store , said jason shepherd , a brick police officer parents and teenagers surrounded the area tarpaulins holding the 500 balloons each with a slip of paper redeemable for a prize were suspended above the crowd of children at the signal , children were supposed to pop balloons with their hands the prizes were discounts on toys , gift certificates and a twominute buying spree in the toy department as the balloons fell , older children , then parents , were pushing to get to them , said lieut douglas kinney of the brick police department it touched off a little stampede kind of thing but it was over quickly , said officer shepherd when he arrived , 10 minutes after the kickoff signal , he said the melee had ended parents were trying to comfort sobbing children , or hauling them out of the store , or snapping at employees forty children with scratches , bruises and minor head injuries were treated and released at local hospitals , said joni schultz , a spokeswoman for the medical center of ocean county firstaid workers who set up medical stations at the walmart treated dozens more children who were kicked , clawed and trampled one 3yearold girl was briefly knocked unconscious she was released from brick hospital after a cat scan showed that she was not injured , ms schultz said starla weiss , who took four children , said that parents were in there popping balloons , and children were shoved into one big pile mothers were screaming 'my son ! my daughter ! ' she said , as they hunted for their children one heroic woman , she said , was literally pulling children out , one by one , picking them up and leading them to safety mrs weiss s 3yearold son , dylan , had claw marks on his shoulders and arms , she said his brother zachary , 5 , was scratched and sobbing because he did not win a prize walmart stores inc issued a statement yesterday saying that it regretted the injuries and was grateful none were serious store managers said they would try to contact all the customers who left their names with store employees cheryl morgan , melissa s mother , said a manager called and offered her toy coupons walmart has also offered to refund the 2 admission fee but yesterday afternoon , most customers wanted the money to go to the children s hospital , said joseph herron , the manager of the walmart at least one brick child had a fine time despite the incident danielle luttenberger , 10 , won the grand prize the 2minute shopping spree but when she and her mother arrived at the store yesterday morning , they were told of a change she was given one shopping cart and allowed to take as long as she pleased to fill it under the circumstances , said an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity , we thought it would be better not to force her to rush
san diego , nov 30 this is how confident the denver broncos are cornerback darrien gordon was san diego s no 1 draft pick in 1993 and spent four years with the chargers before signing with the broncos as a free agent he came home on sunday , and in one of the best singlegame performances by a defensive back this season , he had three tackles , two interceptions , three passes knocked down and one fumble recovery most players would take the shy role after the game , playing down their performance , not wanting to attract attention to themselves gordon did the opposite , maybe because , deep down , he knows this team is unstoppable and it really does not matter what he says this is my house , gordon said , pointing to qualcomm stadium , home of the chargers i built this house coach mike shanahan usually scripts denver s opening 12 to 15 offensive plays on the broncos' first possession in their 3116 bashing of the chargers , quarterback john elway fumbled the snap the turnover was converted into a san diego field goal the chargers had momentum the record crowd of 66 , 523 was on its feet the stomach of most coaches might tighten up in a knot and those scripted plays would be tossed into the garbage but shanahan kept his cool he stuck to the script next possession , ed mccaffrey had a 15yard touchdown catch the possession after that , mccaffrey had a 37yard touchdown catch denver took back control of the game mike never loses his head , broncos defensive end neil smith said that s the biggest reason why we 're 120 twelve victories , no losses and , with four regularseason games to play , history is knocking at the door but if denver goes on to win all its remaining games , will the chargers game , one of the ugliest of the year , hurt the broncos' chances for being considered the greatest team ever \? one view is that the broncos are so good , they were able to overcome a first half in which elway threw three interceptions and the chargers outgained the broncos in total offense , 194 yards to 152 did you see every game the dolphins played \? the denver owner pat bowlen asked , referring to the 1972 miami team that went undefeated if at the end of the year we 're 190 , there s no reason you would n't consider this team one of the better teams in history , if not the greatest all great teams have bad games , but they find a way to win chargers coach june jones said i believe they are a very good football team maybe as good as i 've looked at offensively in the 20 years i 've been around the league the other view is that professional football has become so diluted , with 30 teams , that any potential denver claim to being the best will be weakened the chargers , who missed at least six starters because of injuries , are composed of some players who only months ago were playing football in europe they started a quarterback in craig whelihan who was 07 as a starter last season , and they still outgained denver , 367 yards to 322 , and limited running back terrell davis to 74 yards on 24 carries they 're beatable , said whelihan , whose five interceptions were the most by a chargers quarterback since dan fouts threw five in 1986 against the giants the chargers may have had the best chance to knock off denver because the broncos were not at their best this was the night to beat them , chargers general manager bobby beathard said denver has games at home against kansas city , at the giants , at miami and at home against seattle the only team with a winning record remaining on the broncos' schedule is 84 miami none of those teams have the offensive firepower to keep up with the broncos , who have outscored opponents in the first quarter , 13123 , and have a variety of weapons if elway is having a bad day , he can hand the ball off to davis if davis is slowed , elway can look for tight end shannon sharpe if sharpe is covered , there are wide receivers mccaffrey and rod smith , two pro bowl players the broncos were very good , chargers defensive back charles dimry said i think they 'll go 160 to close out the regular season
game of the week 49ers 72 falcons 72 it s time to start taking these falcons seriously the team is off to its best start ever and is 124 in the past 16 games and has won 7 of past 8 against the nfc west here is the dangerous part for the falcons the 49ers always dominate them san francisco has won 5 straight and has scored 30 or more points in 11 of the past 13 games against atlanta normally , this would be just another blowout of the hapless falcons but the 49ers are reeling their offensive line is in shambles and young is still aching from an abdomen injury quarterback chris chandler , the nfc s fourthranked passer , throws for 350 yards against a terrible 49er pass defense falcons , 2823 sunday 1 pm jets \( 63 \) at indianapolis \( 18 \) after the jets beat the bills last week , bill parcells started his campaign of disinformation with his players the colts are a good team quarterback peyton manning is playing well this team should n't be taken lightly wrong , wrong , wrong the colts are a bad team , manning has a bright future but has thrown 18 interceptions , and the colts should be taken lightly the jets are clearly the better team as they demonstrated by blowing out indianapolis early in the season , 446 this time around , curtis martin has one of those 28carry , 150yard and 2 touchdown days six of the past 8 games have been decided by 8 points or less , but this is a blowout jets , 3513 cincinnati \( 27 \) at minnesota \( 81 \) this is one of those trap games for the vikings under coach bruce coslet , the bengals have always been strong finishers in 1995 , they ended the year 42 the following season the bengals finished 62 and last year 72 if there were a secondhalfoftheseason championship , the bengals would win it every year of course , vikings coach dennis green has mentioned to his players how well cincinnati plays late in the year now , it s just a matter of whether his players will listen randall cunningham gets the start and the vikings squeak by vikings , 3029 miami \( 63 \) at carolina \( 18 \) the panthers have kept games close because of quarterback steve beuerlein , who is third in the nfc with a 917 rating his completion ratio of 65 percent leads the league maybe the best thing that happened to the panthers was kerry collins s being released this game has upset written all over it , especially since kevin greene , who leads the nfl in sacks with 13 , likes going against top teams the dolphins are 1811 in first meetings against a franchise , but carolina wins because of a steady beuerlein and because greene will get at least two sacks panthers , 1714 new england \( 54 \) at buffalo \( 54 \) playing in buffalo does n't scare new england the team has won 3 of the past 4 games there and seems to relish playing in front of the hostile bills crowd basically , the loser of this game is out of the division title race , and it will come down to the winner of the patriotsbills game , the jets and the dolphins it s hard to figure this patriots team , since it got blown out last week at home by atlanta but they know how vital this game is , and the league is starting to figure out doug flutie new england wins a big one on the road patriots , 1814 philadelphia \( 27 \) at washington \( 18 \) the eagles are beginning to build a little momentum the team has been recently propelled by defensive end hugh douglas , the former jet who was cast off to philadelphia because he did n't get along with bill parcells he has a careerhigh 11 sacks , 33 in the past 49 games that s impressive there is no reason to think he wo n't add a few more sacks against the redskins the game is almost guaranteed to be close , with 13 of the past 14 decided by 7 points or less , including the last two in washington by 3 points or less player to watch darrell green , who has nine interceptions against the eagles , tied for most against any team eagles , 1512 pittsburgh \( 63 \) at tennessee \( 54 \) this promises to be one of the most bruising games of the year these two teams met two weeks ago and running back eddie george embarrassed a good pittsburgh defense by running for 153 yards and 1 touchdown in the nfl , there are few times when one team bashes another and then two weeks later does it again if quarterback kordell stewart has finally shaken off his problems running the offense , which it seemed like against green bay last monday night , then the steelers will get revenge steelers , 2117 sunday 1 pm st louis \( 36 \) at new orleans \( 45 \) kerry collins gets the start , and his chance to save his career begins he 'll have more help with the saints than he did in carolina new orleans' defense is playing well the last time these teams met , the saints recorded six sacks and defensive end joe johnson had a 5yard fumble recovery for a touchdown quarterback tony banks throws three interceptions and collins actually has a solid game saints , 147 sunday 4 pm baltimore \( 36 \) at san diego \( 36 \) you know a team is in a desperate state when it benches the franchise quarterback , ryan leaf , for a backup that last year was 07 , craig whelihan the saving grace for san diego has been the defense the chargers have given up just 254 yards a game , especially impressive since the team has n't led the nfl in defense since 1965 chargers , 2017 green bay \( 63 \) at giants \( 36 \)
san diego , oct 19 the homefield advantage in yankee stadium is loud fans chanting colorful phrases and occasionally dropping objects in the vicinity of opposing players at qualcomm stadium , the advantage might be knowing the difference between the foul lines and the yard lines the field here at qualcomm , used for a national football league chargers game on sunday , will be in poor condition for game 3 of the world series on tuesday night , barring an overnight makeover riding the wave of their victories in the first two games , the yankees will send david cone to the mound against san diego s sterling hitchcock , with an opportunity to assume total control of the series but the fielders behind cone may find the footing tenuous as seen from above , that portion of the playing surface used for football extending from the wall in rightcenter field to third base is worn and sandy , in spite of the frantic efforts to quickly convert the stadium from footballfriendly to suitable for baseball a strong scent of wet dirt emanated from the field as the yankees worked out today manager joe torre and brian cashman , the team s general manager , walked through the infield and into the outfield while their club worked out , and cashman returned with eyebrows raised there s a lot of paint and not much grass in the outfield , cashman said , but there s nothing you can do about it i'm sure they did the best they could referring to a charger linebacker , cashman added a couple of spots they can say junior seau fell on it 'll be the same for both teams but it really is n't the same now , with the yankees holding a twogame lead in the fourofsevengame series of the 44 previous teams that won the first two games of the world series , 33 went on to win the title and none of those teams had as much regularseason success as the yankees , who won 114 games before the playoffs tony gwynn , san diego s allstar right fielder , watched as the yankees' hitters patiently and deliberately wore out the padres starters kevin brown and andy ashby in games 1 and 2 gwynn is sure the padres can come back , once they stop making mistakes and start doing what we do that said , gwynn said the yankees are as good a team as i 've seen , to be honest he added the thing that impresses you the most is their ability to go up there and just work a pitcher they 're not swinging at anything they 're not chasing anything there have only been two atbats when i can remember anybody chasing a bad pitch , and last night was one of them , when derek jeter chased a breaking ball their defense has been good , their pitching has been good they 've hit some long balls but to me , if you look at them , if you can keep knoblauch off base , that s important , because he sets the table chuck knoblauch , the yankees' leadoff hitter , opened game 2 with an eightpitch plate appearance and drew a walk , setting up a threerun rally he has four hits , two walks and three runs scored , and he hit a gametying threerun homer in game 1 knoblauch noted today that the yankees have several players with significant experience batting leadoff , who know how to take that approach to working a pitcher knoblauch has been a leadoff hitter virtually his entire career , jeter batted leadoff last season , tim raines hit leadoff for most of his tenure in the majors , and chili davis who has two hits and three walks batted first early in his career the yankees have scored nine runs in each of their last three games , and during the postseason have outscored the opposition , 5430 the yankees have drawn 55 postseason walks , their opponents 26 they will try to maintain this approach against hitchcock , a former yankee who has developed a nasty splitfinger fastball that tends to dive away from righthanded batters as it nears home plate hitchcock is 30 with a 113 earned run average in the postseason , with manager bruce bochy being careful to pull him from games before opposing hitters get a good feel for his stuff the yankees will try to keep from chasing his splitfinger pitch out of the strike zone and instead force hitchcock to throw his fastball , which can be exploited \( hitchcock , hampered by the same flulike symptoms that have bothered many of the san diego players , said today that he felt fine and was suffering only minor congestion \) the lefthandedhitting yankee rookie ricky ledee has four hits in six atbats in the world series , with two walks , but he will probably be replaced by shane spencer in left field spencer , who grew up in the san diego area and played at nearby granite hills high , is a righthanded hitter who was very hot until going 1 for 10 in the american league championship series because the designated hitter is not used in games played at national league sites in the world series , davis will be out of the lineup , though torre has left open the possibility that davis could enter late in a game as a first baseman or left fielder bochy has not officially anointed a starting pitcher for game 4 on wednesday , but with the padres in dire circumstances , it figures that he will go with his ace , kevin brown that way , if san diego forces a game 7 , brown can pitch again photo paul o'neill during a workout yesterday at qualcomm stadium , whose field was damaged by a football game \( associated press \)
the florida marlins and the los angeles dodgers agreed last night to an unprecedented swap of nearly 100 million in contracts in a sevenplayer deal that included mike piazza and gary sheffield the marlins , who in the off season jettisoned 20 million in payroll and 12 players from their world series championship team , continued their payroll purge by agreeing to give the dodgers sheffield , bobby bonilla , charles johnson , jim eisenreich and a minor league pitcher to be named for piazza and todd zeile the deal was made late thursday night , contingent on the acceptance of the trade by sheffield , who has a notrade provision in his 61 million contract sheffield , an underachieving 29yearold outfielder , approved the trade last night there was no immediate announcement on what inducement the dodgers gave sheffield to gain his approval never has there been a trade involving the amount of money covered in the players' contracts , which in total add to 115 million and which have 98 million left to pay , including this season two baseball lawyers said sheffield wanted additional money to make up for the difference in state income taxes florida has none other baseball people said sheffield wanted the dodgers to guarantee the option year in his contract , which would pay him 11 million in 2004 by making the trade , the marlins will have lopped another 94 million from their payroll , reducing it to 24 million , the sixth lowest in the major leagues last year the marlins had the fifth highest the payroll , however , most likely will go even lower because the marlins are expected to turn around and trade piazza and probably zeile before long piazza , a hardhitting , poorcatching star , could wind up with the yankees , the baltimore orioles , the anaheim angels or one or two other teams he has an 8 million salary this year but can be a free agent at the end of the season the dodgers traded him because they do not want to give him the 100 million or so he wants piazza , 29 , rejected their sixyear offer for between 80 million and 85 million one baseball official said he heard the yankees were interested in acquiring piazza from the marlins i never say never on anything , brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , said , but i am not in any talks about piazza that is not to say george steinbrenner is n't the owner did not return a call seeking comment when another owner was asked if he thought steinbrenner would trade for piazza , given his pending freeagent status and his asking price , he said yes , sir if i know george , he 'll give plenty to get him , especially if he hears peter angelos is interested angelos owns the baltimore orioles , who have fallen well behind the yankees in the american league east standing orioles officials felt , at least initially , that their team was not a good fit for piazza , but they said it was something they planned to discuss when joe torre , the yankees' manager , was asked about piazza , he said i do n't see us changing what we 've done catchingwise obviously he s a premier player he could wind up anywhere i like the way our catching stuff is working out the dodgers have their own pennantrace concerns they feel they should be in better position than they are third place , eight games behind divisionleading san diego and they feel the offense of sheffield and bonilla and the defense of johnson , a threetime gold glove catcher , will give them a needed boost into the national league west race johnson should have a hugely positive effect on a pitching staff that has not performed to its capabilities the trade created countrywide discussion among baseball people they were fascinated by the collection of players involved , but some raised a question about the propriety of the marlins' continued effort to shed payroll and established players second baseman craig counsell , shortstop edgar renteria and pitcher livan hernandez are the only starting players who remain from the world series team however , bud selig , the acting commissioner , said he had no problem with the deal given the parameters of the deal and the history of baseball trades , he said by telephone from milwaukee , there s nothing here that quite frankly is different from many other trades of this scope over the last 50 or 75 years according to baseball officials familiar with the mechanics of the trade , it began on a much more minor scale with discussions between the general managers , fred claire of the dodgers and dave dombrowski but it escalated in talks between don smiley , the marlins' president , who heads a group that is buying the club , and chase carey , one of the two fox executives who oversee the dodgers smiley and carey , one executive said , were discussing sports channel florida , which is for sale , when the baseball deal materialized into its present form smiley recently said he wanted to go into next season with a payroll between 12 million and 16 million his plan is to use young players who will grow into a contender in their winter trades , the marlins collected a large number of minor league prospects they hope to add to that collection in eventually trading piazza and zeile photos mike piazza would go to florida in deal bringing gary sheffield , bobby bonilla and charles johnson to the dodgers \( associated press \) \( pg c1 \) bobby

at an october conference called the claims of memory , the novelist cynthia ozick is reported to have said , the aims of the imagination are not the aims of history these words come to mind in the case of the nobel peace laureate rigoberta menchu a new book by the anthropologist david stoll now refutes a number of claims in ms menchu s widely celebrated memoir , i , rigoberta menchu , published in 1983 these include her assertions that the adversaries in her family s land disputes were wealthy landowners of european extraction , that she witnessed mass executions by burning , and that , as a young woman , she worked as a laborer and political organizer the question this case raises is how best to serve the aims of history for the most part , the crimes ms menchu reported , including widespread political murder and torture , were real crimes , even if she learned of some of them from others the struggle to which ms menchu has devoted herself asserting the rights of indigenous peoples is a struggle in which most of her immediate family died and for which she herself has suffered the criminal oppression of indigenous peoples in guatemala cannot be disputed , nor can the impact of her example why , then , the sinking feeling upon learning that some of the essential facts in i , rigoberta menchu are not true \? in a war between unequals , especially when the more powerful side is rampantly duplicitous , we expect that truth will be on the side of the innocent ms menchu has clearly chosen what might generously be called representative truth , where the sufferings of a people are conflated in the tale of an individual life her achievement has been diminished because she altered the truth , perhaps merely in order to make her story more emblematic that sad fact mitigates none of the crimes committed against guatemalan indians testimony is the people s history , but it is only as powerful as it is true

linden , nj , nov 12 when frank penna was torn awake from a deep sleep on june 16 by gunfire thundering through his house , he knew immediately , he said , that the shots were meant for him nine days earlier , because of megan s law , the authorities had distributed fliers bearing his photograph and address to everyone in the neighborhood , letting them know that 22 years before , mr penna had been convicted of kidnapping and raping two girls , 13 and 15 i knew what it was , said mr penna , who is now 56 , in an interview recently i knew they were after me you saw it coming all the kids had been yelling out at me , coming by and everything it was so loud it was a 45caliber militarystyle weapon the bullets went through four walls none of the five bullets hit mr penna , who lives in a basement apartment of the twostory house where he grew up , and they barely missed his neighbor upstairs , joan bazydlo , 66 , who had been awake watching television but they sent an alarming message to mr penna because of the state law on sex offenders , he was no longer a free man i'm out of prison , he said , but it s like i'm in the big prison now the shooting was the worst case of violence against a paroled sex offender since the 1994 passage of the law , which says the residents of a community have a right to know when a highrisk sex offender lives in their midst on monday , james johnson , 23 , who lived around the corner from mr penna , admitted that he had fired the bullets into mr penna s home , in the hope of frightening him to move out of the neighborhood mr johnson said he had feared for the safety of his 9yearold sister , who lives nearby the law , named for megan kanka , 7 , who was raped and murdered in 1994 by a convicted sex offender who lived next door , was entangled in legal challenges for years only this year did prosecutors begin using a refined version that is viewed as a model because it tries to protect the rights of convicted sex offenders the new version places tight limits on which offenders are identified , who has access to the information and how it may be passed on but the shooting in the city of linden illustrates how the law , even in its revised form , cannot protect sex offenders from acts of violence by neighbors the notification law brought together two men of different generations who had never met but who had grown up in the same workingclass community in union county it has also turned everyone into uneasy neighbors while many of mr penna s neighbors seem to have a liveandletlive attitude toward the paroled convict , many avoid him , and others taunt him mr penna , who returned to his childhood home in 1992 after serving 16 years for his crime , lived a relatively quiet existence until earlier this year now , he is consumed by bitterness and anger at prosecutors and the news media i'm the victim here , mr penna said my whole neighborhood is too , and so is my family mr penna says he spends his days mostly indoors , watching television and collecting material for a book he wants to write , not about his crime , but about the effects of the notification law on his life he fears the streets because he is still a target of anger about a week ago , when he was driving home , he stopped at a traffic light to turn onto his street a couple of kids were standing on the corner drinking , he said they yelled out , 'child molester ! ' it hurts stupid kids they 're just wild they just want to start trouble i just hope i do n't get into more trouble i just play like i do n't hear it and i go on my way it s not as bad as it was before when pressed , mr penna acknowledges that his troubles began with his original crime the girls were hitchhiking , he said we picked them up , me and another fellow they went home and told their parents they came home late and made up a story he is reminded that the girls were minors i was a lot younger then , too , he said \( he was in his early 30 s \) i used to drink and do drugs , too he does not offer the explanation up as an excuse , necessarily , and he is not adamant about denying any guilt mostly , he is just weary of having to talk about it it was a long time ago , he said mr penna knew earlier this year that the fliers were going to be distributed while he was convicted only once of rape charges he also has a misdemeanor for lewdness on his record , he says he was put on a list of highrisk sex offenders , arrived at through a point system that takes into account how close he lives to a school and the age of the victims he and a lawyer went to court to fight the distribution of the flier , but they lost some neighbors who live near both mr penna and mr johnson , and the parents of children who attend the school directly across the street from mr penna s house , say that although in general they believe that the law is a good one , they think mr penna has a right to be left alone because he has never bothered anyone else , as far as they know
washington , may 27 the financial panic that struck russia today had distinctly russian causes the government cannot collect taxes , it suffers from an economy that is nearly moribund and it has an untested new economic team but in washington the russian crisis looks very much like the next phase of the asian crisis in fact , the two are related in recent days , as president suharto was being toppled in indonesia , the yen was falling in tokyo and workers were striking in south korea against longdelayed layoffs , investors began to fear that asia s troubles were far from over and could easily spread to other emerging markets in that atmosphere , a senior american official said today , russia is particularly vulnerable like indonesia , it has a rocky banking system like south korea last november , it is seeing its foreign currency reserves dwindling to alarming levels russia s foreign debt of 145 billion is not huge as a percentage of its economy , but lenders around the world are clearly unwilling to put more on the line and while the economic plan put together by prime minister sergei kiriyenko has impressed american officials , no one yet knows whether the 35yearold handpicked by president boris n yeltsin has the clout to turn reform into reality russia is facing substantial financial strains , arising from a combination of factors , a senior treasury official said today but he tried to dampen speculation that it was about to suffer an asianstyle meltdown , suggesting that moscow might rise to the challenge much as brazil did last fall when it appeared to be in danger of catching the asian flu he may be right russia s recent economic history has been a series of narrow escapes after flirtations with disaster it has repeatedly gone to the brink , requiring assistance from the international monetary fund but if its economy requires massive help anytime soon , it is not clear where the assistance might come from pinned down in asia , the international monetary fund the world s lender of last resort says it is strapped for cash the monetary fund estimates that it has only 10 billion to 15 billion easily available to fight another national meltdown congress has declined so far to commit 16 billion more to the fund , and until washington acts , other governments refuse to increase their contributions so if russia s troubles deepen , the imf s remaining reserves could prove insufficient to support the russian currency and help the country meet its debt payments after all , south korea needed a bailout package that totaled more than 50 billion from the fund and other sources , though only a fraction of that has been spent so far and its economy is far healthier and more developed than russia s clinton administration officials insisted today that they had not discussed using american funds to help the russians out , even with the kind of backup financing offered to indonesia and korea instead , the americans are offering plenty of private advice and public encouragement designed to calm the markets deputy treasury secretary lawrence h summers visited mr kiriyenko 10 days ago , and the state department spokesman , james p rubin , said today that washington was confident that the russian government was capable of leading the economy in a direction of successful economic growth but unlike washington , the world s currency traders and investors do not dwell on russia s strategic importance or its nuclear capabilities they are interested in hard evidence that the country can pay its debts and these days , they have a lot of reason for doubt declining oil prices have cut into the country s revenues and prevented russia from getting the price it wanted at the auction of the last big governmentowned oil company the outlook has worsened with disturbances triggered by coal miners and with the government s inability to force profitable companies to pay their taxes while none of those problems are particularly new , the revival of the asian crisis which makes investors nervous about any emerging market is creating a bad case of economic contagion the markets are just waking up to the fact that the asian crisis is far from over , and in some places it is getting worse , kenneth courtis , the chief economist for deutsche bank , said recently , before russia s problems took center stage people just pull their horns in they are much more attuned to risk than they were even a few months ago the connections are more than psychological among the heaviest investors in russia were the south koreans , who lent to the country and began to build factories there as part of their strategy of isolating north korea from its onetime ally now , with the south korean stock market at an 11year low and south korean manufacturers cutting back around the world , that source has dried up once there was hope that japan would see russia as an enormous opportunity , within sight of its northern islands but with japanese banks reeling and the japanese currency in rapid decline , there is little hope that japan will help anyone but itself so for russia , the next few days are critical its decision to jack up the interest rate paid by its central bank to more than 150 percent was meant to send a message that russia will defend the ruble but it cannot afford to pay such rates for long it must somehow convince investors that mr kiriyenko s reform plan to cut spending and raise revenues is about to become reality otherwise , russia could suffer the fate of many of asia s highflyers

the typical family moving to westchester considers many factors before choosing where to live there are the taxes , of course , the caliber of the school district , the safety of the streets and perhaps the length of the commute but how many parents consider the quality of emergency medical care \? most parents presume that every ambulance and each community hospital is equipped to handle a serious pediatric emergency this presumption may not necessarily be correct , according to a group of pediatricians who have joined to improve emergency care for children dr norma dreyfus , a pediatrician in larchmont , offered the following scenario a mother is in the park with her 4yearold son , who is playing with a small ball suddenly he is choking and gasping for breath , the ball having lodged in his throat the mother tries the heimlich maneuver , but it is ineffective the child becomes pale and limp and is no longer breathing luckily , the park is across the street from a hospital the mother runs with her child to the emergency room , assuming that her child will soon be all right the assumption is made that once in an emergency department , proper help is at hand , dr dreyfus said but this assumption may or may not be correct in this case , the doctors look into the child s mouth and see what looks like a multicolored jawbreaker they try to remove it only to push it farther down the airway if and i repeat if the emergency department has the proper size equipment and if it has professionals who are trained to treat children , your child may have a chance remember the minutes without oxygen are ticking away your child is unconscious , blue and limp in the situation dr dreyfus described , the emergency room was staffed with a doctor and nurse who were trained in advanced pediatric life support further , they have the pediatricsize medical equipment on hand to remove the small ball they reach for the childsize laryngoscope and mcgill forceps and remove the foreign object , dr dreyfus continued but he still does n't breathe remember , this hospital staff has been trained properly and is wellversed in airway management and its consequences for the pediatric patient the team knows to bag and mask him and after a few minutes he sits up none the worse for wear now take a moment to think of the alternative an emergency department prepared with neither the knowledge or equipment to care for your child dr dreyfus , along with eight other doctors in the county , is working on paces , a project of the local chapter of the american academy of pediatrics paces is an acronym for pediatric areawide coordinated emergency services the project is the first phase of a national effort to establish emergency medical services for children , a federally financed initiative meant to insure that children with serious injuries or illnesses will have access to services that offer them the best chance of survival the plan is based on the concept that a critically injured child s survival depends on several factors first , at each level of care , beginning with the ambulance service , professionals need to be trained in pediatric emergencies second , equipment of the right size needs to be available , both in ambulances and emergency rooms third , coordination is necessary at all levels of care for instance , if a child is taken to a community hospital with an injury beyond the scope of the hospital , after the child is stabilized , there should be a procedure for immediate consultation and transportation to a center with more advanced treatment you do n't expect every hospital to be a tertiary care center , or even right below that level , said dr joli yuknek , director of pediatric emergency medicine at the westchester medical center in valhalla and a member of the committee but you do want some policy to expedite things because time is of the essence what we do n't want to happen is , 'oh , gee , i have this sick kid we need to transfer to another place ok now who should i call , where s the phone number \? ' then you get the operator , she transfers you to some other place we want a policy where you call hospital a , and the system is activated to transport that child one of the goals of the committee is to see that every hospital in the county with an emergency room meets the minimum standards of the american academy of pediatrics for an emergency department approved for pediatrics the criteria cover basic staffing , training , equipment , supplies , policies and procedures for treating pediatric emergencies hospitals that meet the standards will be given a logo to display showing their compliance just as with the safe house program , this will alert the community to havens where their seriously ill or injured children will have a greater chance for a positive outcome , dr dreyfus said to encourage education in caring for sick or injured children , the group is also acting as a clearinghouse for educational courses on pediatric advanced life support and has put together a calendar on classes in the hudson valley for emergency medical technicians , pediatricians and hospital emergency departments
to the sports editor i did not like the letter written by derek sherman \( mailbox , aug 9 \) it is typical of much of the derisive , surfacescratchingonly drivel chasing coach john thompson and georgetown around the country let me give you some facts and some logic , not sherman s misrepresentations in his first 13 years as georgetown s coach , thompson was 297107 for a 735 winning percentage the second 13 years 292126 \( 699 \) he has reached three final fours and three championship games , winning one of them in the last 13 years , georgetown has reached the final eight three times \( 1987 , '89 , '96 \) , not once , as sherman claims sherman discusses talent next he mentions mourning and mutombo and smith and williams and wingate and iverson how about turner , tucker , tate , edwards , harrison , harrell , myles , bell , butler , et al \? those are some of the ones who wrecked the integrity , the chemistry , the planning , the teamwork of those they left behind do n't talk to me about talent and plenty of it and the failure to reach the final four , unless you 're prepared to talk about the quitters maybe they would n't study much of it comes down to that , does n't it \? they just could n't hack it no excuses i just want performance on and off the court that is what life is about sherman talks about player conduct and brings up victor page , kenny brunner , ed sheffey and allen iverson page , pure and simple , was not a student he flunked out is it that big a deal \? as for attacking another player while in the pros , nothing like this happened while page was at georgetown sheffey when he was caught speeding \( and marijuana was in the car \) , coach thompson immediately pulled the kid s scholarship you take responsibility for your actions at georgetown brunner \? he was at georgetown for five months , and he transferred out to jerry tarkanian at fresno state need i say more \? maybe sherman s most deceitful diatribe is about iverson , a kid whose biggest shortcoming may be his ability or inability to choose friends because iverson has had some offcourt problems in the pros , sherman draws the conclusion that players are not receiving effective guidance during or after their stays at georgetown sherman concludes that you end up with a picture of inner city kids used for their athletic skills , and then dumped back into the world that statement flies in the face of everything thompson has stood for sherman has chosen a couple of players who have had some problems , and he has painted the entire program as being tainted by doing so , he has flaunted history and reality coach thompson has given opportunity where none existed , to some who never knew the meaning of the word he has created hope and understanding he has protected and shielded and taught , and there is n't a soul in the world who has come in contact with him who is n't better off for it frederic charles wagner 3d pleasantville , ny
prosecutors have charged the owners of two fuel oil companies with defrauding taxpayers out of 65 million by pumping air instead of heating oil into more than 500 cityowned buildings from 1993 to 1995 investigators said some city inspectors who were supposed to verify the deliveries took bribes from the companies as part of the scheme edward j kuriansky , the commissioner of the city s department of investigation , said officials ignored warning signs of the fraud , like the two companies' exceptional offer to provide heating oil to the city at 10 cents below its wholesale cost the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , said yesterday that the two companies had their trucks mix oil and air , allowing them to claim that they had delivered more gallons of heating oil to some buildings than the buildings' boilers could hold or possible burn in a winter the companies , now defunct , also pretended to deliver oil to buildings with broken boilers and then sold the excess fuel to other companies , investigators said the two brooklyn companies , capitol fuel oil transportation corporation and sheffield fuel oil corporation , also pretended to compete with each other when they were actually colluding on bids and sharing employees , officials said in fact , the companies were owned by the same two men , michael spadaro and michael taromina , officials said prosecutors charged mr spadaro , the president of capitol , and mr taromina , the president of sheffield , and 14 employees of the two companies with enterprise corruption , conspiracy , grand larceny , falsifying business records and violating state antitrust laws mr morgenthau said the owners and employees of the companies face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges , enterprise corruption and grand larceny by the end of what mr kuriansky called the massive , massive fraud , the two companies had tricked city officials into paying 65 million for 142 million gallons of heating oil they never delivered the amount of fuel carried on a large supertanker finally , mother nature was the one who tipped us off to the scheme by producing a warm winter in 19941995 , mr kuriansky said auditors for the department of general services said the billings from capitol and sheffield seemed enormously high the city inspectors who are said to have taken bribes are also under investigation , prosecutors said , although none have been charged city officials ended contracts with the two companies at the end of 1995 and it was later discovered that as much as 25 percent of their delivery claims were false investigators said they do not believe other firms are carrying out such schemes the investigators also said it was unlikely that the two accused companies used the scheme to defraud private landlords because landlords would be more likely to notice the difference between the deliveries and their tanks' capacity the cityowned buildings involved were fivestory walkups located mostly in upper manhattan , officials said the city s department of housing preservation and development took ownership of the buildings when their landlords defaulted on tax payments the scheme was highly lucrative for both the company s owners and drivers , investigators said the two owners , mr taromina and mr spadaro , received at least 500 , 000 in cash payments , officials said drivers of the trucks were given 10 cents in cash for every gallon of heating oil they could falsely claim to have delivered to the city buildings , increasing their yearly income by 25 , 000 to 90 , 000 mr kuriansky said his office would recommend that the city become more aggressive when inspecting fuel oil deliveries and that superintendents be trained to monitor them in the fraud case he described , mr kuriansky said the companies were careful not to arouse suspicion by being attentive to the buildings , never allowing them to run out of fuel they were very clever , he said they always made sure that the buildings had enough oil
the yankees will play anaheim in shea stadium at 12 05 pm today , and they will be the home team they will wear home pinstripes , but they will inhabit the visitors' dugout if you have tickets for a game in the bronx today , they will be honored in queens such is the confusion wrought by the 500pound expansion joint that fell through the underside of the upper deck at yankee stadium on monday the stadium is closed until city inspectors say otherwise , and the yankees , the most famous team in baseball , do not have a home for now as of last night , they did not know where their next series , beginning friday against detroit , would be played like high school kids traveling to play crosscity rivals , the yankees will dress in their home locker room at yankee stadium today then , in full uniform , the players will board buses and head across town to shea stadium , the first of three departing at 7 am it s a huge distraction , there s no two ways about it , said david cone , one of several yankees who used to call shea stadium home mel stottlemyre , the pitching coach , was once the mets' pitching coach darryl strawberry was the right fielder of the mets' team that won the world series in 1986 manager joe torre managed the mets from 197781 it will be better to be in the thirdbase dugout , torre joked , because he did not have much success in the firstbase dugout the yankees , hampered by rain for the first week of the season and losers of their first three games , have won their last five now this our pitching staff is affected our whole team is affected , cone said the timing could n't be worse tickets for the game that was supposed to be played in yankee stadium today can be used at shea stadium , for what officials hope will be comparable seating , based on charts that they have produced box seats at yankee stadium will translate into box seats at shea , and so on tickets from the games that were canceled on monday and yesterday may be used today if seating is available fan information will be available at gates a , e and c at shea approximately 1 , 600 yankee stadium parking passes will be honored at shea the mets hold the lease to shea , but david howard , a mets vice president , said his team is not charging the yankees rent the yankees will borrow the visitors' clubhouse , having acquired the permission of the chicago cubs , who are currently playing the mets in a threegame series the angels will use the old jets locker room and the firstbase dugout bob sheppard , the voice of yankee stadium , will be the public address announcer david wells will pitch for the yankees , ken hill for anaheim today s game was initially scheduled for 1 pm , but the mets , concerned about a long or extrainning yankees game , asked that the start time be moved back an hour the mets also have asked about a possible curfew of 4 30 , to give them time to prepare for their own game against chicago at 7 40 pm , but have received no assurances that will be enforced according to one american league official , there is a 5050 chance the city will not endorse the safety of yankee stadium in time for the team s weekend series against detroit that starts friday if not , the threegame series will probably be played at shea stadium another baseball official familiar the schedule shuffling said the yankees are trying to avoid any more games at shea they would prefer moving the games to tiger stadium , flipflopping home series with detroit , with the yankees then playing host to the tigers on april 2426 but the al official said there was no compelling reason for the tigers to agree to a switch that would inconvenience their own fans last night , the tigers' public relations department released a twosentence statement on the matter we expect to know tomorrow the status of this weekend s games at this point , we have not been asked by the league to move the games to tiger stadium phyllis merhige , senior vice president for the al , said her office has not received a final report from building inspectors we certainly have reason to think the weekend series might be in jeopardy , she said a number of alternatives are being considered it could be very difficult for the tigers , but they are trying hard to be cooperative yesterday at the stadium , the yankees played an exhibition game of four and a half innings against norwich , their class aa affiliate , primarily for the benefit of pitchers hideki irabu and willie banks irabu was supposed to pitch against anaheim yesterday banks has been ill and has not thrown since the first day of the season irabu , pitching against norwich , struck out nine in five innings , allowing two hits , three walks and a run , starting very sluggishly and improving in his last three innings using a new curveball adapted in a workout last weekend , he had a better breaking ball irabu refused to speak with reporters afterward banks pitched four innings against the yankees , giving up seven hits , five walks and seven runs irabu will start sunday against detroit , in yankee stadium or tiger stadium or shea someplace there is a lot of speculation over what this is going to do to our team , cone said none of it is good maybe in the long run this will bring us closer , but right now , those questions are kind of tough to answer photos the crowd came out to shea stadium for the metscubs game last night , but the yankees and manager joe torre , right , had to settle for a few innings of practice against their class aa team in a deserted yankee stadium \( vic delucia the new york times \( chang

auction houses have been trampling on the turf of dealers for some time now , what with sotheby s and christie s buying up art galleries and increasing their private treaty sales \( selling art , that is , without putting it on the block \) at the same time , the houses have been tiptoeing on museum and publishing territory , mounting museumstyle exhibitions and producing lavish books , besides the standard catalogues here s the latest from feb 17 through march 1 , christie s will put on view an exhibition of cuttingedge art from the late 1960 s and early 1970 s at both its park avenue showrooms and its annex at 308 east 59th street in manhattan but the auction house says none of the art is for sale yet indeed , interested buyers may be somewhat perplexed there will be no price list , which galleries always offer clients , nor will there be the estimates traditionally provided but there will be a fancy color catalogue , painting object film concept works from the herbig collection , designed by takaaki matsumoto , a manhattanbased designer , and for sale for 45 a scholarly catalogue , it is meant to look more like a museum publication than an auction house production , with essays by experts and art historians neither prices nor a possible sale are mentioned anywhere neal meltzer , the head of christie s contemporary art department , said , things will be sold from this collection in june to kick off the new contemporary art department but exactly which works or how much of the collection will see its way to auction has yet to be determined , mr meltzer added the designer of the park avenue portion of the exhibition is annabel selldorf , the soho architect who has designed several art galleries , including the barbara gladstone gallery in chelsea and jeffrey deitch in soho richard francis , who joined christie s last year after having been the chief curator at the museum of contemporary art in chicago , said , this is intended to be a museumstyle show and a museumstyle catalogue he added , it s what the client wanted the client , barbara herbig , a jewelry designer , is the wife of dr jost herbig , a scientist from cologne who died in 1995 the couple put their collection together over eight years , buying works by artists including georg baselitz , joseph beuys , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard tuttle and bruce nauman while the collection has been on view since the mid1970 s at the museum of contemporary art in kassel , germany , this is the first time it will be out of that country experts believe it is worth around 10 million a christie s official said the company had a financial interest in the property , though no one would discuss the details of christie s arrangement with mrs herbig contemporary art experts say mrs herbig wanted to sell the collection as a whole , offering it to the san francisco museum of modern art a museum spokeswoman said the trustees had explored the possibility of buying the collection but had never made a bid still , experts say the museum did make an offer , but not for as much money as mrs herbig wanted with this exhibition , mr meltzer is out to get attention for his new department , which was created in september and concentrates on works made after 1970 we 're hoping to attract the kind of people who spend their time going to galleries in soho and chelsea , mr meltzer said mr meltzer is also hoping to follow the formula christie s used when it sold the modern and contemporary art put together by the new york collectors victor and sally ganz in november that was a recordbreaking sale , totaling 2065 million for months before the ganz sale , christie s pumped up its marketing efforts it also mounted a museumlike exhibition , though with estimates on the labels , and published a 100 book in addition to an 80 , 210page hardbound catalogue the herbig collection , besides representing a larger group of artists than the ganz collection did , is far more european in taste it includes several paintings by mr baselitz and mr richter there is also a strong showing of early works by mr polke , a r penck and blinky palermo , as well as examples of pieces by mr tuttle , dan flavin , mr nauman and jorg immmendorff it s about a moment in time , mr meltzer said a change at sotheby s kevin bousquette , sotheby s executive vice president and its chief financial officer worldwide , is leaving the company after five years mr bousquette came to sotheby s from wall street , where he had been a limited partner at kohlberg kravis roberts i have invested myself totally in sotheby s , but it s time to go on , he said i want to spend my time pursuing my personal interests mr bousquette follows several other highlevel sotheby s officials who have left the company recently , most notably simon de pury , sotheby s chairman in europe and its star auctioneer mr de pury left in november along with daniella luxembourg , sotheby s chairwoman in switzerland , to form an art investment and advisory company sotheby s sales rise sotheby s also reported its yearend figures this week its worldwide auction sales increased by 15 percent from 16 billion to 184 billion , a figure that excludes its private treaty sales mr bousquette said we had the highest total for impressionist and modern art since 1990 389 million in auction sales we also set an alltime record for old master paintings , a total of 157 million meanwhile , the company posted aftertax profits of 48 million , a 17 percent increase from 1996 , when its profits were 409 million christie s

london , dec 19 the british news media have always been skeptical about the claims of richard tomlinson , the renegade mi6 agent who recently served a brief jail sentence for revealing embarrassing secrets about the security service but this week , the newspapers found mr tomlinson s latest disclosure too good to ignore he said that dominic lawson , the editor of the sunday telegraph , was a british spy the newspapers knew about the charge last weekend , but because of libel laws and the strict official secrets act , none could print mr lawson s name that all conveniently changed on wednesday , when brian sedgemore , a labor member of parliament , rose on the commons floor and said he hoped parliament would investigate mr tomlinson s claims that mr lawson had been recruited as a paid mi6 agent he added that seems a very odd thing it would be very damaging for the press if it were true because they were subject to parliamentary privilege , and therefore not to britain s strict libel laws , mr sedgemore s remarks allowed everyone to rush them into print for his part , mr lawson immediately said in a statement that i am not and never have been an agent , either paid or unpaid , of mi6 or any other government agency whatever mr lawson s relationship with mi6 and he said through an assistant that he had no further comment his rivals at other newspapers were clearly delighted at the chance to torture him in print they have run ample stories chronicling his highsociety connections , his history of printing awkward quotes from people who later protested that they had spoken off the record and his move from a modest house in london to a more expensive one in the country there is everything wrong with an editor becoming part of the security machine , the times of london said in an editorial , calling for an investigation as several of his competitors were only too happy to point out , mr lawson s denial seemed carefully worded perhaps in order to leave him some wiggle room he said he was n't an agent , and i 'll buy that , because i'm sure that means something special , said an editor at a rival newspaper , who spoke on condition of anonymity but , the editor pointed out , that left a lot of other possibilities open including a more informal , symbiotic relationship with mi6 in theory , the charge is not as farfetched as it would seem in the united states in britain , journalists say , the intelligence services have traditionally enjoyed cozy relations with a select group of editors and reporters , who provide sympathetic coverage in exchange for special access and exclusive stories while the days of correspondents leading double lives as paid spies abroad probably vanished at the end of the cold war , journalists say that some of their colleagues occasionally seem a little too close for comfort to mi6 and its sister agency , mi5 people at competing newspapers say they have always had vague suspicions about mr lawson , who was editor of the spectator magazine before he took the sunday telegraph job mr lawson is an ultraestablishment figure whose father , lord lawson of blaby , was margaret thatcher s chancellor of the exchequer , and whose wife , rosa monckton , the managing director of tiffany s in london , was a close friend of diana , princess of wales in particular , they say , a number of articles in the sunday telegraph and spectator during lawson s era have had , at best , dubious provenance for instance , according to the the guardian , two articles in the spectator in 1994 , purporting to be written by a united nations official , were in fact written by an mi6 agent using a false name the pieces , about the bosnian civil war , were widely seen as a chance for the agency to promote its own agenda but mr lawson insisted this week that he did not know who wrote the piece i have no means of knowing if you are right , he told the guardian , which asked him whether the author was indeed an mi6 agent if you are , it is news to me
except for a legal technicality call it a mistake it would all have been settled by now in the closing days of his administration , former county executive andrew p o'rourke had , over the objections of his successor and the board of legislators , pushed through a plan to extend for five years , with a fiveyear option to renew , a contract between westchester county and liberty lines for liberty to continue running the county s buses the matter was approved by the county s threemember board of acquisition and contract , with anthony landi , the commissioner of public works , voting with his boss , mr o'rourke it seemed like a done deal but mr o'rourke s office failed at that early december vote to realize it also needed a formal vote of approval for the leasing of the bulk of the countyowned bus fleet to liberty and by the time this was recognized three weeks later , mr landi had a change of heart about supporting the fast renewal of liberty s contract by then , he had been reappointed public works commissioner by andrew j spano , mr o'rourke s successor as county executive this time mr landi voted against the item , in line with the views of his future boss as a consequence , westchester county is considering various options about what to do when the longstanding contract with liberty lines expires at the end of this year , but the county cannot waste too much time , if new bidding specifications need to be drawn they may have the contract , but we have the buses , mr spano said , adding that the county was reviewing its legal and practical options they include seeing if the renewed contract with liberty can be invalidated , and if so , renegotiating with liberty or putting the contract out to bid to other companies that might deliver comparable service at lower cost even if the liberty contract is negated , the yonkersbased company probably has the inside track to win an extension because of its experience , mr spano and others said jerry a d'amore , president of liberty lines , said he has not heard directly from the county government since the change of administrations but he expressed confidence that liberty would continue as the county s main bus operator we 're very proud of the operation we have , he said this goes back to the 1950 s when liberty put together the company that built this bus system he said that liberty ran an efficient system meanwhile , the county government will proceed to make a decision on whether to buy the liberty lines bus garage on saw mill river road in yonkers , which houses much of the bus fleet , county executive spano said mr o'rourke , as part of his budget package last november , had recommended this action , saying it would save the county about 1 million a year the decision is being put on a fast track , mr spano said the building was financed with the help of industrial development agency bonds , but it belongs to liberty lines the o'rourke administration had negotiated a selling price of about 34 million , mr spano said , adding that he hoped the price could be reduced a large amount of the purchase cost perhaps 26 million might be financed by the state and federal government , he said richard g wishnie , a county legislator from briarcliff manor who is chairman of the budget and appropriations committee , said the board of legislators did not move on the matter in december because it felt pressed for time but , he said , it did feel confident that a lot of money could be saved over the long run by the purchase of the garage under the current arrangement , the county government pays liberty rent for the space to house the buses the county bus fleet the beeline buses includes 350 vehicles liberty lines has been the county s chief provider of bus service since about 1974 under the arrangement , the county buys the buses and liberty leases them for a nominal amount fares collected go toward offsetting costs liberty is guaranteed a certain amount of profit for providing the service eric langeloh , transportation commissioner , said the guaranteed amount in 1998 is 13 million and would be about the same in 1999 , if the contract with liberty is renewed and would include a costofliving increase in future years the county has similar arrangements with three smaller bus companies that serve areas of the county out of liberty s jurisdiction none of the county officials interviewed could say how feasible it was to replace liberty and they all emphasized that they were generally satisfied with the service liberty provides but were just looking to make sure that the county gets the best deal possible i do n't see any downside to looking , commissioner langeloh said we have a healthy system here but with a new administration in , you look closely at the ways you always did things to see if there are some things that should be changed the issue , mr wishnie said , is that legislators had been assured by the o'rourke administration that there would be no renewal proposed in 1997 and were taken by surprise when the former county executive reversed himself you never know unless you put things out for bid , he said liberty may be the best provider the problem has been the process mr spano said he was consulting his legal advisers to see whether the contract renewal with liberty could be abrogated the fiveyear contract has a fiveyear renewal , and if this is interpreted as a 10year contract , it cannot go into effect without approval by the board of legislators , he said other issues revolve around who owns the franchises for the routes the county or liberty \? he added that things were very amicable right now between the county and liberty and they 're doing a good job even if liberty were ultimately selected , he said , it might be that there were some provisions of the contract that the county government would like to have renegotiated the county bus system has about 29 million riders on more than 60 routes under the publicprivate partnership arrangement , the county sets bus fares now 140 and determines routes the county government also buys the buses the county receives state and federal aid for its bus operations based on number of passengers carried , miles of routes and population density the county s 1998 budget projects that the net cost to the county of running the bus system will be 122 million in a separate matter , the county s recent practice of allowing buses to be engulfed in what are called bus wraps advertisements that cover the entire bus has been questioned by one county legislator , louis a mosiello , a republican from yonkers the result is nothing more than an eyesore , he said he called on the county to reexamine its advertising policy commissioner langeloh said that at present only four buses have this kind of advertising , and it generates about 200 , 000 in income photo steve tocci works on beeline bus at maintenance garage in yonkers liberty lines runs

major investment bank and a small brokerage firm have gone under retailers are hurting unemployment is rising , and real estate development , a pillar of the economy , is slowing though some of this is a result of regional collapse , hong kong is being buffeted primarily by a problem of its own making the territory s monetary policy the hong kong dollar is rigidly pegged to the united states dollar at a rate of roughly 78 to 1 , a link that has forestalled currency instability here but has also begun to rattle some sectors of the economy even tung cheehwa , the man chosen by beijing as hong kong s chief executive , acknowledges that maintaining the link is causing problems in the course of defending the linked exchangerate system , mr tung , a former shipping entrepreneur , told the beijingpicked legislature about two weeks ago , the following situations will undoubtedly arise the hong kong dollar interest rate goes up property prices come down the stock market lingers at low levels our tourism is in the doldrums consumer spending sentiment diminishes our economic growth in 1998 will slow down significantly , and our unemployment figures will be on the rise yet mr tung has repeatedly declared that the link with the united states dollar will be maintained at all costs it is vital for us to defend the linked exchange rate , he told the legislators this is a basic policy to maintain the economic stability and prosperity of hong kong likewise , deputy prime minister zhu rongji of china has told visiting officials that beijing will defend not only the value of the chinese currency but also hong kong s decision to preserve its peg to the united states dollar although no one is talking about alternate monetary policies , the ramifications of keeping the peg are evident in the domestic economy mortgage interest rates have already touched 12 percent , making monthly payments more expensive , depressing property prices , raising costs for retailers , dampening the stock market even undermining the value of taxi licenses , which are usually bought with bank loans that now carry sharply higher rates not only has mr leung s cab license slumped in value , but

grand prairie , tex , july 19 not too long ago , marlon st julien was another cleanpants rider in the rundown jock rooms of louisiana s evangeline and delta downs , an afterthought on a secondrate circuit waiting for a break he was young , inexperienced and black he was aware of the rich heritage of 19th century africanamerican jockeys in thoroughbred racing but day after day after day , as he got passed over for mounts and saw how few other africanamericans were riding , he began to wonder what it would take to succeed in a profession dominated by white and latin athletes now , at age 26 , st julien is ready to find out his is a tale of how talent and perseverance sometimes needs a 491 long shot in the very first race at a brandnew texas track to find the winner s circle and stay there two aprils ago , st julien brought home a colt named i are sharp in lone star park at grand prairie s premier stakes his pants have shown the shadows of sweat ever since he won the riding title at this summer s lone star meet , which ended sunday , with a runaway 78 victories worth more than 17 million in purses he is closing in on 1 , 000 career victories with nearly 8 million in purse money despite a slow start in picking up good mounts that seems at odds with the talent he has shown i 've worked hard to become a good rider , st julien said in a recent interview , and i believe the trainers think of me in only that way st julien has already moved his tack to hawthorne and the highprofile chicago circuit at the invitation of the longtime jockey agent harry hacek the hat , as hacek is known , has previously helped move riders such as steve cauthen , alex solis and chris mccarron to the sport s top level the goal is to ride in california , to become one of the best and to ride in the kentucky derby , st julien said the 5foot2inch , 110pound louisiana native is focused on the future , but conscious of the past he rattles off the fact that black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 kentucky derbys that a pair of black 15yearolds are the two youngest jockeys ever to win the race alonzo clayton aboard azra in 1892 and james perkins on halma in 1895 you know about isaac murphy \? how he won three kentucky derbys , two of them back to back \? he asked , referring to the hall of fame rider who won the 1884 , 1890 and 1891 derbys we 've been around for a long time maybe so , but no africanamerican has ridden in the kentucky derby since jess conley in 1911 when asked to name the current crop of black riders , st julien was silent the jockey s guild has 900 registered riders , according to the organization s national manager , john giovanni but race is not specified in the registration process , and giovanni said he could not be sure how many africanamericans are actually riding best guesses are less than 5 percent this much is sure none have made a dent on the rich new york , california and kentucky circuits africanamerican jockeys began disappearing from the race tracks as the last century turned and the economy shifted from agrarian to industrial most were very young and either employees of the farms or former slaves , said phyllis rogers of the keeneland library in lexington , ky , which houses an extensive collection of works about africanamerican riders of that era like a lot of people at that time , they went to the cities for jobs in manufacturing also contributing to the disappearance of africanamerican riders were factors such as the influx of new immigrants and the difficulty of making weight , factors that are still at work today first , it was the germans and irish who began appearing as riders now , jockeys from latin america and the caribbean are major players at tracks across america each generation of americans has gotten bigger , giovanni said it s hard to make the scales we 've seen the latin riders come now we have growth in women riders who do n't have as difficult a time making weight at lone star , a successful secondyear track that is part of the texaslouisianaarkansas circuit , st julien is known as a talented money rider three weeks ago , he powered the texasbred mocha express to an upset , comefrombehindvictory over a talented field which included bob baffert s graded stakes winner , anet to capture the 200 , 000 lone star handicap for st julien , it was the richest victory of his career for many trainers here , it was a sign that the rider who has earned the nickname the saint was n't going to be around much longer larry robideaux , one of lone star s leading trainers , compares st julien to eddie delahoussaye and kent desormeaux , whom he once used as riders before they moved on to bigger tracks he s a strong finisher , robideaux said he can ride a speed horse he listens to instructions he s got the timing , power and soft hands he s the best i 've seen come up in a long time he s ready for california or new york right now st julien was introduced to horse racing as a boy by his mother , cynthia sargent , an elementary school teacher whose brothers owned and raced thoroughbreds in the horsecrazy country around lafayette , la
the most crucial sequence of yesterday s game between the mets and the arizona diamondbacks was also the most confusing sequence , leading manager bobby valentine to complain to the umpires and get ejected and leaving the mets looking dazed then the listless game turned brutally disappointing for the mets because mel rojas made an appearance the mets were sleepwalking to their second straight loss to an expansion team , which was depressing enough for them but the events that unfolded in the eighth and ninth innings of their 95 defeat at shea stadium stood out as prominently as mark mcgwire bashing baseballs during batting practice on a high school field the dreary loss left valentine offering a critique of the umpires as he quoted from the rule book on his desk , left rojas cursing himself for giving up five runs for the second time in four days and left the weary mets clinging to a onegame lead over the chicago cubs in the national league wildcard race as they flew to the west coast for nine games in nine days i ca n't complain about it because it s nobody s fault but my own , rojas said it s frustrating we scored five runs and we could have won what can i say about what i did \? it s terrible it was not the way to perform in a wildcard skirmish , especially against an arizona team that could win its next 30 games and still be two games under 500 even valentine , who preaches optimism with every sentence , called the day pretty disappointing tomorrow , it will be forgotten , valentine said today , it s not arizona had a 41 lead in the bottom of the eighth when the mets put runners on first and second but they saw the threat vanish when brian mcrae was called out on a controversial 32 pitch and john olerud was thrown out trying to steal second the plate umpire , greg bonin , initially ruled that mcrae had checked his swing on willie banks s curveball for ball four , which would have loaded the bases and made catcher kelly stinnett s throw to second meaningless but the thirdbase umpire , bill hohn , stepped forward and signaled strike three valentine argued that bonin , who had held up four fingers for a walk , had to ask for help from another umpire to change his call and that help could not be volunteered , as it was in this case in fact , rule 902 \( c \) of the major league baseball rule book states that no umpire shall criticize , seek to reverse or interfere with another umpire s decision unless asked to do so by the umpire making it in this case , with the runners going , stinnett threw first and then appealed to hohn at third and at that point , hohn made his call , without waiting for bonin replays indicated that mcrae did swing valentine was ejected the moment he left the dugout because , he said bonin told him , he could not argue balls and strikes again , valentine claimed the umpires were wrong , saying that he is supposed to receive a warning a person working in the umpire s room after the game said none were available for comment i thought it was an overzealous decision on his part , said valentine , who had made a risky decision in sending jermaine allensworth from second and the plodding olerud from first mike piazza was on deck as a pinchhitter whether it was right or wrong on the swing , it was n't the proper call at least valentine did not have to witness what happened next he watched on television as rojas started the ninth and was whacked for five runs on a wild pitch , matt williams s massive threerun homer and stinnett s basesempty shot suddenly the score was 91 the fans buried rojas in boos i'm not supposed to give up five runs , rojas said we got four runs in the ninth and we could have won the game or tied it this should n't have happened as rojas mentioned , the mets finally awakened in the ninth and clipped banks for four runs to slice the deficit to 95 and make the afternoon interesting it made it frustrating , too while it is impossible to know what the mets' hitters would have done if rojas had pitched a clean ninth , everyone wondered you just do n't know what would have happened , valentine said i 'd rather it did n't happen let s put it that way i 'd rather go in down three runs than down eight before the controversial play ended the eighth and before rojas s implosion in the ninth , the mets had set themselves up to lose the game anyway they were a mere 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position off the ordinary amaury telemaco , who snapped a threegame losing streak with seven sturdy innings the only time the mets nicked telemaco was when lenny harris and olerud had backtoback doubles in the sixth to make it 41 with men on first and third and two outs , valentine did not insert piazza as a pinchhitter for jorge fabregas and the fans groaned fabregas lined out to left as piazza went unused for the second time in four days i do n't know what s going on , rojas said now i 've given up 10 runs the last two times it s terrible i'm not helping the team inside pitch jay bell hit a tworun homer , a runscoring triple and a double off the mets' masato yoshii , failing to complete the cycle with a single as he struck out in the seventh and walked in the ninth yoshii yielded four runs in six innings in slipping to 57 arizona s willie banks recorded his first major league save , but saw his clubrecord scoreless streak end at 21 2 3 innings photos manager bobby valentine walking off after being ejected for arguing with an umpire over ballsandstrikes calls bobby valentine , the met manager , arguing with umpire bill hohn yesterday valentine was ejected \( pg c1 \) mets' masato yoshii after giving up a home run to arizona s jay bell yesterday yoshii , whose record dipped to 57 , worked six innings \( photographs by vic delucia the new york times \) \( pg c2 \)
