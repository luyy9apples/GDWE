latest in the long , long line of controversies we were n't really expecting the right to bear arms at the republican national convention a petition calling on the republicans to allow people to carry their pistols when they assemble this july collected more than 50 , 000 signatures rather speedily this week the secret service instantly turned thumbs down the presidential candidates , who are normally so rapturous about all things gunrelated , refused to get involved the author of the petition later that he was just trying to point out that republicans' enthusiasm for weaponry does not necessarily extend to large , potentially rancorous gatherings at which they are personally present this gives us an excellent opportunity to talk about guns and politics there was a time when americans seemed ok with a middleoftheroad approach to guns the public tended to regard them as things you used for hunting or household defense , and favored laws that regulated them accordingly but no more the national rifle association is beginning to run out of places to demand that people be allowed to bring their pistols , having already thrown down the gauntlet on bars , kindergartens , airports and college campuses the theory is that once everybody is armed 24 7 , no matter what bad thing occurs , there will always be good guys on hand to shoot the evildoer in the real world very few people including police officers are skilled enough to aim accurately during a scary emergency but if you want to win the republican presidential nomination , it s important to pretend otherwise after the terrorist mass murders in france , donald trump argued that if only parisian concertgoers had been packing heat , the outcome would have been much different you know what \? if i'm in that room and let s say we have two or five or 40 people with guns , we 're going to do a lot better because there s going to be a shootout , he said two important points here even in the confines of second amendment aficionados , you do n't normally hear the term we 're going to do a lot better because there s going to be a shootout plus , note the suggestion that people would be safer with an armed donald trump in the building trump does not appear to know anything much about firearms do you remember back in january , when he boasted that he could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and i would n't lose voters \? no one took him literally , possibly because no one believed that trump could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and actually hit anything while he says he owns a gun , when asked if he ever uses it , he replied , none of your business mainly , he brags that his sons are crack hunters , and you can see the proof of that if you google donald trump jr and dead elephant tail do you think hillary clinton could beat trump at a firing range \? clinton actually meets the basic political standard for marksmanship , which involves being in possession of one anecdote about having gone hunting and shot a bird hers goes back to her days in arkansas when she was with a group of friends who did n't believe she knew how to handle a gun , then watched as she downed a duck on the first try the deadfowl tradition is sort of silly , but it does hark back to the good old days when people thought about shooting in terms of sport and scaring off burglars clinton has been talking a lot about gun regulation lately , because it s one of the very few issues on which she can attack bernie sanders from the left sanders , who appears to have no personal interest in guns whatsoever , has been historically weak when it comes to voting on things like background checks their debate would be much more useful if it carried on into the general election but it wo n't the sad truth is that democrats do n't believe gun control is a winning issue and the republicans are so completely in bed with the nra , the mattress is buckling the one candidate in this year s race who actually has some skill as a marksman is ted cruz he shot two pheasants while campaigning in iowa , which is perfectly reasonable he also carried out the tradition that calls for ambitious rightwing politicians to put on camouflage and face paint and go hunting with someone from duck dynasty , which is really embarrassing but if you want to know where cruz stands on a reasoned approach to handling weapons , i suggest you take a look at the video in which he demonstrates how to cook bacon by wrapping it around the barrel of an assault rifle \( mmmm , \) the mantra is pretty straightforward nobody wants to think about armed convention delegates but otherwise guns belong everywhere tomorrow morning , brew the coffee and shoot the breakfast

mahmoud jibril cleared customs at le bourget airport and sped into paris , the american secretary of state had been waiting for hours but this was not a meeting hillary clinton could cancel their encounter could decide whether america was again going to war in the throes of the , was facing a furious revolt by libyans determined to end his quixotic 42year rule the dictator s forces were approaching benghazi , the crucible of the rebellion , and threatening a blood bath france and britain were urging the united states to join them in a military campaign to halt colonel qaddafi s troops , and now the , too , was calling for action president obama was deeply wary of another military venture in a muslim country most of his senior advisers were telling him to stay out still , he dispatched mrs clinton to sound out mr jibril , a leader of the libyan opposition their on march 14 , 2011 , would be the first chance for a top american official to get a sense of whom , exactly , the united states was being asked to support in her suite at the westin , she and mr jibril , a political scientist with a doctorate from the university of pittsburgh , spoke at length about the fastmoving military situation in libya but mrs clinton was clearly also thinking about iraq , and its hard lessons for american intervention did the opposition s really represent the whole of a deeply divided country , or just one region \? what if colonel qaddafi quit , fled or was killed did they have a plan for what came next \? she was asking every question you could imagine , mr jibril recalled mrs clinton was won over opposition leaders said all the right things about supporting democracy and inclusivity and building libyan institutions , providing some hope that we might be able to pull this off , said philip h gordon , one of her assistant secretaries they gave us what we wanted to hear and you do want to believe her conviction would be critical in persuading mr obama to join allies in bombing colonel qaddafi s forces in fact , mr obama s defense secretary , robert m gates , would later say that in a 5149 decision , it was mrs clinton s support that put the ambivalent president over the line the consequences would be more farreaching than anyone imagined , leaving libya a failed state and a terrorist haven , a place where the direst answers to mrs clinton s questions have come to pass this is the story of how a woman whose senate vote for the iraq war may have doomed her first presidential campaign nonetheless doubled down and pushed for military action in another muslim country as she once again seeks the white house , campaigning in part on her experience as the nation s chief diplomat , an examination of the intervention she championed shows her at what was arguably her moment of greatest influence as secretary of state it is a working portrait rich with evidence of what kind of president she might be , and especially of her expansive approach to the signal foreignpolicy conundrum of today whether , when and how the united states should wield its military power in syria and elsewhere in the middle east from the earliest days of the libya debate , mrs clinton was a diligent student and unrelenting inquisitor , absorbing fat briefing books , inviting dissenting views from subordinates , studying foreign counterparts to learn how to win them over she was a pragmatist , willing to improvise to try the bankshot solution but above all , in the view of many who have watched her up close , her record on libya illustrates how , facing a nationalsecurity or foreignpolicy quandary , she was inclined to act in marked contrast to mr obama s more reticent approach annemarie slaughter , her director of policy planning at the state department , notes that in conversation and in her memoir , mrs clinton repeatedly speaks of wanting to be caught trying in other words , she would rather be criticized for what she has done than for having done nothing at all she s very careful and reflective , ms slaughter said but when the choice is between action and inaction , and you 've got risks in either direction , which you often do , she 'd rather be caught trying the new york times s examination of the intervention offers a detailed accounting of how mrs clinton s deep belief in america s power to do good in the world ran aground in a tribal country with no functioning government , rival factions and a staggering quantity of arms the times interviewed more than 50 american , libyan and european officials , including many of the principal actors virtually all agreed to comment on the record they expressed regret , frustration and in some cases bewilderment about what went wrong and what might have been done differently was the mistake the decision to intervene in the first place , or the mission creep from protecting civilians to ousting a dictator , or the failure to send a peacekeeping force in the aftermath \? mrs clinton declined to be interviewed but in public , she has said it is too soon to tell how things will turn out in libya and has called for a more interventionist approach in syria libya s descent into chaos began with a rushed decision to go to war , made in what one top official called a shadow of uncertainty as to colonel qaddafi s intentions the mission inexorably evolved even as mrs clinton foresaw some of the hazards of toppling another middle eastern strongman she pressed for a secret american program that supplied arms to rebel militias , an effort never before confirmed only after and what one american diplomat called the endorphins of revolution faded did it become clear that libya s new leaders were unequal to the task of unifying the country , and that mrs clinton and president obama pointed to as proof of success only deepened libya s divisions now libya , with a population smaller than that of tennessee , poses an outsize security threat to the region and beyond , calling into question whether the intervention prevented a humanitarian catastrophe or merely helped create one of a different kind the looting of colonel qaddafi s vast weapons arsenals during the intervention , empowered terrorist and criminal groups from nigeria to sinai , and destabilized mali , where islamist militants in november and killed 20 people a growing trade in humans has sent a quartermillion refugees north across the mediterranean , with hundreds drowning en route a civil war in libya has left the country with two rival governments , cities in ruins and more than 4 , 000 dead amid that fighting , the islamic state has built its , a redoubt to fall back upon as it is bombed in syria and iraq with the pentagon saying the islamic state s fastgrowing force now numbers between 5 , 000 and 6 , 500 fighters , some of mr obama s top national security aides are in libya on feb 19 , american warplanes hunting a tunisian militant in western libya , killing at least 41 people we had a dream , said mr jibril , who served as libya s first interim prime minister and to be honest with you , we had a golden opportunity to bring this country back to life unfortunately , that dream was shattered on the campaign trail and in relentless congressional investigations , republican critics have used a singular tragedy , the sept 11 , 2012 , on the american diplomatic complex in benghazi , which killed and three other americans , as a hammer against the former secretary of state and while attempts to pin blame on mrs clinton have largely been frustrated , her rival for the democratic presidential nomination , senator bernie sanders of vermont , has seized on her role in the larger narrative of the libyan intervention during a recent debate , he said he feared that secretary clinton is too much into regime change president obama has called failing to do more in libya his biggest foreign policy lesson and g rard araud , the french ambassador to the united nations during the revolution , is deeply troubled by the aftermath of the 2011 intervention the islamic state only 300 miles from europe , a refugee crisis that is a human tragedy as well as a political one and the destabilization of much of west africa you have to make a moral choice a blood bath in benghazi and keeping qaddafi in power , or what is happening now , mr araud said it is a tough question , because now western national interests are very much impacted by what is happening in libya it was late afternoon on march 15 , 2011 , and mr araud had just left the office when his phone rang it was his american counterpart , susan e rice , with a pointed message for a security council vote on a resolution supporting a nofly zone in libya to prevent colonel qaddafi from slaughtering his opponents ms rice was calling to push back , in characteristically salty language she says , and i quote , you are not going to drag us into your shitty war , ' said mr araud , now france s ambassador in washington she said , we 'll be obliged to follow and support you , and we do n't want to' the conversation got tense i answered , france is n't a us subsidiary' it was the obama policy at the time that they did n't want a new arab war in the preceding weeks , a series of highlevel meetings had grappled with the escalating rebellion , and some younger white house aides believed the president should join the international effort but a far more formidable lineup was outspoken against an american commitment , including vice president joseph r biden jr tom donilon , the national security adviser and mr gates , the defense secretary , who did not want to divert american air power or attention away from afghanistan and iraq if the europeans were so worried about libya , they argued , let them take responsibility for its future i think at one point i said , can i finish the two wars i'm already in before you guys go looking for a third one \? ' mr gates recalled colonel qaddafi , he said , was not a threat to us anywhere he was a threat to his own people , and that was about it some senior intelligence officials had deep misgivings about what would happen if colonel qaddafi lost control in recent years , the libyan dictator had begun aiding the united states in its fight against al qaeda in north africa he was a thug in a dangerous neighborhood , said michael t flynn , a retired army lieutenant general who headed the defense intelligence agency at the time but he was keeping order then there was secretary clinton early in mr obama s presidency , she had worked hard to win the trust of the man who had bested her in a tough primary campaign in 2008 , and she sometimes showed anxiety about being cut out of his inner circle \( in one 2009 email , she fretted to aides i heard on the radio that there is a cabinet mtg this am is there \? can i go \? \) mrs clinton had cultivated a close relationship with mr gates both tended to be more hawkish than the president they had raised concerns about how rapidly he wanted to withdraw troops from afghanistan more recently , they had argued that mr obama should not be too hasty in dropping support for hosni mubarak , the embattled egyptian leader , whom mrs clinton had known since her years as the first lady but they had lost out to the younger aides the backbenchers , mr gates called them , who he said argued that in the moral clash of the arab spring , mr president , you 've got to be on the right side of history in libya , mrs clinton had a new opportunity to support the historic change that had just swept out the leaders of its neighbors egypt and tunisia and libya seemed a tantalizingly easy case with just six million people , no sectarian divide and plenty of oil but the debate was handicapped by sketchy intelligence top state department officials were busy trying to evacuate the american embassy , fearing that the libyan leader might use diplomats as hostages there was no inside information on whether , or on what scale , colonel qaddafi would carry out his threats we , the us , did not have a particularly good handle on what was going on inside libya , said derek chollet , a state department aide who moved to the national security council as the libya debate began american officials were relying largely on news reports , he said would later count about 350 protesters killed before the intervention not the thousands described in some media accounts but inside the obama administration , few doubted that colonel qaddafi would do what it took to remain in power of course , he would have lined up the tanks and just gone after folks , said david h petraeus , the retired general and former cia director jake sullivan , mrs clinton s top foreignpolicy aide at state and now in her campaign , said her view was that we have to live in a world of risks in assessing the situation in libya , he said , she did n't know for certain at the time , nor did any of us , what would happen only that it passed a risk threshold that demanded that we look very hard at the response so , after some initial doubts , mrs clinton diverged from the other senior members of the administration the comparison with mr biden was revealing for the vice president , according to antony j blinken , then his national security adviser and now deputy secretary of state , the lesson of iraq was crucial what biden called not the day after , but the decade after what s the plan \? mr blinken continued there is going to be some kind of vacuum , and how s it going to be filled , and what are we doing to fill it \? former secretary of state colin powell s famous adage about iraq if you break it , you own it loomed large more decisive for mrs clinton were two episodes from her husband s presidency the american failure to prevent the in 1994 , and the success , albeit belated , in bringing together an international military coalition to prevent greater bloodshed after 8 , 000 muslims were during the bosnian war the thing about rwanda that s important is it showed the cost of inaction , said james b steinberg , who served as mrs clinton s deputy through july 2011 but i think the reason bosnia and kosovo figured so importantly is they demonstrated there were ways of being effective and there were lessons of what worked and did n't work on the same march afternoon when ambassador rice was telling her french colleague at the united nations to back off , president obama and his security cabinet were arrayed in the white house situation room speaking on the video screen from cairo was secretary clinton , just arrived from paris the day before , at lunch with president nicolas sarkozy of france , she was tough , she was bullish on the idea of intervention in libya the perfect ally , recalled mr sarkozy s senior diplomatic adviser , jeandavid levitte but now mrs clinton did not directly push mr obama to intervene in libya nor did she make an impassioned moral case , according to several people in the room instead , she described mr jibril , the opposition leader , as impressive and reasonable she conveyed her surprise that arab leaders not only supported military action but , in some cases , were willing to participate mostly , though , she warned that the french and british would go ahead with airstrikes on their own , potentially requiring the united states to step in later if things went badly dennis b ross , then a senior middle east expert at the , said he remembered listening to her and thinking , if she s advocating , she s advocating in what i would describe as a fairly clever way he recalled her saying you do n't see what the mood is here , and how this has a kind of momentum of its own and we will be left behind , and we 'll be less capable of shaping this' mrs clinton s account of a unified europeanarab front powerfully influenced mr obama because the president would never have done this thing on our own , said benjamin j rhodes , the deputy national security adviser mr gates , among others , thought mrs clinton s backing decisive mr obama later told him privately in the oval office , he said , that the libya decision was 5149 i 've always thought that hillary s support for the broader mission in libya put the president on the 51 side of the line for a more aggressive approach , mr gates said had the secretaries of state and defense both opposed the war , he and others said , the president s decision might have been politically impossible having decided to act , mr obama questioned military leaders about the effectiveness of a nofly zone , the europeans' favored military response when they told him that it could not prevent a massacre , mr obama directed his staff to draft a new , tougher united nations resolution late that night , mr araud , the french diplomat , was astonished to get a second call from ms rice the united states would not only support intervention , but mr araud said the turnabout had so shocked him and his british counterpart that they at first suspected a trick there remained only one real obstacle russia could block a security council resolution with a veto mrs clinton had done her best to develop a relationship with russia s leader , vladimir v putin , listening to his tales of tagging polar bears and tracking siberian tigers her theory on putin is , this is a person with some passions if you get him going on those passions , your capacity to try and deal with him is improved , one clinton aide said but the relationship remained difficult , and the secretary of state sparred constantly with her russian counterpart , sergey v lavrov , who , mrs clinton wrote in her memoir , was initially dead set against a nofly zone we do n't want another war , she told mr lavrov , stressing that the mission was limited to protecting civilians i take your point about not seeking another war , she recalled him responding but that does n't mean that you wo n't get one in the end , mrs clinton would acknowledge that colonel qaddafi himself had helped win over the russians , by giving a fiery speech just before the security council vote calling his opponents the rats and vowing to hunt them house by house , alley by alley on march 17 , 10 members of the security council authorizing all necessary means to protect libyan civilians five countries , including russia , abstained two days later , mr sarkozy met with mrs clinton and david cameron , the british prime minister , at the lys e palace in paris to discuss the next move the french president emphasized that within a day or so , colonel qaddafi s troops would be inside benghazi , mingling with civilians , making it difficult or impossible to use air power against them then he played his trump card french fighter jets were already in the air , he said but , he added , this is a collective decision , and i will recall them if you want me to , mr levitte said mr sarkozy s maneuver had abruptly pushed forward the timing of the operation , but for all of mrs clinton s irritation , she was not prepared to object i'm not going to be the one to recall the planes and create the massacre in benghazi , she grumbled to an aide and the bombing began about the time the air campaign began , charles r kubic , a retired rear admiral , received a message from a senior libyan military officer proposing militarytomilitary negotiations for a 72hour ceasefire , potentially leading to an arranged exit for colonel qaddafi and his family but after he approached the american military command for africa , admiral kubic said , he was directed to end the talks the orders , he was told , had come from outside the pentagon , though aides to both mr obama and mrs clinton said the offer had never made it to their level he was baffled by the lack of interest in exploring an option he thought might lead to a less bloody transition the question that stays with me is , why did n't you spend 72 hours giving peace a chance \? he said the answer , at least in part , was that the two sides had started from positions of mutual mistrust in the weeks leading up to the intervention , aides to colonel qaddafi had reached out to potential intermediaries , including gen wesley k clark , who served as nato commander under mrs clinton s husband , and tony blair , the former british prime minister and longtime clinton friend diplomats representing the united nations , the and a halfdozen countries discussed the chances , however remote , of a political settlement even the russian multimillionaire who headed the got involved there was envoy proliferation , said mr chollet , who monitored such exchanges from the national security council the americans did not believe that the libyans purporting to speak for the leader could actually deliver a peaceful transfer of power colonel qaddafi , the americans thought , would simply use a ceasefire as an opportunity to regroup my view is that there was never a serious offer from qaddafi to step down from power , said gene a cretz , who preceded mr stevens as the american ambassador in libya i firmly believe that none of those characters around him ever had the gumption to raise the issue with him personally for the libyan leader and his inner circle , episodes like the one admiral kubic described were proof that the americans had no desire to negotiate , said mohamed ismail , a top aide to colonel qaddafi s son seif and frequent envoy to the west they just wanted to get rid of qaddafi , he said the libyans saw the threatened intervention not as a noble act to save lives , as mrs clinton portrayed it , but in far darker terms after all , colonel qaddafi , fearing the fate of saddam hussein , had abandoned his nuclear program and was sharing intelligence with the cia in the fight against al qaeda mrs clinton herself had publicly welcomed one of the leader s sons to the state department in 2009 now colonel qaddafi saw deep treachery , ingratitude and mercantile revenge he railed to anyone who would listen that he was libya s only bulwark against extremism , that without him the country would become a terrorist haven in a further complication , the united nations on protesters to the , so both the leader and his inner circle might face prosecution if he ceded power we were open to power sharing , but the minute that happened it was hard to go forward , mr ismail said a top american diplomat agreed , saying that the threat of prosecution boxed seif into a corner over the years , mr ismail noted , colonel qaddafi had certainly found ways to offend nearly every country now allied against him he had financed political opponents and been accused of plotting the murder of the saudi king and , mr ismail said , he had recently reneged on oil and arms deals with the british and the french then there was lebanon and the matter of the missing shiite cleric back in 1978 , a revered lebanese imam , moussa alsadr , had disappeared while visiting libya lebanon suspected foul play , probably with government involvement but the had never been definitively solved in an interview with the times , mr ismail confirmed the lebanese suspicions we said he left to go to italy , mr ismail said of mr sadr but that was a lie he was killed , mr ismail said , offering a chillingly succinct explanation there was an argument with the leader mr ismail said he had learned of the cleric s fate long after the fact , and stressed that colonel qaddafi s family , including a son now imprisoned in lebanon , had no involvement or knowledge the cleric s body , he said , was thrown into the sea early on , president obama had declared that colonel qaddafi had lost his legitimacy and had to go but the president was careful to point out that this was the administration s political position , not its military objective we are not going to use force to go beyond a welldefined goal , specifically the protection of civilians in libya , he said mrs clinton echoed that five days after the security council resolution was adopted there is nothing in there about getting rid of anybody , she told abc news the president directed the pentagon to use its unique military capabilities to stop the feared massacre and , within 10 days , turn the operation over to european and arab allies an unnamed aide described this approach as leading from behind , handing the president s republican opponents an enduring talking point but mr obama was adamant that libya would not become another protracted american war in fact , his limited goal was achieved far faster than planned we basically destroyed qaddafi s air defenses and stopped the advance of his forces within three days , recalled mr rhodes , the deputy national security adviser but the mission quickly evolved from protecting civilians in benghazi to protecting civilians wherever they were as the rebellion swelled and bystanders became combatants , the endgame became ever more murky the united states and its allies were increasingly drawn to one side of the fighting , without extended debate over what that shift portended i ca n't recall any specific decision that said , well , let s just take him out , ' mr gates said publicly , he said , the fiction was maintained that the goal was limited to disabling colonel qaddafi s command and control in fact , the former defense secretary said , i do n't think there was a day that passed that people did n't hope he would be in one of those command and control centers two of mrs clinton s top libya advisers said in interviews that they had harbored misgivings about the intervention precisely because of fears that the coalition would not be able to stop short of regime change , with no ability to manage the aftermath one was mr gordon , the assistant secretary the other was jeremy shapiro , who handled libya on mrs clinton s policy planning staff mr shapiro said he had expressed his concerns to mrs clinton s top policy aide , mr sullivan once you get into a fight where we basically say , we have to stop a madman from killing tens of thousands of people in his own country , ' how do you stop \? mr shapiro said ultimately the logic becomes , jesus , the qaddafi regime is a real threat to civilians , he added it required nothing to escalate to that it would have required an amazing force of will not to practical military considerations also complicated mr obama s inandout strategy though he had directed that the united states provide only unique capabilities that its allies did not possess , that turned out to be quite a bit a continuing supply of precision munitions , combat search and rescue , and surveillance , mr petraeus said by april , the president had authorized the use of drones , and , according to a senior rebel commander , cia operatives began visiting rebel camps and providing us with intercepts of qaddafi s troop movements the incremental escalation ran against mr obama s instincts , and he did it reluctantly , said mr ross , the former national security council official mrs clinton , he said , was less concerned that every step puts you on a slippery slope her view is , we ca n't fail in this , mr ross said once we have made a decision , we ca n't fail when mr jibril and his libyan entourage showed up in rome in may to meet with mrs clinton , they expected a 10minute checkin instead , they talked for nearly an hour the opposition leaders had already given her a white paper setting out a spectacular future political parties would compete in open elections , a free news media would hold leaders accountable and women s rights would be respected in retrospect , mr jibril acknowledged in an interview , it was a utopian ideal quite detached from libyan reality but mrs clinton had been enthusiastic , according to those in attendance , and now she wanted to talk in greater depth about how to turn the vision into reality she said , and i remember this , let us brainstorm about libya , ' said mahmud shammam , the rebel council s chief spokesman the opposition leaders wanted something more immediate they wanted weapons despite hundreds of coalition airstrikes , the fighting was at a stalemate every time the rebels gained some ground , government forces retook it the rebels seemed unable to get past brega , an oil port on the way to tripoli , and they hoped more sophisticated weapons from the americans would tip the balance the secretary of state heard them out she was very patient , very charming , mr shammam said always had a smile in the end , though , she demurred but back in washington , where a lowgrade panic over the stalled fighting was setting in , mrs clinton pressed the rebels' case , according to three senior white house officials and two state department officials involved in the secret debate the american military involvement that mr obama had hoped to curtail after 10 days had dragged on for months , and political support was waning some over the administration s failure to seek approval after 60 days , as the seemed to require onetime advocates of the intervention , including ms slaughter , the secretary s former policy planning director , had grown disillusioned over the rebels' humanrights abuses we did not try to protect civilians on qaddafi s side , said ms slaughter , who at the time called for a deal in which colonel qaddafi would have turned over power to one of his sons the international coalition that mrs clinton had stitched together was also unraveling russia accused the united states and its allies of a baitandswitch , and the arab league called for a ceasefire and settlement regime change that was not our business at all , amr moussa , who headed the organization at the time , said in an interview there was a moment , around about june or july , recalled mr shapiro , the state department s libya policy adviser , when the situation on the ground seemed to settle into a stalemate and we were n't sure we were winning , or at least winning quickly enough moreover , the united states' strategy of letting other countries arm the opposition was backfiring , creating a regional power imbalance that could come back to haunt libya if the rebels did win throughout the spring , the administration had effectively turned a blind eye as qatar and the united arab emirates supplied the rebels with lethal assistance , according to mr gates and others but mrs clinton had grown increasingly concerned that qatar , in particular , was militias from the city of misurata and select islamist brigades she could hardly tell qatar to stand down if the united states was unwilling to step in with lethal assistance of its own , one state department aide said , because their answer would be , well , those guys need help you 're not doing it' her view , often relayed to her staff , was that to have influence with the fractious opposition and arab allies , you had to have skin in the game , mr ross said former president bill clinton had publicly noted in april 2011 that the united states should not rule out arming the opposition , and in emails with mr sullivan , her policy adviser , mrs clinton discussed using private contractors to do just that mr ross , speaking generally , said she had frequently consulted her husband i 'd say , here s what i think we should do' she 'd say , that s what bill said , too' now mrs clinton took what one top adviser called the activist side of the debate over whether to counter qatar by arming more secular fighters if you did n't , mr ross recalled her arguing , whatever happened , your options would shrink , your influence would shrink , therefore your ability to affect anything there would also shrink but other senior officials were wary nato s supreme allied commander , adm james g stavridis , had told congress of flickers of al qaeda within the opposition mr donilon , mr obama s national security adviser , argued that the administration could not ensure that weapons intended for the socalled good guys , as one state department official put it , did not fall into the hands of islamist extremists in fact , there was reason to worry mr jibril himself described in an interview how a french shipment of missiles and machine guns had gone awry at a june meeting , president sarkozy had agreed to ask our arab friends to supply the transitional national council with the weapons , mr jibril said but , he said , the acting defense minister diverted them to a militia led by abdel hakim belhaj , a militant islamist who had once been held in a secret prison by the cia mrs clinton understood the hazards , but also weighed the costs of not acting , aides said they described her as comfortable with feeling her way through a problem without being certain of the outcome president obama ultimately took her side , according to the administration officials who described the debate after he signed a secret document called a presidential finding , approving a covert operation , a list of approved weaponry was drawn up the shipments arranged by the united states and other western countries generally arrived through the port of benghazi and airports in eastern libya , a libyan rebel commander said humvees , counterbattery radar , tow missiles was the highest end we talked about , one state department official recalled we were definitely giving them lethal assistance we 'd crossed that line prompted in part by the decision to arm the rebels , the state department as the legitimate governing authority for libya mrs clinton announced the decision on july 15 in istanbul that very day , our troops had started to get inside brega , mr shammam recalled we told that to mrs clinton , and she said i remember her smiling good ! this is the only language that qaddafi is understanding' one month later , secretary clinton appeared at the with leon e panetta , who had recently replaced mr gates as defense secretary she hailed the intervention as a case study in smart power for the first time we have a natoarab alliance taking action , you 've got arab countries who are running strike actions , she said this is exactly the kind of world that i want to see where it s not just the united states and everybody is standing on the sidelines while we bear the cost , while we bear the sacrifice mr panetta spoke of a sense that qaddafi s days are numbered six days later , on aug 22 , the cumulative efforts of the international coalition bore fruit when exuberant rebels in tripoli the dictator was still at large , but his reign was over mrs clinton s old friend and political adviser , sidney blumenthal , who regularly emailed her political advice and vaguely sourced intelligence reports on libya , on the dictator s fall brava ! mr blumenthal exclaimed as always , he was thinking about mrs clinton s presidential ambitions you must go on camera you must establish yourself in the historical record at this moment she should be sure to use the phrase successful strategy , he wrote you are vindicated
the news that five young black men were accused of raping a young woman in a brooklyn park in january captivated the city for weeks the defendants were tried and immediately convicted in the court of public opinion but as details emerged , it became clear that they were innocent , and the prosecutor dropped all charges however , the dismissal of charges does not undo the damage to the reputations of the socalled brownsville five , teenagers ages 14 to 18 , including one who is my client because they were tried in adult court , their names were made public and were reported widely in the news media , smearing them for the rest of their lives the incident should prompt a serious public discussion about the need for both sealing laws to help protect the identities of the accused and reform of new york s archaic discovery laws , which deprive defense attorneys of the evidence gathered by the police and the prosecutor new york retains some of the most restrictive discovery laws in the nation broad discovery is standard in other major cities like los angeles , chicago , philadelphia , miami , detroit , boston , denver , seattle , san diego and newark in my client s case , the district attorney s office and other law enforcement agencies had gathered videos from the boys who were arrested and statements from the woman and her father , who was also in the park just before the incident , and witnesses in the neighborhood , all of which cast serious doubt as to the veracity of the allegations but new york law does not require the prosecutor to provide any police reports or other evidence to a person who has been arrested or that person s attorney until a trial actually starts often a year or more after the arrest in this case , between arraignment and dismissal , i received nothing but a scant formal felony complaint listing little more than the allegations before the arrests , news reports accused the five boys of threatening the woman and her father with a gun however , at my client s arraignment , only days after these reports were published , the assistant district attorney made no mention of a gun , probably because the investigation had revealed that the gun allegation made by the father was not credible yet no exculpatory evidence not a single police report or witness statement was ever turned over to me the rules governing discovery do n't simply delay justice they deny it a tiny minority of cases in new york go to trial a vast majority are resolved by either plea or dismissal that means that in almost all criminal cases , defendants never get basic information about their case or even learn whether exculpatory evidence exists without it , clients and their attorneys are forced to make lifechanging decisions , and it is no surprise that innocent people plead guilty to crimes they did not commit since my client s charges were dismissed , he will not be faced with such a decision but the state is not obligated to protect the confidentiality of adolescents charged with a crime and it is not possible to retroactively seal my client s name once it has been published on the internet the need for legislation that would seal the records of all adolescents regardless of whether they are tried in adult or family court until there is a conviction is clear while the criminal case against my client has been dismissed and sealed , his name and picture will forever be associated with these horrible allegations and the stigma of being charged with a sex crime even absent legislation , prosecutors , the police and the media should show restraint and consider the effect of destroying the reputations of youths regardless of whether they are ever convicted while nearly every local media outlet reported the allegations against my client , none of them reported that three of his public school teachers , well aware of the seriousness of the situation , came to night court in a demonstration of support for him and his good character , and ultimately pooled money to help pay his bail after his arrest , he was rejected from an afterschool program in the community and was forced to leave his home to escape the media encampment surrounding it of course , there will also be many consequences in his future , when a simple google search will call up these allegations he can assume loss of opportunities in education , employment , housing and relationships for the rest of his life he is not alone thousands of adolescents are forever linked to allegations and crimes that result in dismissals or no conviction , and those records and characterizations of those records by the media follow them into every aspect of their daily lives by enacting comprehensive sealing statutes and rewriting its regressive discovery laws , new york can protect the innocent , as well as provide a second chance for people who have rehabilitated themselves naming my client and the other boys during the initial public uproar may have been intended to create the appearance that the police and prosecutors were taking the case seriously their innocence should have a greater claim on our conscience
no one , not even , vilified the eastern elite more than he particularly railed against harvard none of them in the cabinet , do you understand \? none of those harvard bastards ! he bellowed at his chief of staff h r haldeman yet when it came time to pick a national security adviser , he chose , a harvard professor who today embodies the east coast foreign policy establishment mr trump s foreignpolicy stance operates on two levels america first isolationism in content , slotted within an ardent antiestablishment , antiexpert frame the two are inextricable in mr trump s world , the foreign policy elite in both parties have forced us into expensive alliances and wars get rid of them , and america will be great again in fact , he has that backward as much as his neoisolationism frightens our allies , it is mr trump s antiestablishment stance that most threatens international security as even nixon recognized , since its emergence as a global power in the late 19th century , america has relied on a highly trained corps of diplomats , worldly financiers and academics to steer it straight get rid of them , as mr trump seems intent on doing , and chaos will follow mr trump s antielite chatter is nothing new on the stump in 1952 , nixon , then s running mate , delighted in referring to the democratic presidential nominee , , a princeton graduate , as an egghead an effeminate intellectual but it was obvious , even then , that this was campaign bluster eisenhower played the genial , folksy man of the people , but his secretaries of state , john foster dulles and christian herter , were prominent members of the council on foreign relations nixon followed suit besides mr kissinger , he tapped william rogers , a wall street lawyer , as secretary of state and elliot richardson , a boston brahmin , as secretary of defense he understood that the world was a complicated place that required experience and expertise , even if it had to come from harvard he knew that to open up communist china and negotiate an arms control treaty with the soviet union , he needed a policy expert and diplomat like mr kissinger of course , the best and the brightest of the 1960s administrations academics like walt rostow and mr kissinger , corporate titans like robert s mcnamara were far from perfect , to put it kindly they bear the blame for vietnam and the 58 , 000 american soldiers who died there , not to mention the millions of vietnamese but they also strengthened a world order balanced precariously on the edge of nuclear war they expanded trade , deepened alliances and underwrote billions in foreign aid none of this was cheap , but they understood as mr trump seems not to that the global stability bought with such efforts is worth far more and contrast the mistakes of the 1960s to times when washington allowed foreign policy to be set by public consensus in the 1930s , congress closed off free trade to protect american industry and listened to voters who wanted a smaller , less costly military with no entangling alliances the results \? the smoothawley tariff contributed to , and the failure of the league of nations allowed the rise of fascism and global war even then , some members of the east coast elite knew better a small group of mostly ivy leaguers met at the century club in new york to work up a semisecret plan to push america toward greater involvement with britain in its stand against hitler president listened and chose henry stimson , a republican wall street lawyer from yale and harvard law school , as his secretary of war later , stimson became a kind of patron saint of the postwar bipartisan foreign policy establishment if america had heeded stimson and his ilk from the beginning and worked harder to build up european alliances before nazi germany became unstoppable , american soldiers might not have needed to fight their way onto the continent fortunately , dalliances with antiestablishment , populist isolationism tend to be shortlived over the years , voters wisely turned away from na ve beckoning to create fortress america , as senator advertised in the early 1950s , or to , george mcgovern s presidential campaign slogan in 1972 and while elite has an obvious antidemocratic meaning , today the foreign policy establishment looks more like the america it guides the eastern establishment was exceedingly insular in eisenhower s day white , male , protestant , preppy but by nixon s time it had loosened up to include mr kissinger , a jewish refugee today s foreign policy establishment is heavily populated by graduates of elite schools , but many of them are minorities and the children and grandchildren of immigrants no doubt , the modern foreign policy establishment can be criticized for stale or lazy thinking , or parochial selfinterest but it still includes many men and women with a sophisticated knowledge of the world to ignore them and their counsel is foolish
it has been five years since syria descended into brutal warfare , and whatever happens with the current talks on its political transition , it is difficult to imagine the country returning to its prewar borders as a unified state indeed , negotiators are beginning to think about something radically different partition speaking before the senate foreign relations committee last month , secretary of state john kerry implied that if the present ceasefire and political negotiations on syria failed , partition could be plan b the russians have openly proposed a federal solution , and , according to a united nations security council diplomat , the idea of a very loose center with a lot of autonomy for different regions is gaining traction among major western powers it is by no means the ideal solution it would mean acquiescing to president bashar alassad s savagery over strident opposition objections , require still more internal displacement by way of sectarian relocation , and perhaps concede territory to the islamic state partition , or a loose confederation , might not even end the civil war and the accompanying humanitarian catastrophe it would notionally leave intact an assadrun statelet against which the islamic state could continue to rally support , and a sunnirun statelet that alawis might seek to undermine more broadly , partition resulting from war has a deservedly dubious reputation in korea and germany , for instance , it has meant the brutal sequestration of large populations and laid tripwires for future major wars in india , it produced a huge demographic rupture and seemingly permanent enmity the partition of vietnam in 1954 proved unsustainably vulnerable in exceptional circumstances , partition can produce relative longterm stability and security in small and isolated populations cyprus has been partitioned for over 40 years , with united nations troops patrolling the green line separating the greek and turkish cypriot portions of the island pending theoretical unification similar stability has held in northern ireland , where the powersharing belfast agreement has helped smooth over residual tensions the formal partition of bosnia under the dayton accords satisfactorily ended a terrible war among the serbs , bosnian muslims , and croats but in all three cases partition was eased by europe s overall peace and stability , the presence of a powerful supranational body in the european union that diluted the significance of putative national sovereignty and , most important , the relative absence of external provocation none of these conditions apply to syria the syrian civil war has occurred in an extraordinarily tough neighborhood the arab league has been unable to ameliorate it it has been stoked by outside parties notably iran and russia on the regime s side , and saudi arabia on the opposition s inclined to treat it as a proxy war and the conflict has been bloodier and its combatants more plentiful and heavily armed than those in cyprus or ireland the only way to make partitioning work in syria is for the outside powers to get involved to agree to an armistice that would freeze the conflict and isolate the islamic state , and to use force under united nations auspices to maintain that armistice , facilitate partition and discourage regional actors from geopolitical meddling that , in turn , would require a large multinational peace enforcement effort , probably with an american nato component alongside arab league troops and possibly russian elements such a force would also have to oversee the relocation of syrians who felt unsafe in their current situations forging that kind of arrangement is no easy task the different powers would have to figure out how to work together , agree to binding personnel and funding commitments , and deal with the inevitable and potentially substantial casualties and it is unlikely that the united states , other nato countries or russia , let alone saudi arabia or turkey , would support a largescale combat deployment to enforce syrian partitioning if that meant actively engaging the islamic state which may not otherwise be containable in a rogue statelet and other jihadists on the ground even if an agreed force could avoid major ground operations against isis and gradually shift to a less muscular peacekeeping role , it would become increasingly brittle other knotty challenges would remain , including contentious negotiations between the regime and the moderate opposition over who got control of which cities the regime would insist on keeping damascus , which would likely mean the mass relocation of sunnis \( the drawback to partitioning iraq 10 years ago was that baghdad s sectarian realignment would have uprooted populations even more traumatically than a dysfunctional unitary state has done organically \) meanwhile , a kurddominated entity would be unacceptable to turkey and would practically have to be scotched to preserve a nato consensus supporting partition a catch22 , and an unfair one , given how hard the kurds have fought finally , syria s partition , at least if it were permanent , would contravene the 1923 lausanne treaty and therefore would itself have to be legally effected by treaty , which is a tougher haul than a mere ad hoc agreement partitioning syria could also spur destabilizing partitionist impulses elsewhere in the middle east the argument for partition or loose confederation rests on the idea that there s no better alternative that it would take diplomatic alchemy to achieve a unitary syria with a powersharing government but diplomacy has never been a science , and the thinking behind partitioning is scarcely less magical given that a unitary state is by far the neater and more desirable alternative , washington should continue to pursue it within the existing framework just because it is n't yet imagineable does n't mean it is n't possible
vinyl is n't the first tv show to fill out its cast of characters with a parade of reallife music stars from the past , for example , which ran on nbc from 2002 to 2005 , was centered on the 1960s era of dick clark s music program , and included modern singers impersonating older ones \( john legend as stevie wonder , usher as marvin gaye , jennifer love hewitt as nancy sinatra \) when a show pulls off this stunt , it can bring the past and the present into a dialogue when it fails , it can feel like one long episode vinyl has n't carved any pumpkins yet , but i worry that the show has a jumbo bag of funsize nestle crunch stashed in the pantry some of the reallife figures in vinyl are just background performers to add verisimilitude so in this week s episode , when richie attends a musicindustry banquet , we get to see actors playing reallife executives while the mc delivers wisecracks neil bogart , he says , tipped a valet with a vial of cocaine the joke is that casablanca records was fueled by white powder ! he introduces berry gordy of motown records with a slur the joke is that the music industry circa 1973 was racist ! also flitting by are the actors playing musicians from the 1950s , punctuating episodes by doing a brief version of one of their hits this week , irving louis lattin as howlin' wolf sings smokestack lightning on a fire escape last week , lance lipinsky as jerry lee lewis did breathless at a piano these songs are the show s oddest stylistic flourishes where most series would be content to play the song on the soundtrack to evoke both a mood and a time in richie s life when his life was simpler , vinyl stages a performance it s not just storytelling for an adhd audience it s a power move , showing how fully hbo has turned on the money spigot for this show this episode also features an appearance by dj kool herc \( played by dominique johnson \) , scratching and mixing records , inventing hiphop if you thought rap music began with rapper s delight in 1979 , the scene might seem anachronistic , given that the show is set in 1973 , but this timeline is basically correct we see a couple of codgers , oblivious to the musical revolution happening in front of them , complaining that kool herc is cutting between records too quickly this may be intended as irony , but it mostly lets audiences congratulate themselves for their superior knowledge when vinyl incorporates real people into the world of the american century record label , they often seem slightly off the show s version of the led zeppelin manager peter grant was furious and destructive , as expected , but the actor ian hart has a slight , wiry build , unlike the bearlike grant , a former bouncer and wrestler whose stature was part of his threat the zep singer robert plant was rendered by zebedee row as surprisingly manic john cameron mitchell s version of andy warhol is engaged with the world around him , not the famously disinterested observer none of these decisions are terrible , but they all seem arbitrary are they based on the personal impressions of one of the executive producers , be it mick jagger , martin scorsese or the showrunner terence winter \? are they all choices made by the individual actors \? or are they conscious efforts at mythpuncturing \? if vinyl were better , the point of view would be clearer the more indistinct a musician s image , the more fun vinyl can have with it take , for example , england dan john ford coley , the yachtrock duo best remembered for their 1976 hit we see them in this studio this week , rerecording their early single simone and boring the hapless junior ar man clark out of his mind the mustachioed duo are earnest and selfcongratulatory , which makes them hilarious that was a good take , coley says after a dullish runthrough is interrupted it had a recklessness to it this portrayal may be spot on or it may be totally unfair , but hardly anybody outside the duo s immediate families will know which in a studio hallway , clark runs into the shockrocker alice cooper and tries to convince him that he should dump his band and join american century as a solo act \( that almost certainly would n't pass muster as a legal maneuver , by the way \) alice cooper , played here by dustin ingram , is exactly the sort of rock star ripe for vinylization he had a no 1 album in 1973 \( billion dollar babies \) and most rock fans can still sing , but he s not the subject of countless books and documentaries , and so the show s creators can indulge some creative license the direction they choose is a shaggydog subplot where alice expresses dissatisfaction with his band , his record company , and his management , and encourages clark to follow him around to wild parties and a golf course where clark finds himself holding alice s beer and carrying his snake eventually , alice humiliates clark in front of his band , announcing that clark had been trying to get alice to dump them clark is wrestled into a guillotine a prop for the group s grand guignol stage show and has a moment of abject terror where he believes he s going to be decapitated it s a fairly sharp portrait of a smart rock star finding new ways to leverage his power and humiliate people but what s alice s motivation \? it turns out that he holds a grudge against richie , because years earlier , when the band was broke and unsigned , they flew out to new york for a meeting with him which richie blew off without an apology so we learn that richie is selfabsorbed and does n't care very much about how his decisions can wreak havoc with the lives of others after four hours of vinyl hammering on those character traits , that s not much of a revelation the aspiring ar rep jamie gets the nasty bits signed to american century , triumphing over the head of ar , who is baffled by their raw sound the authorities find the corpse of buck rogers leaving richie on edge and owing a favor to the associate who helped him dump the body the price signing a dreadful female singer american century s financial difficulties attract the interest of the mobster corrado galasso , who offers richie a bridge loan that pinch means that richie ca n't cut the check his wife , devon \( olivia wilde \) , needs for the renovation of a connecticut barn for a ballet troupe she decides to sell her warhol portrait of herself instead , a choice that brings humiliation instead of victory
at a recent awards ceremony at the kremlin for scientists , artists and public intellectuals , president vladimir v putin of russia could n't help but his country s achievements but he also offered a word of caution we still have a lot of unsolved problems and questions , he said it is certainly no time for us to be dizzy with success' do n't be deceived by such expressions of humility many russians view mr putin as highly successful and the president himself very much agrees his approval rating has reached levels upward of 80 percent for nearly two years , and few , certainly none at a kremlin event , are making a public case for redefining or even amending the notion of what constitutes a moscow leader s success take the economy throughout the years of oildriven growth , economic performance was a measure of success no longer russian officials project that the economy will contract 1 percent to 15 percent this year , provided oil prices stay within the 35 40 range per barrel , after having shrunk 37 percent in 2015 growth is n't expected to arrive until 2017 and only if the price of oil averages 52 or more a barrel , by no means a certainty the news gets worse real incomes are falling for the second year now the country s infrastructure is in terrible shape , while investment is going down for the fourth year in a row people are losing jobs and russia is losing talent but even if some people recognize these things as failures , they are not generally viewed as mr putin s responsibility the outcomes may be unpopular but the decisions that caused them are not his use of the phrase dizzy with success may help explain why every russian knows the slogan it was the headline of an article written by joseph stalin in 1930 for the newspaper pravda , his messenger of choice stalin wrote dizzy with success at the height of his campaign to turn soviet farmers into an agricultural proletariat in less than a year tens of millions of peasants were bayoneted into joining new collective farms those who resisted were arrested or exiled in the year that stalin was writing about success , more than three million peasants were in revolt millions died as a result of deportations or famine the country s agricultural economy never fully recovered , but the leader at the top remained popular even today stalin enjoys a staunch although by no means universal following among my countrymen stalin was asserting that collectivization was a success except for isolated cases of overzealous bureaucracy he took credit for establishing a socialized agriculture in just a few months and shifted blame for the many brutalities involved to local authorities and others many of those people were later arrested and punished my point is not to draw a direct comparison between stalin and mr putin they are very different leaders living in very different times i just cannot help noticing that they seem to follow the same playbook for being a successful autocrat indeed , if there were a secret manual describing the kremlin s art of governance , it would almost certainly include three rules that both men have mastered rule no 1 calls for attributing all victories to oneself regardless of who or what contributed to the perceived success a victory in war won by the people at impossible cost has to be ascribed to the leader prosperity , even if a gift from mother nature or market forces , is an achievement of the ruler rule no 2 failures must be ascribed to subordinates or external forces stalin did n't invent this trick but he perfected it with brutal efficiency he created disaster after disaster , but his associates and subjects just kept admiring , or at least fearing , him rule no 3 is the ability to manipulate what used to be called the party line one day hitler is an enemy , the next a friend , then later an enemy once again one day leftwing forces are the party s enemies , the next day its best friends mr putin has proved adept at all three he took credit for the oildriven economic boom \( rule no 1 \) then when the economy tanked , he has allowed blame to be placed on his ministers , particularly prime minister dmitri a medvedev , or pointed a finger at the west \( rule no 2 \) and he has changed the party line with dizzying agility \( rule no 3 \) one day russia is a businessfriendly economy , the next it is a statist power one day russia is busy integrating with the former soviet republics , the next day it is fighting them one day russia proclaims sovereignty sacred , the next day it annexes crimea , a neighboring country s territory the next day it again proclaims sovereignty sacred , to justify propping up the beleaguered regime of president bashar al assad in syria syria is one of those success stories for which the czar is enjoying credit while others will have to manage the thorny consequences this week secretary of state john kerry heads to moscow this is the altitude at which the czars fly is n't it neat \? this is also how he can stay popular while the nation s economy is going nowhere and this is the flip side of the myth of putin leadership that in some quarters of europe and even the united states , other wouldbe czars seek to emulate
few operatic characters are better equipped to steal scenes than the adolescent page cherubino in mozart s le nozze di figaro a young man ridden by hormones and given gorgeous arias pulsing with sensuality that the role is allotted to a grown woman only increases the opportunities for sophisticated humor and low farce so it came as little surprise that on thursday evening , when richard eyre s of figaro returned to the stage of the with the wonderful again in that role , cherubino ruled ms leonard s lustrous , fullbodied mezzosoprano and her exquisite comic timing seized attention at every turn not that the competition is all that strong in this revival true , , a proven scene stealer himself , portrayed the count compellingly , his rich , solid bassbaritone projecting cleanly , his lustful finagling written on his every oily snoop and gesture , though a stiffer character as the countess , rose to her big arias beautifully but the figures at the center mikhail petrenko as figaro and anita hartig as susanna , his bridetobe were slow to make their presence felt both were more than adequate vocally , and ms hartig took on some personality , but mr petrenko remained rather colorless , often hard to pick out of a crowd rob howell s monumental and fussy set gives the sense of a crowd even where there is none , and of huge public spaces rather than intimate rooms still , mr eyre s direction of the characters , as carried through by the current stage director , jonathon loy , generally works well enough to make human connections robert mcpherson made his met debut as an amusingly bluff don basilio opposite the practiced marcellina of susanne mentzer \( a onetime cherubino \) ashley emerson was touching as barbarina the orchestra sounded in top form with fabio luisi , the met s principal conductor , in charge , revealing unremembered details and previously unnoticed subtleties the players seemed to be sitting just barely on the edges of their seats , ready to pounce on mr luisi s beat , sometimes even anticipating it in the early going the chorus , trained by donald palumbo , was its usual fine self
ross douthat has a wonderfully written , heartfelt takedown of the wsj editorial page , which is surprise ! dead set against any deviation from the taxcutsfortherich agenda definitely worth reading but my question is , did republican reformers like douthat really think there was any chance that their ideas would achieve headway within the party \? if so , they were remarkably naive after all , what is the modern gop \? a simple model that accounts for just about everything you see is that it s an engine designed to harness white resentment on behalf of higher incomes for the donor class what we call the republican establishment is really a network of organizations that represent donor interests because they re supported by donor money these organizations impose ideological purity with a combination of carrots and sticks assured support for politicians and pundits who toe the line , sanctions against anyone who veers from orthodoxy excommunication if you re an independent thinking pundit , a primary challenge from the club for growth if you re an imperfectly reliable politician to a very casual observer , it may look as if this movement infrastructure engages in actual policy analysis and discussion , but that s only a show put on for the media can you even imagine being unsure how a heritage foundation study on any significant issue will come out \? the truth is that the right s policy ideas haven t changed in decades paul ryan s innovative idea on medicare let s replace it with vouchers ! is the same proposal newt gingrich offered in 1995  so why are we seeing a crackup of this system now \? it s not because events have called the orthodoxy into question that has never mattered in the past on the contrary , failed predictions have never caused even the slightest change in claims the same people who predicted that bill clinton s 1993 tax hike would kill jobs and that obamacare would be an economic disaster are making confident predictions about the salutary effects of tax cuts now the problem , instead , seems to be demography an increasingly diverse population means that the party needs to go beyond white resentment , but the resentful whites are having none of it oh , and the base never cared about the ideology just to be clear , democrats aren t angels but the democratic party is a very different kind of arrangement it s a coalition of interest groups none of them are selfless , but the party does in fact try to serve the interests of these groups , more or less it s not the kind of immense exercise in baitandswitch that the gop has become and it can respond to a changing country by changing itself , adapting to the shifting balance of power among its constituent groups oh , and the very pluralism of the democratic system , while it can make the party diffuse and ineffectual , means that there s nothing like the right s unchallengeable orthodoxy , which in turn means that sometimes analysis and evidence can matter but back to the republicans the reformist hope was , i guess , that the donor class itself would realize the need to soften the party s ideology in the face of a changing society but the rightwing rich are different from you and me they can and do surround themselves with people telling them that if only they say the usual things louder if only they run yet another ad accusing donald trump of not being a true conservative they can reestablish the old order remember , it took five presidential defeats 1932 , 1936 , 1940 , 1944 , and the shocker in 1948 before the old gop accepted the legitimacy of the new deal if that s the standard , wouldbe republican reformers might have to wait through two terms of hillary and one of her successor before getting a hearing for now , at least , the reformers have no constituency
arthur , do you remember that old musical number , \? here we are at super tuesday ! voters are dancing across the stage and donald trump is lurking in the wings what do you think \? hi , gail if we 're starting with a lavish musical metaphor , i think that in terms of weirdness it s maybe a little less kiss me , kate and more the rocky horror picture show wow , now that i think of it , did n't rocky horror feature \? that s right actually , let s start with the notweird part hillary clinton s crushing win in south carolina was expected and seems to be putting that race back on the rails for her the democrats are definitely the notheartstopping part of the story there are times when it s smart to be unexciting but the republicans \? with considerable trepidation i 'll offer a little premortem on the race so far last summer , when there were n't any juicy celebrity scandals and only reruns on tv , trump created a huge stir with controversial populist rhetoric much of the media figured out that covering him to the exclusion of almost everything else would ring the cash register like crazy this built a modest plurality of republican support , roughly 30 percent of the 30 percent of voters who are official republicans meanwhile , approximately one million mainstream republicans got into the race , meaning that even though together they outpolled trump individually none could match him so here s the formula a plurality of voters plus an absolute majority of earned media plus a fragmented opposition equals victory i applaud your continued determination to embrace the fragmentation theory , which posits that there are tons of good candidates and sane republican voters out there , they 've just yet to come out and get together i sense you are mildly dubious of my hypothesis but remember , despair is a sin for catholics i do think that there have been some very good republican presidential candidates this year , and that conservatives could have a bright future in congress and in the states , however this election turns out yes , and my next tune will be where have you gone , joe dimaggio \? but substituting jeb bush or george pataki hehehehe simon and garfunkel would be so proud ok , so i gave you my field theory of the republican race what s yours \? what s making this season different \? one thing is social media donald trump was made for a world of twitter and youtube i have a theory that whenever we move on to a new , more open form of communication , there s a period of hysteria in which everybody who s come onstage competes for attention we 'll adjust eventually we always do but in the meantime there are a lot of outrageous claims and personal assaults , made in the loudest voice possible i could tell you stories about the coming of cheaper printing presses and what it did to grover cleveland s sex life although nobody ever really takes me up on that offer well , this is a family newspaper , so you probably should n't go into details although it s hard to pass up a bodiceripper featuring grover cleveland meanwhile , i have to admit that while the republicans are imploding with rage , the democrats are short on juice i appreciate what bernie sanders has brought to the race , but the party s thin on a next generation of national voices it goes deeper than one presidential contest when young liberals think about how they want to change the world , the last thing they think about is running for congress they 're probably more likely to imagine doing a latenight comedy show jon stewart is more of a role model for young liberals than harry reid \? that s crazy talk and hey before we get back to politics , your mention of jon stewart calls up a question i 've always wanted to ask the republican party has been roiled and transformed by angry talk radio there is no equivalent on the democratic side liberals have tried and tried , but they do n't seem to have any talent for yelling into a radio mic it s true , liberals are generally better at murmuring into the mic in dulcet tones all paid for with philanthropy and government subsidy on the other hand , republicans seem to have no aptitude for comedy late night is packed , , with liberals making fun of conservatives nothing on the other side you can argue that this is discrimination of some sort , but i 've always wondered if it speaks to some fundamental difference what do you think \? actually , when you guys are n't watching , we are hilarious interestingly , there is an academic literature hypothesizing that conservatives are humorless stiffs while liberals are superfun here s how one scholar his findings conservatives seek emotional control and cognitive closure compared with liberals , who are comfortable with more abandoned selfexpression and thought processes sounds like a real pageturner , i know no , i think i may be in total agreement my colleague jonah goldberg who is an extremely funny conservative points out that on the subject of latenight comedy , it s true that there are a lot of liberals making fun of conservatives and god knows there s a lot of material to work with but it s notable that there s not so much making fun of liberals which raises the question is there really nothing to mock on the left \? or is that just not quite as safe and fun \? well , i will acknowledge that it s not as much fun one thing we would probably agree on is that people on the extremes of both sides are pretty humorless after all , chris rock who was pretty hard on the hollywood left at the oscars says he does n't like to do campus gigs anymore because students and faculty members are so easily offended by the jokes the three words most often uttered on campus these days that s not funny ! you 're leading us into a much longer topic of discussion i 've always been bemused by the subjects that some people find funny i am thinking now of rape jokes but also the ones sometimes deemed too sensitive for humor at my very first newspaper , a weekly in connecticut , we once ran a picture that had a puppy in a silly pose , and we got tons of complaints a month later we had a similarly dumbbutnotmean picture featuring a baby , and nobody said a word two topics for future weeks , then campus culture and puppy exploitation but back to politics did you watch the republican debate last thursday \? it was like a car accident , where you ca n't stand it but you ca n't look away after months giving him a pass , marco rubio and ted cruz took turns going after trump , mocking and insulting him just like he has been doing to everyone else for months about time probably too late , actually , to change trump s public image while my times colleagues did just break the story on , some of the other stories he was beaten up with the polish workers , trump university have been out there forever you know a lot of republicans answer me this they spend weeks and weeks wringing their hands about donald trump sometimes financing ads against donald trump sometimes begging the remaining candidates to unite behind one guy but never just sending off their minions to do the basic opposition research how come \? simple have you ever been on a subway car where a belligerent guy is screaming at everyone \? the commuters all want something to be done , but no one wants to be the one to make eye contact with him because then they 'll become the focus of his terrible abuse social scientists call this a collective action problem i guarantee you that the clinton campaign wo n't make that mistake no doubt they are already preparing ads featuring working poor people who were laid off from their jobs due to trump s bankruptcies , interspersed with clips of him saying , you 're fired ! and then chris christie pops up and says no , you 're not ! ' that endorsement surprised a lot of people , but jon ward over at yahoo news actually called it a few days earlier , he published that looked back on christie s campaign and wondered whether an endorsement for trump might be brewing apparently the answer was yes i'm betting that if things keep going trump s way you 'll see a lot of establishment republicans wanting to get on board it 'll look like the box office for hamilton or maybe a midnight showing of rocky horror well , it s about time for the final curtain on this conversation super tuesday results , here we come by the way , gail , how many democrats does it take to screw in a light bulb \? that s not funny !

hanover , germany said on sunday that he was confident the united states and the would succeed in negotiating a new transatlantic trade deal by the end of the year , saying the benefits of such an agreement were indisputable mr obama said images of factories moving overseas and lost jobs created a narrative about trade agreements that drives , understandably , a lot of suspicion in places like the united states and but , he added , welldesigned trade deals can have greater benefits it is indisputable that it has made our economy stronger , he said it has made sure that our businesses are the most competitive in the world mr obama spoke while standing next to of germany at a news conference in hanover as they prepared to preside over the opening here of the world s largest  in the evening , mr obama and ms merkel hosted a dinner for 29 chief executives of major american and german companies the president s visit to germany was intended to bolster negotiators seeking to wrap up a trade agreement between the united states and the european union , an accord that ms merkel supports but that is highly unpopular in her country ms merkel is among mr obama s most trusted counterparts , and the president is eager to support her during difficult political times ms merkel has struggled in recent months to confront a surge of migrants and a weakening economy on sunday , she echoed mr obama s enthusiasm for the transatlantic trade deal , using bolder language than is her usual style we should get a move on , the chancellor said we all know the reproaches , worries and fears , and what difficulties remain but if time is used wisely , she said , an agreement that will raise living standards can emerge so my request to those who are present , she added , looking around the audience of hundreds of business leaders and politicians , is do it , and then we can have a great success this year the chancellor greeted the president at the schloss herrenhausen , the former summer residence of the royal house of hanover they stood in front of a line of german troops in gray overcoats and green berets as the national anthems of the two nations played before the two leaders returned inside for a private meeting mr obama said he hoped the trade negotiations could be completed before he left office i do n't anticipate that we will be able to complete ratification of a deal by the end of this year , but i do anticipate that we will have completed the agreement , he said once negotiations are finished , he said , people will be able to see exactly why this will be good for our two countries yet even as he expressed confidence that a deal would be reached this year , mr obama acknowledged that time is not on our side , and he offered a thinly veiled warning that a deal could be doomed if politicians like hillary clinton , who opposes the accord , are elected this year if we do n't complete negotiations this year , then upcoming political transitions in the united states and europe could mean this agreement wo n't be finished for quite some time , mr obama said , not mentioning mrs clinton , his former secretary of state , directly earlier , mr obama s commerce secretary , penny pritzker , told an audience of 350 business leaders , we must ask ourselves what is the cost of delay \? now is the time for usgerman leadership , she said yet germans often veer between admiration and scorn of the united states rarely was that more clear than in the contrasting ways that two groups prepared to greet mr obama here this weekend undeterred by the scandal caused by from its diesel vehicles in the united states , germany s exportdriven businesses showed off their wares in eager anticipation of the fair s opening on sunday and the first visit to this city by a sitting american president mr obama helped open the fair mr obama kindled good will with an unusually glowing appraisal of ms merkel , telling germany s bestselling newspaper , , that he was proud to call her a friend in particular , he praised ms merkel s real political and moral leadership in welcoming more than a last year none of that impressed the tens of thousands of protesters who gathered in hanover s opera square on saturday their goal , as proclaimed in hundreds of banners and chants , was to topple the trade deal , the transatlantic trade and investment partnership germany depends on exports for its wealth and on the united states for its security yet many germans do not see the trade agreement as a good thing monica orth , 54 , a therapist for teenagers who lives in bonn , is one of many here who see the trade pact as a plot by big businesses often american ones to lower consumer standards , bypass national justice systems and undermine europe s way of life i do n't want and bayer to determine which seeds i eat , ms orth said as two friends nodded in agreement , she added , democracy is a really valuable thing , and i do n't want big business to take that from me at least a dozen other protesters who were interviewed echoed her words all accused corporations like monsanto the american biotechnology corporation reviled by some for using genetically modified seeds that it says help battle disease or the german pharmaceutical company bayer of trying to force on them products they do not want in a way , these germans should be a source of american pride , fierce believers in the democratic creed that the western allies spread after the defeat of the nazis yet popular sentiment in germany often turns against the united states , which , though admired for its liberty and technical prowess , is also mistrusted by many for its commercial and military dominance antiamericanism plays a certain role in the opposition to the trade accord , said christian bluth , a researcher at bertelsmann stiftung , a german research institute that recently commissioned a poll suggesting even stronger rejection of the deal than the latest survey by zdf , a publicservice television broadcaster , which that at least half of germans opposed the proposed trade agreement what i personally find very difficult to understand is why germans are so full of fears about trade and the future at a time when they have it good and unemployment is relatively low , mr bluth said in an interview anton hofreiter , a leader of the greens party who observed the protest on saturday , said antiamerican beliefs were not the guiding force of the campaign against the trade pact yet he noted that demonstrators were wary that mr obama had come to europe partly to make a quick trade deal protesters who were asked why they so feared a pact likely to enhance germany s trade prospects or why they distrusted american regulators , who uncovered the volkswagen scandal when european regulators did not , insisted that they would be deceived , describing the trade talks as secretive as a leading commentator , nico fried , noted in the newspaper on saturday , it sometimes seems easier to get the conflicting parties in syria to agree on peace than for the friendly transatlantic partners to produce a trade agreement
how do you say no girls allowed in french \? that was the sentiment this week when the angoul me international comics festival in france released its list of 30 nominees for its grand prix award and none was female the french group bd galit called for a boycott with an image of olive oyl , flexing her muscles like popeye and proclaiming , we do it too ! the cause was taken up by a flurry of nominees including daniel clowes \( ghost world \) , chris ware \( jimmy corrigan \) , charles burns \( black hole \) , riad sattouf \( the arab of the future \) who asked to be removed from consideration for what is considered a lifetime achievement award organizers of the festival , which will be held in angoul me , france , jan 2931 , initially responded to the criticism by announcing they would amend the list to include marjane satrapi \( persepolis \) and posy simmonds \( gemma bovery \) but their statement curried no favor when it noted that the festival cannot remake the history of comics and that positive discrimination has no place in the arts after more criticism , the organizers decided to allow cartoonists to vote on nominees of their own choosing the comics website the 13th dimension provided a list of women it says should have been considered for the award
washington after a month of speculation and pleas ranging from to mildly , speaker held an unusually formal news conference tuesday afternoon to rule out what he has always said he would not do serve as the republican nominee for president in 2016 let me be clear , mr ryan said , addressing reporters at the republican national committee s headquarters i do not want , nor will i accept , the nomination of our party he then offered a strong opinion to convention delegates about how they should proceed in the case of a contested nomination if no candidate has the majority on the first ballot , i believe you should only choose from a person who has participated in the primary count me out speculation about mr ryan s intentions has escalated in recent weeks as large segments of the are in despair over its two leading candidates , donald j trump and senator ted cruz of texas , a state of play that mr ryan s aides say has become an increasing distraction but in some ways , the speaker s staff had added to that speculation , producing one campaignstyle video depicting mr ryan as an abovethefray politician seeking a battle of ideas and another as a readyonday1 leader taking a tour of the middle east the circus surrounding what in any other year would be a statement of the obvious a newly installed speaker of the house does not wish to undo the will of thousands of voters and delegates in the dark of night at his party s convention is simply the latest strange turn in a race replete with them and with each twist , it seemed , more republicans not aligned with mr trump or mr cruz saw an elegant solution in mr ryan on tuesday , he said he would have none of it i simply believe that if you want to be the nominee to be the president you should actually run for it , said mr ryan , who will be the convention chairman i chose not to therefore , i should not be considered period i just think it would be wrong to go any other way by coming down so firmly against drafting a new candidate in cleveland the most coveted white knight denouncing the very idea mr ryan made it less likely that the party would risk the backlash from supporters of mr trump and mr cruz that would come from such a maneuver but if mr ryan was emphatic that republicans should not attempt to find a new candidate or at least one who did not run for the presidency this election season he also again made clear that he hoped to thwart many of mr trump s ideas , if stopping short of actually opposing him on a ballot from his policies to his tone , i think ryan is looking toward what the future of the party is going to look like , postdonald trump , said liesl hickey , a veteran congressional aide and former executive director of the house republican campaign committee mr trump struck a wary note about mr ryan s announcement , pointing out during an appearance in rome , ny , that mr ryan had insisted last year that he did not want the speaker s job , only to eventually accept his party s entreaties we 'll see , mr trump said i take him at his word but we 'll have to watch , see what happens mr ryan could have easily reiterated his oftstated denials about the presidency through a clearly worded news release but by choosing to appear before the cameras and in front of four american flags at the republican national committee , the speaker purposefully used the moment to call for a different , sunnier brand of conservatism than the grievanceoriented politics that have propelled mr trump to the top of the republican race i believe we can once again be that optimistic party that is defined by a belief in the limitless possibility of our people , he said although senior republicans like former speaker john a boehner and senator orrin g hatch of utah have mentioned mr ryan as a potential alternative , there has been a of resistance to the idea over the past week many republicans worry that mr ryan s policy ideas , notably on immigration , are out of step with the republican base and would inflame chaos in the party and worst of all , mr ryan could lose in the fall mr ryan s remarks come just days after he returned from a trip to the middle east , where he visited with foreign leaders , and where gossip trailed him it s amazing how closely our politics is followed overseas , he said i was asked about it everywhere i went i'm also aware that while i was overseas , there was more speculation that someone other than the current candidates will emerge as our party s nominee i want to put that to rest once and for all mr ryan has repeatedly denounced several contentious statements made by mr trump in this campaign , but he has also said he would support whomever voters picked instead , he is focusing on a policy agenda in the house he hopes the eventual nominee will support many republicans expect that if mr trump prevails , mr ryan will avoid directly helping him , choosing instead to shore up vulnerable house republicans , particularly those trying to distance themselves from mr trump when it was pointed out to mr ryan that he also denied his desire to become speaker last year , mr ryan said the comparison was apples and oranges but he did add , not running does not mean i am going to disappear without mentioning mr trump by name , mr ryan once again denounced the businessman s approach to the race and the response to it across the country politics today tends to drift toward personality contests , not policy contests , he said , and once again made a pitch for house republicans to shape their own policy agenda the speaker s effort to present himself , and the house , as something close to a republican antidote to mr trump may be wishful thinking if the frontrunner becomes the standardbearer presidential nominees command more attention from the public than congressional leaders , and mr trump has already proved that he can shape the political debate but whether it is as speaker or future presidential candidate , mr ryan is positioning himself as a beacon of opposition to mr trump s policies and style of politics insults get more ink than ideas , mr ryan said but we still owe it to the country to show what we would do if given a mandate from the people
former gov of florida blasted for insulting the bush family and ridiculed the idea that mr trump could be commander in chief during a contentious and sometimes nasty republican presidential debate in greenville , sc , on saturday , a week before a crucial primary in the state with mr trump leading in the polls in south carolina and elsewhere after his victory in the new hampshire primary on tuesday , he was a ripe target for his republican rivals , especially mr bush and senator of texas , who are under intense pressure to halt his political momentum but the vitriol was so intense that it seemed to surprise even mr trump , a combative figure who had not been so roundly pummeled at a debate before after a somber opening to the debate that focused on the death of justice , mr bush aggressively took on mr trump an imperative for the former governor , given his poor showings in new hampshire and the iowa caucuses this month having helped raise more than 155 million , and with his family s political reputation on the line , mr bush had the look and feel of a man taking his last , best shot to rescue his candidacy and destroy mr trump s mr bush bore into mr trump s knowledge and readiness to confront national security threats , noting that mr trump had made positive remarks about russia s role in fighting the islamic state in syria it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that russia could be a positive partner in this , mr bush said jeb is so wrong jeb is absolutely , mr trump said , before being cut off by boos from the audience you 've got to fight isis first , he added you have to knock them off strong mr trump drew more boos by attacking a south carolina republican , senator lindsey graham , who is a bush ally mr trump dismissed the catcalls from the audience by saying they were from bush supporters , donors and washington insiders i tell the truth , lobbyists , mr trump said moments later , mr trump stood by his past remarks that he would have supported the impeachment of president george w bush over the war in iraq , saying that his administration misled the country about weapons of mass destruction they lied they said there were weapons of mass destruction , and there were none , mr trump said his remarks drew a slashing attack from jeb bush , who is well aware that many south carolina republicans hold high opinions of president bush as well as of their parents i'm sick and tired of him going after my family , mr bush said my dad is the greatest man alive , in my mind , he added my mom is the strongest woman i know she should be running , mr trump said tartly attacking the honor and record of the bush family amounted to one of the biggest risks that mr trump had taken during the presidential race , given that mr bush and his are spending heavily to win the south carolina primary and that bush advisers believe mr trump is vulnerable here mr trump s florid reputation , past support for abortion rights and harsh language including a he used last week about mr cruz could alienate social conservatives and establishment republicans in the state , according to bush advisers while mr bush has assailed mr trump in the past and described him as all but unqualified for the presidency , the saturday debate was his most forceful performance of the race the debate was also critical for senator of florida after his disastrous turn in a faceoff last weekend in new hampshire , where gov chris christie of new jersey savaged him as scripted and callow after mr rubio kept repeating the same stock attack on president obama mr rubio s political momentum slowed after that , and he finished fifth in the primary there in his concession speech , he promised supporters that he would not make the same mistakes in the debate on saturday night if he did not embarrass himself , he did not appreciably improve as before , he spoke very quickly , in long sentences , rattling off national security challenges in asia , the middle east and russia without pausing , a furious rush akin to spitting out words mr rubio also briefly pounced on mr trump during the exchange over president george w bush , not only on the subject of iraq , but also on the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks mr trump disputed mr rubio s assertion that president bush had shown leadership before the attacks the world trade center came down during the reign of george bush , mr trump said that is not safe , marco the world trade center came down because bill clinton did not kill osama bin laden when he had the chance to kill him , mr rubio said the death of justice scalia briefly injected a new seriousness into a republican nomination fight that has been rambunctious and unpredictable ever since mr trump upended american politics last summer by building a formidable lead in national opinion polls despite a series of harsh comments about mexicans , women , senator john mccain and others the six candidates were generally in agreement that the republicanled senate should try to block any nomination by mr obama to replace justice scalia , although some of them acknowledged that if they were president , they would act on their constitutional authority to try to fill the vacancy if i were president now , i would certainly want to try to nominate a justice , mr trump said i think he s going to do it whether i'm ok with it or not i think it s up to mitch mcconnell and everybody else to stop it it s called delay , delay , delay gov john kasich of ohio struck a somber note , saying he was disappointed that justice scalia s death had turned into a partisan fight so quickly he argued that mr obama should pick a candidate who would receive unanimous approval from both parties , or else forgo naming a candidate i wish we had n't run so fast into politics , mr kasich said while all of the candidates seemed more animated during the forum , the dynamic seemed to revert to the early days of the campaign , when mr trump s presence , personality and blunt insults dominated the action mr kasich , who has sought to portray himself as the most reasonable and centrist of the candidates , told the group at one point , i think we 're fixing to lose the election to hillary clinton if we do n't stop this the candidates also clashed sharply over immigration , which has emerged as the major policy flash point in the south carolina republican primary mr rubio , who sees mr cruz and to a lesser extent jeb bush as his chief threats in south carolina , attacked mr cruz with the same talking points he had used all week , insisting that the texas senator had held lenient positions on illegal immigration i would note not only that marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty , mr cruz said in the state of florida , as speaker of the house , he supported instate tuition for illegal immigrants in addition to that , marco went on univision in spanish and said he would not rescind mr obama s illegal exclusive amnesty on his first day in office mr rubio shot back , i do n't know how he knows what i said on univision because he does n't speak spanish , which prompted a brief reply in spanish from mr cruz while mr trump was repeatedly dismissive of mr bush s political skills , portraying him as a loser whose supporters had spent more than 20 million on attack ads to little gain , he was even more scathing toward mr cruz , who is regarded by the trump campaign as its ultimate opponent mr trump appeared on the verge of losing his cool as mr cruz invoked the death of justice scalia to warn that mr trump would appoint liberals to the supreme court and brought up mr trump s past support for abortion rights you are the single biggest liar , mr trump said , glaring at mr cruz this guy will say anything nasty guy now i know why he does n't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues in the senate yet when mr trump went on to attack mr cruz over his campaign s attempt to undermine ben carson , a retired neurosurgeon , in iowa , mr cruz saw an opening and seized it i will say it is fairly remarkable to see donald defending ben , mr cruz said , after he called him pathological and compared him to a child molester , both of which were offensive and wrong i just quoted his book , mr trump said of some his swipes at mr carson last fall the debate s moderator , john dickerson of cbs , even confronted mr trump with his history of profanity , asking him to explain it , given that many voters found his language offensive on occasion , in order to sort of really highlight something , i 'll use a profanity , mr trump said one of the profanities that i got credited with using that i did n't use was a very bad word two weeks ago that i never used , he added and everybody said , oh , he did n't say anything wrong' but you bleeped it so everyone thinks i said the word i did n't say anything i never said the word

brussels simon o'connor , a european commission official , had parked his car and was about to walk toward the departure terminal , en route to rome for work salom corbo , an actress from montreal , was at the air canada counter , about to check her luggage elouan preaud and his wife , angelina centeno , were having breakfast , waiting to board an american airlines flight to her native colombia then came the blasts the first one tore through the checkin area at brussels airport just before 8 am on tuesday another followed , seconds later , near a starbucks mr preaud and his wife , who is pregnant , hit the ground as people screamed , get down , get down ! after the second explosion , he looked up to see a giant fan part of an airconditioning unit that had landed near them they had been eating at a d lifrance , talking about salah abdeslam , the terrorism suspect who was in brussels on friday after a fourmonth global manhunt in 10 seconds , everything changed , mr preaud said it was an apocalypse there was blood everywhere ms corbo , like other witnesses , said the second blast was stronger than the first i felt myself pushed forward as if by a force of air , she said in a phone interview people dove to the ground parts of the ceiling fell in there were some injured people lying on the ground i saw a foot that had been blown off mr o'connor , the european commission official , described hearing two deeply rumbling crashes as he approached the terminal from the parking lot i saw the glass side of the terminal blown out , a lot of agitated people streaming out , he said in a phone interview there were people with blood on their faces , people with injuries on the ground outside the terminal building it was the kind of stuff you hope to never see nearly seven miles away , in the heart of brussels as paramedics , police officers and other emergency workers were still evacuating hundreds of passengers at the airport and taking scores of injured people away for treatment a bomb went off on a subway train as it departed the crowded maelbeek station it was 9 11 am , just after the height of the morning rush the train was coming into maelbeek station , said brian carroll , 31 , a communications consultant from washington , who was on the train heading to a conference downtown there was suddenly a loud explosion there was smoke everywhere everyone dropped to the ground people were screaming and crying i was on the ground my immediate reaction was , we are getting attacked by terrorists , ' he continued for all i knew , there was a gunman going from car to car and shooting people after a couple of minutes , mr carroll pried open a door of the subway car i thought to myself , i 've got to get out of here , ' he recalled i headed toward an exit there was smoke and soot everywhere there was glass everywhere it was like running through a cloud of dust he eventually joined a friend near the berlaymont , the headquarters of the european commission , the executive arm of the european union i'm a bit shaken up , but i'm ok , he said both the airport terminal and the subway station became scenes of carnage roughly 10 people were killed at the airport and 20 at the subway station , while 200 others were injured , officials said tuesday evening , cautioning that the death toll could rise among the dozen or so witnesses interviewed on tuesday , a theme recurred with striking consistency none said they had thought an accident occurred all of them said they had immediately thought of terror , specifically the nov 13 terrorist attacks in and around paris , which killed 130 people and were largely plotted in brussels we were scared that there were people with guns coming , said johannie hoedenaeken , a traveler who , like mr preaud and ms centeno , was eating at the d lifrance when the airport explosions occurred that s what happened in paris i really thought i was going to die mr carroll , the visitor from washington , said he had followed news coverage about belgium s fractured governance and its response to the  this has been going on for a while , and the whole world is looking at belgium , he said all of us have doubts that the belgian government can manage this situation there are so many competing language groups the police do n't cooperate well together but amid the chaos , there were acts of altruism a kid came out bleeding a lot , said ilaria ruggiano , who was traveling with her mother and five others i tried to help him with a tissue , but it was not enough ms corbo , the actress , credited a security guard for escorting her and other passengers to a secure area on the tarmac there was a lot of humanity amid all the horror , she said we received water i was hungry , and a stranger offered me some nuts people were helping each other even in their shock , people sought to alert or protect others a lady was crying and yelling at me in french , said murat ueranuez , who was in the restaurant of the sheraton hotel across from the airport terminal , preparing for a conference of fraud examiners , when the blasts occurred she was panicked i said , i am sorry , i do n't speak french' she switched to english and , speaking with a heavy accent , said do n't go out , do n't go out there there are explosions' she was still crying and yelling and was obviously in shock in the early evening , belgian officials released a photo of three men captured from surveillance cameras , saying that two were suicide bombers and that they were looking for the third who may have had a bomb that failed to go off all three looked calm like many of their victims , they were pushing airport luggage carts
at halftime , it seemed safe to go to bed the golden state warriors led the oklahoma city thunder , 6047 , on monday night golden state , the recordbreaking 739 team , seemed to be cruising at home to a 10 series lead in the bestofseven western conference finals the half was capped by the nba s most valuable player , stephen curry , swishing one of his trademark long 3pointers over andre roberson russell westbrook , in particular , struggled for the thunder , shooting 1 for 8 for 3 points but a different westbrook and thunder came out for the second half it started with a third quarter in which the thunder seemed to score at will , cutting golden state s lead to 3 the thunder s 38 points were the most scored in a third quarter against golden state this season in the fourth quarter , the mighty warriors seemed to forget how to shoot , scoring 14 points and losing a game they seemed to have won ,  way too many quick shots , coach steve kerr said five minutes left in the game and we 're down 4 or whatever , and we were acting like we had 20 seconds left five minutes is an eternity curry said , we got rushed a little bit and tried to go for the home run plays golden state had shot its way out of trouble all season , but in the final quarter the team was 6 for 23 , including 1 of 10 from 3point range golden state got 20 points or more from each of its big three curry , klay thompson and draymond green but none from the starting center andrew bogut and 16 from the bench despite its secondhalf woes , golden state still had a fighting chance , trailing by 3 with 22 seconds left as westbrook stopped dribbling to call a timeout , he dragged his pivot foot kerr , standing right by the play , wanted a traveling call , but none was forthcoming i thought he walked , but it was n't called , so that s the way it goes , kerr said i just played till i heard the whistle , westbrook said joe borgia , the nba s senior vice president for referee operations , acknowledged the nocall was a mistake the officials , no one could get in a good position to see him drag that pivot foot it s an unfortunate miss , but so much going on in the play , the speed of it , and officiating is about getting angles and sometimes you just ca n't get them , and they did not get a great angle on that play oklahoma city has now won three in a row on the road against san antonio and golden state , who combined to lose just three times at home in the regular season should the thunder make the nba finals , they would also cede homecourt advantage to the cavaliers or the raptors \( that series was set to start tuesday night in cleveland \) despite the loss , the warriors are far from sunk bookmakers still have them as favorites to win the series at 47 , with the thunder at 75 that would translate to about a 6040 edge to golden state , even though the warriors must now win four of six games losing game 1 at home in a sevengame series is not ideal , but also not a death sentence indeed , it has happened five times in the last two years , and each time the losing team came back to win the series the toronto raptors in this year s playoffs dropped game 1 in their series against the indiana pacers and the miami heat , but rallied to win both we 've never been down , 01 , at home it s a little different , green said coming out in game 2 , we know we need to win that s pretty much what it is oklahoma city center steven adams apologized tuesday for describing golden state s guards as quick little monkeys in a televised oncourt interview after the game adams s father is from england , his mother is from tonga and he grew up in new zealand it s just different , mate , adams told usa today sports different words , different expressions , and stuff like that but they obviously can be taken differently , depending on which country you 're in i'm assimilating , mate , still trying to figure out the boundaries but i definitely overstepped them tonight
two years ago , as wrestled with an array of political challenges , pundits and partisans reached for a familiar explanation the secondterm curse to conservative opponents , battles over the , and the signaled the democratic president s failure a former economic adviser to mr obama , lawrence h summers , seeing echoes of secondterm struggles for presidents from franklin d roosevelt to george w bush , revived the idea of a constitutional shift to a single sixyear presidency such talk has all but vanished mr obama has overseen , a reduction in the proportion of and diplomatic breakthroughs on , , and  republicans are now more likely to denounce his ideology and use of executive power than his competence unfortunately , i think he has been successful at achieving his agenda , senator marco rubio , a candidate for the republican presidential nomination , lamented recently former representative vin weber , a republican who came to power in ronald reagan s landslide in 1980 , said it s very hard for republicans to acknowledge that but you ca n't deny the successes smooth sailing in the final year is by no means guaranteed ten months before bill clinton left office , the the made a ruin of mr bush s final chapter frightened by the and attacks , most americans say mr obama s strategy against the is n't working but the evidence points to a second term for mr obama that is more successful than most if you go back to the truman era , his stacks up favorably in fact , much better than the majority , said thomas cronin , a scholar of the presidency at colorado college presidential achievement takes different forms some predecessors accomplished more with congress in second terms mr reagan , for example , signed and  but partisan polarization has steadily made legislative compromise more difficult although mr obama still hopes that congress will approve his trade deal , he has spent much of his second term using his executive authority and fending off republican attempts to thwart him the presidential historian robert dallek described mr obama s performance as well above average , calling it a model for an era of ferocious partisanship that he can carry this off sort of sets a new parameter , mr dallek said national consensus remains beyond mr obama s reach as measured by gallup , his approval rating among republicans has remained below 20 percent throughout his second term his approval among democrats has remained at 75 percent or higher those numbers broadly resemble the partisan divide over mr bush s second term , a split that has inflamed a steady stream of allegations over management of the internal revenue service , the department of veterans affairs and the justice department , among others yet none has blossomed into the sort of secondterm disaster suffered by mr reagan with the , or mr clinton with the affair , not to mention richard nixon with watergate compared to recent presidents , the number of scandals is exceptionally low , said brandon rottinghaus , a university of houston professor who monitors executive branch scandals the closest thing to a public corruption prosecution tied to an obama appointee s official duties was a by the former cia director david petraeus in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge for allowing his mistress access to classified material the durability of mr obama s secondterm legacy depends partly on his successor every twiceelected president since world war ii left office with congress controlled by the opposing party unless senate democrats gain at least four seats in november , mr obama will , too even a friendly successor could discard mr obama s initiatives if they prove ineffective mr weber , the former lawmaker , questions whether the will change much , for example , and said , i'm not sure the iran deal s going to accomplish what he wants the only judgment possible now , mr weber added , is this he did it
the top art auction houses had a carefree and comfortable time of it for most of the first couple of centuries of their existence , but lately they have been hustling to adjust to a radical transformation of their industry new digital technology and new customers with new attitudes in new places , along with new competition from deft and nimble upstarts eager to cater to them , have forced the dominant companies , sotheby s and christie s , to develop new ways to do business they are responding to the challenge by throwing their money and names around , buying or forming looser affiliations with rivals that understand the shifting realities of the marketplace , including a collector base increasingly inclined to buy art online and on the go , better than they do because the arrivistes helped create those realities businesses need to evolve , and although the auction process has been around close to forever , the technology changes things the way the market works changes things , and so does the global nature of the market , said suzanne gyorgy , global head of art advisory and finance at citi private bank , a subsidiary of citigroup as with many businesses , the internet presents the greatest threat to the established order in the art market and the greatest opportunity , too online art sales in 2014 reached 33 billion euros , or about 36 billion , according to the latest edition of the european fine art foundation annual report that represents about 6 percent of the global market in art and antiques and a 32 percent increase from 2013 global auction sales totaled 246 billion in 2014 , the report said that was 48 percent of the market , but it marked just a 93 percent gain on the year before and was barely over the 24 billion recorded in 2007 , the previous highwater mark tefaf and other organizations that monitor the market , such as hiscox , an insurance company that specializes in art , among other niches , foresee growth of about 25 percent a year in online sales for the rest of the decade to grab a piece of the action , the auction industry leaders have expanded vigorously online christie s , in 2011 , set up an onlineonly auction platform that held 79 sales in 2015 , said jennifer ferguson , a company spokeswoman last year christie s bought collectrium , a digital art collection management service we have made important hires to support a new marketing and content strategy in both print and digital across all our platforms , as well as strategic digital acquisitions , ms ferguson said none of this happened in just the last 12 months , but has been happening over the last five years sotheby s raised its profile online last year when it began streaming its auctions live on ebay , the allpurpose auction website we want to create more channels and more ways for our collectors to be able to engage in and buy things that they love , said david goodman , sotheby s executive vice president for digital development and marketing perhaps more important , arrangements such as this give the company access to customers they might not have had otherwise we 're able to see a different group of people from what we would normally have in the consignment auction process , mr goodman said it s a way to expand our distribution and our brand and introduce new people to the world of collecting we 're excited about the momentum we 're seeing in the online space the marketplace is expanding in the real world , too , and auction firms are taking varied steps to cater to new buyers sotheby s recently bought art agency partners , which provides collectors with advice on art , legal and investment matters the acquisition is expected to help sotheby s expand and enhance its private sales , an activity that the industry sees as a more lucrative way to sell art than the traditional auction business among the moves that ms ferguson highlighted at christie s is the opening of offices in shanghai and in mumbai , india , part of an effort that has helped nurture new growth across both the emerging collector and established collector sectors the collectors that have emerged from places like china and india have become a critical segment of the global art market they have been sources of tremendous growth for auction houses , but also sources of volatility and consternation china accounted for 273 percent of global art transactions in 2014 , according to a citigroup report , compared with just 02 percent in 2000 but after years of surging growth , the chinese art market , like its economy and stock market , has been slumping lately auction sales of chinese contemporary art dropped 41 percent last year , according to a report by arttactic , a london firm that analyzes the art market the report noted that sales in other asian markets took up some of the slack , rising 14 percent in india , for instance , and 28 percent in southeast asia in a survey of industry experts by arttactic , 19 percent more respondents said they expected the chinese art market to shrink this year than to expand , worse than for any market except russia india was considered to have the best prospects , with a net 48 percent positive on the market the american and european markets combined had a 16 percent net favorable assessment the possibility that chinese art sales may be leveling off leads benjamin r mandel , global strategist for multiasset solutions at jp morgan asset management , to warn that the next 15 years for the global art market may not be as fruitful as the last 15 he is also concerned that the trend toward ever more extravagant prices for a handful of works amid soso growth elsewhere is bound to reverse china s extraordinary period of catchup growth has largely played out , while the inequality in auction prices may reach some natural limit , mr mandel wrote in a recent report as a result , the slowing of these factors could subtract up to a third from the annual growth of the global market that is , global growth would be on the order of 9 percent , rather than 13 percent whether or not the auction houses are taking such forecasts to heart , they are easing back on the splashy evening sales that they 're best known for by combining different genres of art , such as impressionism and postwar contemporary , and bunching sales together on the calendar they present the moves as a means of catering to clients with eclectic tastes , but they also may reduce costs the more traditional competition that auction houses face comes from brickandmortar galleries , and they are adapting and contributing to the evolution of the market , too alessia zorloni , adjunct professor in art markets at libera universit di lingue e comunicazione iulm , in milan , observed a trend among galleries to abandon the middle ground there are two choices for dealers today , either to run a lightweight , costeffective operation that supports young artists or adopt the megagallery model , she said the highend art market is controlled by a few dozen operators and characterized by a small number of large and powerful galleries , often organized as real commercial companies with a wide network of connections with other galleries , and in the most important cases , with branches in other cities these galleries trade on the value of their brands and reputations , ms zorloni said , just as the auction houses do these are important aspects of any business but especially in one like art where the value of the main product is hard to calculate and based on subjective criteria that s why the auction industry faces little threat at the top end from online entities , in her view if you think about this feature of the art market , there will never be competition with websites , even mainstream ones like amazon and ebay , she said they are simply different market segments appealing to different customers the power of auction house brands will remain strong not only do auction houses have access to firstclass works , but obviously they also have access to the clientele that no one dealer can compete with as time goes on , auction companies may embrace the distinctions between market segments even further providing a premium service for highend collectors centered on a few evening sales while using extensive online abilities to grant greater access to the market , with fewer frills , to a growing number of customers with thinner wallets the number of buyers in the art market has increased so dramatically in the last five years , said ms gyorgy , of citi private bank developing an online presence is really smart as for the marquee sales , people really like the auction experience , she said , adding , it s some of the best theater in town , but it s expensive theater to put on
with few exceptions , donald j trump s week in the news was a blur of unflattering reports his refusal to disclose his effective tax rate eclipsed an audiotape of him posing as his own spokesman that , in turn , upstaged reports about his former butler saying racist , violent things about president obama which had already overtaken mr trump s waffling over his own call for a ban on muslims entering the country  but mr trump somehow seemed to win the news cycle anyway he is the first candidate to truly take advantage of the fact we are an add society , said j tucker martin , a republican communications strategist in virginia he moves so quick and creates outrages so fast , you almost forget what happened mr trump , who by every measure has dominated campaign news for 11 months , was headspinningly ubiquitous this week calling into television morning shows , speaking to reporters from his office at trump tower , popping up on capitol hill and sustaining his steady stream of boasts and insults on twitter repeatedly , he had to do damage control , walking back , clarifying or reclarifying comments about the muslim ban , whether he wanted to raise taxes on the rich , or whether he would release his own tax returns before november yet the sheer volume of incoming fire seemed to diminish the impact of any of it when it landed just ask john miller i ve never seen somebody that s so immune to bad press , said mr miller , the name mr trump evidently gave in identifying himself as a spokesman for mr trump , not the genuine article , during an interview with a people magazine reporter in 1991 the voice on the recording , published on friday by the washington post , sounded undeniably like mr trump s , and spoke extensively and authoritatively about his romantic and business exploits , albeit in the third person \( mr trump , asked about the recording on nbc s today show on friday , nonetheless denied the voice was his \) it hardly mattered , because the story was deprived of oxygen by another one mr trump s telling george stephanopoulos of abc s good morning america that it s none of your business what tax rate he pays with mr trump monopolizing so much of the coverage of the campaign , his likely democratic opponent , hillary clinton , has been far less visible some democrats fret that she is being harmed by the lack of exposure others express confidence that mr trump will lose support with almost every utterance there s never too much of this , said bakari sellers , a former south carolina lawmaker and paid cnn commentator i don t see how anyone can hear all of these things and still vote for him yet , from early in his days as a tabloid fixture in new york , mr trump appears to have grasped that if he were always in the news , no one story would define him as a candidate , it has become routine for mr trump to get away with things that would sink a more conventional politician on wednesday , he told attendees at a long island fundraiser that mrs clinton got her ass kicked in the west virginia primary the crude mockery was barely reported on thursday , his aides quickly repudiated a former butler , anthony senecal , whose threats on social media to lynch mr obama are being investigated by the secret service it ended up even less than a oneday story
in donald trump s characteristically gracious and temperate following his drubbing in wisconsin , he accused ted cruz of being not just a puppet but a trojan horse , a flag of convenience for party bosses attempting to steal the nomination the image of cruz as a tool of the republican party s bosses is not one that would have occurred to anyone before this primary season but clearly some elite republicans do imagine him as a stalking horse for the more congenial and electable nominee they fondly imagine might be elevated by the convention if cruz denies trump the nomination on the early ballots this is the theory driving s continuing campaign for president , which survives on nothing save the thin oxygen provided by him beating hillary clinton handily in a general election it s a possible explanation for why marco rubio has n't actually endorsed cruz yet , and why mitt romney has endorsed him only as the best nevertrump choice , not outright both men may still imagine themselves as seventhballot nominees and it s the reason that republican insiders keep white knight candidacy , which ryan has only tentatively batted away these strange scenarios , and the machinations and floor fights that might make them possible , are basically the reason that journalists pine for a contested convention they were not actually that fanciful two months ago , when it seemed plausible that if the race was pushed to the convention , it would be an evenly matched threeway battle among cruz , trump and rubio that did it in that scenario , or in a counterfactual in which kasich was actually piling up as many delegates as cruz , you could imagine a convention splitting three ways on ballot after ballot , with trump s support gradually shrinking but holding up well enough to deny the other two a majority then the convention might actually reach the point of exhaustion when a whiteknight alternative would seem almost just if none of the candidates can beat the others , then none of them should get the nod but if cruz succeeds in pushing the race to the convention , we wo n't have that scenario instead we 'll have just two candidates with threequarters of the delegates between them , and a third wheel , kasich , who shows no signs of building the delegateselecting juggernaut that could make him a big player on the floor instead , the only candidate is cruz himself his team has been working the system since iowa , getting as many loyalists as possible chosen for delegate slates , to the point where it seems reasonable to assume that many delegates pledged to trump will switch to cruz at the first opportunity it also seems reasonable , as , to assume that many of the delegates who are n't explicitly recruited by team cruz will still like him just fine as loathed as the texas senator might be in the senate cloakroom , there s no evidence that he s similarly despised among the grassroots activists who often become or help pick convention delegates quite the reverse , in fact so play things out , and cruz s path to victory at a contested convention looks very clear indeed on the first ballot , trump wins \( let s say \) 1 , 150 votes , while cruz wins \( say \) 825 on the next two ballots , some of the trump delegates start to jump ship , and most of them go to cruz , since his people have spent months working on them by the third ballot , the texas senator is closing in on 1 , 237 , in a hall filled with people who generally like him and definitely prefer him to trump what would prevent him from getting there \? the answer has to be something more than a vague desire among certain of cruz s delegates to vote for a figure like ryan or romney instead that desire may exist some of cruz s delegates will be more moderate than he is , some of them will worry that he s a hopeless generalelection candidate , some of them will be party men or women who find his selfinterested ambition offputting , some of them will be nevertrump types who actually preferred kasich or rubio but these maybenotcruz impulses wo n't add up to anything unless the people who feel them get organized , and soon someone would need to start building lists , counting votes , and persuading a large number of cruz s delegates to peel away from him on the second or third ballot , to offset the nearly inevitable swing of many trump delegates into his column so it s not just a question of drafting a ryan , a romney or a rubio and expecting weary delegates to swing their way to even get that far , you would need a substantial third bloc of delegates who are already on board with the idea , who understand what needs to be done to get there , and who can be relied on to keep the nomination from both trump and cruz long enough to make a draft seem reasonable and who , exactly , is going to pull such a bloc together \? across months of campaigning , the republican establishment , such as it is , could n't manage to unite around a single candidate develop a strategy to stop donald trump cruz is the only nottrump candidate left standing precisely because the republicans who most dislike him could n't coordinate , plot effectively or successfully elevate a more electable alternative but now we 're supposed to believe that those same incompetents are going to magically turn into convention machiavels , capable of running a secretbutnotreallysecret whip operation on behalf of ryan or rubio while cruz and trump just stand by helplessly and let it happen \? that karl rove and the koch brothers are going to rediscover the magic of the smokefilled room just in time to somehow undo a year s worth of collectiveaction failures \? that seems unlikely yes , not so long ago the republican party drafted a reluctant paul ryan for high office , and it worked but it worked because the house speakership was a job that nobody else or nobody else plausible really wanted not so the party s presidential nomination ted cruz wants it and if he can keep trump from the magic number , it s hard to see the delegates giving it to anyone but him
zurich nothing has rocked international soccer quite like the waves of arrests made across several continents last year as the united states announced bribery and corruption charges against the men running the sport , the world s biggest and richest but as the organization that governs global soccer gathers this week to choose a new president , a leading contender risks stirring up another source of controversy for the sport human rights with the election set to be held here on friday , sheikh salman bin ebrahim alkhalifa , a member of the ruling family of and the president of the governing body for soccer in asia , might already have the support of a commanding number of voting countries , making him one of the favorites , with , to replace sepp blatter as president of  critics have seized on one aspect of sheikh salman s background that remains unclear they want fifa to investigate whether he had any connection to the jailing and torture of bahraini athletes who peacefully protested his in 2011 during the arab spring when the uprisings spread to , the sunni muslim ruling family violently repressed the prodemocracy protests , which were led by members of the country s shiite majority the authorities were accused of torturing hundreds of people taken into custody during the crackdown , among them protest leaders but also professionals , like doctors and athletes , who had sympathized with the demonstrators bahrain , a key ally of the united states in the persian gulf region , pledged to carry out reforms after the unrest , but since then , most of the country s leading dissidents have been forced into exile or sent to prisons where , , torture and other abuse are still rampant in , the fifth anniversary of bahrain s uprising , the state department said bahrain s government had made progress but criticized the detention of leading opposition figures as well as the limitations on peaceful assembly and political activism and the criminalization of free expression sheikh salman has denied allegations that he was connected in any way to human rights violations , but the ruling family s tactics received increased attention as he climbed the hierarchy of international sport in the past five years , winning a position on fifa s governing executive committee in 2013 in that time , some of the athletes in bahrain who once spoke out against him have recanted the allegations against sheikh salman and the possibility of his becoming the first new president of fifa in nearly two decades are discomfiting to some of the organization s members , who are seeking to project an image of reform in the face of centered on allegations of financial crimes human rights officials , who previously criticized fifa over the mistreatment of workers building stadiums in qatar for the 2022 world cup , have expressed outrage about sheikh salman to both soccer federations and sponsors this is a pivotal moment for fifa , but every moment has been a pivotal moment for fifa , said roger pielke jr , a political scientist who has studied the organization and its governance they 've never taken advantage of it they 've never pivoted the other prominent contender for fifa s presidency is infantino , of switzerland but sheikh salman s ability to gather critical support has signaled that power in global soccer , long concentrated in europe , might be shifting toward the middle east he has won the full support of the top soccer officials in africa and asia , fifa s two most populous confederations , and this month seemed to win the backing of russia , which had previously endorsed mr infantino at the same time , sheikh salman has put forth a more western image in photographs on his , appearing more often in suits or jeans than in traditional bahraini dress sheikh salman , who lives in bahrain s capital , manama , said that , if elected , he would be a roving president , spending time in zurich as necessary but focused on traveling to small countries where soccer has been underdeveloped he s said he wo n't take fifa out of switzerland , mr pielke said but let s see what happens when swiss prosecutors are knocking on the door you could imagine any of the candidates pulling up stakes and going to the middle east a private person about whom few personal details are known , sheikh salman declined to be interviewed in person or by phone he answered some questions by email but refused to speak about his family and referred questions about human rights and the arab spring protests to his lawyers , who denied activists' allegations sheikh salman played soccer in a youth league in bahrain in the 1980s , he said , studying history and english literature at the university of bahrain , after which he joined bahrain s national soccer association to work in development in 2002 , 10 years after graduating from college , he was elected president of the association the sheikh won his current position three years ago , overseeing the sport throughout asia and securing a seat on fifa s executive committee but even since joining the fold of fifa s top leadership , sheikh salman has remained a bit of a mystery to some of his colleagues when in zurich for fifa meetings , he chooses not to stay with most of his fellow executive committee members at the baur au lac hotel , preferring more privacy sheikh salman has withdrawn from notable social occasions , several soccer officials said he did not attend the world cup final in rio de janeiro in 2014 or the club world cup in marrakesh , morocco , that year \( his lawyers noted that the world cup final coincided with the religious holiday ramadan and added that sheikh salman had other commitments related to his presidency of the asian football confederation that had kept him from attending the club final \) jim boyce , a soccer official from britain who served on fifa s disciplinary committee with sheikh salman , called him open and honest and said he had never discussed human rights concerns it was as if none of it was going on , mr boyce said sheikh salman said that if elected , he would first seek to reassure fifa s staff in zurich several hundred employees with no voice in electing the next president that he respected their jobs and would not seek to uproot them a top priority , he said , would be to separate fifa s revenuegenerating activities from its management of the game of soccer , carving out separate bodies focused on managing money and developing the sport sheikh salman said he had not been in communication with mr blatter , who left his position amid scandal last year , after the united states in a sweeping corruption case mr blatter is also by switzerland s attorney general and has been barred from soccer by fifa i respect the legal process that is currently underway , the sheikh wrote hakeem aloraibi , a former soccer player for bahrain s national team , said he felt that asia had been underrepresented within world soccer but that sheikh salman was not the person to advance it and represent the sport globally mr oraibi was arrested in november 2012 while walking to a cafe in bahrain to watch a real madridbarcelona game he was accused of vandalizing a police station at a time when he had been playing in a match that had been aired on live television , he said multiple officers beat him while he was in jail , mr oraibi said in a phone interview from melbourne , australia , where he sought asylum in 2014 they blindfolded me , he said they held me really tight , and one started to beat my legs really hard , saying you will not play soccer again we will destroy your future' mr oraibi said he believed he had been arrested because he was a shiite muslim and because of his brother s political activism in bahrain his brother is serving a 10year prison sentence bahrain s soccer association , led by sheikh salman at the time , did not engage with requests from mr oraibi s sister and lawyers to confirm his alibi and exonerate him , mr oraibi said he remained in jail for three months and was later sentenced to 10 years in prison , which he avoided by fleeing bahrain asked about mr oraibi s situation , lawyers for sheikh salman said the bahrain football association had provided evidence to assist a number of football players to defend their cases , adding that sheikh salman did not personally receive a request for help from mr oraibi sheikh salman s lawyers denied separate allegations made by the bahrain institute for rights and democracy that the sheikh had led a committee that studied pictures of prodemocracy demonstrations and identified athletes who had participated in them those athletes , activists said , were later detained and tortured the sheikh s lawyers maintained that the committee in question , while having met once , never formally convened and conducted no business both sheikh salman and the bahraini football association had concerns about sheikh salman being involved , including whether it would be lawful , and , after taking advice , chose not to participate in the committee , the lawyers wrote sheikh salman plays no role in law enforcement and had absolutely no role in the identification , investigation , arrest or mistreatment of any individual but even in the face of such staunch denials , activists have requested that fifa conduct an inquiry by refusing to adequately investigate these allegations and allowing sheikh salman to potentially lead world football , fifa is putting a noose around its neck , said sayed ahmed alwadaei , director of advocacy for the bahrain institute for rights and democracy if elected , sheikh salman could bring protesters like mr alwadaei to fifa s doorstep just as the organization has signaled that human rights are a priority there have been about construction conditions for migrant laborers in qatar , which some have to indentured servitude but in december , fifa announced that it had hired john ruggie , a harvard professor who helped the united nations develop human rights principles , to establish similar requirements for world cup hosts and sponsors for the 2026 bidding process mr ruggie , who is expected to make recommendations by the end of next month , said examining the allegations against sheikh salman was not within the scope of his assignment i 'd hope and expect that the new president would support a commitment to align policies and practices with human rights , he said sheikh salman , meanwhile , has positioned himself as a reform candidate , seeking to bring his experience in disciplining violations like matchfixing in asia to cleaning up soccer on a global scale what is an immediate necessity , he wrote , is to lift this phoenix out of the financial , reputational and governance ashes that it has maneuvered itself into
boston , the former mobster convicted of participating in 11 murders during the 1970s and '80s , will not get a new trial , a federal appeals court ruled friday a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the first circuit found that mr bulger had not shown his right to a fair trial was violated when a judge barred him from testifying about his claim that he received immunity for his crimes for the reasons spelled out above , bulger got a fair trial and none of the complainedof conduct on the court or government s part warrant reversal of his conviction , the appellate judges concluded the is probably not the end of the line for mr bulger , who was once one of the nation s mostwanted fugitives he has the right to appeal the panel s ruling by asking for a hearing before the full court of six judges his lawyer , hank brennan , argued before the court in july that mr bulger s defense was eviscerated when he was not allowed to tell the jury that a federal prosecutor , who is now deceased , granted him immunity to commit crimes the trial judge said mr bulger had not offered any hard evidence of such an agreement prosecutors argued that mr bulger was not barred from taking the witness stand in his own defense , only from testifying about his immunity claim the appeals panel , in its ruling , determined the trial judge was right to take up the immunity issue pretrial , saying its research had found that resolving such claims before trial was more the norm than the exception mr bulger , 86 , fled boston in 1994 after a tip from an fbi agent that he was about to be indicted , and he was on the run for more than a decade he was finally captured with his longtime girlfriend in santa monica , calif , in 2011 the girlfriend , catherine greig , who is in her mid60s , pleaded guilty to charges related to helping mr bulger elude the authorities and was sentenced to eight years in prison during mr bulger s 2013 trial , he disputed the government s contention that he was a longtime fbi informant who gave the agency information on the new england mafia , his gang s main rival mr bulger said that jeremiah o sullivan , a former assistant united states attorney who died in 2009 , had given him immunity during the 1980s in return for protecting his life from the mobsters he prosecuted the judge found that mr o sullivan did not have the authority to grant such immunity mr bulger , after deciding not to testify in his own defense , cited the judge s ruling and called his trial a sham and my thing is , as far as i'm concerned , i did n't get a fair trial , and this is a sham , he said in court mr brennan argued that if mr bulger had been allowed to testify about his immunity claim , the jury would have had a chance to weigh his credibility against the credibility of prosecution witnesses
geneva the authorities in switzerland said on tuesday that they had begun criminal proceedings against one of the country s oldest banks , bsi , after allegations that it had laundered huge sums for politically exposed individuals linked to a scandalplagued malaysian state investment fund the swiss attorney general s office said in a statement that it suspected deficiencies in the internal organization of the bsi sa bank and believed that due to these deficiencies , the bank was unable to prevent the commission of offenses currently under investigation in the criminal proceedings relating to , 1malaysia development berhad the prosecution arose from an investigation that switzerland started last year into suspected misappropriation of billions of dollars from the malaysian fund , also known as 1mdb , and that it has pursued in cooperation with the authorities in luxembourg , singapore and the united states the investigation has strained relations with malaysia and embarrassed its prime minister , najib razak , who is that has roiled malaysian politics involving was paid into his bank accounts the monetary authority of singapore announced separately on tuesday that it was withdrawing the license of bsi s singapore branch for serious breaches of antimoney laundering requirements , poor management oversight of the bank s operations , and gross misconduct by some of the bank s staff the authority said it had considerable evidence of gross dereliction of duty by bsi management and had sent prosecutors the names of six senior managers to investigate whether they had committed criminal offenses the swiss attorney general s office said that it had started proceedings against bsi , the oldest bank in the swiss canton of ticino , as a result of its own investigations into transactions linked to 1mdb and on the basis of an investigation by the swiss financial market supervisory authority in a separate statement on tuesday , the financial market authority said that through business relationships and transactions linked to the corruption scandals surrounding the malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1mdb , bsi had committed serious breaches of money laundering regulations the authority said that it had ordered bsi to hand over to the swiss government profits amounting to 95 million swiss francs , or about 96 million , and had started legal proceedings against two of the bank s former top managers on tuesday , it also approved the takeover of bsi by a zurichbased private bank , efg international , under an agreement reached in february between efg and bsi s brazilian owner , btg pactual the authority said it had approved the deal on the conditions that bsi be completely integrated into efg and dissolved within 12 months and that none of bsi s top management associated with its misconduct take leadership positions in efg efg said in a statement that it believed tuesday s developments would draw a line ending regulatory uncertainty in switzerland and singapore for clients , employees , investors and other stakeholders the financial market authority said it had investigated 20 other swiss banks and had started legal proceedings against six of them over transactions linked to either 1mdb or the brazilian state oil company petrobras , which has also been a subject of investigation by the swiss authorities bsi s misconduct in its dealings with 1mdb was particularly serious , it said the swiss attorney general s office said in january that it suspected 4 billion earmarked for development projects in malaysia had been misappropriated from 1mdb , citing cases involving companies in malaysia and saudi arabia , and a united arab emirates sovereign wealth fund , each involving a systematic course of action carried out by means of complex financial structures in its business with 1mdb , the swiss financial market authority said , bsi handled transactions for several foreign sovereign wealth funds amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars without adequately clarifying the money s origins and helped to set up intermediate structures for handling the funds intended to increase the confidentiality of the transactions the sovereign wealth funds had constituted bsi s most profitable group of clients , the financial market authority said , and generated fees that were above market rates bsi s senior management did not question why the sovereign wealth funds should use a private bank to provide institutional services and pay excessive outofmarket fees for doing so , the authority said it said the swiss bank had also failed to apply adequate risk management procedures to business relationships with politically exposed persons , the origin of whose assets was not sufficiently clarified and whose dubious transactions involving hundreds of millions of us dollars were not satisfactorily scrutinized bsi had happily accepted the explanation that one deposit of 20 million was a gift , the market authority said , and in another instance it allowed 98 million to be paid into an account with no attempt to identify the commercial basis for the transaction in many cases , there were clear indications of passthrough transactions , the authority said , citing a case in which a payment of 20 million was shifted through several accounts on the same day before being transferred to another bank such transactions were often a clear indication of money laundering , but the bank failed to carry out any checks , the authority said the authority s statement added that , despite its warnings to bsi about the risks in its dealings with clients linked to 1mdb , the bank s board of directors and executive board had determined to continue these client relationships
a few months ago , my wife and i had dinner with a couple we did n't know very well it was awkward at first , but there was wine , and conversation soon followed at one point , the wife asked about my tour in iraq , where i served four years as a cavalry officer i began talking about the desert , the tribal politics and the daytoday travails of counterinsurgency that s all fine , the husband interrupted but tell us about the supersoldiers the specialops guys that s what people care about he had no time for gi joe he wanted american sniper he is not alone the mythos of special operations has seized our nation s popular imagination , and has proved to be the one prism through which the public will engage with america s wars from the box office to bookstores , the special ops commando quiet and professional , stoic and squarejawed thrives that he works in the shadows , where missions are classified and enemy combatants come in silhouettes of nightvision green , is all for the better details only complicate we like our heroes sanitized , perhaps especially in murky times like these the age of the commando , though , is more than pop cultural fantasy emanating from hollywood it s now a significant part of our military strategy last month the white house announced the nomination of gen joseph l votel to lead united states central command , which is responsible for military operations in 20 countries in the middle east and central asia , including iraq , iran , yemen , syria and saudi arabia in other words , the hotbed of our geopolitical conflicts general votel has been the head of the military s special operations command since 2014 his central command nomination represents a break in tradition it has almost always gone to generals of more conventional backgrounds military analysts hailed it as a sign of the obama administration s trust in , and reliance on , special operations special operations command , or socom , oversees all special operations forces our delta force operators , navy seals , green berets , army rangers , among others special operations personnel deployed to approximately 139 nations in 2015 about 70 percent of the countries on the planet while a vast majority of those missions involve training the defense forces of partner countries , a few involve direct combat in december , secretary of defense ashton b carter announced at a house hearing that an expeditionary targeting force will be sent to iraq to conduct raids on top islamic state targets they 'll be joining the roughly 3 , 500 troops already there working as advisers and trainers president obama seems desperate to strike a balance between doing nothing in the region and not reneging on his no boots on the ground promises clearly , commandos have boots , and those boots touch the ground but white house officials have taken to what a report in this newspaper recently called to obscure the forces' combat roles as the military as a whole downsizes , special ops recruitment continues to rise there are approximately 70 , 000 special ops personnel today , a number that includes soldiers , civilians , national guard and reservists , as well this number is up from 45 , 600 in 2001 and 61 , 400 in 2011 still , adm william h mcraven then the head of socom told congress in 2014 that the force has continued to fray from the endless deployment cycles in response , the army alone last year put out a call for 5 , 000 new special ops candidates in the political sense , the policy works the secrecy surrounding special ops keeps the heavy human costs of war off the front pages but in doing so , it also keeps the nonmilitary public wholly disconnected from the armed violence carried out in our name it enables our state of perpetual warfare , and ensures that as little as we care and understand today , we 'll care and understand even less tomorrow special operations are not a panacea just as swat teams ca n't fulfill their purpose without everyday beat cops on corners , operators ca n't and do n't function in a vacuum many a military analyst has compared our current counterterror approach to a bandaid while effective , that effectiveness has no clear end state and recent history suggests an overreliance on our commandos can lead to tragedy in 1993 , in somalia , special operations seemed a cureall , too then came the battle of mogadishu same with 1980 and operation eagle claw , as we desperately tried to end the iran hostage crisis the former led to a shortlived retreat from international intervention , the latter to the very creation of socom further , like a postmodern praetorian guard , our operators do n't serve at the will of the american people though congress holds the purse strings for special operations , decisions about individual missions are not generally put before them for approval individual force commanders overwhelmingly make those calls while mr obama has proved cautious in authorizing their use , the next commander in chief might not be so prudent clear away the smoke and romance , and special ops often function as highly trained kill squads sent out into the beyond in the name of country they are the best there is at that but this strategy ensures a recurring cycle of armed conflict , a decision of such significance that all citizens need to be weighing it and considering it , not just a select few my own experience with special ops is mixed i did n't have many positive encounters with them overseas as part of the fabled surge in iraq , my scout platoon and i patrolled a rural town north of baghdad for 15 months on a counterinsurgency mission that often seemed to conflict with that of the operators in early 2008 we were called to a farm to help pick up the pieces after a commando raid a tribal leader claimed that two of his lieutenants had been taken by mistake by the other americans , the ones with helicopters those other americans , the tribal leader told me , said that the two iraqis were brothers , and members of al qaeda in iraq now we were left to explain to the men s family why they were gone , why their house had been cycloned , and why a placard of mecca had been torn from a wall , and receive the hard stares from those men s children as we stood over a dead pet dog that had been shot during the raid i did n't tell that story to our dinner companions , though instead i talked about a visit i made to tacoma , wash , in 2011 , when i got to know the other side of these other americans i 'd left the military and was now a writer , or trying to be one a college friend and his ranger unit were returning from afghanistan , and i had visions of writing a tale of young men constantly at war but in between battles the rangers , the special ops unit that pat tillman left his nfl career in 2002 to join , is a proving ground of sorts , and attracts many younger soldiers though designed in part as an elite light infantry for airfield seizures , the rangers have seen their purpose morph more than ever , killorcapture raids are their raison d' tre they 're the fullbacks of the special ops world , all brute force and power , as memorialized in the film black hawk down we get on the fiveyard line , a ranger officer tells a dismissive delta soldier , you 're going to need my rangers the days in tacoma were spent trying \( and failing \) to get the rangers' public affairs office to approve onpost access the nights in tacoma were mostly spent in bars with young rangers looking to unwind from their last tour while also prepping for the next one they described the routine three to six months deployed , three to six months stateside , rinse and repeat elizabeth samet , who teaches english at west point , calls these service members war commuters more than one observer in tacoma , including some partners and spouses , termed it an addiction if that was true and it did n't apply to many , in my estimation they 'd have their reasons a number of rangers i met joked that vampires saw more light than they did during their deployments i came to see these young men in a way i had n't when i 'd worn the uniform myself , because of the way they embraced the endlessness of it all they were n't fighting for resolution , as we 'd been in iraq , or how we thought we 'd been peace over there was n't their goal calm back here was i did n't agree with that worldview , not at all but i still appreciated it on super bowl sunday , my friend and i were invited to watch the game with a group of older sergeants it seemed that most had already settled into their stateside lives , sharing diaper responsibilities with their wives , swapping war stories with one another in between while the adults watched the game , kids ran around with nerf guns as big as they were this was no cowboys and indians they were playing rangers and rangers they all wanted to be like daddy , and none were willing to play the role of an al qaeda jihadist , even in pretend the babyfaced ranger privates i helped sneak into bars in 2011 are hardened sergeants by now the sergeants i met are either in charge of entire ranger companies or have moved into the socalled black units of socom , like delta force they remain anonymous silhouettes to the country they serve , not just because their bosses at the pentagon want it that way , but because we do , too the other americans , indeed
the economic forces driving this year s nomination contests have been at work for decades why did the dam break now \? the share of the gross national product going to labor as opposed to the share going to capital fell from 688 percent in 1970 to 607 percent by 2013 , according to , an economics professor at the university of chicago s booth school of business even more devastating , the dropped by 36 percent , from 193 million in 1979 to 123 million in 2015 , while the increased by 43 percent , from 225 million to 321 million the postwar boom , when measured by the , continued into the early 1970s and then abruptly stopped \( see the accompanying chart \) in other words , the economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years starting in 2000 , two related developments added to worsening conditions for the middle and working classes first , that year marked the before 2000 , the size of both the lower and middle classes had shrunk , while the percentage of households with inflationadjusted incomes of 100 , 000 or more grew americans were moving up the ladder after 2000 , the middle class continued to shrink , but so did the percentage of households making 100 , 000 or more the only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of 35 , 000 or less americans were moving down the ladder \( this downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article \) the second adverse trend is that trade with china , which shot up after in december 2001 , imposed far larger costs on american workers than most economists anticipated , according to and the costs of trade with china have fallen most harshly on workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder in their january 2016 paper , , david autor , david dorn and gordon hanson , economists at mit , the university of zurich and the university of californiasan diego respectively , found that high wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and do not experience an earnings loss , argue autor and his colleagues low wage workers , in contrast , suffer large differential earnings loss , as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers this is why trump s charge that china has gotten the better of the united states has gained traction when i asked what factors provoked the populist insurgencies in both parties in this particular election cycle , he emailed back the stew , to continue hanson s metaphor , began to boil over with the cataclysmic in which many people left and right felt was caused by on wall street the collapse and the destruction it left in its wake was , without question , the most important economic and political event in recent years it was the financial crisis , what it revealed about governmentwall street links , and the fumbling of the response to it that put the nail in the coffin of trust in government , , an economist at mit , wrote in reply to my questions once trust in government was destroyed , those that had not benefited from the previous boom years became particularly easy pickings for populist rhetoric on , congress enacted , and president bush signed , the tarp funds bailed out major investment banks , and were also used , as the federal reserve bank of st louis put it , to make loans and direct equity investments to select auto industry participants , backstop credit markets , provide a lifeline to the american international group \( aig \) and provide ongoing support for government housing initiatives but in addition , tarp insulated the very institutions and executives that caused the collapse and the disastrous recession that followed i do n't think you can underestimate or underemphasize the impact of the bailout , , a scholar at the american enterprise institute , a centerright think washington think tank , told me in an email on jan 10 , 2010 , the supreme court granted those in upper income brackets additional privileges \( buttressed by subsequent \) that allowed wealthy individuals , corporations and unions to make unlimited political contributions by opening the door to the creation of super

reducing their own medical care in order to provide health coverage to the disproportionately minority poor by the midterm elections of 2010 , voter dissatisfaction among whites found expression in the tea party movement , which produced the sweeping in competitive congressional districts as well as of moderate and centerright republicans in primary contests voter anger was directed at two targets the undeserving rich and the undeserving poor the 2010 election pattern was repeated in the 2014 midterms to many of those who cast their ballots in anger in 2010 and 2014 , however , it appeared that their votes had not changed anything obamacare stayed in place ,  already disillusioned with the democratic party , these white voters became convinced that , not only on economic issues , but on cultural matters as well a asked voters if they agreed or disagreed with the statement more and more , i do n't identify with what america has become 72 percent of surveyed republicans concurred , compared to 58 percent of independents and 45 percent of democrats two thirds of republicans , 62 percent , agreed with the statement these days i feel like a stranger in my own country , compared to 53 percent of independents and 37 percent of democrats here is one place where trump s scathing dismissal of political correctness found fertile ground jared bernstein , a senior fellow at the center for budget and policy priorities , described in blunt terms the consequences of disillusionment with old guard republicans in these circumstances , bernstein wrote , the logic supporting the traditional republican party fell apart just as animosity to republican power brokers in washington intensified , the republican party began to splinter i asked , a stanford law professor , are party establishments now fictions , no longer able to exercise control \? persily responded on super tuesday , donald trump won that were up for grabs he collected far more delegates than ted cruz or marco rubio the tragedy of the 2016 campaign is that trump has mobilized a constituency with legitimate grievances on a fool s errand if he is shoved out of the field somehow , his supporters will remain bitter and enraged , convinced that a selfserving and malign elite defeated their leader if he prevails , a constituency that could force politicians to confront the problems of the working and middle class will waste its energies on a candidate incompetent to improve the lives of the credulous men and women lining up to support him
for a lesson on the riddles of human nature , look no further than dennis hastert go back to early 1999 , when he became the speaker of the house of representatives revisit the reason he got that job his republican colleagues were sick of provocateurs , had been burned by scandal and wanted a reprieve an antidote , even hastert fit the bill in their view he was n't merely above reproach he was too frumpy and flatout boring to be acquainted with reproach like an old shoe was how one prominent republican described him to a reporter at the time in the closet with that old shoe were skeletons , but no one around him knew it or could have guessed which kind and somehow hastert was n't haunted by them , or at least had never been impeded by them despite a history of sexually abusing boys as a high school teacher and coach , the old shoe stepped into politics , a line of work that invites examination and raises the stakes of any revelation , ensuring the most public shaming imaginable despite that history he accepted prominent positions on capitol hill was he fearful \? he showed no signs of it was he abashed \? not outwardly he joined his fellow republicans in publicly denouncing bill clinton s behavior with monica lewinsky , calling the president immoral he championed legislation to put repeat sexual offenders behind bars for life but perhaps hastert s history did inform his hesitation , as house speaker , to act on reports that mark foley , another republican congressman , had sent sexually explicit messages to underage congressional pages or perhaps that hesitation reflected nothing more than hastert s passivity and docility the old shoe never had much of a stride last week , at 74 , he appeared in a wheelchair in an illinois courtroom , where he received a 15month prison sentence for illegally structuring bank transactions in an attempt to conceal those decadesold instances of sexual abuse it was his turn to be publicly denounced the judge branded him a serial child molester but before we let this latest sad and infuriating story whiz past , before we file it under fallen leaders or blatant hypocrisy or wherever it best belongs , we should heed the important reminders and questions here there are morals aplenty in this old shoe one is the quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude will we ever learn \? hastert described himself as a bornagain christian and had a diploma from wheaton college in illinois , which advertises itself as explicitly christian and is an alma mater of billy graham s this was a factor in his colleagues' assessments of him as safe , uncontroversial this was a drum still being beaten by authors of letters urging the judge to treat hastert leniently tom delay , who served as the house majority whip and then the house majority leader under hastert , was one of those writers he told the judge that he , hastert and a pastor would routinely read and discuss the bible together in lunchtime sessions on capitol hill we held each other accountable and we studied god s word , wrote delay , later adding he is a good man that loves the lord he gets his integrity and values from him he does n't deserve what he is going through does n't deserve it because he prays in what delay , also a bornagain christian , considers the right way , to the right divinity \? perhaps that will earn hastert the most important forgiveness of all but it s no free pass for bringing pain into the lives of children he was paid to instruct and inspire the testimonials that hastert rounded up from prominent republicans demonstrate more than mercy and pity they affirm the degree to which pacts rather than principle govern partisan politics today his past is precisely the kind that republicans in particular express such unyielding horror toward but in rallying to his aid , they dismissed it as a blip in a life of selfless public service , to cite a phrase that his lawyer leaned on public service many politicians believe genuinely in it many are also enriched by it hastert among them his actions in congress increased the value of his private holdings in illinois his work as a lobbyist after he left the house in 2007 also fattened his net worth that s how he was able to shell out more than 15 million in hush money the old shoe had become a ferragamo did hastert have a specific , discrete attraction to boys \? or was he a gay or bisexual man in a time , place and culture that discouraged him from acknowledging that , led him to repress it and prompted its manifestation in stealthy , impermissible and destructive ways \? the ages of his victims , who were close to being young men , raise this possibility , giving us cause to ponder the price of making people feel unnecessary shame and of pushing them into the shadows nothing healthy happens there but another question fascinates me as much what was hastert thinking \? i do n't mean when he touched teenagers who lacked the maturity to consent to it and the power within that relationship to resist and report him i mean many years later , when he attended the funeral of one of those boys , who died from aids i mean in recent months , when he asked a prominent illinois republican to intervene with the judge though that man s brother would subsequently come forward to say that hastert had victimized him , too i mean when hastert bowed his head and burrowed into scripture with delay , pledging righteousness while burying sins for which he 'd never properly atoned my guess hastert had tucked away whole episodes of his past and walled off whole parts of himself , so that he could buy into others' notions of his decency , which were n't just notions but truths partial ones he was indeed the kind , humble , milquetoast man that so many colleagues deemed him to be that was a subdivision of him , coexisting with darker tracts of all the abilities that human beings possess , perhaps none is as mysterious as our talent for compartmentalization each of us is multiple people , and different ones emerge in different circumstances and relationships if we can never fully know somebody , it s not simply because his exterior does n't match his interior it s because there are so many chambers inside , and a few are more hidden than others , even from the person himself
the united states military academy at announced on tuesday that it would not punish 16 cadets who last week with raised fists , saying the gesture was intended to show unity and pride , and did not violate army regulations that prohibit engaging in partisan political activities while in uniform the photograph shows all but one of the black female seniors in the largest such group to ever graduate from west point , wearing traditional gray uniforms with sabers and arranged on the steps of the public military academy s oldest barracks a tradition of generations of seniors their version , with raised fists , fueled a storm of criticism as it circulated on social media a number of current and former members of the military said the raised fists were an inappropriate and divisive sign of allegiance with the black lives matter movement some called for the cadets' punishment or dismissal but an army concluded tuesday that the women intended to demonstrate unity , solidarity and pride , and that while what they did was inappropriate , it did not violate regulations i find that , based upon available evidence , none of the participants , through their actions , intended to show support for a political movement , said the investigator , whose name was redacted in a public copy of the inquiry finding released by west point in a to cadets , lt gen robert l caslen jr , the academy s superintendent , agreed that the women should not be punished , but stopped short of absolving them of responsibility as members of the profession of arms , we are held to a high standard , where our actions are constantly observed and scrutinized in the public domain , the letter said we all must understand that a symbol or gesture that one group of people may find harmless may offend others as army officers , we are not afforded the luxury of a lack of awareness of how we are perceived in deciding its response , west point , which is 80 percent male and 70 percent white , had to balance its desire to increase diversity with its need for uniformity among leaders , said mary tobin , a 2003 graduate active in minority recruiting it s hard these young cadets have a lot of demands put on them , ms tobin said you have to manage perception and be very careful in ways other students their age do n't it s not fair , but when you are a leader , you have to make challenges that others do n't , she said i am more than confident there will be a lot of cultural training on this issue because of the photo the photograph was one of three poses the women took in dress uniforms , the inquiry said , adding that the women said their intent was to showcase the awesome black women in our class after taking a serious photograph , and one making silly faces , two cadets proposed raising fists other women were hesitant , the investigator found they said , are we really doing this \? but one cadet assured them , we wo n't get in trouble , according to the inquiry s findings the photograph , which circulated via facebook and twitter , angered some at west point who found the raised fist long associated with black power movements offensive and divisive several members of the military alerted military newspapers and bloggers , saying the women had violated army regulations many west point graduates responded that they had raised fists as part of chants at football games and other celebrations without scrutiny , and questioned whether the women were being held to a different standard in his letter , general caslen echoed this sentiment , saying last december , on the night before the armynavy game , i joined hundreds of staff and graduates in raising our fist in support of the army football team during the armynavy pep rally video the time , place and manner of a symbol can also hold significant meaning and influence perception
rome not long into andy murray s first news conference since he parted ways with his coach , am lie mauresmo , he was asked if the end of their pairing was a blow to the idea of women coaching men in tennis in nearly two years with mauresmo , the highestprofile female coach in tennis , murray maintained a careerbest ranking of no 2 , reached two australian open finals and nearly singlehandedly led britain to a davis cup title so he did not agree with the premise of the question i think it did work , he said tuesday at the italian open i mean , for two years , i think , the results that we had were good he added when she first came into the team , i was really struggling , you know i was not doing well my confidence was low , and i was going the wrong direction then , obviously , when she came on board , my results actually really picked up i mean , for me , the time we spent together was positive it s just a shame i was n't able to win one of the major events , because that s what both of us wanted murray and mauresmo , both twotime grand slam singles champions , announced monday that they had mutually ended their partnership because of scheduling problems mauresmo , with a young son and duties as the french fed cup captain , had been able to spend only 10 days with murray since january murray made a comparison to roger federer s recent split with a male grand slam champion coach , which had drawn little scrutiny despite similar results and a similar conclusion roger stopped working with stefan edberg at the end of last year because stefan edberg wanted to spend more time with his family , did n't want to spend as much time traveling , said murray , who also has a baby daughter no one sort of batted an eyelid about that , you know \? so in my opinion , it s nothing to do with am lie being a woman i think it s the case of a lot of the explayers it takes a lot of time to do the job well and properly it s not easy to do that for four , five years in a row murray is working , in the interim , with the male coach jamie delgado , a former british player , who is able to be with murray most weeks of the year it is n't easy to find that , especially if you 're going for the explayers that have spent , you know , 15 , 20 years of their life on the road for 30 , 35 weeks a year , murray said they do n't always want to do it novak djokovic , who added the seventime major champion boris becker to his team at the beginning of the 2014 season , said he understood the limitations of working around becker s schedule certainly it is a challenge to organize properly the time spent on the tour , for the former players that also have their own families and private lives , and different things , he said djokovic added that mauresmo would have faced additional obstacles in her calendar after becoming a mother last year , which he called the biggest and toughest job you can have in the world the sustainability of the trend of former stars serving as coaches for top players remains in question but murray s will be remembered as bold , given the near invisibility of female coaches in professional men s tennis even on the wta tour , none of the top 25 women have female coaches pam shriver , a commentator and former player , said murray and mauresmo had been pioneers in a groundbreaking situation , which should expand the minds of men and women alike i think all these things help both genders open up their mindsets to possibilities that people might not have thought of before , shriver said in the case of men s tennis players , she continued , the possibilities included the notion that a female with great tennis knowledge and elite tennis experience , like mauresmo , can help communicate and help make a male player a better player , to help them in a stage of their career , by being the best lead coach at any given time shriver added not that it s going to open up the floodgates , but people now will think outside the box , and think not just who is the best male coach available \? ' but who is the best coach available \? , ' and that would include females shriver said that women who wanted top coaching positions should not be complacent about their wishes there are certainly some good female coaches out there , but getting the opportunity to coach at the highest level , meaning a top10 , top5 player , those opportunities have been rare for women coaches , she said but i think also the women coaches have to market themselves they have to let their talents be known they ca n't sit on the sidelines and expect it to happen they have to work the networks , and work with the agents , and get their r sum s and ideas out and market their ideas and their talent shriver credited mauresmo with helping murray emerge as a leader on various issues , including feminism and performanceenhancing drugs mauresmo s two years are not just about oncourt results , but also andy developing as a person , as a leader , shriver said he s developing a really great reputation as the one in the big four who is ok with pushing the envelope on issues although murray did not win a third grand slam title under mauresmo and won only one of 13 matches against djokovic , shriver said that she saw the partnership as entirely positive i think the feeling is all good for these two years , she said it s not just all about how many majors you win
naypyidaw , myanmar less than two months after a civilian government took many of the levers of power in for the first time in a half century , secretary of state conducted a seemingly routine diplomatic meeting on sunday with the most improbable burmese counterpart , the nobel peace prizewinning dissident who now sits atop a government that had long kept her under house arrest their discussion focused on s brutal treatment of a muslim minority group at a moment when outsiders are questioning whether ms , a hero of the human rights movement , has a double standard and on the delicate question of whether myanmar s military leaders once had a program in place to build a nuclear weapon yet mr kerry seemed struck by the very idea that he was having the conversation at all he recalled visiting ms aung san suu kyi at her lakeside home in yangon , when it was still the capital of what was then called burma , and sparring with members of the junta they assured me that there were no political prisoners in the country , he said , and tried to tell me that the people of myanmar prized order more than they prized democratic rights president obama has already been to myanmar twice , and mr kerry several times but it was only in april that ms aung san suu kyi , 69 , became state counselor and foreign minister and moved into her offices in naypyidaw , a strange capital carved into a valley a dozen years ago by military leaders obsessed with the fear that the united states , among others , was preparing to invade the meeting between mr kerry and ms aung san suu kyi was a milestone in one of the obama administration s biggest foreign policy experiments to coax isolated , longtime adversaries into engaging with the united states and gradually moving toward more democratic governance iran and cuba have taken steps but strongly resist fundamental change efforts with never got off the ground why that policy succeeded in myanmar will be studied for decades , and had as much to do with personalities as institutions chiefly inside the military they accepted defeat , and have generally supported the political transition , benjamin j rhodes , the deputy national security adviser , said in washington last week , when the united states on myanmar this work is incomplete , and the military s role in politics continues to go beyond what would constitute a full transition to democracy in fact , as soon as mr kerry left ms aung san suu kyi s office , his motorcade sped along this capital s empty , eightlane roads up into the hills to see the nation s other center of power the commander in chief of the armed forces , senior gen min aung hlaing , a slight man in a green uniform with none of the nobel laureate s international profile his sparkling headquarters , with 40foot ceilings and gold trim , and huge parade fields outside , left little question who was in charge of the scarce resources of one of southeast asia s poorest nations at a news conference with ms aung san suu kyi , mr kerry acknowledged that he had expressed longstanding concerns that myanmar s close relationship with north korea could include the transfer of technology in 2011 , a state department report concluded that myanmar might be violating its pledges under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , though united states officials , citing the classified nature of the data , have never publicly discussed the intelligence behind their suspicions i did raise the issue with her , mr kerry said when pressed and i am satisfied that with respect to north korea , he continued , clearly myanmar has taken the steps to address that issue , and we 're satisfied that we 're on the same page ms aung san suu kyi s comment on the nuclear ambitions of her predecessors drew laughter from burmese and americans alike if they did , they have n't said anything about that to me , she said the previous government was not in the habit of informing me of what they were doing ms aung san suu kyi is not myanmar s president because the constitution , as drafted by the military , prohibits anyone whose children hold passports from another country from serving as president \( ms aung suu kyi s husband , who died in 1999 , was british , and their sons , kim and alexander , were born in britain \) a political ally , htin kyaw , was placed in the office , allowing ms aung suu kyi to  there has already been a sharp disagreement with her american benefactors she recently urged the new united states ambassador here , scot a marciel , the muslim minority rohingya , as they are known by much of the outside world emotive terms make it very difficult for us to find a peaceful and sensible resolution to our problems , ms aung san suu kyi told reporters on sunday all that we are asking is that people should be aware of the difficulties we are facing and to give us enough space to solve all our problems by united states estimates , 125 , 000 rohingya are kept in camps under strict travel restrictions battles between buddhists and muslims , who have been denied basic rights , including citizenship , in the western state of rakhine buddhist nationalists in ms aung san suu kyi s party oppose granting rights to the rohingya , and her request to mr marciel seemed to be a concession to them from the air , naypyidaw , with its modern airport , luxury hotels and wide , carless boulevards , seems almost like a mirage , since it did not exist when i toured the area 30 years ago on a rail and backpack trip the rickety train i took decades ago was a leftover from colonial times it still runs on the same tracks through the town of pyinmana , long a military stronghold a return visit there on saturday showed that little had changed while the generals had built themselves a capital city resembling a florida golf resort four miles away , pyinmana remains stuck in the 1950s , with rundown markets , badly paved roads and stray dogs soaking up the sun but at least there were ordinary burmese there few were visible in naypyidaw , save for the families that came to see the uppatasanti pagoda , and a display of captured white elephants , considered a sign of national power ms aung san suu kyi is clearly adapting her own diplomatic style , and it resembles the style she employed in 15 years of house arrest utter calm asked sunday about the fact that the united states had retained some economic sanctions as leverage for economic and political reform and a rewriting of the constitution to ensure civilian control over the military , she seemed unperturbed we 're not afraid of sanctions , she said we 're not afraid of scrutiny we believe that if we are going along the right path , all sanctions should be lifted in good time

over four decades , at least 50 priests and other church employees molested hundreds of children in a small roman catholic diocese in central pennsylvania , and in many cases their superiors knew of the abuses but did not remove the priests or notify law enforcement , according to a grand jury report released on tuesday but none of the findings will result in prosecution , according to state attorney general kathleen g kane , whose office led the investigation , because the statutes of limitations on all alleged crimes have expired names a dozen priests who admitted to church officials , to the grand jury or both that they had molested children , and other cases where church records made clear that their superiors believed they were guilty none were taken to law enforcement , and in cases where police or prosecutors learned of allegations , the report says , church officials worked to hush them up they placed their desire to avoid public scandal over the wellbeing of innocent children , the report says the diocese of altoonajohnstown is only the most recent to be the target of an investigation and a report by a grand jury or attorney general for shielding priests who abused children but the numbers it cites are striking for a diocese that claims fewer than 100 , 000 catholics there have been public allegations in the past against some of the priests named in the report , including the rev joseph d maurizio jr , who is to be sentenced on wednesday in a case that drew international attention father maurizio , who raised money for an orphanage in honduras , was convicted in federal court in september of sexually abusing boys at the orphanage , money laundering and possessing child pornography bishop joseph adamec , former leader of the diocese , learned of allegations against father maurizio in 2009 , according to the grand jury report and the charity that sponsored the orphanage but bishop adamec and his successor , bishop mark l bartchak , at a church in central city , pa , until shortly before his arrest in 2014 given that record , anne barrett doyle , codirector of , said she was puzzled that the grand jury report did not hold bishop bartchak accountable , as well in a statement , the diocese said it had cooperated fully with authorities throughout the investigation , and will continue to do so the report offers a scathing picture of bishop james hogan , who led the diocese from 1966 to 1986 , and died in 2005 , as a leader who repeatedly persuaded the police and prosecutors to drop criminal cases against priests , failed to discipline people he knew were abusers , and responded to complaints about predatory priests by relocating them to jobs where they could molest again it contains serious , but less harsh , criticism of his successor , bishop adamec , who retired in 2011 but retains his title it cites a few priests who were allowed to continue ministry for years after the diocese learned of allegations against them , including three who remain active priests , and notes that the diocese turned none of the priests in to the police or prosecutors the records indicate that with over half the priests , the diocese did not learn of alleged abuse until decades had passed , when no legal action was possible the bishop s lawyer , david berardinelli , released a response describing the grand jury report as onesided and unfair it notes that unlike his predecessors , bishop adamec frequently suspended accused pedophile priests , often soon after learning of the allegations , and asked the church hierarchy to defrock them those he allowed to remain in active ministry have had no new allegation of abuse of a minor since then pope francis called last year for the to create a tribunal on judging bishops accused of negligence , but the vatican has yet to do so last month , francis said in a news conference that bishops who kept abusive priests in ministry should resign the report names 35 priests , most of them now dead , who have been accused of child molestation , and cites other abusers who are not named the information is based mostly on documents taken from diocesan offices in 2014 under a search warrant

' said chris barclay , the american owner of a boutique guesthouse , the old theatre inn , in the countryside outside the sideng square none of that has happened here , which is great mr barclay and his wife have been using their own money to renovate the , mainly in thanks to the fertility aspect of the goddess guanyin there his thai wife , a buddhist , became pregnant at age 45 after praying to guanyin on a visit their first child had died years earlier mr barclay said he had also been inspired by the marketplace work done in sideng that project began with jacques feiner , a swiss conservation expert who had worked on the old city in sana , yemen around 2000 , he was looking for a project along the south silk road and settled on the shaxi valley because the scale of the sideng marketplace was manageable , said , a team leader and swisstrained architect at mr feiner s urging , the , based in new york , added the marketplace to its 2002 watch list of 100 most endangered sites the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich and the government of jianchuan county put together a conservation team mr huang , originally from , joined the team and came to shaxi in 2003 the team had an advantage doing conservation here the local bai carpenters are considered among the most skilled in china and get commissions across the country in this process , the main purpose was to understand the local tradition , the local knowledge , the local craftsmanship , mr huang said we wanted to see how far we could go with the local knowledge the team restored lowslung wooden facades around the old marketplace and a 100yearold caravansary most of the plaza s buildings are just a century old because they have been repeatedly rebuilt bandits burned down the buildings in constant raids when the project began , most of the buildings had been abandoned in 2006 , the buds of commerce appeared a couple from faraway shenzhen asked to rent one of the smaller buildings near the theater they wanted to live there and turn it into a cafe mr huang said this went against his idea for the plaza he had intended for the fronts to be shops and the interiors to be courtyards open to the public i did n't agree to that , he said with a laugh as he sat in the square one recent morning , pointing to the old tree cafe run by the couple the government wanted them to move in , so they started living there and running the business there the xingjiao temple took four years to refurbish a fierce blue guardian deity and a red one flank the main entrance the bai here worship local gods and practice esoteric buddhism having the temple and theater together facing each other is a local custom , mr huang said the locals think the buddha should enjoy the performances along with the people i'm working on another temple in shaxi where there is a stage in the main temple area you move a wooden god to face the stage that temple , chenghuang , is part of the next phase of the renovation project , as envisioned by mr huang founding community centers across shaxi to help residents tap into the tourist economy mr huang , who still lives in shaxi even though his swiss teammates have left , said the first such center would be at chenghuang temple his plans call for the centers to have computers where villagers can go online tourists following cycling and walking routes through the valley would mingle with the villagers at those centers thirteen villages would be part of this network , and residents might start homegrown industries like craft beer to appeal to the tourist crowds , he said we can have internetbased education , he said this is a way to help people to understand more and get the capability to develop things on their own guesthouses and cafes have boomed in sideng village , but they are mostly run by outsider chinese rather than locals the shaxi horse pen 46 youth hostel next to the central theater was opened in 2010 by huo wanfei , 36 , who moved here from sichuan province after visiting as a backpacker now that the swissled team is done with the plaza , these chinese outsiders are the main force behind renovating buildings , mostly to start tourist businesses ms huo said she had employed local carpenters and completed the renovation after much trial and error it made me realize there s a way in nature that makes things work out , she said the evolution of the village is beginning to mirror what happened in lijiang the locals are renting out their homes to outsiders and moving elsewhere so visitors to sideng increasingly meet chinese outsiders and not bai locals like ms he the market is driving shaxi in this direction , mr huang said this is not something in our control that is why i'm doing this new project to encourage a community economy
tampa , fla while the were on the baseball fields on friday , throwing , catching , running and hitting , greg bird was doing none of those he is one of 69 players the yankees have in camp , but his routine is different he walks around the nearby minor league complex , as much to clear his head as to work his legs he cannot lift anything with his right hand , though he took a small step forward on wednesday when he took his right arm out of a sling on friday , he had begun doing rangeofmotion exercises , a little more than three weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a tear in his labrum bird , a firstbase prospect who the yankees clung to at the nonwaiver trade deadline last july , was called up shortly afterward to provide a break for mark teixeira and designated hitter alex rodriguez what was supposed to be a cameo for bird , now 23 , turned out to be headlining role when teixeira fouled a ball off his own shin on aug 17 and had only three more atbats the rest of the season thrust into the lineup in the middle of a playoff chase , bird hit 261 with 11 home runs and 31 rbi in 178 plate appearances teixeira was the only yankee with more than 60 plate appearances who topped bird s 871 onbaseplusslugging percentage this is a guy that proved in those two months that he belongs in the big leagues , teixeira said there are lot of guys that have hype coming out of the minors and never do anything i think he s going to have a great career the way bird and pitcher luis severino performed down the stretch , neither one being overwhelmed and at times becoming the yankees' best hitter and pitcher , helped confirm that the longawaited next generation of homegrown anchors might finally be on its way even if teixeira s return meant that bird might spend most of this season in the minor leagues but when bird s right shoulder , which had been troublesome most of the season , still felt unstable after a couple of months of rest and rehabilitation , the yankees' doctors recommended surgery so that the injury would not become chronic you work your whole life to get to that point , to be in the major leagues and go out and help your team win games every day , said bird , who will miss the 2016 season to not be able to do that is extremely disappointing the shoulder injury sidelined him in may and continued to be uncomfortable at times , though the discomfort was something he learned to manage he rarely threw at the end of the season while general manager brian cashman had been saying since the end of last season that bird would play every day at scranton wilkesbarre rather than sporadically for the yankees , bird said he wanted to force the issue with his play i was open to doing whatever , bird said but i was coming into camp to make the team i was n't coming into camp to go to scranton manager joe girardi said that bird could still get something out of this camp , even if the most challenging exercise is a sudoku puzzle it is an opportunity to observe , talk to veterans and be engaged i think it s important for him to be here , just for his psyche , girardi said the injury could also complicate the yankees' plan for next season if bird had a productive year in scranton wilkesbarre and in the bronx , he would have been primed to take over at first base next season , when teixeira s eightyear , 180 million contract runs out now , if teixeira , who will be 36 in april , produces another year like last season he was leading the yankees with 31 home runs and 79 rbi when he was hurt and there are questions about bird s health , what do the yankees do \? it s tough now , bird said the best thing for the yankees and the best thing for me is to be healthy when i do get back inside pitch aaron judge , the 6foot7 , 275pound outfielder , hit a mammoth home run in batting practice , belting it about 40 feet above the leftfield scoreboard i did n't see them , i heard them , alex rodriguez said of some of judge s long drives joe girardi said it was hard to put too much stock in spring training when assessing prospects like judge , who struggled at times last season when he was promoted to class aaa , where pitchers were generally craftier than at class aa a better indicator of judge s progress will be how he performs at scranton wilkesbarre , girardi said the yankees accommodated greg bird s request to switch uniform numbers , to 33 from 31 he said it was a coincidence that no 33 was worn by larry bird
no sooner was the ebola virus subdued in africa than another virus , zika , began sweeping through south and central america it has been linked to and is threatening to invade the united states it is imperative that the world health organization not repeat its sluggish response to the ebola crisis and act urgently this time to mobilize international action until it reached the western hemisphere , the zika virus related to dengue , yellow fever and west nile virus and named after the ugandan forest where it was first identified almost 70 years ago had caused little more than relatively mild , flulike infections but in the nine months since it came to the americas , it has moved swiftly through brazil and two dozen other countries and territories , spread by mosquitoes of the aedes species , which can breed in the tiniest pools of water and usually bite during the day , making them especially hard to control though not particularly dangerous to the person infected , the spread of zika has been accompanied by a huge spike in microcephaly , a congenital and irreversible deformation of the skull in newborn babies the number of reported cases in brazil jumped from 147 in 2014 to nearly 4 , 000 in 2015 , leaving health officials with little doubt although no firm scientific proof that zika was responsible scientists have also identified a possible link between the virus and the neurological disorder known as the guillainbarr syndrome at present there is no vaccine , no cure and no widely available test for zika infection in their absence , the obvious course is to avoid mosquito bites by wearing clothes that cover arms and legs , and using airconditioning and screens and insect repellents containing deet brazil , which is hosting the olympic games this summer , has begun an extensive to eradicate mosquitoes , including the deployment of 220 , 000 soldiers to search for breeding sites , and has urged women to avoid getting pregnant until the outbreak is brought under control el salvador women to delay pregnancy until 2018 in the united states , the centers for disease control and prevention a list of countries pregnant women would be wise to avoid and has urged pregnant women who have traveled to affected areas to see a doctor and determine whether a test is required none of that is likely to quickly end the scourge , and no country can do that on its own on the contrary , the virus could migrate to southern areas of the united states when winter ends regrettably , despite these actions , the world health organization seems , once again , to be dozing and has yet to generate a broad and coordinated international response by coincidence , the who executive board is currently meeting in geneva , so this is the perfect time for the agency to show leadership by convening an emergency committee of experts to take stock of the zika pandemic and advise the who director general , dr margaret chan , on how best to combat it
factory farm operators believe that the less americans know about what goes on behind their closed doors , the better for the industry that s because the animals sent through those factories often endure  cows too sick to walk are across cement floors pigs are with sledgehammers chickens are and stomped to death and accepted industry practices , like confining animals in impossibly small cages , are just as brutal nearly always , this treatment comes to light only because courageous employees or those posing as employees take undercover video and release it to the public the industry should welcome such scrutiny as a way to expose the worst operators instead , the industry s lobbyists have taken the opposite approach , pushing for the passage of , which ban undercover recordings on farms and in slaughterhouses these measures have , but they have been enacted in eight none has gone as far as north carolina , where a new law that took effect jan 1 aims to silence whistleblowers not just at agricultural facilities , but at all workplaces in the state that includes , among others , nursing homes , day care centers , and veterans' facilities anyone who violates the law say , by secretly taping abuses of elderly patients or farm animals and then sharing the recording with the media or an advocacy group can be sued by business owners for bad publicity and be required to pay a fine of 5 , 000 for each day that person is gathering information or recording without authorization the law originally singled out factoryfarm expos s , but after it twice failed to pass in the face of resistance from animalrights activists , lawmakers succeeded in pushing through a version that covered everyone equally gov pat mccrory , who said he was concerned the law would make it harder for employees to report illegal activity , the measure , but the state s legislature , the general assembly , overrode the veto last june the law exempts those who report abuses directly to their bosses or state authorities , but its intended effect is to shut down a very effective means of getting important information to the public as one of its sponsors told a senate committee last year , the whole point is to stop people who would go running out to a news outlet this is a clear violation of the constitutional freedoms of speech and the press , as a coalition of animalwelfare , consumer protection and goodgovernment groups filed in january they have precedent to back them up , in the form of a decision by a federal judge last august that an aggag law in idaho on freespeech grounds , the first such ruling in the country activists who pose as employees to gain access to farming operations , the judge wrote , actually advance core first amendment values by exposing misconduct to the public eye and facilitating dialogue on issues of considerable public interest as far back as the publication of which documented the horrific conditions inside chicago meatpacking plants in the early 20th century , the public has relied on journalists and activists to expose dangerous abuses and misconduct by businesses the outcry that follows revelations about factory farms has led to important policy changes , like banning some of the worst kinds of intensive confinement of farm animals the secrecy promoted by aggag laws should have no place in american society
jakarta , indonesia thousands of children working in s tobacco industry , one of the world s largest , are being subjected to poisoning and exposed to , according to a report released wednesday that called for establishing traceable supply chains to discourage the use of  the , , based in new york , said that many indonesian children working on tobacco farms , mostly on the country s main island of java , suffer from nausea , , headaches or , all of which can be signs that nicotine has seeped into the skin the children , who usually work without protective clothing , are also exposed to pesticides , and they face the additional hazards of doing heavy labor in extreme heat using sharp tools , the report from the rights group said kids are handling tobacco in their bare hands , and it can soak into the skin , margaret wurth , a children s rights researcher for and one of the report s authors , said in an interview in jakarta before its release the report , titled the harvest is in my blood , calls on domestic and foreign tobacco companies that buy the crop to ban suppliers that employ underage children indonesia is trying to put its palm , the world s largest , under similar scrutiny by ensuring that the oil is sold from sustainable sources that do not contribute to the destruction of rain forests the government , major palm oil producers and industry associations have signed on to the effort , but it remains a work in progress most indonesian tobacco is sold on the open market , making it virtually impossible to determine where it was produced indonesia is the world s  agriculture , including smallscale , familyrun farms , is the country s largest industry the international labor organization has estimated that more than 15 million indonesian children do agricultural work children between the ages of 13 and 15 are legally allowed to do light work on tobacco plantations during hours when school is not in session but human rights watch s investigation , which covered planting and harvesting seasons across java and the island of lombok in 2014 and 2015 , found that children as young as 8 were doing heavy labor , ms wurth said virtually all of indonesia s more than 500 , 000 tobacco farms are familyrun operations on 25 acres of land or less , according to the report , which said that adult workers as well as children were engaging in risky practices there s no meaningful training or health education , ms wurth said she said that most indonesian children working in tobacco fields do not go to local health clinics when they become ill , making it difficult to determine whether the number who get sick is in the thousands or the tens of thousands we also do n't know what the longterm health impacts might be , she said human rights watch said it had shared its findings with 13 indonesian and multinational tobacco companies operating here and that 10 had replied none of the indonesian companies gave a detailed response , and two did not respond to repeated inquiries , according to the rights group
leading up to the holidays , the were already the best team in the eastern conference then , on dec 20 , kyrie irving , their star point guard , returned from an injury , playing in his first game since june with irving , the cavaliers were 82 entering sunday night s game against the philadelphia 76ers , and had lost only one game in which irving has played for his part , irving has returned in style he was averaging 208 points a game in january , and he scored 25 against the toronto raptors and 32 against the washington wizards irving is also shooting well , though he seems to be having trouble from the 3point line more important , he looks fast , limber and healthy a far cry from the player who seemed debilitated even before he limped off the floor in game 1 of the nba finals last year irving s return boosts a team that already seemed very likely to return to the finals the cavaliers have the most efficient offense and best overall point differential in the eastern conference they are a team filled with capable scorers , none more so than lebron james , whom many still consider to be the best player in the world , even as stephen curry has been making inroads on the claim in his 13th season , king james retains his royal air he is still one of the top scorers in the league , averaging 25 5 points a game entering sunday along with 74 rebounds and 59 assists he is also shooting well from the floor , although , like irving , he is having trouble hitting 3pointers , shooting 276 percent from long range this season , the worst average of his career but despite the difficulty that the cavaliers' two best scorers are having making 3s , cleveland takes plenty of shots from behind the arc \( 281 per game \) and makes 362 percent of them , seventh in the league that is largely thanks to a supporting cast that includes matthew dellavedova , iman shumpert and j r smith , all of whom average at least three 3point attempts per game smith averages 61 attempts and converts 393 percent , which recently led james to support his bid for a spot in the 3point shootout over the allstar weekend after smith , it is kevin love who makes the most 3pointers for the team almost a season and a half after leaving minnesota for cleveland , love looks to have shed much of the baggage that weighed him down when he first arrived though his numbers have not changed much he was scoring more in the early months of this season but has since slowed he has become better integrated into the offense he often works from the post , where he can set up baskets for his teammates or pop out for an easy shot from the baseline the cavaliers are 186 against teams from their conference , and 73 against western conference teams but on christmas , they fell to the golden state warriors in a rematch of last season s finals , and thursday will mark the first time this season that they will face the \( thursday , 8 pm eastern , tnt \) , a team that has recently looked as good as golden state , maybe even a touch better the spurs are 220 at home this season they have won 31 in a row in their arena , san antonio s att center , dating to the last regular season but they do not look invincible a streaking knicks team nearly defeated them in san antonio on friday night , scoring 9 points in a row late in the fourth quarter to make things close before eventually losing , 10099 before that game , san antonio , which is on a sevengame winning streak over all , had been blowing teams out , scoring at least 110 points and winning by at least 18 points in four consecutive games in a league in which fielding small lineups is in vogue , the spurs have been dominating teams by dominating the paint they score a higher percentage of their points inside than any team in the league other than the knicks and the minnesota timberwolves , quite a feat for a squad that scores so efficiently but in the cavaliers , the spurs will face a team that can defend the paint better than most the cavs' big men , timofey mozgov and tristan thompson , are capable rebounders who can make it difficult to score inside if the spurs are to lose a game at home , the cavaliers seem uniquely qualified to deliver the loss and if the cavaliers do manage to beat san antonio on thursday , it will be a sign that this season s nba finals no matter which of the dominant western conference teams makes it has a good chance to be one of the more exciting championship series in recent memory
if you have somehow missed watching the golden state warriors this season , you might have a quaint notion of how basketball is played you might believe , for instance , that 3point shots are difficult or that players should generally avoid hoisting jumpers 35 feet from the basket or that , in the , a team cannot clinch a playoff berth in february , with six weeks left in the season none of that is true anymore , thanks to one player stephen curry , a butterfly with a jump shot who is reshaping people s understanding of the game jargon usually found on airport bookstore display racks has come to the hardwood , thanks to curry he is an outlier he has caused a tipping point in basketball the biggest disrupter in sports is on display in where else \? the bay area in recent days , curry has broken the league record for 3pointers in a season which he did for the first time three seasons ago and the warriors \( 535 \) still have 24 games left to play , starting tuesday night at home against the atlanta hawks he has made 288 3pointers this season , eclipsing the 286 he made last season \( so he is now no 1 , no 2 and , you guessed it , no 3 on the singleseason list , with 272 during 201213 \) the warriors could lose the rest of their games and still make the playoffs they will not lose them all , of course , because they tend to beat nearly all of their opponents , and usually by large margins the warriors experienced a rare close call saturday night when the oklahoma city thunder took them to overtime curry won the game with a looping shot from a few feet inside the halfcourt line once considered remarkable , now considered well within his comfort zone as everyone , from players to coaches to fans , tries to make sense of curry s breakout performances , some context is desperately needed to whom can we compare this shooting master \? basketball has had other captivating stars like magic johnson , michael jordan and lebron james , who all streaked to lasting fame but the curry phenomenon is different because of his size he is a sinewy 6 feet 3 inches , 190 pounds and because of the way in which he dominates games by scoring far from the basket , somehow stretching the court beyond its conceivable limits it may be more useful to look beyond basketball , to two athletes who redefined their respective sports wayne gretzky , hockey s goalscoring wizard , and , the legendary homerun hitter long before curry began smashing records for 3point proficiency , gretzky was elevating statistical anomalies to an art form with the edmonton oilers during the 198081 season , gretzky set the nhl record for points in a season , with 164 , which included 55 goals and 109 assists it was a remarkable feat and one he quickly overshadowed by posting 212 points the following season it was one of those ohmygod kind of breakout moments , said eric zweig , an author and hockey historian nobody had done anything close to that kind of thing before curry and gretzky are kindred spirits quick , explosive and capable of controlling play despite relatively small frames for their sport \( gretzky was listed at 6 feet , 185 pounds \) curry can find spaces where it s almost impossible for defenders to cover him , zweig said from one recordsetting season to the next , gretzky managed to increase his production by 293 percent by way of comparison , consider that if curry continues to make 3pointers for the remainder of the season at his current rate , he would finish with 407 , which would be a 423 percent increase from his recordsetting total last season yet in the department of athletic outliers , curry and gretzky were both preceded by ruth , who broke the singleseason record for home runs in 1919 by slugging 29 during his final season with the boston red sox the next year , in his first season with the yankees , ruth outdid himself by smashing 54 an 86 percent increase from his previous record total john thorn , the official historian for major league baseball , noted that the numbers are actually deceiving in 1919 , ruth hit 20 home runs on the road but just 9 at home , where he had to deal with fenway park s thencavernous dimensions , which included a distance of 510 feet straightaway to center field ruth clearly benefited from the cozier confines of the polo grounds the next season given those ballpark variables , thorn said , a more useful metric to study is slugging percentage and those , too , were off the charts for ruth compared to the rest of the league in 1920 , his slugging percentage was 847 , also a record george sisler of the st louis browns was a distant second , with a slugging percentage of 632 \( he was also second in home runs , with 19 \) ruth had a profound effect on the way other hitters began to approach their atbats , thorn said where the goal was once to slap base hits through the infield during the socalled deadball era of the early 20th century , ruth showed that hitting for power was possible and highly productive above all , thorn said , ruth was great at a time when most players simply were not in sports , players tend to improve , on average , with each passing decade as a result , thorn said , it becomes more and more difficult for one player to emerge as some sort of outlier the margin between average and great diminishes over time so it was noteworthy when barry bonds of the san francisco giants came along in 2001 and not only set the singleseason homerun record , with 73 , but also broke ruth s 81yearold record for singleseason slugging percentage \( 863 \) bonds , of course , later became known as one of the more notorious figures of baseball s steroid era , which may have helped explain his hitting prowess but to have a slugging percentage and an onbase percentage so far beyond the league norm well , that s what curry is doing now , thorn said thorn said that curry s emergence was partly the result of nba teams' paying more attention to analytics and , in particular , to the simple fact that a 3pointer is worth more than a 2point field goal the math is with them , thorn said , and that s why lowpost play is kind of disappearing , too when ruth began to hit all his home runs back in the 1920s , baseball officials recognized the excitement he had created many teams drew their fences in , thorn said , and future ballparks were built with smaller dimensions to enable more hitters to slug homers thorn said he could see curry having the opposite effect on the nba he has made shooting 3pointers look so easy , and so effectively revealed to other teams the shot s potency , that league officials might have no choice but to push the line back a few feet , thorn said it would be a real crusher for most players most everyone , that is , except curry he appears to be on another planet at this moment , thorn said
i was one of the first women in the san francisco fire department for more than a dozen years , i worked on a busy rig in a tough neighborhood where rundown houses caught fire easily and gangs fought with machetes and 22s i 've pulled a bloated body from the bay , performed cpr on a baby and crawled down countless smoky hallways i expected people to question whether i had the physical ability to do the job \( even though i was a 5foot10 , 150pound excollege athlete \) what i did n't expect was the question i heard more than any other are n't you scared \? it was strange and insulting to have my courage doubted i never heard my male colleagues asked this apparently , fear is expected of women this fear conditioning begins early many studies have shown that physical activity sports , hiking , playing outdoors is tied to girls' selfesteem and yet girls are often warned away from doing anything that involves a hint of risk one focused on , coincidentally , a playground fire pole , is particularly revealing it was published in the journal of applied developmental psychology and showed that parents cautioned their daughters about the dangers of the fire pole significantly more than they did their sons and were much more likely to assist them but both moms and dads directed their sons to face their fears , with instruction on how to complete the task on their own i spoke recently to a friend who admitted that she cautioned her daughter much more than her son but she s very klutzy , the mom explained i wondered , was n't there a way even a klutzy child could take risks \? my friend agreed there might be , but only halfheartedly , and i could see on her face that maternal instinct was sparring with feminism , and feminism was losing i had been a klutzy child , too i was also shy , and scared of many things big kids , whatever might be under my bed at night , school but i pored over national geographic and harriet the spy i knew all about sir lancelot and the knights of the round table , who wandered the countryside swearing oaths of bravery and honor none of these characters talked about fear they talked about courage , exploration and exciting deeds so i biked down a steep country road \( and hit a car \) i sledded down an icy hill \( and hit a tree \) i do n't remember my parents freaking out they seemed to understand that mishaps were part of childhood i got a few stitches , and kept biking and sledding misadventures meant that i should try again with each triumph over fear and physical adversity , i gained confidence i recently asked my mother why she never tried to stop me she said that her own mother had been very fearful , gasping at anything remotely roughandtumble i had been so discouraged from having adventures , and i wanted you to have a more exciting childhood , she told me my mom is an outlier according to a study in the journal of pediatric psychology last year , parents are to be more careful after mishaps that are not lifethreatening but do entail a trip to the emergency room it seems like a reasonable warning but there is a drawback , and the researchers remarked on it girls may be less likely than boys to try challenging physical activities , which are important for developing new skills this study points to an uncomfortable truth we think our daughters are more fragile , both physically and emotionally , than our sons nobody is saying that injuries are good , or that girls should be reckless but risk taking is important gever tulley , the author of 50 dangerous things \( you should let your children do \) encourages girls and boys to own pocketknives , light fires and , arguing that dangerous activities under supervision can teach kids responsibility , problemsolving and confidence it follows that by cautioning girls away from these experiences , we are not protecting them we are failing to prepare them for life when a girl learns that the chance of skinning her knee is an acceptable reason not to attempt the fire pole , she learns to avoid activities outside her comfort zone soon many situations are considered too scary , when in fact they are simply exhilarating and unknown fear becomes a goto feminine trait , something girls are expected to feel and express at will by the time a girl reaches her tweens no one bats an eye when she screams at the sight of an insect when girls become women , this fear manifests as deference and timid decision making we try to counter this conditioning by urging ourselves to lean in books on female empowerment proliferate on our shelves i admire what these writers are trying to do but they come far too late we must chuck the insidious language of fear \( be careful ! that s too scary ! \) and instead use the same terms we offer boys , of bravery and resilience we need to embolden girls to master skills that at first appear difficult , even dangerous and it s cute when a 10yearold girl screeches , i'm too scared when i worked as a firefighter , i was often scared of course i was so were the men but fear was n't a reason to quit i put my fear where it belonged , behind my feelings of focus , confidence and courage then i headed , with my crew , into the burning building
washington when finally began to reveal the names of his foreign policy advisers during a swing through washington this week , the republican foreign policy establishment looked at them and had a pretty universal reaction who \? many foreign policy experts have been wondering for months about who might be counseling the leading republican presidential candidate , who has unfurled such provocative proposals as reinstating waterboarding and barring foreign muslims from entering the country mr trump has promised to hire the world s brightest minds to make up for his lack of political experience , but his new foreign policy team left some of the country s leading experts in the field scratching their heads as they tried to identify his choices and on a day when the islamic state struck a blow to a major european capital , mr trump s new team faced additional scrutiny many of us who have held senior positions in previous republican administrations have been asking each other if we have ever heard of them , and pretty much everybody is turning to google to see what they can find , said mike green , a foreign policy expert at the who served on president george w bush s national security council while most presidential campaigns have been offering lists of their highprofile advisers , mr trump had repeatedly declined to reveal his , offering only that he developed his views about world affairs from listening to experts on television , and that he liked to come up with his own ideas that changed on monday when , in an , he shared the names of five advisers who signed up to be on his team joseph e schmitz , gen keith kellogg , carter page , george papadopoulos and walid phares but in many cases , even google offered little but of mr trump s new cast of experts , and on tuesday , most of them proved elusive when sought for interviews perhaps the most prominent of the group is mr phares , who is regularly accused by muslim civil rights groups of being islamophobic and of fearmongering about the spread of he took to fox news on tuesday to discuss the terrorist attacks in brussels and warned , basically , we do n't know who s jihadist and who s not , but would not say what advice he had been giving the campaign the rest are remaining low profile there was no record of employment for mr kellogg , a retired army lieutenant general who helped run the coalition provisional authority in iraq from 2003 to 2004 he most recently worked for a defense contractor that had no information on his whereabouts mr papadopoulos , a londonbased energy analyst who lists in the 2012 model united nations on his r sum , was traveling , and his employer said he was unreachable and others could say little about how they were helping mr trump none have spoken to their new boss mr page , a managing partner at global energy capital , who will be advising mr trump on energy policy and russia , said that he had just been sending policy memos to the trump campaign and that the details of his role remained unclear mr page did not comment when asked if he supported mr trump s views on torture or the moratorium on muslim immigration some foreign policy experts have been wary about joining mr trump out of concern that they will have to answer for controversial policies that he sometimes seems to develop on the fly although there is potential upside to signing up with a candidate who is on the rise , there are also risks to reputation it s always surprising when a member of our relatively tightly knit community is willing to sacrifice their reputation to stand with someone like donald trump , said danielle pletka , senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative  peter d feaver , a political science professor at duke university , signed a letter from top republican national security leaders objecting to mr trump earlier this month and said he was confounded by the advisers that the candidate ultimately came up with i think that normally , the frontrunner for a republican presidential campaign , by march of the campaign year , has assembled a team that is more distinguished than this , said dr feaver , who was a national security adviser in the george w bush and bill clinton administrations i think this suggests that he might be straining to assemble a list dr feaver said that while he had heard of mr phares and mr schmitz , who was an inspector general of the defense department during mr bush s administration , the assortment of backgrounds did not have a coherent theme also curious was the fact that mr trump would choose two people who played active roles in the iraq war mr trump regularly tells voters that he was against the war , and he has accused mr bush of lying about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq top foreign policy experts have been increasingly worried about mr trump s vision for the united states' role in the world , and many of the prominent figures in the administrations of george bush and george w bush have denounced mr trump the prominence of those who , which included robert b zoellick , a former world bank president , and michael chertoff , a former secretary of homeland security , dwarfs the littleknown experts that mr trump has turned to despite questions about the team , the trump campaign contends that this is just the beginning of a hiring spree sam clovis , a senior policy adviser to mr trump , said new hires were being briefed on mr trump s foreign policy positions and were asked to be sure that they felt comfortable with where he stood mr clovis also pushed back against the idea that it had been hard for mr trump to find good help and said the campaign had been looking for people with real world and military experience as opposed to retreads that other candidates relied on these are people who work for a living , mr clovis said if you 're looking for show ponies , you 're coming to the wrong stable
providence , ri the providence friars played their 750th game at dunkin' donuts center on tuesday night , a run dating to 1972 , but it was the very first to feature two top10 teams , the 10thranked friars and no 7 xavier but history could do little for providence , a charter member of the big east the friars \( 174 , 53 big east \) fell to xavier , which joined the conference three seasons ago , 7568 , before a raucous sellout crowd of 12 , 804 the first half was a sloppy affair as the teams combined for 22 turnovers xavier \( 182 , 62 \) had a 14point lead in the second half when the providence sophomore forward ben bentil , the big east s leading scorer , found his range he scored 16 of his gamehigh 25 points , including his 18th and 19th 3pointers of the season , and led a frenetic friars comeback after providence cut the deficit to 3 points with 80 seconds left , xavier rushed the ball into the halfcourt coach chris mack tried to tell his team to call timeout instead the ball found its way to the sophomore reserve j p macura , who swished a 3pointer to swing the game back about that run , the xavier junior myles davis said , we knew it was going to happen it s their home court , and they 've got one of the best players in the country davis was referring to the junior point guard kris dunn , a player of the year candidate the 6foot4 dunn used his long arms to disrupt xavier s halfcourt sets and rake in seven steals he had eight assists some of them nearly fullcourt passes and 16 points in 38 minutes but he also shot only 1of6 from 3pointrange for most of the game , none of the friars could shoot they are making nearly 33 percent of their 3point attempts this season , yet they were 1 of 11 from behind the arc in the first half and 7 of 34 over all instead , the friars fed on electric fast breaks , typically kicked off by one of dunn s steals or eight rebounds in the streaky first half , xavier started 70 before providence went on a 130 run xavier found its way through providence s zone defense with expert ball movement the musketeers shot nearly 50 percent from the field as they took a 3426 lead at halftime xavier was led by the junior jalen reynolds , who had 15 points and 11 rebounds , and the senior james farr , by percentage one of college basketball s superlative rebounders , who pulled in eight despite fouling out and playing

seconds left cut the hoosiers' deficit to 8079 before hayes hit two free throws for the final margin indiana \( 174 , 71 \) never had a chance to give ferrell one last shot to tie after hayes tipped away the inbounds pass as time expired ferrell finished with 30 points on 12of20 shooting he was 5 of 6 from 3point range the redshirt sophomore darius thompson hit a 3pointer at the buzzer to give no 11 virginia a stunning victory over host wake forest malcolm brogdon scored 28 points and anthony gill added 17 for the cavaliers \( 164 , 53 atlantic coast conference \) virginia , the league s top 3point shooting team , shook off a miserable night on the perimeter , hitting four 3s in the final minute to pull out an unlikely victory bryant crawford scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half , and devin thomas added 19 for the demon deacons \( 1010 , 17 \) , who blew a 10point lead with 90 seconds left crawford missed one of two free throws with 40 seconds left to set up virginia s last chance devon hall brought the ball up the court and passed to thompson in the left corner , who banked in his 3pointer over thomas to end it jonathan holton had 14 points and 11 rebounds as no 9 west virginia defeated visiting kansas state , giving the mountaineers a sweep of the season series it was holton s second doubledouble in three games for the mountaineers \( 173 , 62 big 12 \) justin edwards had 11 points for kansas state \( 128 , 26 \) , which cut west virginia s lead to single digits in the second half just once dean wade had 9 points for the wildcats , who connected on 20 of 57

big 12 \) , who remained in first place in the conference oklahoma , which leads the nation in 3point percentage , made 12 of 23 from beyond the arc and shot 53 percent over all oklahoma was equally impressive on defense the sooners matched a program record with 14 blocked shots and held texas tech \( 127 , 26 \) to 32 percent shooting justin gray scored 20 points , devaugntah williams had 12 , and matthew temple added 11 for texas tech oklahoma led by 1713 before hield hit two 3pointers in an 80 run to push the lead to 2513 the sooners had a 4939 advantage at halftime , as hield had 16

new orleans a hotel door , a short elevator ride , a stroll through the lobby and the urge to take a walk were all that separated albert woodfox from the great wide world this had been the case only for less than 24 hours on friday morning , mr woodfox , who had just turned 69 , was released from prison as part of a plea deal with louisiana prosecutors he pleaded no contest before a state judge to charges of manslaughter and aggravated burglary in the 1972 death of a corrections officer in return , he turned his back on the 45 years he had spent in louisiana s custody , nearly all that time in a 50squarefoot cell , perhaps the longest time in solitary confinement of any prisoner in united states history now on saturday morning , he was sitting in a hotel suite alongside one of his brothers and members of the legal team that had worked for years for his release he was calm , composed , steady as a surgeon , but one imagines that survival would have been impossible without this sort of disposition i do n't think i ever felt that i would die in prison , mr woodfox , who is black , said but he acknowledged as the years passed , it became more difficult to feel that way the louisiana state penitentiary , the 18 , 000acre prison in an elbow of the mississippi river , is known familiarly as angola this was the name for the cotton plantation that once occupied the same grounds , itself named for the part of africa where the plantation s slaves had come from it is the largest maximumsecurity prison in the country , and in the early 1970s it was possibly the bloodiest almost every day , somewhere in the prison , somebody was getting stabbed or killed or beat with an iron pipe , mr woodfox recalled when mr woodfox arrived at angola in 1971 , it was his second time there raised by a barmaid in new orleans , he had taken to the street life and had the lengthy criminal r sum to show for it two years earlier , already facing a 50year sentence for armed robbery , mr woodfox escaped from the orleans parish courthouse using a smuggled pistol and made his way to new york city before long , he was in jail there , too , awaiting extradition but also becoming a part of the black panther party , which was growing in the nation s jails when he returned to angola , he was a different sort his fellow inmates at first laughed at his new talk of politics and revolution but prison officials referred to him as a militant , he said , and kept him on what was known as the panther tier , where he organized protests of prison conditions the morning of april 17 , 1972 , mr woodfox said , he was on his way back from picking up some papers from an inmate paralegal when rumors began spreading that a white corrections officer had been murdered guards pulled mr woodfox and other inmates into a room where they were stripsearched after a night in a solitary cell called the dungeon , mr woodfox and a fellow black panther , herman wallace , were charged with murder and sent to the oneman cells where they would spend the next four decades the officer who had been killed was brent miller , a former standout high school wide receiver who had just turned 23 at the time , his father also worked at angola , overseeing the crops and livestock and his brother was a corrections officer at the prison brent miller knew the prison was overcrowded , understaffed and dangerous another officer had been set on fire the day before when brent miller was found on the morning of the 17th , he had been stabbed 32 times do i believe he did it \? stan a miller , another of brent miller s brothers who at one time worked at the prison , too , said when asked about mr woodfox hell yeah , i believe he did it mr miller said an eyewitness told him as much in 1995 still , that witness , leonard turner , testified in 1998 that he had not seen the murder and then in 2002 signed a statement for mr woodfox s lawyers saying that he did see the murder but that he knew for an absolute fact that mr woodfox had not been involved mr turner s is only one of the problematic witness accounts on which the case rested no forensic evidence was found that tied mr woodfox or mr wallace to the murder mr woodfox s lawyers highlighted not only the inconsistency of the accounts but also incentives that in some cases were undisclosed by prosecutors before trial an unusual furlough for one witness , a governor s pardon for another and for one , a transfer to a custody situation with such minimal security that he was able to rob three banks while still under state supervision mr miller s widow eventually came to doubt the guilt of mr woodfox and mr wallace , creating something of a break with her former inlaws , who remain convinced that he did it at a 1973 trial , mr woodfox was convicted mr wallace was convicted the next year and so they sat , alone state prosecutors have pushed back at the description of mr woodfox s confinement as solitary for most of his time at angola he was kept alone in a cell , 6 feet by 8 or 9 feet with bars on one end , allowing limited conversation with other inmates when the industrial fans did not drown out all talk he was allowed out for one hour a day former inmates said it would be impossible to describe this as anything other than solitary  i 've seen grown men turn into babies you know , they just lay in their bed in a fetal position and do n't talk , mr woodfox said i 've seen guys who ca n't stop talking i 've seen guys that scream all day you play this game i'm superman , there s nothing you can do to hurt me' then at night time when the lights are out and everybody s sleeping , you sit down and cry or whatever and you realize , i 'll survive another day' in a 2008 filing about bail , the state laid out its case for labeling mr woodfox a dangerous inmate six incidents over the preceding two decades were listed , including hollering and shaking the bars of his cell in 2002 and threatening to start a hunger strike in 1999 in none of the cases was anyone hurt , though officials said in 1992 that he had been found with the makings of a homemade spear \( george kendall , a lawyer for mr woodfox , said it had been made of paper \) mr woodfox did calisthenics in the morning , and in the afternoon he wrote letters and read newspapers , law books and political literature nelson mandela , malcolm x , james baldwin little about his day changed , even in recent years when the outside world learned of him , mr wallace and robert king , a third inmate who spent a long stint in solitary the men collectively became known as the angola three mr king was ordered released in 2001 in 1992 , mr woodfox s conviction was thrown out on the ground that he had not had effective assistance of counsel he was convicted at a second trial in 1998 , though that conviction was overturned in 2013 because of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury foreman mr wallace s conviction was overturned the same year on similar grounds dying of lung cancer , mr wallace was ordered released by a federal judge he died three days later , mr woodfox said , his voice breaking but he died a free man mr woodfox was indicted last february for a third time so the preparation for a trial one in which all the key witnesses were dead began again but the election of a new state attorney general in november restarted negotiations , leading to friday s plea agreement it counts as a conviction , but is not an admission of guilt , something that angers the miller family they lied to us , stan miller said of the state attorney general s office when someone is in a cell for four decades he measures things differently time , certainly , but also freedom asked to recall his last trip as a free man , as a 22yearold on the run to new york , mr woodfox said he did not remember it as a feeling of freedom true freedom he discovered much later , he said , after years of reading of brave men when i began to understand who i was , i considered myself free , he said no matter how much concrete they use to hold me in a particular place they could n't stop my mind the interview ended , and mr woodfox asked about his little brother , who had stepped out for a moment together they were planning to visit their mother s grave a flash underneath the sleeve of mr woodfox s jacket revealed a gift that his brother had given him a few hours earlier to celebrate his first morning as a free man in 45 years a watch
i recently attended an autopsy at the hospital where i work , in a room in the basement adjoining the morgue the corpse , a newborn baby , was lying peacefully , as if napping , on a steel table with rusted wheels he had succumbed to hypoxia , low oxygen levels in the blood , a few minutes after a fullterm delivery did he have a heart defect \? had the umbilical cord been compressed \? had he breathed meconium , the first stool , into his lungs \? the purpose of the autopsy was to find out i 'd come that afternoon to witness what has become a rarity the nonforensic medical autopsy autopsy means to see for oneself , and that is exactly what doctors once did fifty years ago we performed autopsies on roughly half of patients who died in hospitals today , the number of autopsies has dwindled to less than 10 percent , with next to none in nonacademic hospitals the reasons for the decline are many in 1971 , the joint commission on accreditation of hospitals stopped requiring hospitals to perform autopsies in 1986 , , presumably skeptical of the usefulness of autopsies , stopped directly paying for them since then , private insurers have followed medicare s lead perhaps the biggest reason for the autopsy s demise is that doctors no longer seem to view the procedure as essential we used to use autopsies as an educational tool , to learn what we 'd gotten right and what we 'd missed today , many doctors believe that medical tests will reveal all they need to know about how and why a patient died nothing could be further from the truth despite technological improvements in medicine , diagnostic errors remain rampant according to a recent institute of medicine report , misdiagnoses contribute to some 10 percent of patient deaths and account for 6 percent to 17 percent of patient harm in this country most americans in their lifetime strangely , diagnostic accuracy is rarely raised as a safety issue compared with treatment errors , such as medication overdoses or wronglimb amputations , diagnostic errors receive little attention of course , they are harder to identify many doctors never find out about them because they never learn the outcomes of their cases this is where autopsies can be very useful even though modern testing can give us a lot of information , 10 percent to 30 percent of autopsies still reveal undiagnosed medical problems studies have found that patients at hospitals that perform more autopsies suffer fewer major diagnostic mistakes still , it is n't easy to ask a family for an autopsy when i was a resident i took care of an elderly man in whom a mysterious had taken up residence like a malevolent squatter his temperature was 102 degrees or higher for weeks he lost a third of his body weight all tests bacterial , viral , oncologic , rheumatologic were normal they remained that way until he died an autopsy would probably have been useful it could have shown us what we had missed but none of us wanted to ask his grieving wife for permission feedback and reflection are critical in any human enterprise , but especially so in medicine , where the stakes are so high we do n't always see the correct diagnosis when our patients are alive however , it can be pretty obvious in the splayedout tissues of an autopsy the autopsy i attended took two hours the pathologist cut into the baby s plumsize heart it was normal so , too , were the intestines , the liver and the kidneys after the initial examination , the pathologist placed the baby s chest and abdominal organs on a neighboring table for closer inspection it was there that we noticed the tiny lungs had yellowish spots on their surface the pathologist did n't know what to make of this , but when he sliced the lungs open , yellowishgreen meconium was present in all the major breathing tubes out to the furthest branches he said it was the worst case of he had ever seen it occurred to me that the baby s parents could perhaps now have some closure as well as some potentially useful information the diagnosis was not , say , a hereditary abnormality that could affect other children they might choose to have my hospital , i learned , is a regional autopsy center it receives bodies from a dozen affiliated health care sites \( the baby in fact had been transferred from another hospital \) i was told that the hospital had increased the number of stored bodies , almost doubling the number of storage lockers yet the autopsy rate has not budged reviving the autopsy would be a good thing , giving doctors a sorely needed tool to improve diagnosis at the very least , medicare and private insurers should start paying for autopsies again , so that financial considerations do not limit their use electronic hospital records should give doctors reminders to ask for them despite the emphasis on metrics and data in medicine today , we ignore perhaps the most important information of all what we can see for ourselves

washington the united states and announced an agreement on monday for a partial truce in , though the caveats and cautious words on all sides underscored the obstacles in the way of the latest diplomatic effort to end the fiveyearold civil war under the terms of the agreement , the syrian government and s armed opposition are being asked to agree to a cessation of hostilities , effective this saturday but the truce does not apply to two of the most lethal extremist groups , the islamic state and the nusra front , raising questions about whether it will be any more lasting than previous ceasefires the agreement calls for the syrian government and the opposition to indicate by noon on friday whether they will comply with the cessation of hostilities , a term carefully chosen because it does not require the kind of agreement in a formal ceasefire the united states is responsible for bringing the various opposition groups in line while the russians are supposed to pressure the government washington and moscow also agreed to set up a hotline to monitor compliance by both sides sealed the final terms of the arrangement in a phone call with president of , who has become perhaps the most influential player in the syrian war since russia thrust itself into the conflict in september on behalf of its client , syria s president , bashar alassad i am sure that the common actions , agreed with the american side , are capable of radically changing the crisis situation in syria , mr putin declared finally , a real chance emerged to stop the longstanding bloodshed and violence the white house was more muted , issuing a twoparagraph summary of the president s conversation , in which he welcomed the agreement but did not celebrate it the priorities , mr obama told mr putin , were to alleviate the suffering of the syrian people , accelerate a political settlement and keep the focus on the coalition s battle against the islamic state this is going to be difficult to implement , the white house press secretary , josh earnest , said the fact is that the situation in syria has been very difficult from the getgo on the ground in syria , the prospects for an end to the bloodshed seemed even more elusive in the last week alone , more than 100 people in homs and damascus were killed by suicide bombings by the islamic state airstrikes by the syrian government and its russian allies in aleppo and elsewhere have killed scores of people , including in at least five hospitals , one aided by the international charity doctors without borders farther east , scores of civilians were said by locals to have been killed in airstrikes by the americanled coalition fighting the , also known as or isil the diplomatic efforts did yield a small victory aid was delivered for the first time in months to several towns after the combatants gave permission under intense pressure but hundreds of thousands of syrians remain trapped in areas that are classified as besieged or hard to reach , without regular access to food and medicine humanitarian groups caution that the more access to aid is used as part of political deals , the less the combatants will provide it unconditionally , as required under international law the agreement came after one false start secretary of state announced in munich on feb 12 that the truce would take effect in a week , but the target date passed as the two sides wrestled over how to carry it out on sunday , in amman , jordan , mr kerry spoke three times by phone with russia s foreign minister , sergey v lavrov , to iron out the details on monday , while flying back to washington , mr kerry briefed ministers from britain , france , germany , saudi arabia , qatar and turkey about the agreement , according to a senior state department official he is expected to discuss the truce when he testifies at a budget hearing tuesday before the senate foreign relations committee mr kerry has tended to be more optimistic than the white house about the prospects for a diplomatic solution in syria but his statement on monday was also notably reserved he did not mention the feb 27 date and said that while the agreement represented a moment of promise , the fulfillment of that promise depends on actions he is , of course , glad that we got the modalities agreed upon and a start date , said the state department official , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss mr kerry s thinking , but he is n't prepared to take anything for granted in his mind , this is not a time to celebrate analysts expressed skepticism about the deal , noting that in the five days before the truce takes effect , the syrian forces and their russian allies could inflict a lot more damage to aleppo through bombing raids some speculated that russia might expand its military campaign to idlib , southwest of aleppo , where nusra fighters are also operating this depends entirely on the good faith of russia , iran and the assad regime , none of whom have shown much good faith in the last five years , said frederic c hof , a senior fellow at the atlantic council who worked on syria policy during the first term of the obama administration the russians have it in their power to stop this in five days , mr hof said the fact that they 're taking five more days suggests that they will use nusra as a pretext to go beyond where they are now in riyadh on monday , a saudibacked consortium of syrian opposition groups and political dissidents said they would agree to the terms of the truce but riad hijab , who coordinates the group s efforts , did not expect the syrian government , iran or russia to abide by it since , he said , mr assad s survival depended on the continuation of its campaign of oppression , killing and forced displacement for the obama administration , a partial truce in syria may simply be a way to keep a lid on the violence there while it turns its attention to planning and carrying out military operations against islamic state fighters in libya some analysts said the agreement was less an effort to end the fighting in syria than to ease the bloodshed enough to allow more humanitarian aid to reach stricken cities like aleppo washington s stated policy is not to end the syrian war , said andrew j tabler , an expert on syria at the washington institute for near east policy they just want to settle it down so it boils a little more slowly it s yet another attempt to contain a conflict that has been uncontainable
there are vocal powerhouse pop stars , who dominate with the sheer magnitude of their gift kaleidoscopically vivid pop stars , who dazzle with enthusiasm and energy diligent pop stars , who chip away at success until they strike oil cheeky pop stars , who understand the absurdity of the situation but manage to convincingly stay the course and there is rihanna , who is not quite any of these things that deficit has not proved to be much of an obstacle more than three years have passed since the release of her last album , and she is perhaps more famous than ever , a star of fashion , social media and tabloids who sometimes , y'know , makes music or whatever and while , her eighth album , that peculiar state of affairs is unlikely to change anti is a chaotic and scattershot album , not the product of a committed artistic vision , or even an appealingly freeform aesthetic , but rather an amalgam of approaches , tones , styles and moods depending on the moment , she is an electric vocalist or an indifferent one , an emotional savant or a naif , a singer who understands what her voice is best at and one who sounds like she s merely following directions rihanna has always shined when at her most assertive , like on needed me , one of this album s highlights over a pulpy , throbbing beat by dj mustard , rihanna sings about using men for sex and disposing of them like tissues trying to fix your inner issues with a bad bitch did n't they tell you that i was a savage \? if she were sweating at all , it would come off as a scold , but her singing is reserved and cool she s letting a poor sap down and practically has her back turned she succeeds at this end of the spectrum , and also the other , like on a popdancehall number that s all bubble and no depth , it s cheaply effective in places , she barely even relies on words , truncating her syllables past patois to something far less exact that rihanna can be postlanguage and still thrive is among her gifts , and on anti , she is relying on a range of talents rather than a fixed strategy around the time of her last album , unapologetic \( def jam \) , released near the end of 2012 , rihanna was at her creative peak , having honed a haughty , gothic , erotic sound but the intervening years have been more curious than productive the medium in which she s most excelled has been instagram her account was gloriously unfiltered before it mysteriously disappeared at its apex , it showed rihanna being exceptional at being famous , a sunburst of unimpeachable cool last year , she released three singles the winning countrysoul number fourfiveseconds , a collaboration with kanye west and paul mccartney the limp american oxygen and bitch better have my money , probably the most basic and least imaginative of her toughtalk hits but none of those songs appear on anti , an album that has been long in the works and that arrives burdened by heavy expectations the album s rollout was troubled right down to the final step anti leaked online wednesday evening before being officially made available for streaming \( a limited number of free downloads were given away as part of a promotional arrangement with samsung \) one of the many hiccups on the path to anti was a recent twitter eruption by glass john , a writer and producer who worked on the album and suggested it was being held up because travis scott , the rapper who is rihanna s rumored boyfriend , was getting in the way that both men s fingerprints on this album are so clear is one indication of its patchwork approach mr scott helped produce the determinedly sloppy woo , with dark , distorted production akin to his hit antidote glass john , meanwhile , helped make kiss it better , an ostentatious sex jam that pulses with 1980s synthrock sleaze kiss it better is also one of several songs on anti on which rihanna s singing takes center stage it s true , too , on the three songs that close the album , each of which pulls rihanna in an unanticipated musical direction , anchored only by her flexible voice love on the brain is a calm doowop song about toxic love you love when i fall apart so you can put me together and throw me against the wall then comes higher , a smoldering soul number where rihanna finds a scratchy , amy winehouseesque part of her voice she s never used before finally , there s the piano ballad close to you , the most affecting torch song of her career as songs , each of these is imperfect , but together they make an improbable argument rihanna may be near her vocal peak , at the place in her career where it matters the least \( this is also undoubtedly a testament to the gifts of her vocal producer , kuk harrell \) but there are plenty of counterarguments here , as well the lumpy desperado the tepid never ending , which unimaginatively borrows from dido s thank you and the foggy same ol' mistakes a cover of tame impala s new person , same old mistakes a sixminutethick moat of pseudochillwave bringing down this album s middle that all these songs exist side by side reaffirm that rihanna is our least aesthetically consistent least aesthetically committed \? major pop star at this stage of her career , music may be the least essential brick in her house and as rihanna has made clear time and again , not only is the sum greater than the parts , but the sum might also have nothing to do with the parts whatsoever
donald trump is a walking political science course his meteoric rise is lesson no 1 on leadership most voters do not listen through their ears they listen through their stomachs if a leader can connect with them on a gut level , their response is do n't bother me with the details i trust your instincts if a leader ca n't connect on a gut level , he or she ca n't show them enough particulars they 'll just keep asking , can you show me the details one more time \? trump s republican rivals keep thinking that if they just point out a few more details about him , voters will drop the donald and turn to one of them instead but you ca n't talk voters out of something that they have n't been talked into many have come to trump out of a gut feeling that this is a guy who knows their pain , even if he really does n't many of his supporters are from the middleagewhitemalesmatter movement , for whom the current age of acceleration has not been kind and for whom trump s rallies are their way of saying can you hear me now \? and of sticking it to all the people who exploited their pain but left them behind , particularly traditional republican elites they are not interested in trump s details they like his gut and no wonder those gop elites sold their own souls and their party so many times to charlatans and plutocrats that you wonder when it s going to show up on closeout on ebay for sale the gop soul almost empty this soul was previously sold to sarah palin , the tea party anarchists , rush limbaugh , grover norquist , the gun lobby , the oil industry , the koch brothers , sheldon adelson and fox news will bargain no offer too low normally smart people , like mitt romney , discarded all their best instincts to suck up to this ragtag assortment of selfappointed gop commissars , each representing a different slice of what came to be republican orthodoxy climate change is a hoax abortion , even in the case of rape or incest , is impermissible even commonsense gun laws must be opposed , no matter how many kids get murdered taxes must always be cut and safety nets shrunk , no matter what the economic context obamacare must be destroyed , even though it was based on a republican idea and iraq was a success even though it was a mess the gop became an accretion of ideas that ossified over the years without the party ever stopping to ask afresh what world are we living in now \? what are the dominant trends \? and how does america best exploit them by applying conservative values and marketbased solutions \? the cynicism of today s gop could not have been more vividly displayed than when marco rubio , john kasich \( a decent guy \) and ted cruz all declared that they would support the party s nominee , even if it was trump , right after telling voters he was a con man no wonder so many republicans are voting for trump on the basis of what they think is in his guts all the other gop candidates have none but even if his support is weakening , democrats take trump lightly at their peril he is still sitting with three aces that he has n't played yet they could all come out in the general election one ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities he will have no problem playing the moderate unifier and plenty of people will buy it , saying why not give him a chance \? he says he can make us winners sure , mexico will have to pay for that wall , trump will say , but it will be in installments deport 11 million illegal immigrants \? c'mon , do n't you know an opening bid on an immigration bill when you hear one \? ban all muslims \? well of course we ca n't ban a whole faith community , but trump will vow to be much harder on visas from certain countries have you never read the art of the deal \? his second ace is that given the position he staked out on terrorism , if , god forbid , there is a major terrorist attack on our soil between now and election day , trump will reap enormous political benefits watch out i 've seen how one welltimed terrorist attack tilted an israeli election his third ace is that he will indeed go after hillary clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected republicans , whose hatred of hillary knows no bounds did you hear what trump said about hillary last night \? that she was bill s enabler ! ' finally ! i will vote for him just for that again , beware but trump is also holding two jokers with those aces one of the lessons i learned covering the middle east is that the only good thing about extremists is that they do n't know when to stop and in the end , they often do themselves in see saddam hussein trump has already gone places no candidate ever has , even telling us he has a big penis one day he may go too far \( if he has n't already \) and sever his gut connection with voters trump s other joker is that among those attracted to his gut are racists and fascists with a taste for violence at his rallies one day they may go too far and do something so ugly , so brownshirt , it will also turn people off to his gut in short , only trump can trump trump do n't count on it , but do n't count it out
half a century has passed since mao zedong set in motion the , his chaotic attempt to purge the communist party and chinese society of compromise and capitalist tendencies the movement unleashed widespread violence , some of it led by red guards , young students who organized themselves into militant units to enforce mao s revolutionary vision some of the most intense fighting was in chongqing , where in recent days some residents mourned at china s only surviving sizable red guard cemetery , a writer who grew up in chongqing and is now based in boston , is the author of apologies forthcoming , a collection of stories about the cultural revolution in an interview , ms eberlein , who is working on a memoir , reflected on how that time affected her and her family my mother came from a poor peasant family in zhongxian , a riverside county on the yangtze , and my father was an orphan from chongqing they both became underground communists in the 1940s while chongqing was under nationalist rule when the cultural revolution began in 1966 , my mother was an elementary school principal , my father was a midranked party cadre , and i was finishing the fourth grade i witnessed my mother being perpwalked in a dunce cap by her students , and my father being struggled against by his colleagues from the beginning they , like most all their close friends , were very confused by what the cultural revolution was really for , and they had no choice but to muddle through the chaotic time my big sister was a middleschool student , and she became a red guard in the august 15 faction in july 1968 , she drowned while commemorating my family never really recovered from that tragedy by the end of the cultural revolution , my mother s belief in mao and communism was fundamentally shaken , while the change dawned much more slowly for my father , likely because he had everything to thank the party underground for in his impoverished youth , and he had become much more invested in the communist cause but he , too , was disillusioned in his later years for my generation , generally speaking , at the end of the cultural revolution , the spiritual landscape had become a desert in china i do n't think i'm capable of describing those agonizing years in a few calm sentences i'm working on a memoir , and the cultural revolution is part of it one thing i want to say is that my memoir will not be victim literature we were all participants at the time , whether one admits or denies it many times after my sister died in 1968 , her schoolmates said they would move her grave to the red guard cemetery , but they never did i read in my sister s diary how she and her schoolmates buried their red guard leader ai shuquan in the shapingba park cemetery , so i went to look for ai s tomb in 2002 i did n't think i would find it , but i did it was a few days after the qingming festival when chinese tend family graves , and i saw wilted flower bouquets here and there , but none at ai s my sister had written that ai was from tianjin , so perhaps he had no family members in chongqing i remember feeling like crying when i found his tomb encroached upon by weeds one that i still remember was at the chaotianmen port , in the flower garden in front the port bureau s office building i remember wreaths with white paper flowers on mounds of dirt then one day , maybe a year or two later , the dirt mounds were flattened and the flower garden returned , as if nothing had happened all the cemeteries then were for members of one faction , august 15 , because it was the faction in power then the dead from the opposite faction , rebel to the end , had no cemetery the many weapon factories certainly contributed to the large scale of chongqing s armed struggle , and another arguable factor might be local character in ancient times , chongqing was part of the ancient books use words like valiant and combative to describe the ba people yet some other significant factors have often been overlooked by outside historians chongqing is where the hit novel is set , a name i believe no mainland chinese adult does n't know the novel , set in 1940s chongqing , eulogizes the underground communists' heroic struggles in concentration camps said to be corun by americans and the chinese nationalists revolutionary heroism had always been an important part of official education in the 17 years of the mao era leading up to the cultural revolution , but during the 1960s the novel red crag was more influential than any textbook i would n't be surprised if the boys and girls who fought each other to death aspired to be heroes like those in the novel another overlooked factor is the lingering damage of the great famine from 1959 to 1962 sichuan , which included chongqing then , had the largest number of starvation deaths , estimated at oneseventh of the province s population lots of anger during the cultural revolution came from that painful history , and suddenly the causes became clear as the red guards dug up undisclosed party documents and put them on bigcharacter posters and fliers because there was no school to go to , i spent lots of time on the streets reading those things once , i saw a flier glued to a wall , with a bold red title extra grand good news ! it said medical experts had scientifically proved that chairman mao would live to be 130 to 140 years old a few moments later , this flier was covered by angry comments extra grand nonsense ! venomous attack ! chairman mao is immortal ! long live chairman mao ! long , long live chairman mao ! but they also uncovered things we would n't have known otherwise i remember how shocked my parents were when they learned that it was the government and in sichuan , the southwest region party secretary li jingquan in particular not a natural disaster , that was responsible for the famine we learned the truth during the cultural revolution , but those who grew up later still do n't know it i once did a little poll on a us writers' website , asking what people thought china s red guards were the answers were all in the line of pretty much the same as the hitler youth at the other extreme , i 've seen chinese youngsters , high school and undergrad students newly arrived in the us to study , who simply refused to believe the crazy things that happened during the cultural revolution their typical argument was that , my parents would 've told me about those things if they were true the silence on the cultural revolution has been more voluntary than enforced , and it is because the memory of the time is very painful to the victims and shameful to those who victimized adding to the emotional complexity is the fact that many people took turns in both roles victims and victimizers parents do n't pass their experiences of the time to children this , coupled with the void in textbooks , results in the ignorance of the younger generations this is where the danger lies because the lesson has not been learned by the later generations , the disaster might be repeated in the future two years ago , this collective silence was briefly broken , when quite a number of exred guards courageously came out to apologize for what they 'd done in their fanatic youth it looked like the prediction i made in 2008 through my book s title , apologies forthcoming , might finally come true but that hope was short lived that voice was quickly gone , like a wisp of smoke , and has not been heard again
washington speaker on tuesday forcefully denounced s refusal to distance himself from the former leader david duke but mr ryan did not shift from his position that he would support mr trump if he became the s presidential nominee , a perplexing contradiction that reflects the growing anxiety on capitol hill over the billionaire businessman s ascent if a person wants to be the nominee of the , there can be no evasion and no games , mr ryan told reporters in washington after his weekly meeting with house republicans they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry this party does not prey on people s prejudices we appeal to their highest ideals this is the party of lincoln mr ryan , who did not mention mr trump by name , brought into sharp relief the intense struggle facing congressional republicans especially those in tough reelection fights as they move to simultaneously run from mr trump s positions and largely proclaim fealty to his increasingly possible rise to the top of their ticket let me make it perfectly clear , senate republicans condemn david duke and the kkk , and his racism , senator , republican of kentucky and the majority leader , said tuesday on capitol hill that is not the view of republicans that have been elected to the united states senate , and i condemn his comments in the most forceful way mr mcconnell stopped short of saying what only a very few congressional republicans have said that he will not pull the lever for mr trump if he is the nominee the inherent paradox of renouncing a candidate you also provisionally support was raised tuesday to near contortionist levels for instance , republicans now repeatedly say they must support any republican nominee over a democrat largely to protect the supreme court seat that opened up with the death of justice antonin scalia , a position that mr mcconnell says they will not agree to fill until after the election any republican nominee is going to have a better supreme court nominee , said senator cory gardner , republican of colorado , moments after he said his first job was to show america that trump is a wolf in sheep s clothing but republicans acknowledge that they have no proof that mr trump would pick the conservative jurist they crave to wit mr trump has repeatedly embraced policies and political figures disliked by his party he that paul volcker , the former chairman of the federal reserve , whose policies fueled the recession in president ronald reagan s first term and who then became a trusted economic adviser to the presidential candidate barack obama , was a great pick for the nation s central bank job congressional republicans dominated by the party s conservative wing dislike many of mr trump s policies , are out of step with their frontrunner on social issues and are embarrassed by his antics yet they insist that at the end of the long , arduous day , none of those traits would be disqualifying we will have to work on changing some of his ideas , said senator orrin g hatch , republican of utah , smiling weakly he s a good businessman and many said that while his views were at odds with voters in their states , mr trump s overall candidacy was not , and so they would support him if for no other reason than they will need his voters , too i have a primary , said senator johnny isakson , republican of georgia , who added he would not endorse anyone in the race it is almost as if republicans are dating someone they will not introduce to their mother , but have reluctantly agreed to marry because they cannot do better for a group with 9 percent favorables telling people how to vote , said senator jeff flake , republican of arizona , an outspoken critic of mr trump , i do n't think that s going to work one exception is senator ben sasse , the freshman republican from nebraska , who began a oneman attack on mr trump , explaining why he would never vote for him a house republican , representative scott rigell of virginia , did proclaim tuesday that love for our country eclipses my loyalty to our party as he declared he would never support a nominee so lacking in the judgment , temperament and character needed to be our nation s commander in chief but mr rigell has already announced his retirement at the end of the year yet for all the wishful thinking about mr trump s imminent demise they said repeatedly that even if he cleaned up in tuesday s primaries , he could still lose the nomination fight republicans have not strongly coalesced around an alternative many senate republicans were behind the nowfailed campaign of former gov jeb bush of florida support for other candidates has been scattered senator marco rubio of florida has the endorsement of about a dozen senators , while senator ted cruz has none still , they press on it s not going to be , snapped the usually affable mr gardner , who is trying to elevate mr rubio mr mcconnell , who has spent much of his public life pressing against the most flagrant bigotry in politics , is in a particularly tough spot by not fully dismissing mr trump s candidacy over the david duke episode and while mr ryan has been careful to try to ignore mr trump s gardenvariety outbursts and name calling , he becomes agitated over remarks that he feels violate the inclusiveness of the party this is fundamental , mr ryan said and if someone wants to be our nominee , they must understand this i hope this is the last time i need to speak out on this race democrats are using the issue to pummel republicans senator harry reid of nevada , the minority leader , was sharply critical of mr ryan on tuesday and his refusal to say he would not support mr trump talk is cheap , mr reid sneered
we , as voters and electionobsessed bystanders , made it past the first two contests in this eonslong presidential primary , but seven candidates were n't so lucky the winnoweddown field has now moved on to the warmer voteseeking climes of nevada and south carolina before moving on too , i 'd like to consider what this election has now proven iowa and new hampshire s firstinthenation status is not only obsolete , it s bad for our democratic process ask people in iowa or new hampshire to justify their lock on early voting , and you hear this it s cheap to campaign here it can turn into a sort of zen koan we matter because we 're first , and we 're first because we matter inconveniently for them , none of these justifications are good enough that s why , to help save our democracy , i would like to autocratically declare ohio as the new firstinthenation primary state starting in 2020 it might not be a perfect idea , but it would be a lot better than our system now the main problem with iowa and new hampshire is a demographic one put simply , they are too white both states' populations are , while the united states population as a whole is the united states is projected to become a minoritywhite country in roughly this is where comes in unlike iowa and new hampshire , ohio has a racial and cultural makeup that more closely mirrors the united states as a whole ohio s primary process is also generally less restrictive than caucusing , as the state allows absentee and early voting let s preemptively address defenders of our current system it s true that television and radio ads in a state like iowa are significantly cheaper than , say , new york or california but with the advent of cable tv , online news and social media , the primary is national from day 1 fortune magazine has estimated that simply starting a presidential campaign costs roughly the idea that underfunded candidates can set up shop in iowa and ride the sheer skill of their retail politics to victory is a terrifyingly na ve way to think about american politics that strategy did not pan out for scott walker , rick santorum or mike huckabee turnout in the caucuses also do not point to a grand tradition in iowa , republicans had record turnout this year , with people participating along with the democratic turnout of more than 170 , 000 , which was high but not higher than 2008 , that still meant , that by one analysis , a relatively abysmal of eligible voters in the state showed up to caucus but that did n't keep local and national media from reporting the caucuses' turnout as previous records ohio might as well be called the goldilocks state it s big without being big , neither too red nor too blue and it s culturally diverse another option is colorado , but its caucus process could prove just as tedious as iowa s florida would be nice , too , but as the third most populous state in the country , its media markets might be too expensive virginia is another good option , but that might favor dcbased politicians who can simply drive down every weekend north carolina , another racially diverse swing state , could replace new hampshire as secondinthenation there s just one problem with ohio becoming the new iowa ohio does n't want to be first in the nation jon husted , ohio s secretary of state , said that as swingstate voters ohioans get enough attention from presidential candidates as it is putting even more focus on the state would make it more expensive for candidates at the state level to buy local advertising i think we probably have enough impact on who becomes president already i think that s what some people would say , he said we do n't feel neglected , let s put it that way we get plenty of attention so , what can be done \? the realistic answer is , not much quite a few people have floated smart ideas for reforming the presidential primary system michael mcdonald , a professor of political science at the university of florida , has proposed the primary calendar to april or may as a reminder , canada s campaign for prime minister last year lasted about blissfully short by american campaign standards others have proposed a , or alternately , one to even the playing field but the idea of holding one national primary is difficult , as it could even the playing field in some ways , while still disproportionately benefiting candidates who can campaign across 50 states without their money running out or who are skilled enough media personalities that they do n't need to rely on showing up in person it would also mean there is no gradual winnowing of the field , which is arguably the best purpose the iowa and new hampshire primaries serve a staggered primary system , by contrast , helps candidates build that allimportant yet intangible momentum , giving donors and voters more time to assess which candidate best fits their values another asset of the staggered primary system is it gives us a chance to see how candidates interact with real live voters on the campaign trail before we cast our votes john c fortier , the director of the bipartisan policy center s democracy project , says that while our current system may not be ideal , iowa and new hampshire do serve the political process by requiring candidates to meet with voters oneonone and address their concerns it allows you to see the candidates in a light that you do n't get to for the rest of the campaign , where it s much more of a managed process , he said there s no other part of the presidential process where they have to do that the influence of iowa is arguably a bigger problem for the republican party than for democrats it means that a largely white , christian conservative cohort has more sway over the nomination than any other group within the party while some gop operatives will quietly express regret at the influence iowa wields , party leaders and the presidential candidates themselves are generally too concerned about offending iowa voters to speak ill of the process liz mair , a republican strategist , from mr walker s presidential campaign after it was discovered that she had made negative comments about ethanol subsidies an important issue in what jonah goldberg the saudi arabia of corn and the iowa caucuses' on national politics the republican party desperately needs to recruit nonwhite voters to its side , if it wants to survive keeping the firstinthenation status quo ensures that voter interests in largely white states are considered first in the primaries a recent found that this year s republican primary has led 57 percent of black voters and 45 percent of latino voters to view the gop less favorably changing the system to ohio or anywhere else does seem unlikely , however iowa s state party activists have pretty much threatened to leapfrog any other state that dares to schedule its primary earlier than the caucuses and bill gardner , new hampshire s secretary of state , has steadfastly guarded his state s early calendar spot for many years among secretaries of state , who schedule state elections , mr gardner is a legend i think the law in new hampshire is , the election is whenever bill gardner says the election is , mr husted , of ohio , said i'm exaggerating , but not by very much so while the primary system we have today is better than the nominating contests that took place , the process could be more equitable if you really care about making the campaign process cheaper , demand that we push back the primary calendar if you really care about increasing turnout , ensure that the early voting process that gets the most attention is n't an hourslong affair that prohibits large swathes of people from participating if you really care about the presidential campaign being inclusive , pay attention to states that represent americans' diverse interests but if you only really care about a narrow definition of tradition , well , you may have a promising career in iowa or new hampshire state politics

marion , iowa for months , it was the biggest question nagging at the rubio campaign here where s marco \? his schedule was not packed with 16hour days spent rolling across iowa s hinterlands in a bus as an iowan , you were probably more likely to see him on fox news or hear about him visiting new hampshire or south carolina other candidates like and had the support of more highprofile conservative leaders but something appears to be shifting for senator of florida it is a change evident in his growing crowds a string of endorsements a friendly nod from a popular iowa senator , joni ernst and the cautious confidence he is starting to express i'm very optimistic about the energy we 're gaining , the endorsements , the support and the turnout on a day like today , mr rubio told a crowd of more than 300 people who came to hear him speak here at a best western over the weekend , mr rubio of the state s largest newspaper , the des moines register and on sunday his campaign announced that ms ernst would join him for a rally in des moines on monday while that does not amount to a formal endorsement , ms ernst has no plans to campaign with any other candidate all along , mr rubio and his advisers have insisted that grumbling about his relatively light footprint in iowa would look silly in retrospect but there is still a week left before iowans vote plenty of time for his backloaded strategy to backfire and by the time the week is over it will be clear whether or not the rubio campaign is experiencing slowbuilding momentum that would position the senator to peak right before the caucuses asked on saturday night if all the activity around his campaign lately was a way of playing catchup , he said , sounding confident , no , it s an indication that the caucuses are eight days away mr rubio s strategy heading into the caucuses next monday is to remain the candidate who is most broadly acceptable to the republican electorate , pitching himself to voters as more agreeable than mr cruz and more sensible than mr trump , the candidates he trails in the polls here you will never see me on tv and cringe and say , i ca n't believe i voted for him , ' he told an audience of several hundred in waterloo on sunday a thirdplace finish is the most realistic outcome the rubio campaign expects , but it realizes that his margin over whoever finishes in fourth place is also significant a large margin going into the new hampshire primary a week later would give him a lift there with iowa out of reach , new hampshire is the state where mr rubio hopes to be able to perform strongly enough to begin consolidating support from the more moderate , establishmentaligned wing of the  though his campaign does not expect him to win in new hampshire , either , a strong finish would enable his supporters to start applying pressure to donors who have backed other candidates , namely , to jump on board many donors have privately indicated that they would switch their allegiances to mr rubio , several people inside and outside his campaign have said , but they want to first see how new hampshire votes his advisers say that the only certainty about the race remains its fluidity , and that they are confident they will still be standing once the field narrows no poll in new hampshire matters until iowa votes , and no poll in south carolina matters until new hampshire votes , said todd harris , a senior rubio strategist as mr rubio campaigned across iowa the last few days , he sharpened his case not only that he is a more practical choice than mr trump or mr cruz , but that he is the candidate most capable of beating hillary clinton we 're all frustrated about the direction of america , yes , he said , urging his audience to reject some of the angrier , more pessimistic appeals from his rivals that alone is not enough you 've got to know what you 're going to do he added , you deserve to know exactly what they 're going do when you entrust them with the most powerful office in the land several voters who are leaning toward mr rubio said there was no single trait or issue that drew them to him instead , it is a more intangible attractiveness and a sense that he would perform well in a general election i do n't know if i have any profound reasons for supporting him , said aaron telecky , 44 , the pastor of a church in cedar rapids who brought his 15yearold son to hear mr rubio on sunday mr telecky said mr rubio seemed to have presidential qualities that other republicans did not i agree with cruz on a lot , he said , but i do n't think he s electable i get the donald appeal but he s too unpredictable and i do n't think he has a north star driving his philosophy mr rubio , he said , checks off a lot of my boxes but mr rubio is still facing unrelenting attacks from opponents , none more apparent than those from the right to rise , which supports mr bush and has inundated the airwaves in iowa , new hampshire and south carolina the most potent attack so far and the one that has mr rubio s backers most concerned is an ad that depicts him as a weather vane , shifting his political positions on immigration as the wind blows if you add up all the other candidates , more has been spent against me than all the other candidates combined , he told his audience here in the crowd on sunday afternoon , there was evidence the attacks were sticking a man stood up and asked mr rubio to clarify how his support for immigration reform did not amount to supporting amnesty for undocumented immigrants i'm a little confused , the man said where s the difference \?
andover , mass on a clear sunday in midmarch , onaje x o woodbine sat down to an elegant brunch at the andover inn , the hotel adjacent to the famous prep school in this northern massachusetts town he was eager to talk about his new book , but there was another question first what did he think about the basketball team , which had just made the ncaa tournament for the first time since 1962 , even as its captain had been expelled amid accusations of sexual assault \? in 2000 , as a yale sophomore , woodbine had been the basketball team s leading scorer and greatest hope but this march , he did not even know that his old team had won the ivy league title i do n't follow that stuff anymore , said woodbine , a yoruba shaman who teaches philosophy and religious studies at phillips academy , or andover , as it is known last week , columbia university press published black gods of the asphalt religion , hiphop , and street basketball , based on woodbine s doctoral dissertation at the work draws on scholars like pierre bourdieu , clifford geertz and henry louis gates jr to describe how street basketball functions as an outlet for mourning and healing for urban youths but while the book speaks of basketball with love and reverence , it came about only because woodbine , who is black , once quit basketball in disgust woodbine , 36 , grew up 30 miles from andover , in the poor boston neighborhood of roxbury , where he showed basketball promise at a young age a high school standout at newton south high school , where he was bused as part of the region s racial integration program , he arrived at yale with dreams of nba stardom he was a terrific player , said james jones , yale s coach , whose first year was woodbine s sophomore season he could get to 15 feet and score with best of them he talked a lot about wanting to be allen iverson when he was here but while woodbine excelled on the court , he was miserable on the team he felt that his teammates resented his tougher , more passionate style of play the white players also belonged to a fraternity that none of the black players had joined woodbine said he was also disturbed by a lockerroom culture that encouraged misogyny , reveling in the sexual conquest and denigration of women , as he wrote in a for the chronicle of higher education above all , woodbine said , he felt valued only for his basketball skills jones , who is also black , did n't build any relationship with me whatsoever throughout the entire year , woodbine said none of the coaches did and my teammates were the same way and that s why it was easy to leave when woodbine told jones that he was leaving the team , the coach was in tears , woodbine said woodbine said a white assistant coach had told him , in an email , that his leaving the team could negatively affect the admission chances of future minority recruits still , woodbine carried through with his promise to leave , and he wrote an opinion column for the yale daily news about his decision , saying he was leaving sports to focus on the life of the mind his father , who did not raise him but with whom he had reconnected when he was 15 , is a buddhist tai chi instructor and an acupuncturist , and in long conversations he had given his son an interest in spirituality when i look two years down the road , woodbine wrote , do i want to say i played basketball for yale but did not get to meet with my teachers , did not get to read all of my class materials \? he said he felt called to study philosophy and religion , to expose the contradictions that people of african descent face in america every day , to give my life to humanity the column was reprinted by the yale alumni magazine , where it was read by the wife of robert neville , then the dean of boston university s school of theology she showed it to her husband , who was so impressed that he drove to yale to ask woodbine to apply to boston university for graduate school he did in 2001 , woodbine went to africa for the first time , to ghana in 2004 , he traveled to nigeria the nigerian trip changed my life , he said i sat on the ground with some shamans , and they read me like a book , and they debated about me , and my life , and my philosophy in nigeria , he began studying to be initiated as a yoruba shaman , a process he completed in 2012 on his second trip to nigeria in 2005 , he had met his wife , folasade , whom he married the next year they are expecting their second child in october back at graduate school at boston university , he came full circle with his dissertation , back to basketball , back to the courts that had shaped him , now a short trip from campus back to his old neighborhood it occurred to him , as he read deeply in theories of religion , that there was something profoundly religious about what he and his friends had experienced playing basketball the courts were sacred spaces , separating sacred time from profane , allowing them to enact rites of jubilation , transition or mourning the overall thesis , woodbine said , is that on the one hand , africanamerican men are pushed toward basketball by poverty , by predominantly white institutions , by racism but on the other hand , once they get on the basketball court itself , the experience of playing becomes a mode of resistance to their dehumanization and this happens on the level of the religious consciousness in black gods of the asphalt , woodbine pays particular attention to urban street ball tournaments , which he attended regularly from 2010 to 2014 , doing field research the tournaments are often named for players who have been killed , and thus function like yoruba rituals in yoruba tradition , woodbine said , there are perennial human problems death , loss , disease and there are things that are good in life vitality , energy , relationships , children i saw these tournaments were expressing the same idea they were about death , loss , fighting , but the goal was to transform those things death to vitality , a loss to grieve , to reconnect with that individual a play based on black gods of the asphalt , written by woodbine , will be performed at andover in may , and at the oprah winfrey leadership academy for girls in south africa in june in the meantime , he keeps busy teaching at andover , where he coaches the girls' junior varsity basketball team woodbine still plays pickup games with some old friends and when he finds time to think , he thinks back to how important the game was to him as a youth in roxbury there were a few times when people came onto the court and somebody had just been shot , and they would play basketball as if they were playing for that person , woodbine recalled and they could n't miss every shot would go in at the end of the game , they would just fall out crying it became this other place , this place outside the violence of the ghetto i always kept that with me
sarah palin is really falling apart trump s candidacy , it has exposed not just that tragic , the ramifications of that betrayal of a transformation of our country , but too , he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle that has enabled it , ok \? palin told the crowd at her big announcement endorsing donald trump the man himself was standing next to her , with a halfsmile hard to tell if it was selfsatisfaction or the look someone might get when trapped at a dinner party next to a stranger who s describing how she met president william henry harrison in a past life even though palin seemed to have a script , it did n't help he is from the private sector , not a politician can i get a hallelujah \? where in the private sector you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize , to keep the main thing , the main thing , and he knows the main thing , she continued got that \? it s been quite a while since the world outside the tea party has checked in on sarah palin , but i think it s safe to say there has n't been a whole lot of personal growth the absolute high point of her rather long , rambling address was the moment when she complained that the united states pays for middle eastern squirmishes the next day , palin spoke at another trump rally , where she appeared to blame barack obama s veterans policy for her son s domestic violence arrest this week republicans seem currently ok with blaming the president for anything , including sunspots but even some of them must have found it a little creepy still , trump has been having a super week palin was n't even the high point that came when iowa s sixterm republican governor , terry branstad , urged voters to reject trump s main competitor , ted cruz ted cruz is ahead right now but what we 're doing is , we 're trying to do is educate the people of iowa he is the biggest opponent of renewable fuels , branstad told a press conference renewable fuels is code for the government ethanol program , which has been stupendously profitable for the iowa corn industry cruz has broken one of the great traditions of the iowa caucus \( first in the nation ! forever ! \) , which is that every major presidential candidate falls down to worship big corn iowa s many , many corn farmers have always gotten lots of government aid the environmental working group says that between 1995 and 2012 , they received more than 15 billion in subsidies on top of that , we 've got the ethanol program , which requires gasoline to be mixed with biofuel , usually corn this causes corn prices to soar and creates environmental problems due to overplanting a triplelayer subsidy cake , said scott faber of the ewg all this is the opposite of fiscal conservatism , but generally , politicians find a way to evolve on the subject when they get to iowa this year cruz has hung tough perhaps it s because he s close to big oil , which wants the gas tanks for itself but whatever the reason , he s paying the price a proethanol group , which happens to be led by the governor s son , ran a mess of ads against him cruz seemed to waver , then stiffened out charged branstad with his warning a popular governor s antipathy could be a big deal let s take a minute to feel sympathy for ted cruz poor guy ok , time s up dear friend , wrote cruz to his mailing list on wednesday i literally have no time to explain the longestserving republican career politician in the nation and his politically connected family is coordinating with establishment politicians and super pacs to lead an 11th hour attack against us and sink our campaign ted said he is responding with everything i have but that would be much easier if he had another 265 , 000 in donations posthaste meanwhile , donald trump is supremely happy the governor just made a very big statement that was appreciated by many , he told a gathering of yes ! the iowa renewable fuels association before going on to announce that he was not only in favor of requiring corn in every tankful of gas , but he wanted to see the proportion go higher as president i will encourage congress to be cautious in attempting to change of the rfs , he continued that would be renewable fuel standard trump was reading this speech , which he claimed he had written himself it was deep into ethanolspeak all of you who think he s still just a free spirit flying around the country saying whatever the hell comes into his mind , be aware this is now an increasingly careful politician cruz , he said , without actually mentioning any names , is a tool of the oil companies he goes wherever the votes are , trump said contemptuously none of that here , god knows
the between senator and gov of ohio , formed to deny the republican presidential nomination , was already fraying almost to the point of irrelevance on monday , only hours after it was announced to great fanfare with the pact , the two candidates agreed to cede forthcoming primary contests to each other mr kasich would , most crucially , stand down in indiana s primary on may 3 to give mr cruz a better chance to defeat mr trump there , while mr cruz would leave oregon and new mexico to mr kasich it appeared to be a measure of last resort , but initially it seemed like a breakthrough mr cruz trumpeted what he called the big news in indiana , a state that appears pivotal to stopping mr trump from winning a majority of delegates john kasich has decided to pull out of indiana to give us a headtohead contest with donald trump , he said but at his own campaign stop in philadelphia on monday , mr kasich tamped down mr cruz s triumphalism voters in indiana , mr kasich said , ought to vote for me , even if he would not be campaigning publicly there he added , i do n't see this as any big deal under the best of circumstances , the arrangement between mr cruz and mr kasich would seem to be a long shot more of an expedient to stop mr trump from taking a big step toward winning the nomination next week in indiana than a permanent joining of forces far from forming any kind of unity ticket , mr trump s surviving challengers have both vowed to triumph in an open convention in cleveland , and they remain irreconcilable on key matters of policy their agreement dealt only with three states , leaving an open question as to how directly they might compete with each other everywhere else even in indiana , emerging as the most important state , the cruzkasich pact appeared something less than decisive while mr kasich s campaign canceled his public appearances in the state , the governor was still slated to visit indianapolis on tuesday for a fundraising event at the columbia club and he still had meetings scheduled with a series of indiana republicans , including gov mike pence , according to a leading republican in the state mr cruz s campaign privately advised supporters on sunday not to endorse tactical voting , whereby his supporters might switch their allegiance to mr kasich in states where the ohio governor is running stronger against mr trump we never tell voters who to vote for , read the suggested cruz talking point we 're simply letting folks know where we will be focusing our time and resources mr trump , who has taunted his opponents throughout the race for their keystone kops approach to undermining his campaign , seemed to relish the continuing strain between his remaining rivals on twitter , he mocked lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich , referring to the latter s dismal winning record in the republican race , for being unable to beat him on their own so they have to team up \( collusion \) in a two on one , shows weakness ! at a campaign rally in rhode island , mr trump boasted that his opponents were united against him , and said he welcomed their collusion actually i was happy , he said , because it shows how weak they are allies of both mr cruz and mr kasich did not exactly disagree with that assessment , and acknowledged that the prospect of imminent disaster in indiana had been the impetus to reach their deal , such as it is still , aides to mr cruz and mr kasich seem acutely aware that they risk turning off voters who find the arrangement unseemly even before his rivals' agreement , mr trump had complained repeatedly that the nominating process was rigged against him with mr trump expected to win all five of the east coast states that , the next opportunity to slow his campaign will come a week later in indiana republicans believe he must be stopped there if they are to deny him the nomination indiana is a mustwin for ted cruz , and it s a mustwin for anybody who does n't think donald trump should be the nominee , said david mcintosh , the president of the , a conservative group opposed to mr trump and supportive of mr cruz the group is airing urging voters to vote for mr cruz , not mr kasich , to stop mr trump , and officials said they intended to keep it on the air despite the agreement on monday , , a group supporting mr cruz , said it also planned to keep a previously announced attack ad against mr kasich on the air in indiana the group added , though , that it had shelved advertising plans in new mexico and oregon charles r black jr , an adviser to mr kasich , said it would be helpful to his candidate and a big blow to trump for mr cruz to win indiana the point of announcing the deal , mr black said , was to indicate to outside where the campaigns and candidates were marshaling their resources mr black played down the degree to which voters would cast their ballots strategically , switching allegiance between candidates to thwart mr trump either the guy gets to 1 , 237 or he does n't , he said voters do n't focus on this tactical , inside baseball stuff for months , rivals of the republican frontrunner have claimed that he has succeeded only because the antitrump vote has been spread among so many alternative candidates that argument appeared to falter in new york last week , when mr trump and captured nearly all of the state s delegates now that each of them has been granted a cleaner shot against mr trump in different states , and at different moments over the next few weeks mr cruz and mr kasich will have no easy excuse if mr trump continues to prevail while mr cruz faces the more immediate test in indiana , mr kasich will have to make swift use of his free hand in oregon though the state s primary date is may 17 , the election there is conducted by mail , and voters will begin to receive their ballots this week ron saxton , a prominent kasich supporter in oregon , said the deal puts more pressure on mr kasich and mr cruz to perform strongly against mr trump but mr saxton , a former republican candidate for governor , said there was catching up to do in his state none of the three campaigns have any real oregon visibility yet , just the national press , mr saxton wrote in an email since cruz s name remains on the ballot , my guess is that he 'll get close to the same votes he 'd get if he had n't withdrawn' is he going to actively encourage his supporters to vote for kasich \? on monday , both candidates swatted away questions about whether the deal was something of an underhanded ploy mr cruz said the agreement was aimed at empowering antitrump voters against the frontrunner , denying that the effort to stop mr trump was subverting the will of the people this is entirely about the will of the people , he said this is about winning the votes of the hoosier state mr kasich , in pennsylvania , grew quickly agitated at the suggestion that his deal with mr cruz reflected desperation me \? no , i'm not desperate are you \? he asked a reporter are you desperate \?
washington top senate democrats yearn for video of s nominee being ignored outside senator mitch mcconnell s suite just off the senate floor , perhaps snacking on the hershey s chocolate kisses the kentucky republican keeps in small bowls in his outer office they ca n't wait for scenes of the president s choice being barred from the reception area of a republican member of the senate judiciary committee s office , ushered out without so much as a friendly hello those images would be something never seen in a supreme court nomination typically , it begins as a dignified process , with a white house ceremony and a series of decorous photo opportunities in senate offices the unveiling of s court pick promises to be a brawl from the start rather than the usual niceties about scrutinizing the nominee s record and awaiting a hearing , democrats and republicans are preparing for an immediate acceleration of the fight once the identity of the president s choice is known republicans have made clear there will be no confirmation hearing to await senate democrats are hoping the nominee , who traditionally says little if anything before the confirmation hearings , is prepared from the outset to be more outspoken they also want the white house to break with precedent and allow the nominee to do interviews with the news media allies of the administration say that while the unusual situation might require unusual measures , they do n't see the white house straying too far from the usual supreme court confirmation playbook or putting the nominee in awkward situations democrats say they will have no choice but to aggressively press on behalf of the nominee if republicans hold to their position and refuse to even entertain the nomination it would be making a point that this president has a constitutional duty to nominate a qualified and capable candidate , and the senate has a duty to provide advice and consent , said senator chris coons of delaware , a democrat who is a member of the judiciary committee i am hopeful that if the president s nominee is someone who is just eminently qualified and reasonable and they keep at it and are persistent , they will eventually get a hearing republicans are having none of it they say they intend to hold off any publicrelations onslaught and assert that the point is n't the person mr obama puts up for the job , but simply that the vacancy caused by the death of antonin scalia happened in the final year of mr obama s term the person who is nominated is not going to get confirmed , though i am sure they will be a good person , said senator lindsey graham , the south carolina republican who also sits on the judiciary committee it will be no fault of theirs it will just be the way the calendar fell and the way the system works mr graham says he already has a plan for deterring any nominee from knocking on his office door , referring to a 2007 speech by senator chuck schumer , democrat of new york , who raised the theoretical prospect that the senate should not act on any more of president george w bush s nominees i will put schumer s statement on the door and say please read before entering , mr graham said allowing a nominee to serve as an aggressive advocate for a hearing would carry some risks , raising the possibility of making a statement that could backfire or give republicans a chance to accuse the nominee of being too partisan senator charles e grassley , the iowa republican who is the chairman of the judiciary committee , nodded in that direction earlier this week when asked how he would handle the possible nomination of the iowan jane l kelly , a federal appellate judge mr grassley said he would ask any potential nominee what they feel about being used as a political pawn senator john cornyn of texas , the no 2 senate republican and also a member of the judiciary committee , said it would represent an interesting strategy for the white house and democrats to give the nominee a louder microphone and advocate on his or her own behalf if they want to make it more about the personality than the principle of who gets to choose the next nominee , they can certainly do that , mr cornyn said but that is usually a twoedged sword conservative groups say they are already digging into the records and backgrounds of potential court picks to be ready to prevent the white house from framing an irresistible positive personal narrative progressive activists are making similar preparations to move in full support of the nominee as soon as mr obama introduces his pick senate democrats have been discussing among themselves how far they can push their campaign for the nominee , even raising the idea of a democraticonly , fauxhearing if republicans hold firm they do n't seem inclined in that direction , but the coming fight is very likely to take on all the trappings of a political campaign the fact that republicans have ruled out a hearing makes the situation unique and formidable for whoever is chosen and agrees to take on what could be a frustrating and thankless task at a moment that is usually the pinnacle of a legal career this time , the nominee must prepare for not only an arduous confirmation hearing , but a grueling push to even get a hearing , with no guarantee whatsoever of success
miami the poster , the only prominent piece of memorabilia , hangs in the back of the shed next to the dusty old suitcase , a row of unused candles and a pile of vhs tapes , a few bearing the label cuba baseball whenever rene arocha goes for the lawn mower , he can see it , his younger self , no 43 of the around 1993 , caught in the familiar hunchedover , legup pose of a pitcher hurtling something toward the plate it is a tuckedaway reminder of his fleeting fame , a fame that he has sought to tuck away himself after a career that began with a flash of hope but ultimately fizzled in disappointments and unfulfilled expectations i am hidden here , he said , laughing , of the nondescript peach bungalowstyle house here where he lives , with a beatenup 1990s sedan on the lawn , a motorboat in the side yard , squawking parrots on the back patio and a pregnant cat making the rounds yet with one simple but rebellious move , he changed baseball major league baseball and cuba are discussing ways for cuban players to sign with teams without having to defect , taking advantage of a thaw between the countries that will culminate in president obama s twoday trip there , set to begin sunday a new arrangement would formalize the decadeslong flow of cuban players showing up on american shores and on major league rosters including star players like yasiel puig , yoenis cespedes , aroldis chapman and orlando hernandez , known as el duque before all of them , and scores of others , there was rene arocha he never got a bigmoney contract or played memorably enough to be a household name , even among ardent fans at best , he may be a curious footnote but on july 10 , 1991 , he committed a simple but utterly rebellious act that opened the way for the modern surge of cuban players he walked away from the cuban national team during a layover in miami and sought asylum in the united states until then , no active player on the national team , the best of the best in the country , had defected he was the one who started the current wave of players defecting and deciding to come to the us and staying here , said peter c bjarkman , a longtime scholar of cuban baseball , whose book cuba s baseball defectors is scheduled for publication in may he really was the pioneer now , the kind of defections to which arocha opened the way may be on the way out after fidel castro took power in 1959 , he abolished professional baseball and established the national series , a 16team amateur league run by a government department this is the triumph of free baseball over slave baseball , castro declared , showing his distaste for the buying and selling of players in the united states leagues before arocha defected , a few players managed to make it to the united states , but none had been active players on the highprofile national team one player , barbaro garbey , who had been imprisoned on a gamefixing charge and who left cuba on the mariel boatlift , a mass migration of more than 120 , 000 cuban refugees to the united states in 1980 , did make it to the major leagues but garbey was not an active player when he left cuba , bjarkman said , and his departure did not cause nearly the stir that arocha s did arocha , by contrast , was a star pitcher on cuba s national team when he left , a righthander with a 92mileanhour fastball at 25 , however , he was already an overworked pitcher cuba tended not to use relievers , so starters often worked entire games , sometimes several a week i got injured when i was 17 , but i still played , arocha said we used terrible baseballs , too none of the equipment was good then even as major league baseball has applied to the treasury department to institute a new system to draft cuban players to teams directly a pathway that the league expects would preempt the smuggling and the often chaotic and dangerous journeys of cuban players to the united states players continue to arrive last month , two brothers , yulieski gourriel , 31 , and lourdes gourriel jr , 22 , left the cuban national team while in the dominican republic , two of the most highprofile defections in recent years their father , lourdes gourriel sr , was one of cuba s most celebrated players arocha played with him on the cuba teams that won the 1986 amateur world series and the 1988 baseball world cup against the united states i still remember lourdes s home run that tied the score before we went on to win , arocha said i gave up the runs that put the united states ahead , but then he tied it pow ! there is pride in that voice of course , he said i am very proud i am cuban , pure cuban i am just not a baseball player it is no longer part of my life he paused for a moment it is a little like when you were with a woman , and now you are no longer with her if jose canseco , the oakland athletics' allstar , had not decided to make a candy bar , arocha might not have ended up in the majors cuba now closely guards the travels of its players , driving many defecting players to risk harrowing journeys in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers but arocha s defection was remarkably simple the team was on a layover in miami after playing a series of exhibition games against the united states the players were staying at the hotel in the middle of the airport , arocha said , and he just walked out he did have a plan in fact , he said , he had been plotting for a long time to make a break from the team , considering and then dropping the idea on at least two earlier occasions when the team was traveling miami , however , made a lot of sense because he had relatives there when his father and aunt came to visit at the airport hotel , he told them he was not going back to cuba and would stay with them they did n't know what i was going to do , he said i told them i was staying they could not believe it he slipped out of the hotel and through an exit door in the crowded terminal , apparently not closely watched by cuban officials , who had not dealt with a defection before the next day , according to news accounts at the time , the cuban team waited on the plane for arocha and waited , and waited , until after a few hours it was clear he was not going to show up back in cuba , he was denounced as a traitor in official media in cuba , he had left a wife and young daughter but doubted they would suffer reprisals \( his daughter eventually joined him \) it was not about them , he said it was about me he had been playing baseball since he was 13 , starting in his hometown , regla , near havana he had worked his way up through the equivalent of the minor leagues to the metropolitanos and the industriales , two of the country s best teams in total , he is credited with 100 wins and a 600 winning percentage , bjarkman said , and was talked up as the probable starter for cuba s olympic baseball team at the 1992 barcelona games over the years , a torn achilles' tendon set him back and his throwing arm went cold and hot , but he made it to the national team with the dissolution of the soviet union in 1989 , cuba entered what is known as the special period , an era of food shortages and want among the worst the country has endured baseball players were not spared sometimes on the road we slept right in the stands , outside with the mosquitoes , he said just like everybody else , we had to search for food and figure out how to get by he added , i did n't have eggs in the refrigerator , either there were other slights the authoritarian ways of the country trickled down to athletics players , arocha said , were tightly controlled decisions on who would start which games were never explained , and the players were forced to attend meetings to hear political speeches nothing was ever explained they just made decisions and nobody would know why , he said off the field , people were punished for seemingly minor violations he recalled the time an uncle was jailed for simply possessing american dollars it was all getting to him , he said i wanted freedom , he said yes , i was playing baseball and wondered if i could play in the big leagues , but mainly i wanted to be free not even his wife at the time knew his plan , he said she went to the havana airport to meet him they eventually split up , and he has since remarried in the united states it was hard at first , he said i missed cuba , but i knew i could not go back the sudden freedom to speak his mind bewildered him at first at a cafe in little havana in miami , he was stunned to hear fellow cubans loudly criticizing president george bush bush this , bush that , he recalled , chuckling at the memory i was looking around and thinking , how could they be talking like this about the president \? ' nobody was hushing their voice that s how you can tell a newly arrived cuban they still talk in whispers the exile community embraced him , though arocha was wary of political activism i know nothing about politics , he a few weeks after arriving as that article noted , arocha had left shortly before havana was to play host to the panamerican games , perhaps adding to fidel castro s ire gus dominguez , a cubanamerican working at an advertising firm in los angeles , happened to be visiting a miami radio station to help promote canseco s candy bar while word spread of arocha s defection a sports reporter helped him make the connection i knew canseco s agents , so i agreed to bring rene to los angeles to meet them and see what could happen , dominguez said a week later , the meeting had still not panned out baseball had no system in place to draft cuban players , so everybody was operating with caution and suspicion finally , rene tells me , why do n't you be my agent \? you are the only one helping me , ' dominguez said he said , i will learn how to play baseball here and you learn how to be an agent' it took several months , but the league decided to hold a special lottery for arocha the st louis cardinals signed him i wanted him to play , to at least give it a shot , dominguez said , adding his talent was above average , but he was n't great what made him above average is you could tell winning was always on his mind pitching in cuba was one thing pitching in the big leagues was another i thought my years of experience would help , but i had a lot to learn , arocha said slider , sinker , everything i mostly used the fastball in cuba arocha went 118 his rookie season in 1993 he remembered standing on the mound in that first game against the cincinnati reds on april 9 , 1993 i thought , i really did it , he said i have arrived it turned out to be the pinnacle of his career the next season , he was in the bullpen arocha did not adjust well , mentally or physically , and ended up with an elbow injury that at first was diagnosed as a bone chip but was later found to be a torn tendon he required tommy john surgery , and in his eyes and the eyes of his associates , it signaled the end of his career he missed the 1996 season he was cut by the cardinals after playing three seasons and signed with the san francisco giants in 1997 for a season but did not start , relegated to one of their minor league teams in 1998 , he played for the new orleans zephyrs , a houston astros class aaa team , then went on to play in mexican leagues in 1999 and discussed a comeback with the mets in 2000 , but there was not enough interest , and he retired he settled here , because the community had always welcomed him thousands of fans of cuban descent had watched and cheered him here when he had pitched against the marlins in a game that rookie season without a doubt , arocha was a pitcher with a lot of talent , but injuries and bad luck always followed him , said ian padron , a cuban filmmaker who featured arocha in his 2003 documentary on cuban baseball , fuera de liga \( out of this league \) still , arocha s relative success when he was healthy answered doubts about whether top cuban players could play in the big leagues his rookie season alone was solid enough to answer the many doubts of the skeptics , bjarkman writes in his new book , and to demonstrate that at least the top cuban league pitchers could indeed make the grade at the highest levels of professional baseball i do n't watch baseball , none of the games or spring training or anything , arocha said recently on his cluttered back patio i never liked watching baseball i do n't have patience for that i liked playing baseball he likened his split with the sport to a chapter in my life that has ended sometimes they come around and ask me to play softball , he added i do n't even do that yet he is still conscious enough of his image to have of his playing days on youtube who , after all , wants to be forgotten \? at the suggestion that he might feel differently if baseball had made him rich or if injuries had not derailed his career , he shrugged who knows \? for a time he did run a youth baseball academy , coaching children , but the business failed in hard economic times and he closed it in 2010 he gets by driving a van for a medical clinic and spends his free time on his motorboat or with his three grown children , two of whom were born and raised in the united states he never got the multimilliondollar contracts that many cuban players land now his signing bonus with st louis was 15 , 000 \( i thought it was a fortune , he said \) the most he made in a season was 300 , 000 i do n't have control over such things , he said of the difference in contracts those players deserve it they have the talent i was in a different time he still harbors doubts about cuba and the talk of changes there several of his relatives have gone on trips to cuba and encouraged him to go , but he said he doubted that much had really changed his only visit came during a 1994 humanitarian tour to visit refugees at the american military base at guant namo , which is walled off from the rest of the country players are going to keep coming because there still is no freedom there , he said he noted that puig and a few other players who had defected visited cuba in november but only as part of a goodwill trip organized by major league baseball and the players' union so it was controlled , he said if i go , i want to go wherever i want , whenever i want that is freedom in the fading afternoon light , he is waxing the side of his 17foot boat parked in the yard when he takes it out on the seas , it occurs to him he may encounter cubans on rafts fleeing the island , a common occurrence in south florida i hear you ca n't bring them on the boat , he says you could be accused of smuggling you throw them water and food and call the coast guard the letters indicating the name of the boat are fading lady no , arocha interrupts no , that s not the name i have n't named it yet , but i have the name picked out he smiles , pausing for effect industriales ! and he laughs loudly at the inside joke , one for the cuban fans
great new yorker or greatest new yorker \? last september , the internet embraced of a rat dragging the city s finest populist comestible down a subway staircase it was hilarious and disgusting , but for city folk , the identification went deeper here was a fellow prole , having battled new york city for an absurdly large prize , humping it home like a weary commuter pizza rat was us in the grungy spirit of pizza rat comes hbo s animated comedy which has its premiere on friday based on a series of online shorts by the creators phil matarese and mike luciano and produced by the indie power sibs jay and mark duplass \( togetherness \) , it imagines this city s schlubbiest critters pigeons and bugs , police horses and alley cats as neurotic hipsters it s not exactly or but it s what you might find behind those shows' baseboards animals , like netflix s is a comedy about creatures that have the anxieties and social entanglements of humans , but the appetites and drives of animals it s a funny gimmick , raunchily executed , but not much more than that the series begins with two rat buddies heading to a party , on the hunt for mates \( one of them has procured a saltine we ca n't all be pizza rat \) it s the hookupanxiety stuff of a dozen singleshangout sitcoms , but intensified by the rodents' much faster biological clocks \( this guy is the king of making babies ! is how a rat wingman talks \) underneath its fur and feathers , animals is a pretty familiar species comedicus bohemiana , the observational , urban comedy its animation is soottinged and static , with the unpretty , distressed look of an alternative graphic novel it enlists a menagerie of indie film and comedy guest voices , including both duplasses , molly shannon , nick kroll , wanda sykes and marc maron \( playing a rat version of himself \) at its best , the show uses animal life to send up specific cityliving situations and subcultures a story about two cat brothers that have never left their apartment gradually lays bare the creepy , codependent relationship behind the cuddly exterior a bit about moths gathering around an electric sign imagines the experience as a kind of trippy insect burning man \( this is my favorite part , right when the light starts hitting this moment is all there is , and then you see the light \) because of its anthology format , animals does n't have much time to develop any particular character \( there is a continuing , superfluous story line about a seedy bunch of people unlike the animals , the humans mostly do n't speak \) this is the kind of loose , talky slacker comedy that needs razorsharp observations and originality to work unfortunately , the writing is n't consistently funny enough to make up for the , well , shaggy dog storytelling too often , the conceit of an animals vignette is to take a familiar setup an awkward dinner party , say and add the joke but they 're fish ! animals has inspired moments , and it deserves credit for trying to expand beyond the millions of human stories in the naked city but simply being a rat is not enough to make you an interesting person
london for the first time in the tournament s 20year history , the playoff stages of rugby s champions cup will include only french and english clubs five english teams the most ever from one nation and three from france will contest the quarterfinals when the tournament resumes in april , after a twomonth break for the six nations championship in europe the last hopes of the celtic nations were foiled when the welsh club ospreys lost out in a fourway chase for first in its qualifying pool the leaders at the start of the day , ospreys lost , 3317 , to the english club exeter , who rose from third place to win the pool on headtohead records over the french club bordeaux begles , which won , 3728 , at clermont auvergne ospreys fell to third on another tiebreaker , number of tries scored all four teams were tied with a projected 16 points in the pool standings with only three minutes to go as exeter led ospreys , 2617 , and bordeaux led , 3428 , at clermont but a penalty goal by bordeaux s pierre bernard deprived clermont of the bonus point awarded for losing by seven points or fewer , sending it from first to last and exeter s veteran no 8 , thomas waldrom , scored his second try of the afternoon and exeter s fifth to end the ospreys' hopes clermont might still have reclaimed its bonus , but the french international scrumhalf morgan parra chose to seek a try rather than take the points when the team was awarded a kickable penalty chance exeter , which had not previously made the final eight , will visit its fellow english club wasps in the quarterfinals the ospreys' ouster means wales has not had a playoff team in four years the last time the playoffs have been without an irish team was 199798 ireland had three quarterfinalists as recently as two years ago its last hope , ulster , did its best on the final weekend by beating the french club oyonnax , 563 , to initially lay claim to one of the three places for the best runnersup , but it saw all of its rivals win to knock it out of contention the anglofrench monopoly is perhaps the logical outcome of the reorganization of the tournament two years ago , which reduced the representation of the celtic nations and also changed how they qualified it has meant that there was little to counterbalance the greater wealth of the french and english clubs fueled by rich ownership and lucrative television deals even so , some familiar french names will be missing most surprising is clermont , which has been a finalist in two of the last three seasons and had won its last 24 matches at home in europe the perennial contender and fourtime champion toulouse had its worst tournament ever , winning only one of six games and winding up last in its group after losing , 2817 , at home to saracens toulon , which has overtaken toulouse as france s superpower by winning for the last three seasons , teetered on the edge of elimination for the second week running when it trailed at bath but a try by bryan habana and a penalty from james o'connor squeezed it through , 1914 our handling and distribution could have been better , but we defended very well , said toulon s attack coach , steve meehan we got off to an ordinary start in this competition so we have n't finished top of the group , but it just means we take a different route that route will start in paris at racing 92 , which had already won its group before losing its final pool match , 225 , in glasgow toulon s place at the top of its group was taken by wasps , a twotime winner in 2004 and 2007 , which squeezed past it on tries scored by beating the threetime champion leinster , 5110 it s a huge achievement by these players to get out of this group , and i do n't think too much money was riding on us to do it , said the wasps coach , david young we 've gone to bath and ireland and won , and we should have won in france against toulon last week exeter will play at wasps , while saracens will be taking on another english club when they host northampton in the quarterfinal saracens finished 60 in their group and will be the top seed in the playoff draw none of the 12 teams that has previously swept its group has ever gone on to take the trophy , though nor has any top seed northampton qualified by winning 2210 in llanelli against the scarlets its fourth try , securing the decisive bonus point , was scored by george north , a former scarlet the fourth quarterfinal will match leicester against another paris club , stade fran ais , reprising their two meetings in the pool stage this year the second , on sunday , in which stade defeated the tigers , 3621 , in paris , secured the final runnerup place and eliminated ulster leicester had already won the pool
the economic forces driving this year s nomination contests have been at work for decades why did the dam break now \? the share of the gross national product going to labor as opposed to the share going to capital fell from 688 percent in 1970 to 607 percent by 2013 , according to , an economics professor at the university of chicago s booth school of business even more devastating , the dropped by 36 percent , from 193 million in 1979 to 123 million in 2015 , while the increased by 43 percent , from 225 million to 321 million the postwar boom , when measured by the , continued into the early 1970s and then abruptly stopped \( see the accompanying chart \) in other words , the economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years starting in 2000 , two related developments added to worsening conditions for the middle and working classes first , that year marked the before 2000 , the size of both the lower and middle classes had shrunk , while the percentage of households with inflationadjusted incomes of 100 , 000 or more grew americans were moving up the ladder after 2000 , the middle class continued to shrink , but so did the percentage of households making 100 , 000 or more the only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of 35 , 000 or less americans were moving down the ladder \( this downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article \) the second adverse trend is that trade with china , which shot up after in december 2001 , imposed far larger costs on american workers than most economists anticipated , according to and the costs of trade with china have fallen most harshly on workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder in their january 2016 paper , , david autor , david dorn and gordon hanson , economists at mit , the university of zurich and the university of californiasan diego respectively , found that high wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and do not experience an earnings loss , argue autor and his colleagues low wage workers , in contrast , suffer large differential earnings loss , as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers this is why trump s charge that china has gotten the better of the united states has gained traction when i asked what factors provoked the populist insurgencies in both parties in this particular election cycle , he emailed back the stew , to continue hanson s metaphor , began to boil over with the cataclysmic in which many people left and right felt was caused by on wall street the collapse and the destruction it left in its wake was , without question , the most important economic and political event in recent years it was the financial crisis , what it revealed about governmentwall street links , and the fumbling of the response to it that put the nail in the coffin of trust in government , , an economist at mit , wrote in reply to my questions once trust in government was destroyed , those that had not benefited from the previous boom years became particularly easy pickings for populist rhetoric on , congress enacted , and president bush signed , the tarp funds bailed out major investment banks , and were also used , as the federal reserve bank of st louis put it , to make loans and direct equity investments to select auto industry participants , backstop credit markets , provide a lifeline to the american international group \( aig \) and provide ongoing support for government housing initiatives but in addition , tarp insulated the very institutions and executives that caused the collapse and the disastrous recession that followed i do n't think you can underestimate or underemphasize the impact of the bailout , , a scholar at the american enterprise institute , a centerright think washington think tank , told me in an email on jan 10 , 2010 , the supreme court granted those in upper income brackets additional privileges \( buttressed by subsequent \) that allowed wealthy individuals , corporations and unions to make unlimited political contributions by opening the door to the creation of super pacs and giving wall street and other major financial sectors new ways to buy political outcomes , the courts gave the impression , to say the least , that they favored establishment interests over those of the less well off a last september found that 78 percent of voters would like to see citizens united overturned , and this view held across a range of partisan loyalties republicans at 80 percent democrats at 83 and independents at 71 in march 2010 , two months after citizens united was decided , president obama signed the affordable care act , aka obamacare , a program perceived as reducing their own medical care in order to provide health coverage to the disproportionately minority poor by the midterm elections of 2010 , voter dissatisfaction among whites found expression in the tea party movement , which produced the sweeping in competitive congressional districts as well as of moderate and centerright republicans in primary contests voter anger was directed at two targets the undeserving rich and the undeserving poor the 2010 election pattern was repeated in the 2014 midterms to many of those who cast their ballots in anger in 2010 and 2014 , however , it appeared that their votes had not changed anything obamacare stayed in place ,  already disillusioned with the democratic party , these white voters became convinced that , not only on economic issues , but on cultural matters as well a asked voters if they agreed or disagreed with the statement more and more , i do n't identify with what america has become 72 percent of surveyed republicans concurred , compared to 58 percent of independents and 45 percent of democrats two thirds of republicans , 62 percent , agreed with the statement these days i feel like a stranger in my own country , compared to 53 percent of independents and 37 percent of democrats here is one place where trump s scathing dismissal of political correctness found fertile ground jared bernstein , a senior fellow at the center for budget and policy priorities , described in blunt terms the consequences of disillusionment with old guard republicans in these circumstances , bernstein wrote , the logic supporting the traditional republican party fell apart just as animosity to republican power brokers in washington intensified , the republican party began to splinter i asked , a stanford law professor , are party establishments now fictions , no longer able to exercise control \? persily responded on super tuesday , donald trump won that were up for grabs he collected far more delegates than ted cruz or marco rubio the tragedy of the 2016 campaign is that trump has mobilized a constituency with legitimate grievances on a fool s errand if he is shoved out of the field somehow , his supporters will remain bitter and enraged , convinced that a selfserving and malign elite defeated their leader if he prevails , a constituency that could force politicians to confront the problems of the working and middle class will waste its energies on a candidate incompetent to improve the lives of the credulous men and women lining up to support him

augusta , ga reduce this year s masters to jordan spieth versus rory mcilroy at your peril with two rounds to play , there is a mob of fine golfers just behind them and more blustery weather just ahead of them but there is certainly no doubt which pairing on saturday deserves to be the biggest magnet for spectators spieth , the 22yearold defending champion , is still in the lead but no longer on quite the same roll after the first overpar round \( 74 \) of his brief and remarkable masters career mcilroy , the 26yearold wouldbe champion , trails by only one shot after a gutty 71 on friday that put him solidly back in contention to win the only major title he is missing i 'd rather be playing with someone less threatening , to be honest , spieth said , prompting laughter in the interview room he s certainly proven himself in the majors , but i think it s going to be fun a really fun challenge a 71 might not sound like much of a charge at augusta national , the garden spot where spieth finished at 18 under par last year but mcilroy s round was worth toasting in the clubhouse on friday , with nerves fraying and tree limbs swaying in gusty conditions that whipped sand out of the bunkers on the 18th into spectators' faces at one uncivilized stage i think i was just trying to fend off the golf course , mcilroy said he did it very effectively there were only four rounds under par on friday , and none better than 71 i feel so much better about myself after today than i did yesterday , mcilroy said on thursday , mcilroy bogeyed two of the final three holes on the way to a 70 on friday , he played the final six holes in three under and the final three holes in one under to manage it , he needed to sink a curling , 40foot birdie putt on 16 and then make a great escape on the 18th after driving into the trees and then hunching low to try to get a clear view out of trouble there actually was n't a window , he said but he found enough daylight to punch the ball low off the pine straw with a 4iron and onto the fairway , where he then hit a fine approach shot that landed high above the hole and rolled slowly back to within 12 feet of the pin mcilroy then holed his putt for par huge , mcilroy said spieth did some fine scrambling of his own after thursday s hyperresourceful , bogeyfree 66 , he quickly dropped to eight under after two birdies on the first three holes and opened up a fiveshot lead at one early stage but the venerable augusta course has a great deal more bite this year than in 2015 , and it soon took a significant toll on spieth s bottom line , beginning with a double bogey on the par4 fifth hole in which spieth one of the game s great putters missed twice from relatively short range there were four more bogeys and just two more birdies from there really tough conditions for where the pins were located , and the greens got really crusty in the end , spieth told espn after the round it was a battle yet at four under , he remains the sole leader for the sixth straight round at the masters , a remarkable achievement for a young man who cannot overwhelm the course with power off the tee there is no grip it and rip it in spieth s golf he is a deep thinker , so reflective that officials put his group on the clock for slow play near the end of the first round on thursday and at the 11th hole on friday with the group s pace of play being monitored , he ran the risk of a twoshot penalty though no penalty was imposed , spieth was far from delighted i would n't say it was unfair , he said i would say , have fun getting on the clock at 11 of augusta and then play 11 and 12 rushing with gusting winds it s not fun not fun at all mcilroy , who started his round nearly two hours earlier , plays at a brisker pace and the contrast in their styles and personalities could make for quite an intragenerational tussle at this masters mcilroy and spieth set the table for that matchup on the same day that the 66yearold tom watson played his final round at the masters , missing the cut at eight over watson , a twotime masters champion , was greeted with ovation after ovation as he walked the rolling course where he had won in 1977 and 1981 , doffing his cap repeatedly and tearing up on the 18th green after he thanked his longtime caddie neil oxman he was going to plow out ahead of me and let me have my glory , and i said no way you 're walking up the last hole with me , ' watson said phil mickelson , at 45 , is nowhere near his last masters , but he too failed to make the cut , missing it by one shot with a sevenover total of 151 i know it was tough , he said of the course conditions but it was n't as tough as i made it look other former masters champions to miss the cut included zach johnson , charl schwartzel and trevor immelman the twotime winner bubba watson , who finished at 150 , appeared to be in that group as well , until a late bogey from spieth on 17 put watson within the requisite 10 shots of the leader spieth and mcilroy have not yet had a great duel in the sun \( or the shade \) at a major but they have been paired together with some frequency , including the first two days of the 2014 masters i do n't think i can get wrapped up in that and buy into the big 3 , mcilroy said of the label used to describe him , spieth and the world no 1 jason day , who is at one over , five shots off the lead of course , it s great for the game but whenever i'm out there playing and competing , that s absolutely not what i should be thinking about i should be concentrating on myself and thinking about what i need to do to win this golf tournament , regardless of who else is up there there is plenty of talent in striking range the young new zealander danny lee and the american scott piercy are two shots off the lead at two under brandt snedeker , soren kjeldsen and hideki matsuyama are tied for fifth at one under sergio garc a and dustin johnson are four behind also in that group is bryson dechambeau , the 22yearold united states amateur and ncaa champion he played with spieth for the first two rounds and was at three under heading into the 18th hole on friday before an unplayable drive set him up for big trouble and a triple bogey people think , oh my gosh , he was nervous , ' dechambeau said no , i was n't nervous i pulled two shots but friday was undoubtedly a day to question one s own judgment , a day when the implement in one s hand was only an abrupt wind shift away from becoming the wrong implement go ahead ! full commitment , said terry mundy , ian poulter s caddie , urging poulter to hit his tee shot on the watery , treacherous 12th hole \( poulter still missed the green \) there were other such exhortations , along with plenty of mutterings but mcilroy maintained a relatively even strain amid all the changes in his fortunes and scorecard mcilroy has done most of his damage on augusta s four par 5s \( he is a combined seven under on those holes so far this year \) his round friday featured five birdies and two bogeys , and a double bogey on the par3 fourth hole that could have derailed him but mcilroy , who was the pretournament focus last year , was not the prime focus this time i felt i was just part of the narrative instead of narrative , mcilroy said he will now be a big part of the narrative on saturday just be careful about making it all about mcilroy and spieth too many ill winds and talented men remain
dewitt , iowa jim dougherty sat in the last row of a crowded hearing room at city hall here on wednesday night , hands folded in his lap and a look of evident skepticism on his face , as senator , the chairman of the , tried to defend the republicans' position that a nomination should be postponed until after the presidential election then mr dougherty took his shot to your point about delaying or waiting until the next president , i do n't see that that does anything but a disservice to the public , said mr dougherty , 59 , a registered republican who is supporting gov john kasich of ohio for president the constitution says justices are nominated by the president with the advice and consent of the senate mr grassley parried that the senate , exercising its constitutional authority , might also decide not to advise or consent it also implies if you do n't want to act , as well , or if you want to disapprove , you see , either way , mr grassley said as chairman of the judiciary committee , mr grassley must decide whether to schedule a confirmation hearing on a court nominee , arguably giving him more power than any other individual senator in deciding if the process will move forward but he has given off conflicting signals about his intentions in the immediate aftermath of , mr grassley said the senate should not take up a nominee until after the presidential election he later said he had not ruled out holding hearings in the week since , he seemed increasingly uncertain , saying that his preference was that not make a nomination , but that he expected that one would be made anyway in a series of town hall meetings this week , his answers to sometimes aggressive questioning from his constituents were ambiguous , and he repeatedly said he would take things one step at a time on friday , in an in the washington post that mr grassley wrote with senator mitch mcconnell , the majority leader , mr grassley said voters should decide in the november presidential election whom they trusted to nominate the next justice if mr grassley , 82 , who is running for a seventh term , seems uncertain about how to proceed , the sentiment from the town hall meetings was clear in a state that prides itself on good government , the message was that he should hold confirmation hearings , presuming mr obama submits a qualified nominee i do understand the hesitation , why republicans would say we do n't want to give obama the chance to influence the court for years and years and years , mr dougherty said but that s the political side of the coin i would like to think that , especially with supreme court nominations , we could get above the fray a little bit and determine what s best for the public bill nichols , 60 , also pressed mr grassley at the meeting in dewitt , in eastern iowa it s all about good governance , he said like many iowans , mr nichols switches party affiliation depending on the competitiveness of elections , and he is currently registered as a republican it s not about approving obama s pick it s about going through the process of advice and consent , he said mr grassley s thorny predicament was made clear as he was repeatedly forced to shift from his usual plainspoken , iowa farmer demeanor to a more lecturing tone , offering intricate explanations of process and precedents in washington under heavy pressure at a town hall meeting at muscatine community college in muscatine on thursday , mr grassley almost seemed to give in the president is going to nominate somebody , or if he does n't nominate somebody , that s his choice , mr grassley told eva mcbride , who had accused him of flipflopping from 2008 when he said there was no reason to delay approving judicial nominees in president george w bush s final year in office then it comes to the senate , mr grassley continued and then at that point , we are going to act we 're going to act in one of two ways we are either going to give our consent or we 're not going to give our consent either way , the constitution is going to be fulfilled at a town meeting in tipton , iowa , douglas klein , a retired corporate comptroller , stood up to challenge the senator but first wanted to make sure he was showing the proper respect i have a serious question for you , and i do n't want you to take this as derogatory \? mr grassley offered thank you , said mr klein , 68 or maybe you were trying to think , would i take it personal \? mr grassley said you can say anything you want because you are entitled to your opinion mr klein fired away i was wondering if you could enumerate which of the powers of the presidency the constitution suspends during his final year in office \? the senator gave no ground do n't forget , mr grassley said , advice and consent , that is a congressional power , and none of those congressional powers are suspended by the constitution either larry bailey , 76 , of west branch , iowa , was one of many republicans who said they were glad to have mr grassley in a position to block mr obama s nominee it 'll be interesting to see if this iowa farm boy can dig his heels in and say no , ' mr bailey said in tipton , mr grassley tried to explain that both parties had taken strong positions on nominations he noted that senator chuck schumer , democrat of new york , once pledged to block any supreme court nomination made in the last 18 months of mr bush s term but deborah vandergaast , a registered democrat who owns a day care center in tipton , was having none of it congress , she said , often seemed about as mature as kindergartners i think all of us can agree that we are so tired of the partisan politics and this whole thing with the supreme court nomination is partisan politics , ms vandergaast began if he makes a good nomination , then let s do the hearings and do it , she said if it s a bad nomination , fine that s fair but doing it based on the fact that a democratic president is making a nomination and we 're hoping that we can get a republican president in , so they can do a nomination , so that our party can maintain or control the balance in the supreme court , is not representing us it s representing your party and yes , i know the democrats have done it in the past , and like i 'll tell the 5yearolds in my care , just because he did it first , does n't make it right the crowd in the basement meeting room of the cedar county courthouse broke out in applause but they were not done i know you are tired of talking about the supreme court nominee , probably heard enough about that , another constituent , larry hogden , 70 , began still , mr hogden wanted to better understand who was in charge of the process he asked mr grassley whether he could call hearings on his own as the judiciary committee chairman or if he had to have the approval of mr mcconnell turns out , mr grassley had been wondering the same thing the senator said he had read through reports by the congressional research service and consulted committee lawyers and concluded that mr mcconnell probably could not hold the nomination out of committee without causing a big quagmire mr hogden pounced , cutting mr grassley off that means that you have got even more power to control how this works out , mr hogden said and i would hope that you would consider working with  sitting off to the side , ernie jennings wanted to make a different point the intense focus on a single court nominee seemed to underscore s criticism that the supreme court had become overly political none of us should be afraid or concerned with the appointment of one supreme court judge , but because of the way the supreme court seems to have been operating for a long time now , they seem to make laws , rather than interpret them that gave mr grassley an opening to advocate a nominee who , like , would want to be known as a textualist , adding , in other words , leave their ideas out of the decision
the allegations are beyond chilling two virginia tech freshmen charged with the premeditated kidnapping and killing of a 13yearold girl who , authorities say , communicated with her murderer online but the way they chatted on a wildly popular messaging app called kik has increasingly become a source of concern for law enforcement the death of , a liver transplant and cancer survivor from blacksburg , va , has put kik widely used by american teenagers but not as well known to adults as snapchat or instagram in the spotlight at a time when law enforcement officials say it has been linked to a growing number of abuse cases neighbors say that the day before she died , nicole showed them kik messages she had exchanged with an 18yearold man she was to meet that night kik is cooperating in the investigation its officials say they responded to multiple emergency requests from the fbi for information that helped lead to the arrests of the students , david eisenhauer , 18 , and natalie marie keepers , 19 , both aspiring engineers from maryland and experts in internet crime caution that the app is just one of many digital platforms abused by all manner of criminals , from smalltime drug dealers to terrorists but law enforcement officials say kik used by 40 percent of american teenagers , goes further than most widely used apps in shielding its users from view , often making it hard for investigators to know who is using it , or how \( yik yak is another popular app under fire for its use of anonymous messages \) kik is the problem app of the moment , said david frattare , commander of the ohio internet crimes against children task force , which includes hundreds of law enforcement agencies we tell parents about kik , and to them it s some earthshattering news , and then it turns out it s been on their kid s phone for months and months and as a law enforcement agency , the information that we can get from kik is extremely limited kik s appeal to young people goes far beyond anonymity teenagers like its special emoji and other features it offers free and unlimited texting and like aol instant messenger and myspace before it , kik is a space that parents are unlikely to know about but it is also place where inappropriate sexual content and behavior can flourish cases involving kik in just the past 10 days include a with using kik to exchange child pornography  with finding a 14yearold girl through kik and , posing as a teenager , sending her sexually explicit messages and trying to get her to meet him  with statutory rape and the attempted kidnapping of a 14yearold girl he contacted on kik with taking a 13yearold connecticut girl to a hotel and sexually assaulting her , after chatting and arranging the meeting on kik the kik app has become so popular , it s probably the one where law enforcement has seen the most activity , said leslie rutledge , the arkansas attorney general , who issued a public plea last year to parents in her state to educate themselves about their children s online habits after two arkansas men used kik to solicit nude photos from underage girls and an undercover investigator founded in 2009 and based in canada , kik aspires to become the , the hugely successful messaging service in china that offers free texting , ecommerce and content delivery its main appeal is privacy and anonymity the app is free , and allows people to find strangers and communicate with them anonymously , through a user name we view user names and anonymity as a safe way to connect with people you meet on the internet , said rod mcleod , a spokesman for kik the company is taking a variety of steps , including sponsoring an annual conference on crimes against children and posting a on its website , to assist in preventing child exploitation , said lisa van heugten , who was hired two years ago and helped form a special kik division devoted to fielding law enforcement requests kik estimates that it has 275 million registered users worldwide , with 70 percent of them in the united states \( the company does not report figures for daily or monthly active users \) but the very anonymity and secrecy that make kik appealing also pose serious challenges for law enforcement the app asks for the user s real name and email address , but it works even if those are fictitious , and the user does not have to supply a phone number unlike some competing apps , kik says it does not have the ability to view written messages between users , or to show them to the police it can view pictures and videos , but retains them only until the recipient s device has received the message those practices are legal with a court order or in a dire emergency as in nicole s death the company can provide the authorities with a log of a user s sent and received messages , and in some cases can supply the user s internet protocol address , giving a physical location in deciding what information to store , the company says , it aims to strike a balance between protecting user privacy and the need to remove bad actors from our platform and assist law enforcement but kik says it can find users on its system with only a user name and because kik is based in canada , law enforcement officials say , it can be a slow process requests have to go through the united states justice department they 've assisted us in a lot of our cases , said detective josh woodhams of the bentonville , ark , police department but when it comes to the content of conversations , they do n't retain information including photos and videos so it makes it tough for us law enforcement officials say they often run across kik in cases of sextortion , or blackmail , in which a sexual predator coaxes a young person to send nude photos and then threatens to post the photos online , or alert the child s parents or harm the child , if he or she does not send more david finkelhor , director of the crimes against children research center at the university of new hampshire said research suggests that social media has not spawned an uptick in violent crimes involving children , but cases involving pornography are on the rise so are arrests professor finkelhor cautions against technophobia , saying character traits not technology make young people vulnerable those who are socially isolated , who have conflict with their parents , who are bullied in school or who are depressed are at higher risk , he said , both in facetoface and electronic environments those risk factors were clearly present in the abduction in virginia of nicole madison lovell , whose mother , tammy weeks , has said she was bullied in school , in part because of the tracheotomy scar she bore from her liver transplant and they were a factor in a november case involving kik in ohio , where a 15yearold girl got in a car with a man she knew only through kik , who drove her more than 500 miles from her home in cleveland almost a month later , the police and fbi burst into a house in missouri , freed the girl and arrested the man they said had held her captive , raped her and videorecorded the act after her rescue she spoke out , which hid her identity she said she had been mourning the death of her stepfather , and was upset that her mother had moved in with a boyfriend on kik , she found someone , claiming to be a man in his 20s , who offered her help and gave her the attention she craved , she said that man , law enforcement officials said , was he destroyed her phone , according to the fbi , and drove her to his home in marthasville , a small town west of st louis with her phone gone , there was no way for the police to track the girl s movements or tie her to the man but weeks later , law enforcement officials said , her abductor got cocky and careless and , posing as the girl on a facebook account , he contacted her friends with help from facebook , investigators read the messages and tracked down mr schroeder , who has pleaded not guilty to charges in federal and state court investigators learned only later that the girl had met mr schroeder on kik asked about the odds of finding her if the man had not gone onto facebook , mr frattare , of the ohio crime task force , said , in my opinion , it would have been slim to none

works like equus and amadeus this fledgling effort from mr shaffer , who went on to win several and an oscar , was first seen in london in 1958 and went to broadway the following year the writing recalls chekhov and jean cocteau in its portrait of a rabidly dysfunctional family that has at its core a flamboyant mother and her emotionally needy son the director , jamie glover , generates a considerable dramatic charge from this slice of theatrical esoterica , as he did in a revival for the print room of harold pinter s the dumb waiter in 2013 on the one hand , there is the intricately clampeddown interplay among a household thrown into disarray by the arrival of the german tutor , walter \( lorne macfadyen \) , who excites the imaginations of a hypersexual matriarch , louise \( lucy cohu \) , and her clearly sexually confused son , clive \( tom morley \) but mr glover then lifts the lid on passions that simply wo n't be contained what is a family anyway \? snarls louise s husband , stanley \( jason merrells \) , a gruff furniture manufacturer who is struggling with the carnal hothouse unfolding around him , as well as with a disdainful wife who scorns his unpolished mien but is happy to spend his money just kids with your blood in them , is stanley s blunt reply to his own query the implication is that in every other way that matters , stanley and clive are opposing forces who happen to share a surname , and not only because clive is a student at cambridge and so inhabits what he calls a new country of education and learning unavailable to his philistine of a father \( clive , rather amusingly , speaks near the beginning of being an incipient drama critic with a particular preference for the greeks \) a 1962 film of five finger exercise changed the role of louise to an american so that she could be played by an improbably cast rosalind russell , and the great jessica tandy originated the part on broadway but it is difficult to imagine this bosomy schemer played with a more cunning mixture of vanity and fury than is exhibited by the riveting ms cohu a woman who smilingly admits to her unhappiness until her selfcomposure suddenly snaps that louise has a french mother and calls her son by the gallic endearment joujou , or toy , further suggests that the young mr shaffer may have had cocteau s tortured family sagas in mind mr morley and mr macfadyen give breakout performances in a cast that includes a sparky terenia edwards as the younger sister , pam , whom walter is there to tutor all sinewy anxiety as clive , mr morley ably communicates the psychological fissures of a manchild who speaks to his father across a willful divide , even as his advances toward walter turn ruinous for all concerned as the largely unwitting catalyst of intrigues and betrayals of which he then becomes the victim , mr macfadyen turns walter s germanic reserve into necessarily selfprotective armor possessed of family traumas of his own that he is keen to leave unspoken , walter ends up all but eaten alive by people who , clive says , constitute less a family than a tribe of wild animals and if that assessment itself brings to mind a play like the bacchae , well , clive like mr shaffer knows his greek tragedy well the print room has made a quiet name for itself trawling lessfrequently performed plays from the 20thcentury repertoire ts eliot s the cocktail party , in september , and jean genet s deathwatch , coming this spring two other london productions sit far less comfortably in their theatrical homes harley granville barker s waste might benefit from the print room s pressurecooker environment instead , the estimable director roger michell has revived this enduring play on the national theater s capacious lyttelton stage and in a production , running in repertory through march 19 , whose design does it no favors hildegard bechtler s minimal set is all sleek and sliding shapes and curves that do little to define a multilayered text in which both personal and political forces conjoin to catch a radical politician , henry trebell , in a vise whose gathering suffocation ought to be felt by the audience as well the periodfriendly charles edwards , late of the 39 steps and blithe spirit , is in principle ideally cast for a piece written in 1906 but then banned by the lord chamberlain and not given a full public performance until 1936 plays that made a plot point of abortion were not allowed at the time not much urgency or sense of discovery is transmitted here , the opening in particular all but evaporating as the first scene s largely female ensemble struggles to be heard across the vast reaches of the set i was bowled over by this play when it was last performed , at the far smaller almeida theater in north london , in 2008 this latest staging represents an opportunity gone to waste spectacle , not language , is the thing with cirque du soleil , the canadian purveyor of aerial acrobatics and corporate branding that has once again taken up residency , through march 6 , at the royal albert hall , which can hold upward of 5 , 000 people depending on the event cirque du soleil s current entertainment , amaluna , is of particular interest because of its tonywinning director , diane paulus , whose broadway credits include such highprofile revivals as hair , pippin , and the gershwins' porgy and bess but it s doubtful that even a living legend like peter brook could make something meaningful out of a proven formula that traffics in eyepopping derringdo and sanitized sexuality amaluna is ostensibly based on the tempest , though none too faithfully while we are indeed introduced to a lovesick young girl called miranda as per the literary source , her main squeeze here goes not by ferdinand but by romeo now that s a name that cirque du soleil s international audience has no doubt heard of , while the mindnumbing rest , as shakespeare might have said , is silence directed by jamie glover directed by roger michell directed by diane paulus
representative jerrold nadler of new york , a democrat whose district includes lower manhattan , has written a scathing open letter denouncing for receiving grant money intended for smallbusiness owners after the sept 11 attacks mr nadler s broadside against mr trump is the latest salvo in efforts by democrats to illustrate his use of various loopholes over the years to help his businesses mr trump , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , frequently to combat criticism from his primary rivals over his  mr nadler described those words by mr trump as exploitation of the city s darkest day when do you plan on returning the taxpayer money that was designated to ease the suffering of our city s smallbusiness owners \? mr nadler wrote in the letter , a copy of which his office provided to the new york times he was referring to that mr trump had 150 , 000 from the world trade center business recovery grant program for his property at 40 wall street it s been reported that on your grant application , you claimed 40 wall street llc which employed 28 people and had 268 million in annual revenues at the time as a small business , ' mr nadler wrote despite the federal definition of a small business as having less than 6 million in revenue , you accepted a 150 , 000 payout he added , in grabbing that money with both fists , you took it out of the pockets of smallbusiness owners in new york who were truly hurting , and prevented them from taking full advantage of the relief so generously offered by their fellow citizens mr nadler pointed out that mr trump had later been quoted in a television interview saying none of his properties were harmed in the attacks mr nadler also made a demand return the funds you received or donate them to a charitable organization dedicated to providing legitimate support for the victims of 9 11 mr trump recently made his first trip and first donation to the national september 11 memorial and museum , at the site of the devastation he has not taken a position on the proposed extension of a bill providing health benefits to recovery workers who became ill at the world trade center site during the months of cleanup in response to mr nadler , mr trump said , the company received this small amount of money after qualifying , given the limited number of employees working at the property , he said , adding , for many months , i allowed people to stay in the building , use the building and store things in the building i was happy to do it and to this day i am still being thanked for the many people i helped the value of what i did was far greater than the money talked about , he said
international falls , minn in this race , the weather forecast is watched more closely than the clock held here in january near the canadian border , a change in temperature can have a demoralizing effect on the competitors in the arrowhead ultra 135 adding too many layers can overheat these ultradistance athletes , producing sweat that can later turn cold on rest breaks along the 135mile course but shedding layers risks hypothermia two years ago , the temperature dropped to 40 below , and few racers finished the course this year was balmy , with daytime highs in the 20s i 've lived here for 30 years , and this has been the warmest winter i 've ever seen here , ken krueger , the race director , said it s ridiculously warm but even in perfect conditions , it s tough getting to the finish line is tough our historic finish rate is 52 percent cardiovascular endurance and mental discipline are important , but mastery of one s gear is an essential factor in the frozen northwoods many of the competitors are gear junkies and selfprofessed weight weenies who count every ounce as they try to stay light while maximizing the benefits of the gear they must haul to survive the grueling ordeal all racers are required to carry a minus20degree sleeping bag , a sleeping pad , a bivouac sack , a fire starter , a stove and pot , eight ounces of fuel , a twoquart insulated water container , a headlamp or flashlight , two flashing led lights , 10 square inches of reflective material on their front and back , a whistle and 3 , 000 calories of food racers can receive no outside help while on the course none of this is negotiable the gear is checked by volunteers before the race , and racers must carry it with them none of it can be ditched the gear is doublechecked at the end of the race athletes can do the race by foot , ski or bike , so their choice of mobility reflects how they must carry their equipment foot racers either pull a plastic sled or push a kicksled , a kind of modified dog sled bikers keep their gear in panniers skiers tend to use backpacks many apparel brands are represented at the race , but not all gear is hightech for an underlayer , tom lais , 61 , of minneapolis , buys wool sweaters at a goodwill store and shrinks them to size in his dryer wool is the only way to go , he said to keep sweat from soaking into the wool , he wraps a diaper mat around his belly once that is drenched , he tosses it into the trash at a checkpoint he calls it his secret weapon john bertram , 52 , of columbus , ohio , uses an old army surplus alice pack as a sixtime veteran foot racer , he was the first person to finish a race carrying only a backpack it was bad , he said what i found was that i almost needed to carry a little stool with me like a foldup thing , because i could n't sit down i was on my knees and trying to take the whole backpack off and taking the food out it was more of a pain than anything else he still uses the same pack , but now divides the gear between the pack and a sled i keep telling myself it has got to last me one more year , he said some of the rivets have popped out because i carry too much weight in it some of the gear is handmade helen and chris scotch , both 38 , of bend , ore , pull their sleds with bungee cords the forgiving stretch of the cords makes the movement of the sled less jarring they also have lightweight handmade ponchos , and to keep their water warm chris scotch used insulated foil bubble wrap to make covers for their water bottles he found it so handy he ordered an entire roll from an industrial distributor i think it works better than neoprene because there is more air to insulate it , he said chuck lindner , 44 , of warroad , minn , wears an anorak made by lure of the north , a company based in ontario the jacket s material is of egyptian sailcloth that is breathable and windproof the hood is trimmed with coyote fur when it s windy , the advantage of a fur ruff is it creates its own microclimate , so at 30 below you wo n't need a face mask , lindner said jared vanderhook , 32 , of minneapolis , had a gear bag made out of cuben fiber , a material used for yacht sails the friend who built the bag also created a website called fastertracks , which processes the gps signal from his spot tracker , which uses satellite technology and is mounted on his sled his girlfriend follows him on her computer other racers and their support teams were also using the software this year cellphones are allowed , but taking one might not be worth it because coverage is spotty tracking devices are permitted , but as krueger , the race director , pointed out , it does n't take away from the rugged independence of the race we discourage snowmobile rescues , krueger said we encourage selfrescue if you 're tired or cold or sore , we want people to get to a checkpoint we do n't want them dependent on snowmobiles to get out this is not a babysitting race this is one of the hardest races in the world , and you 're supposed to be selfsufficient cash is one lightweight item that racers should carry the first checkpoint is gateway general store , a gas station that sells groceries , gifts , hardware and fishing tackle racers take over the place like a locker room , and roaster ovens are loaded with soups , sloppy joes and macaroni and cheese it is here that dan vold was to meet his wife with his newborn daughter svetlana vold , 33 , of minneapolis , gave birth to yeva seven weeks before she trained for the arrowhead right up to the birth and was training again shortly after the plan was to attach a breast pump to her midsection with a velcro belt and drop off the breast milk to dan and yeva at the three checkpoints along the course in past winter racing experience , she found that batteries drained quickly in the cold temperatures so she designed a wrist pocket sleeve to hold spare ones if the breast pump or any other equipment failed , she could swap out the dead batteries for new ones to keep her spirits up , she has two fake flowers attached to her bike , a signature that has made her recognizable to other racers flowers are always on my bike because when everything is gray and there is no color , it makes you she said as she shrugged , then broke into laughter originally a crosscountry runner from belarus , she keeps up her strength by eating russian candy , cheese , bread and kielbasa consuming calories , especially hot food , is essential for the body to fight off the cold wendy drake planned to keep it casual yet efficient drake , 48 , of boulder , colo , had a jetboil flash stove the bottom part is composed of the gas can and burner that mounts to the cook pot the pot has a strap attached to the side so it can be held like an oversize coffee mug since she was on foot , her plan was to fire up the stove as she hiked along while sipping chicken noodle soup spiked with toasted sesame oil the chicken noodle soup is comfort food while the oil will really give me a lot of nutrition , she said i'm superstoked about that her friend rebecca hansen , 54 , of naples , fla , used to be a brand manager for snickers , so when her former coworkers heard she was doing the race they joked that she should take some of the candy bars along to fulfill the 3 , 000calorie requirement snickers has a marketing campaign in which the main logo on the packaging is replaced by an adjective related to moods , like sleepy , impatient or grouchy she carried three , labeled confused , feisty and princess of those , two had back stories in last year s race , she got lost and ended up circumnavigating a frozen lake she was disqualified for not staying on the course , hence the snickers bar labeled confused as for feisty , while she was training in florida with a sled and a weight vest , she came across a ninefoot alligator blocking the trail exhausted and in no mood to hike back 20 miles , she picked up her sled and carefully stepped over the gator he did n't flinch or move at all , hansen said at the prerace meeting at the backus community center here , krueger reminded the racers about one last item to have when they arrived at the finish line at the fortune bay resort last year was warm , and we had some nasty , nasty trench foot , he said so please take care of your feet , and i'm not sure i know how to tell you to do that , but i would start with dry socks it s not that i really care that much about your feet , but our hospitality room smelled awful last year
jefferson city , mo they discussed tyler perry movies , jews who eat pork , even which shoes they should have worn but while the talk got loopy on tuesday in the missouri state senate , the cause was serious on the second day of a against a bill giving new legal protection to opponents of  the bill is that have been introduced in state legislatures and in congress since the supreme court s ruling in june in favor of , and that supporters say aim to protect religious freedom and opponents say permit discrimination but experts say that in some ways , the missouri bill , similar to one being considered in georgia , would go further than any law now in place , prompting challenges that could keep the issue before the courts for years the staged by democrats in the republicancontrolled state senate stetched into its third day on wednesday exhausted lawmakers slipped out to nap or change clothes , some returning for hourly quorum calls , as their increasingly punchy colleagues took turns holding the floor in the mostly empty chamber , bouncing from unrelated topics to heartfelt debates on the bill my conscience comes from the bible , the inerrant word of the bible , said senator david sater , a republican it s a conscience protection bill but senator maria chappellenadal , a democrat , said this is a major scarring of equality in missouri we are living in an environment where hatred is alive , and we as a caucus are not going to tolerate it the bill would shield religious organizations and religious leaders from having anything to do with samesex wedding ceremonies or celebrations opponents contend that the bill is probably unconstitutional , and that the wording could lead to much broader consequences , like denying social services , education , employment or housing to married gay people douglas laycock , a law professor at the university of virginia and an expert on religious liberty , said it was conceivable but unlikely that the bill would have the more dire effects envisioned by opponents unlike most of the laws passed or proposed in other states , the missouri measure is not a statute , but an amendment to the state constitution that potentially gives it greater legal weight , and bypasses the possibility of a veto by gov jay nixon , a democrat if it passes both houses of the legislature , it will go before missouri voters this year donald hinkle , the director of public policy for the missouri baptist convention , which supports the measure , said he was confident of passage you 're talking about a state that voted 71 percent to 29 percent to say that marriage is between one man and one woman and put that in the constitution , he said , referring to a 2004 ballot measure banning samesex marriage eunice rho , the advocacy and policy counsel at the american civil liberties union , said the bill might be unconstitutional on two grounds it allows differential treatment of samesex couples , which runs counter to the supreme court s decision in the samesex marriage case , and it prefers one set of religious beliefs over others twentyone states including indiana and arkansas last year have enacted what backers call religious freedom laws , which do not mention samesex couples but subject discrimination lawsuits to tough scrutiny if the discrimination is based on a defendant s sincere religious belief the missouri bill is one of a new batch of measures that explicitly address samesex marriage and attempt to preempt such lawsuits entirely none of those has become law so far much of the bill addresses wedding ceremonies and celebrations narrowly , saying clergy members and religious groups would not have to participate or make facilities available legal experts say that is probably already true under federal law , though the courts have not addressed it the bill would also give businesspeople like caterers and florists the right to refuse to sell products or services for samesex weddings have who refused but the bill would also protect any religious organization acting in accordance with a sincere religious belief about samesex marriage , in a passage that does not limit itself to weddings and it gives a long list of things that qualify as religious organizations , including schools , charities and retirement homes , as long as their public identity and purpose are in whole or in part religious ms rho said that could mean denying married gay people housing , employment , social services and schooling as in indiana , georgia and other states , some big companies and business organizations have opposed the bill , and opponents have predicted an economic backlash , including boycotts
mitt romney on friday put to rest speculation that he would be open to rescuing the republican party by wresting the presidential nomination away from donald j trump at the convention this summer at his speech in utah on thursday , mr romney tore down mr trump but did not endorse another candidate some took that to mean he was hoping that none of the contenders would gather the delegates needed to be the nominee , leaving open the possibility that he could run for president but mr romney said on friday that he had no plans ride in on a white horse to be the party s savior the people who can save this party are ted cruz , marco rubio or john kasich , mr romney said in an interview in new york with nbc s today show  the former massachusetts governor and 2012 republican presidential nominee said that he anticipated that one of those three would emerge as an alternative to mr trump in the next couple of weeks and that he would support that person mr romney s remarks about mr trump came up during the republican debate in detroit on thursday night , as mr trump was repeatedly asked to address mr romney s criticism he responded forcefully , calling mr romney a failed candidate who wants to be back in the game but mr romney , who was defeated by president obama in 2012 , insisted the game of presidential politics was over for him there are no circumstances i can foresee where that would possibly happen , mr romney said of a lastminute run this year no reasonable scenario i can imagine asked if he was being careful to leave the door cracked , mr romney closed it i m not running for president , he said i won t run for president in an interview later friday with the fox business network , mr romney said that he would not be opposed to a brokered convention but that if it came down to a general election matchup of mr trump against hillary clinton , he would write in the name of a true conservative mr romney also shed more light on why he decided not make a third run for president he said it had more to do with mrs clinton than concerns about mr trump or jeb bush i looked at the race and i said , look , hillary clinton is going to be hard to beat , mr romney said another bad prediction on my part , because she s turned out a lot weaker than i thought
london when i was still an architecture student at yale , i got stuck in new york city traffic with one of my professors , zaha hadid , and her chauffeur i asked her whether she had any advice for me , a young female architecture student graduating into a depressed market dominated by men she simply said , come work for me i told her , ok , but only if i get to design shoes she replied , if you work for me , you can design anything ms hadid of a heart attack while in the hospital with bronchitis i lost a mentor and professional hero , and the world lost one of its leading form makers much of the ensuing praise , though , has so far focused on her gender which is unfortunate , because it obscures what was truly significant about her career as an architect do n't get me wrong her gender was important to me as a woman in an industry with very few people to look up to , and she inspired other young women to follow her lead but zaha would be disappointed in the american institute of architects , which reported her death by calling her a she would have said that her gender was merely incidental , as was her ethnicity a stumbling block at times , but nothing to get excited about the focus on her gender obscures her real achievements the way she drew on russian constructivist design to create an entirely new language of drawing , painting , building and fashion long after the novelty of her gender fades from the public s mind , she will be remembered for the swooping , sumptuous monumentality of her , like the maxxi art museum in rome or her opera house in guangzhou , china zaha did not want to be defined by her gender , and she did n't define anyone else that way , either in her studio , she offered my female colleagues and me a chance to prove ourselves equal to our male counterparts she quietly created an environment where i could look around and see women in positions of power to men , not in spite of them she showed us how gender could fade into the background if it was systematically taken out of the equation in favor of an appreciation of sheer talent there are no token women at zaha hadid architects which is not to say that she was n't nurturing with no husband and no children , she had a private life that may have seemed empty of many of the joys that normal people consider default but ms hadid had many close friends , and fostered a warm , closeknit relationship with her employees she called us , her group of designers , her kids and treated us as such in a lot of ways of course , many people seemed to insist on applying gender stereotypes to her , anyway many great architects , like any great artists , are often difficult to relate to , and ms hadid , so intensely focused on her unique vision , was no exception for male architects , such traits are often taken positively , as proof of genius but the news media insisted on portraying ms hadid as harsh , exacting , difficult diva was the usual term of reference none of this seemed to bother her she just kept on working , showing what you could achieve if you did n't let prejudice get in your way the night before ms hadid died , she was commenting on designs from her hospital bed arriving at the office on friday , the day after her death , was like returning to a campaign office the day after the candidate has suddenly withdrawn from a race all the excitement of the day before , the joy you feel when you 're united behind a single leader with a single purpose , was replaced by shocked silence what happens next \? her work will continue for years , in the form of buildings that are under construction or just starting construction , products that are designed and ready to begin and plans that have been mapped out but not executed but her presence , that woman who turned to me in the middle of manhattan rush hour and told me i could make it \? it s an irreplaceable loss , not just for those of us in her studio , but for an entire generation of architects men and women alike
new delhi may is a month of haunting heat in this city the temperature hovers over 100 degrees there are dust storms and , despite the white skies , the trees are heavy with flower the apocalyptic climate serves as a fitting backdrop to political upheaval two summers ago i witnessed one after a long campaign , and his bharatiya janata party , or bjp , won the first outright majority in s parliament since 1984 it had come at the end of 10 years of congress party rule , the last five of which were marred by corruption and an economy that left many people frustrated i have followed campaigns since i was a child my mother is a journalist and mr modi s election was one of the most hopeful of my lifetime what mr modi understood was that india s conception of itself had changed it was not yet a middleclass country , but it had begun to think of itself as one when i first heard mr modi speak in september 2013 , what surprised me most was the change in the average voter a new kind of person had emerged , young and energetic , representing the happy conjunction of denim , phone and television for many people i spoke to these were their prized possessions \( they did n't have cars or houses \) their restlessness revealed a hunger and they had none of the fatalism of old india they are poor but their selfimage is not of being poor , yogendra singh , a sociologist , said of the bjp s supporters in mr modi spoke directly to their ambition they did n't want the populism of the congress party they did n't want handouts they wanted jobs mr modi was the first indian politician to speak seriously of prosperity in a country with a socialist past whose first prime minister is said to have described profit as a dirty word , mr modi made making money sexy he has a way of explaining complex economic ideas in direct terms i do n't want my cotton grower to wander from place to place , trying to sell his cotton , he said in an address to the sri ram college of commerce in 2013 i have a five f' formula farm to fiber , fiber to fabric , fabric to fashion , fashion to foreign it was revolutionary no candidate for prime minister since economic liberalization began in 1991 had bothered to explain the global economy to the average indian voter , to connect the dots in its supply chain , to speak of its possibilities the congress party , famous for its reforms by stealth , had made liberalization seem like something done at the expense of the poor mr modi sold it as essential to the fight against poverty the response was electrifying two years later , india is still waiting to turn a corner at times it can feel close , but the socialist mindset still has an outsized influence what worries me is not the state of the economy , or the slow pace of reform it s not the government s failure to privatize large public companies like air india , even though mr modi has said that government has no business to be in business it s not that the retroactive tax , which allows the government to collect back capital gains taxes and has been used to hound foreign companies , remains in place , belying the bjp s promise of welcoming foreign investment it s not that major pieces of legislation reforming the economy now seem permanently stuck it s not that job growth is slower than it should be my deeper fear is that mr modi lacks a freemarketer s natural suspicion of the state he seems wedded to the thirdway politics he developed in gujarat state , where he was chief minister from 2001 to 2014 , in which the machinery and assets of an overburdened socialist state are left intact , but the bureaucracy is cleansed of inefficiency and corruption not surprisingly , all that has been achieved in his first two years in office is clean government at the top , while the rest remains more or less unchanged this has disappointed many on the economic right who supported mr modi in 2014 , hoping he would be india s reagan or thatcher sadanand dhume , a freemarket advocate , that the prime minister was a cautious tinkerer rather than a committed reformer a young businesswoman who supports the prime minister put it well he goes to the west and sees prosperity in terms of jobs and physical infrastructure , which he is trying to emulate , she wrote to me in an email but he fails to see the invisible underpinnings of western civilization , which are political and economic liberty mr modi s election unleashed passions that only a roaring economy can contain as i traveled through india recently , from varanasi to mumbai to delhi , i was moved by how much people still trust the prime minister when i asked them what happened to the good days he had promised , they invariably replied , it will take time but i sense an anticipation that could turn sour it is election season once again the scorching capital city is full of news of in places where the party rarely wins , including socialist bastions like kerala and bengal it seems like a clear message to the man who promised an alternative to india s toxic socialism that he should stay the course for decades , the old socialist state preyed on the people it was meant to serve the rage that developed against it propelled mr modi forward it was not a mandate for gentle reform , but for profound change from the ground up

is it unfair to some students that the sat , being rolled out next month , will include longer and harder reading passages and wordier math problems than before \? anemona hartocollis s on the topic drew more than 900 responses from readers some stressed that college admissions tests , by their very nature , should winnow out weaker readers why would you want to accept students who ca n't read and write at a college level regardless of their background \? instead of complaining about the idea that it is unfair to certain students , why not make sure those students are better prepared \? if the poor ca n't read as well as the rich , then that s the problem that needs to be addressed his comment was the most recommended by other readers some readers zeroed in on a sentence in the article that noted educators fear that the revised test will penalize students who have not been exposed to a lot of reading , or who speak a different language at home like immigrants and the poor , i'm a reading specialist i went nuts let s not penalize people who have n't been exposed to a lot of driving by flunking them on the driving test let s not penalize the pilot of our jet liner by keeping him out of the cockpit just because he has n't been exposed to a lot of flying the correct way of thinking about all of the above is not to think of it as penalizing but , instead , a need to get that person the experience there are lots of ways to get children exposed' to reading you could call it penalizing students who have not been exposed to a lot of reading' or you could call it evaluating students' reading skills' with a personal story her son is dyslexic , and he found the sat tough the comments here make my blood boil , she wrote who wants a kid in college who ca n't read proficiently \?

international sports officials have occasionally run afoul of their own rules and even the law over the years , from the olympic officials caught accepting bribes to award the 2002 winter games to salt lake city , to the soccer officials who were more recently accused of accepting bribes related to tv contracts and world cup bids but perhaps a new low for sports officials has been reached in track and field officials are accused of blackmailing some athletes who failed drug tests and choosing not to discipline runners who were suspected of doping the accusations were laid out in an released on thursday by the world antidoping agency unlike most sports scandals in the past that involved top officials , this one touches the field of play the leaders of track and field s global governing body , the international association of athletics federations , allowed athletes who had used banned substances to continue competing in major events , according to the report it s not just a bunch of people sitting at a table passing money to each other , said richard w pound , a lead author of the report this actually affects the outcome of competition the report provided few specific details of individual athletes and competitions they participated in after doping suspicions arose liliya shobukhova , a russian distance runner who won three chicago marathon titles , was cited by name she was among those extorted , according to the report after her name appeared on a list of 23 russian athletes with suspicious test results in 2011 , officials told her to make three payments of nearly 200 , 000 each in order to compete in the 2012 summer olympics in london such shakedowns , the report said , were not limited to ms shobukhova , nor to russian athletes asli cakir alptekin , a middledistance runner from turkey , also paid bribes to officials in late 2012 , hoping to keep the gold medal she won at the london olympics track s top officials fostered a culture of corruption and recruited family members to join their schemes , the commission said among those implicated in the report are the iaaf s longtime president , lamine diack of senegal , and its former treasurer , valentin balakhnichev of russia highranking advisers , including a doctor once in charge of policing doping violations , were also cited mr diack , who was arrested in france late last year in connection with the commission s inquiry , in one instance advised a lawyer that he needed to consult the russian president , vladimir v putin , who had become a friend , before processing the doping violations of nine russian athletes mr diack is suspected by french prosecutors of having accepted more than 1 million in bribes to cover up positive drug tests mr diack presided over the iaaf for 16 years , hiring his two sons as consultants and drawing them into his schemes , the inquiry found mr balakhnichev , too , installed his son as an iaaf employee in moscow suspicions of bribery related to television broadcast rights and international olympic committee votes also surfaced in the group s investigation according to the report , mr diack supported japan s bid for the 2020 summer olympics because it paid 4 million to 5 million in sponsorship money to the iaaf tokyo was ultimately selected to host the 2020 games describing the corruption as embedded in the organization , the report said it cannot be ignored or dismissed as attributable to the odd renegade acting on his own , adding , it is increasingly clear that far more iaaf staff knew about the problems than has currently been acknowledged the first part of the group s inquiry concluded in november , with a report that accused russia of a those findings prompted track and field s governing body to russia from global competition , jeopardizing its participation in this summer s olympics in rio de janeiro the , shifted attention from russia to the ruling body that investigators said had enabled it the olympic body said thursday that it planned to study the report and act as necessary last november , after the release of the commission s first report foreshadowing what could come , the ioc suspended mr diack in a statement thursday , the iaaf said that it accepted the extreme gravity of the report s findings , noting that weak governance had allowed individuals at the head of a previous regime to act poorly the report raised questions about both past leaders of track and field and the sport s celebrated current leader , sebastian coe , a twotime olympic gold medalist who was in charge of the 2012 summer olympics in london although thursday s report said members of the iaaf s council could not have been unaware of the alleged schemes as they occurred , mr pound emphasized at a news conference in munich that he believed the organization s current leader , mr coe , had not been a part of any wrongdoing and had not known about it mr coe , who was vice president to mr diack for seven years , called the corruption totally abhorrent , adding , we cannot change the past , but i am determined that we will learn from it and will not repeat its mistakes authorities have reacted to the commission s yearlong inquiry in addition to mr diack s arrest , habib cisse , mr diack s legal adviser , and gabriel doll , a former director of the iaaf s antidoping division , are under criminal investigation in france none are currently working for the iaaf french authorities are continuing their investigation into the matter , they said thursday interpol , the international police organization , is also leading a continuing global inquiry the organization has put out a wanted notice for one of mr diack s sons , papa massata diack , who worked as a marketing consultant last week , the iaaf announced it had barred him from any future work in track and field mr coe has recognized in recent weeks that the sport and his organization are in crisis last week , perhaps acting preemptively , he announced that he had hired a team of outside lawyers and accountants to conduct an internal investigation at the iaaf he said he planned to institute stricter organizational controls and double the antidoping budget by midyear the threeperson commission that wrote thursday s report was created in december 2014 it consisted of mr pound , founding president of the world antidoping agency richard h mclaren , a canadian lawyer and g nter younger , the head of cybercrime for the police in the german state bavaria the commission s investigation was inspired by reports from the german public broadcaster ard , which released a documentary in december 2014 focused on doping in russian athletics on thursday , the commission focused on what it called a corrupt administration you 've got to have 21stcentury governance , mr pound said , even if it s an organization that s 19th century in origin

in an exhibition at the brooklyn museum , life and photography and art cause sparks to fly its more than 600 images have been taken by 12 wellknown photographers , and document life on one of the most contested stretches of land in the world israel and the west bank , where jews and muslims , israelis and palestinians , bedouins and africans , among others , often live tensely side by side , and the threat of violence is never far away though none of the images could be considered news photographs , they are rarely less than striking and they vigorously play off one another when so much artworld photography is staged , heavily conceptual or even abstract , this place is refreshing for emphasizing the genre of concerned or engaged photography although engagement may be unavoidable in this exhibition , where history is so heavy and life so fraught yet the show is also very much a meditation on the expansiveness of photography itself few things illuminate differences in sensibility and style like a dozen photographers finding their way through the same subject this place was conceived by the french photographer fr d ric brenner , who has long documented the jewish diaspora and who has been taking pictures in israel since 1978 , when he was 19 he assembled a team of organizers and raised support from several private sources , determined to avoid government involvement he ultimately chose photographers who were neither israeli nor palestinian , but outsiders in the end , he also decided to include his own work in his interview in the catalog , mr brenner tells charlotte cotton , the show s curator , as my idea began to crystallize , it made sense to invite others' to question otherness' the 11 photographers invited to participate are american , canadian , european and korean some work digitally , others develop prints they include the photojournalist gilles peress and the sensitive portraitist of people under stress , rosalind fox solomon but mr brenner has also mixed in artworld photographers like thomas struth , steven shore and jeff wall mr wall is known for large , elaborately staged photographs that usually have an acute social subtext perhaps not surprisingly , with a little looking , he discovered a readymade jeff wall scene , full of social fissures , in the negev daybreak , the first photograph in the exhibition , depicts a group of bedouin workers wrapped in bright blankets sleeping at the edge of an olive grove during harvest time , while an enormous industriallooking complex a prison , it turns out looms on the horizon the accompanying text panel begins with a disclaimer from mr wall s catalog interview i witnessed it and did n't invent anything inside the show , you 're tugged this way and that by differences in style and subject there are large and small photos in color and black and white some dot the walls irregularly , others hang in tight grids they offer sandy landscapes , cityscapes and people , either pausing for the camera or on the move as if blessing the show , mr brenner s relatively modest work comes early a sparse arrangement of clear , concentrated portraits of israeli families that are among his first forays into color , and a large , lonely image of the partlybuilt palace hotel \( now the waldorf astoria \) in jerusalem , a hollow shell that evokes the roman colosseum , but with soundstage fragility mr peress , known for documenting regions of conflict in northern ireland , bosnia and rwanda , makes images mainly of young palestinian men going through checkpoints , hanging out or flitting with danger we see two slim adolescents , their heads wrapped in scarves , make obscene gestures to israeli soldiers just off camera with their subjects often caught in motion , these images make the tightrope of life in the west bank especially palpable ms solomon s magnetic portraits cut across all ethnic and racial lines and are arguably the most deeply human images in the show and perhaps the most traditional , reaching back to the work of diane arbus , paul strand and eug ne atget each one is printed by the artist in rich blackandwhite tones a moment of stillness snatched from the chaos of life nick waplington s color photographs , in contrast , focus on jewish settlers in the west bank , some in comfortable homes , others barely camping out mr waplington also displays images of new settlements , along with some sizable found objects colorfully painted water tanks in his catalog interview he talks of learning to read the region s visual codes the water tanks are found on top of the homes of palestinians , who are not allowed access to the main israeli water supply displayed on two freestanding walls that cut through the show s main gallery , big , handsome color images by thomas struth and stephen shore are both aloof and opulent most of mr struth s photos single out specific buildings and interiors including tel aviv s city hall , where yitzhak rabin was assassinated by a rightwing jewish extremist and give them a slightly sinister glamour mr shore s sweeping scenes alternate the new and ancient , all under the same unremitting sun cheekbyjowl apartment buildings in the divided city of hebron and historical , if not biblical sites mount sodom , the michmash valley and the st sabas monastery in the judean desert two photographers take up landscape in sharply different ways the large , dark melancholic landscapes from jungjin lee s unnamed road series might almost be romantic charcoal drawings shot in black and white and blurred by being printed on mulberry paper and then digitally enlarged , the images are n't as haunting as they should be the exception is a startling picture of intersecting gravel roads that looks like a body being flung the american photographer fazal sheikh may be best known for images of displaced people , but for this place he took to the air to conjure displacement from afar dominated by golden sand , his aerial views of the negev are beautiful , even abstract , until you realize that they are scarred by shell craters , signs of military maneuvers , the ruins of ancient villages and recent evictions looking at them is like reading palms the three most impressive photographers approach the region s tensions in markedly different ways martin kollar , a slovakian , makes color pictures that hop from subject to subject but are on edge or surreal they show dead or wounded animals , people undergoing medical procedures , a crudely camouflaged jeep and a series of cubelike buildings that seem altogether too white and crisply geometric to be real mr kollar does not label his images they engross and unsettle on their own the czechoslovakianborn french photographer josef koudelka makes things grimly clear in a slide projection , a foldout book and one panoramic photo mr koudelka first became known for upclose images of confrontations taken during russia s 1968 invasion of prague , but he is equally adept at gentler , more poetic images in this place , his images are starkly empty of human life instead , they focus on the separation barrier , or wall , that twists and turns through jerusalem and beyond , separating israel from the west bank the barrier surges over hills like a neverending freight train , cuts through buildings and parallels roads , changing from concrete to cinder block to metal as it goes it is a relentless presence , almost a beast but beyond the picture frames , life goes on , especially in the nearly 400 postcardsize photographs contributed by wendy ewald that , with ms solomon s work , give the show a kind of grand finale ms ewald again turns photography into a collective , participatory activity by having people photograph their own lives for this place , ms ewald distributed cameras and taught basic skills to people , young and old , in 14 locations in israel and the west bank grade schools , military academies and villages , whether israeli , palestinian or bedouin she edited the images , arranging 30 from each group on a set of shallow shelves hung on the wall infused with the casual precision of intimacy , these images could be excerpts from exceptional scrapbooks or instagram feeds weddings and other rituals take place , old friends meet up , meals are shared , newborns are shown off , teenagers turn the cameras on their friends and themselves whatever the time or place , the heart of the matter is regularly reached here and throughout this moving and insightful show
eight justices heard oral arguments in of the supreme court s term on wednesday when will the court return to full strength \? that question is as urgent today as it was immediately after the death two and a half months ago of justice antonin scalia but the initial wave of outrage at the senate republicans' hardline refusal to consider replacing justice scalia has ebbed , making it that much easier for republicans to keep the seat empty through the presidential election if they succeed , the court will go nearly two terms , and possibly longer , without a ninth member the consequences of the impasse have been growing graver by the day already the justices have split 4 to 4 in two cases , leaving important legal issues unresolved in one , the court failed to decide a involving the longstanding right of publicsector unions , which represent millions of american workers , to charge collective bargaining fees to nonmembers by the term s end in late june , it s likely that several more cases will have ended in tie votes , including possibly the fights over in texas , and president obama s  it could get worse from here so far , the justices' docket for the term beginning in october is , and the eightmember court may hesitate before taking on highprofile cases on controversial topics that are more likely to result in split votes already , major cases involving restrictive voting laws in and , who want the right to refuse to fill contraceptive prescriptions for religious reasons , and to reduce pollution from coalfired power plants are before the court or could be soon all could languish in legal limbo republicans have n't been satisfied simply to hobble the court s ability to function in recent weeks , they have gone to remarkable lengths to impugn the integrity of the justices and thus the legitimacy of the court charles grassley , chairman of the senate judiciary committee , has attacked chief justice john roberts jr , who delighted conservatives at his own confirmation hearings by calling balls and strikes but last month , mr grassley , who should be spending his time scheduling confirmation hearings , instead at the chief justice , claiming that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations , not legal ones presumably referring to chief justice roberts s two votes upholding aspects of the affordable care act gov greg abbott of texas , who is challenging mr obama s immigration actions , also complained about the court , that because it has shed its clothing as being guardians of the law , it deserves to be swept up into the political process none of this has anything to do with the qualifications of mr obama s nominee , , the chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , whom conservatives as someone they would happily confirm the battle is purely about ideological control of the court , which has had a conservative majority for decades how does the insanity end \? if the senate majority leader , mitch mcconnell , and mr grassley hold to their promise not to give judge garland a hearing or a vote , it will probably take a president and senate of the same party to nominate and confirm a new justice after inauguration day in january but if the president and the senate are of different parties , there is every reason to believe that the current blockade will continue indefinitely if donald trump wins the white house , even mr grassley that his supreme court nominee would be a gamble mr grassley and his fellow republicans gambled that anger over their inaction would fade as the news cycle rolled on and the public s attention turned to the presidential campaign maybe republicans are willing to take such gambles because they believe they do n't have anything to lose but the american people do
richard serra may have his ideological detractors , but he is certainly today s greatest living sculptor of minimalist abstraction exhibitions of new works occupying gagosian gallery s two chelsea display spaces find mr serra at 76 still wrangling fundamentals of shape , space , gravity and time into objects and installations of thrilling severity at west 21st street is a single , grand example of his mazes made from immense ribbons of rolled steel west 24th street hosts three works made of solid steel slabs as well as a drawing installation in certain respects these divergent strands in mr serra s oeuvre are opposites while the maze subordinates material to gravitydefying form , the slab works favor weighty raw material what the two have essentially in common is their consciousnessexpanding effects standing in the middle of the huge west 21st street space , nj1 resembles a big tent whose nearly 14foothigh sides seem to be made of burntorange velvet up close you discover a beautiful , granular surface of rusted steel circling clockwise on the outside you find no entrance until you 've gone threequarters of the way , at which point the twoinchthick wall swerves into a narrow corridor walking in , you approach a concave interior wall and openings to right and left either way , you proceed between walls tilting this way and that and admitting different amounts of light from above \( claustrophobes beware \) a series of switchbacks eventually empties you into the first corridor and out this is sculpture not just as an interesting object to look at but as an engulfing experience moving through the construction , you become acutely attuned to sight , touch and sound and to your own being in time and space consciousness itself becomes an object of consciousness perhaps there s a quasireligious dimension , too , if you think of the maze as an ancient participatory ritual object in which the uncertain journey of life is ceremonially enacted and the possibility of spiritual progress is metaphorically expressed the most arresting piece at west 24th street is silence \( for john cage \) , an 80ton slab of forged steel lying flat on the floor kneehigh and 29 feet by 9 feet 2 inches , it astounds by virtue of its sheer mass , its rugged physicality intensified by contrast with the pristine white walls of the gallery it s worth noting mr serra s titular dedication to cage , the avantgarde musician whose most famous composition , for piano , 4'33 , consists of 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence mr cage s piece is presumed to heighten audience attention to and appreciation of ambient sound and to invite meditation on just what exactly music is mr serra s piece is similarly effective you become enthralled by the brute presence of this enormous hunk of steel and your involvement with it what did it take to transport such an unwieldy , dangerously heavy object to the gallery , to unload it and to place it so precisely in the gallery \? what does such an operation cost \? if you saw this piece in a steel foundry you might find it magnetic and even beautiful but you would n't necessarily know it to be a work of art as it bears none of the conventional signs of aesthetic design , technique or symbolism what does it add , then , to see it as an artwork \? it shifts attention from the object itself to the sensory , intuitive and cognitive experience of it it s a beherenow situation you might wonder what it means , for surely if it is art then it means something but it answers only with a provocative silence , as per its title , as if to say that ultimate answers to questions of meaning and being are beyond human comprehension mr serra s two other sculptures in this gallery have a similarly industrial and primordial feeling through consists of three slabs , each the same size as silence , standing on their long sides in parallel the whole is precisely oriented diagonally in the gallery so that peering through the narrow space between two slabs affords a view of one of the room s distant corners metaphorically speaking , you see through the physically opaque to the metaphysically transcendent every which way has 16 slabs set up in a rectangular grid each slab is nearly a foot thick and they are in three heights 7 , 9 and 11 feet walking among them is like strolling through a graveyard of massive tombstones rows alternating paired slabs and single ones create a stately , rhythmic impression , like a marching band playing funereal oompah music a fourth , nonmetal piece , above below betwixt between , is an installation of flat , black rectangles made by applying paint to belgian linen in a white , cubeshaped room about 18 feet on a side , the black swatches fill the upper halves of two opposite walls and the lower halves of the others , creating an enveloping syncopation of impenetrable darkness and blinding light like the rothko chapel , this is a space for meditating on terrestrial perception and cosmic ineffabilities
as the military and political battle against the islamic state escalates , muslim imams and scholars in the west are fighting on another front through theology , a muslim leader in washington , has held live monthly video chats to refute the religious claims of the islamic state , also known as or isil in a dig at the extremists , he broadcast from ice cream parlors and called his talks isis and ice cream , an american muslim scholar based in berkeley , calif , has pleaded with muslims not to be deceived by the stupid young boys of the islamic state millions have watched excerpts from his sermon titled , in which he wept as he asked god not to blame other muslims for what these fools amongst us do it is a religious rumble that barely makes headlines in the secular west since it is carried out at mosques and islamic conferences and over social media the islamic state , however , has taken notice the group recently threatened the lives of 11 muslim imams and scholars in the west , calling them apostates who should be killed the recent issue of the islamic state s online propaganda magazine , dabiq , called them obligatory targets , and it said that supporters should use any weapons on hand to make an example of them the danger is real enough that the fbi has contacted some of those named in the islamic state s magazine to assist them in taking proper steps to ensure their safety , said andrew ames , a spokesman for the fbi s field office in washington the death threats are a sign that muslim religious leaders have antagonized the islamic state , according to analysts who are studying the militant group their growing influence also contradicts those who claim that muslim leaders have been silent in the fight against violent extremism this is what hurts isis the most it is muslims speaking out , said , a canadian who once joined an extremist islamist group and now advises governments on countering radicalization fearmongering is what isis is trying to do , whether to silence these people or to silence others as a deterrent several of the targeted muslim leaders said in interviews that , while they were taking the threat seriously , they had no intention of backing off they have hired security guards and fortified their workplaces , and some keep guns at home it s an honor to be denounced by isis , said imam webb , who frequently engages young muslims over social media , whether on youtube , facebook , periscope or snapchat i consider it one of my greatest accomplishments in life it has only reinvigorated me , he said , to provide the antivenom to the poison of isis these muslim leaders say they are responding to fellow believers who are looking for a religiously based rebuke to violent movements that claim to be acting in the name of islam they say that extremist groups like the islamic state are a threat not just to civil society and security , but to the future of their faith , who is based in tennessee and runs a popular islamic educational institute , thundered against the islamic state in a friday sermon at one of europe s largest mosques in march , only three days after the group s suicide bombers had attacked the brussels airport and train station none of our senior scholars of any school any school has justified these deeds , sheikh qadhi said at the east london mosque he argued that the terrorist attacks of recent years had clearly violated islamic teaching because they cause more harm than good , bringing more bombs , more drones and more chaos to muslim communities , he said who has benefited \? please use the intelligence that allah gave you , he said these radical groups have harmed the image of islam infinitely more than all of the foreign policy of western lands combined these scholars ridicule the islamic state s claim to have created a caliphate ruled by a successor to the islamic prophet , muhammad instead , in a highly effective bit of rebranding , they call the islamic state kharijites , a reviled group of muslims who killed women and children and rebelled against the caliphs in the seventh century the imams named by the islamic state are based in the united states , canada , britain and australia they represent a broad spectrum of islamic thought from spiritual sufis to puritanical salafis , and even the more militant salafi jihadis to the islamic state s propagandists , it does not matter that the imams are fervent muslims or critics of american foreign policy they are all unbelievers , just like the shiite muslims , christians and yazidis that the islamic state has killed by the thousands in iraq , libya , syria and elsewhere this is not the first time that the islamic state has targeted muslim leaders in the united states , but this is the longest list yet it includes sheikh hisham kabbani , a lebanese sufi now based mostly in michigan who has been warning for years about rising extremism the list also includes salafioriented preachers such as bilal philips , a canadian convert who has been barred from several countries because of allegations that he preaches extremism tawfique chowdhury , an australian doctor who founded organizations and charities that propagate orthodox views of islam and abu basir altartusi , a syrian preacher based in london who has spoken in support of al qaeda , according to news reports cole bunzel , a scholar at princeton university studying islamic history and jihadist ideology , said , what isis is saying is that even if you support al qaeda , even if you 're a supporter of someone like tartusi , you 're still not on team islam the islamic state s magazine also targeted american muslims in government , such as of minnesota , a longtime top aide to hillary clinton and , a texas republican and former adviser to the department of homeland security several terrorism experts said that an attack on any of these people was more likely to happen abroad than in the united states , but that all it would take is one deluded or mentally unbalanced lone wolf in march , a popular saudi preacher , by a gunman in the philippines , soon after the islamic state s online magazine had put him on a list of apostate saudi scholars sheikh qarni , who and has , had just given a lecture at western mindanao state university , and his assailant was an engineering student the effort to undermine the islamic state using religion is not just a western phenomenon in january , muslim leaders from around the world gathered in morocco and produced the , which denounces muslim oppression of religious minorities the organization of islamic cooperation , which represents 57 muslim countries , recently  sheikh hamza will soon air a television series in the middle east , rihla with sheikh hamza yusuf \( rihla is quest in arabic \) the show applies traditional islamic scholarship to contemporary challenges in the muslim world , and it includes strong messages against extremism which sheikh hamza said amounts to swatting the hornet s nest again it is likely to be seen in iraq and syria , the islamic state s strongholds , he said sheikh qadhi , however , said that , based on several frightening experiences recently in tennessee , he has more to fear from rightwing muslimhaters than from adherents of the islamic state i'm not scared of isis in america , he said i feel very safe in every mosque i go to but i am scared of other people in this land who are very ignorant and bigoted he said he had gotten used to being vilified by both sides the right wing is calling me a stealth jihadist and isis is calling me a sellout we challenge both of their narratives , even as their narratives feed into each other
the furious fighting in the ranks of republican opponents of donald trump combat that is growing ever more heated and rhetorically violent has forced open to public view longfestering wounds in the conservative coalition take , for example , the ongoing exchange between , the publisher of the conservative weekly standard , and , the director of government affairs for the lobbying firm quinn gillespie and associates it began when feehery , speaking about trump , on march 16 , if it were n't for all the idiotic and racist comments , he would be kind of a breath of fresh air feehery continued in the current issue of the weekly standard , kristol , shot back in an essay called  the republican establishment , including its cadre of lobbyists , kristol continued , has these trump accommodationists have brought to light the rot of an ideological movement that many of us had thought was alive and reasonably well feehery is not one to turn the other cheek in a march 18 blog post , feehery asked incredulously , \? to clear the air , feehery noted that he has not endorsed anyone but i really , really like john kasich feehery said that his own basic policy in elections is to support whomever the republican party nominates he then counterattacked our party is in the shape it is today because of people like bill kristol kristol , in feehery s view , helped lay the groundwork for the iraq invasion , a huge mistake but most of all , kristol palin , in turn , feehery argues , was the real start of the dumbing down of the gop , a cascading process that led to trump you do n't get to donald trump without sarah palin everywhere you look , the over trump dominates strategic discussions newt gingrich , the former speaker of the house who led the republican takeover in 1994 , as the latest incarnation of the reagan revolution not so , counters representative scott rigell , republican of virginia in to his constituents just before the virginia primary on march 1 , rigell wrote nowhere on the right is the conflict as hostile as it is among conservative christians steve berman , a selfdescribed  argues that in effect trump is the current antichrist if america is not on god s side , then god will not bless america , berman wrote in direct contrast , jerry falwell jr , president of liberty university and a son of the founder of the moral majority , backed trump on jan 26 ,  , the president of the southern baptist convention s ethics and public policy commission , is appalled by falwell s statement , and also by protrump declarations from such oriented evangelical leaders as , pastor of lakewood church in houston , the biggest church in the united states , and , pastor of the dallas megachurch first baptist in a phone interview , moore described trump as the embodiment of cultural decadence the personification of the moral decline he says christian leaders have struggled to halt for the past generation some high profile evangelicals are completely repudiating the conviction that character matters , moore said he described trump as a wherever he goes in religious circles , moore said , trump is the dominant subject of discussion how do we maintain the witness of the christian church at a time when america seems to have gone crazy \? despite the critique voiced by moore and other conservative christians , trump won a plurality of the , often by well into the double digits in such former confederate states as south carolina , alabama , georgia , florida and mississippi in every recess of the right , the struggle between those who would accede to the political verdict rendered in the primaries so far and those who would stand on principle against trump is playing itself out two influential republicans on opposing sides are , the georgiabased conservative commentator , and , who served in the reagan and bush administrations and is now chairman of the washington lobbying firm the bgr group in his regular washington post column , rogers to bend to the will of the republican primary electorate erickson is having none of that in an essay called , he declared it s hard to see how trump , if he wins the nomination , could emerge from the republican wreckage he leaves in his wake to actually win the general election an assessment supported by the findings of a not only did hillary clinton beat trump 5041 in the survey s match up among registered voters , but 67 percent of voters had a negative view of trump , 15 points more than clinton while only 37 percent of those polled considered clinton honest and trustworthy , even fewer , 27 percent , believe that those words accurately describe trump when voters were asked if clinton and trump have the experience and personality to serve as president , clinton beat trump by 6626 and 5826 respectively it is universally acknowledged , however , that this is not a normal election one of trump s talents is the destruction and humiliation of his opponents , as the republican candidates who have dropped out one after another can testify trump is already against clinton , including he posted on social media that shows the former secretary of state barking like a small dog as vladimir putin laughs in the background but more than anything else it is the class divisions within the republican electorate that have provided the basis for the trump offensive as my colleagues  the phrase fast changing demographics is a reference to the growing numbers of blacks , hispanics , asianamericans and other minorities , while the white share of the population steadily declines damon linker , , put another spin on the sources of trump s success in his appeal to the bottom of , trump has that minimizes government responsibility for social insurance and he has repudiated classic republican demands for the reduction or privatization of in 2013 , he the conservative political action conference earlier in the campaign , moore of the southern baptist convention produced an apt description of the contestants in the republican nomination fight he  for those who do not recall , was a hugely popular southern televangelist until the defrocked him for  , moore s dissection of the trump phenomenon was even more trenchant moore went on voters should trump has become a human wrecking ball he may be able to assemble the 1 , 237 delegates needed to win his party s nomination , but when he is done with that he will face the task of building a national coalition strong enough to make the old one he has destroyed irrelevant in the face of this possibility , should we ask ourselves whatever our beliefs are to live up to moore s ethical values \? what happens if we do n't \?
sure , the artist carolee schneemann may be best known for pulling a scroll out of her vagina but that piece , interior scroll , in which she read aloud from the scroll the remarks of one of her critics , dates back to 1975 more recently , she has been working on motorized sculptures , often with video projections i'm very anxious for the culture to pay attention to the work that s not 40 years old , said ms schneemann , 76 culturally , my use of the body has dominated the larger body of work i hope now this will be redressed that hope stems from the decision by two galleries to join forces in representing ms schneemann ppow and galerie lelong , which will also mount a twopart solo exhibition of the artist s work together in october there s been in the last five years a revisiting of the importance of firstwave feminist artists , of women artists and of performance art , and carolee spans all those categories , said mary sabbatino , galerie lelong s vice president and partner people have not fully appreciated her work having represented ms schneemann for nearly 20 years , ppow felt it needed assistance in giving her more global exposure , said wendy olsoff , ppow s coowner , adding that the artist s influence extends to pop stars like lady gaga and miley cyrus and contemporary artists like marina abramovic to be sure , ms schneemann is having a moment , with a major retrospective at the museum der moderne in salzburg , austria two monographs on her work and the museum of modern art s recent acquisition of her kinetic 1963 piece , art institutions are reexamining their collections from the 1960s and '70s , the gallerists say , to include artists , like ms schneemann , who have historically been overlooked finally , museums are realizing that she was this totally key player , ms olsoff said , who was subsumed by the male artists of her generation when the choreographer justin peck was thinking about a visual vocabulary for his new ballet , based on the hans christian andersen story of the same name , he discovered at david zwirner gallery his work had a narrative and otherworldly quality to it and very specific color palettes , mr peck said he incorporated a lot of dancer figures so mr peck enlisted the brooklynbased mr dzama to do both the sets and the costumes for his ballet , which will have its first performance by the new york city ballet on feb 2 mr dzama , 41 , said his work had often been inspired by dance from the 1920s and dance magazines from the 1960s and '70s , material that informed his costume designs i wanted the whole thing to look timeless , the artist said , so it had this foot in the past but almost the past looking into the future mr dzama will also create a large installation for the promenade of the ballet s home , the david h koch theater at lincoln center , as part of the company s fourth art series , which invites contemporary visual artists to create works for exhibition this is the first time that an artist has made work for both the art series and a city ballet production because of mr dzama s obsession with the chessloving marcel duchamp , his installation which will go on display on tuesday has a chess theme and will feature video , drawings and sculpture it incorporates the promenade s two elie nadelman nudes and involves polka dots , elements that will be also reflected in mr dzama s highly theatrical costumes for the ballet i wanted this piece to have a real craftsmanship to it , mr peck said i did not want computerized projections i wanted it to feel handmade as a student at cooper union some years ago , augusto arbizo saw the work of at the mary boone gallery and it made a lasting impression so mr arbizo , director of the gallery 11r \( formerly eleven rivington \) , decided to inaugurate his 195 chrystie street location with his of that artist , who died of cancer in 1992 at the age of 34 her work always stayed with me , he said i had a personal connection to it the show , which runs through feb 7 , features ms dryer s paintings and works on paper from throughout her short career , including watercolors , and collages that have not been on view before mr arbizo also includes printed matter to provide context for those unfamiliar with ms dryer , who was born in toronto she was a former studio assistant to elizabeth murray and julian schnabel and also worked as a prop and set maker for new york theaters her work is in the permanent collections of the moma , the whitney and the guggenheim i would go on studio visits and bring up her name , mr arbizo said none of these young artists knew her the exhibition seems well timed , given that lily siegel , an independent curator , is working on a comprehensive dryer exhibition and catalog that has yet to find a home she was so gifted , mr arbizo said of ms dryer there s no knowing what work she might have made
house speaker paul d ryan on thursday criticized donald j trump for suggesting that there would be riots should republicans move to nominate another presidential candidate at the party s convention but he flatly dismissed suggestions that he become the antitrump alternative exulting in his latest primary victories , mr trump warned tuesday that to deny him the nomination at a contested convention , as many republican leaders hope to , would anger his supporters and lead to violence i think you d have riots , he said mr ryan said it appeared increasingly likely that the party s gathering in cleveland would indeed be contested , which would make it possible for republicans to nominate someone other than whoever has the most delegates when the primary contests end in june but he faulted mr trump for raising the prospect of rioting nobody should say such things in my opinion , because to even address or hint to violence is unacceptable , mr ryan told reporters at his weekly news briefing though he has been unsparingly critical of some of mr trump s statements such as the suggestion that foreign muslims be barred from entering the country mr ryan said he did not believe he would need to condemn mr trump s candidacy , expressing his faith in the electoral system but mr ryan said he would continue to speak out against assertions that violate the party s principles if anybody not just donald trump if anybody is out there representing the republican party in ways that we believe disfigure conservatism or do not portray what our views and principles are , i as a party leader and others , i assume , as well , have an obligation to defend our principles from being distorted , he said and we re going to continue doing that mr ryan s comments follow a phone call between mr trump and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , this week , during which mr mcconnell said he advised that it might be a good idea to condemn the recent violence between protesters and his supporters at his rallies mr ryan , the republican vicepresidential nominee in 2012 on the ticket with mitt romney , also sought once again to quell buzz that he might be the party s 11thhour presidential pick , fueled by former speaker john a boehner s suggestion on tuesday that mr ryan should become the party s standardbearer if none of the current candidates wins the nomination on the first ballot at the convention starting july 18 it is not me , mr ryan said , barely letting a reporter finish his question , adding i saw boehner last night , and i told him to knock it off

houston if the police shooting of omar ventura on a february night five years ago had been captured on video , it would have been chilling to watch an offduty houston police officer would have been seen coming out of a bar at closing time after a night of heavy drinking the video would have shown the officer , jose coronado jr , firing his gun while trying to break up a brawl mr ventura , who was unarmed , would have been seen falling to the ground dead and his brother , also unarmed , writhing in pain from a bullet wound but there was no video of that shooting or of most of the dozens of other questionable shootings of unarmed people by houston police officers none of them led to the criminal prosecution of an officer or significant discipline by the department the police in houston , the nation s fourthlargest city , found themselves on the defensive after a series of articles by the houston chronicle two years ago detailed a pattern of questionable shootings the numbers have remained grim , according to police and court records obtained through an open records law request and documents recently made available as part of lawsuits filed against the police department since 2005 , the police have shot 268 people , 111 of them fatally , records show the rate of shootings by police officers was higher in houston from 2010 to 2014 than in new york or los angeles , and the houston police killed more people than the los angeles police despite having half as many officers , according to \( officers in chicago , the nation s thirdlargest city , killed civilians at a higher rate than the houston police did over that period , records show \) despite the troubling statistics , the houston police have largely avoided the intensive public scrutiny directed in recent months at other large departments , including those in , and the reason , critics say , has been the lack of videotapes capturing the most questionable shootings of unarmed civilians without videotaped evidence to contradict police accounts , shootings are far less likely to galvanize the public and to result in disciplinary action against the officers involved , criminologists say the victims of police shootings in houston include brian claunch , a double amputee in a wheelchair who was holding only a pen when an officer shot him in 2012 , and jordan baker , an unarmed man fatally shot after the police stopped him while he was bicycling in 2014 , records show in the case of mr baker , who was 26 , a surveillance camera video captured his initial interaction with a police officer but not the shooting , which the police said took place after mr baker reached for his waistband janet baker , mr baker s mother , said she believed that the police had begun to follow her son because he was an africanamerican man wearing a hooded sweatshirt he was guilty of the wrong garment choice , she said the police were always looking for a way to exonerate the officer , and our family was left to pick up the pieces since 2005 , the houston police have shot at more than 460 people , and nearly one in five were unarmed , according to department records even when there is data on the number of police shootings , it s not nearly as compelling as watching something happen on video , said seth w stoughton , a law professor at the university of south carolina and a former police officer from john crawford to tamir rice to eric garner , it is the video that has kept public attention on policing charles a mcclelland jr , who is retiring as houston s police chief this week , said the lack of video evidence had not influenced his decisions in clearing hundreds of officers in department shooting investigations the law gives wide discretion to a law enforcement officer to use deadly force , he said , adding that the fbi had also investigated some of the shootings the person does not have to be armed , and that s a difficult concept for the public to understand chief mcclelland , who has spent six years as chief and 39 years with the department , said most officers would have body cameras within 18 months currently , about 100 of the department s 5 , 200 officers have cameras , and about 200 cars have dashboard cameras to reduce officerinvolved shootings , chief mcclelland said , the department is contemplating ways to reorganize training to emphasize deescalation , tactical retreating , and cover and concealment many times we know an incident might be lawful and justified , but we do n't want it to happen again , he said on thursday , martha montalvo , an executive assistant chief , was appointed interim chief while the department conducted a national search for a permanent replacement after about one in seven police shootings since 2005 , houston officers told supervisors that they had fired at someone who was unarmed because the person had postured in a threatening manner , according to police records that explanation , according to the records , has become increasingly common in recent years and without video evidence is nearly impossible to refute the vast majority of unarmed shooting victims have been africanamerican or latino lawyers for the families of those killed by the police say it is so routine for houston officers to go unpunished after shooting unarmed individuals that some officers no longer take such shootings seriously the department denied that claim but in one case , moments after a fatal police shooting in 2012 , officers engaged in a conversation over the department s text messaging system that suggested that some officers do take shootings lightly hey , bro , can you guys go at least two weeks without a shooting \? one officer asked a colleague , according to a transcript of the messages the response referring to the southern area of the city where the shooting occurred was that s how we roll at south central , bro we too hard ! the first officer replied ha , ha , ha right is he doa \? upon hearing that the victim had not yet died , the first officer playfully warned his colleague about the frequency of officer shootings man , bro , you better be careful the list is shortening of officers who have n't gotten into a shooting yet officer coronado was a fiveyear veteran of the department at the time he was drinking at sherlock s baker street pub on feb 19 , 2011 after being asked at the bar s 2 am closing time to leave , officer coronado , who had consumed several drinks , tried to take his beer with him , according to court records after the bouncer turned him away , the officer downed nearly a triple shot of jameson irish whiskey and a beer the bouncer and the bartender told investigators that officer coronado had been clearly intoxicated , with slurred speech and glassy eyes , according to police and court documents the bartender said that when she offered officer coronado a glass of water , he growled at her that he did not want it , according to bar employees a fight was taking place in the parking lot when officer coronado left the bar , and he became involved in it after he fatally shot mr ventura , officer coronado said he had opened fire because mr ventura had reached for his waistband as if he had a gun but witnesses said that mr ventura s hands had been extended in a nonthreatening manner and that officer coronado had not identified himself before shooting according to department records after officer coronado killed mr ventura and shot his brother , rolando ventura , in his left arm , the officer was stumbling as he walked away , rolando ventura said in a recent interview officer coronado was not disciplined for the shooting , but was suspended for 30 days for acting in an official capacity while drinking , and for using an unauthorized firearm the ventura family has sued the department rolando ventura , 32 , who has a scar that runs along his forearm from the shooting , said neither he nor his brother had posed a threat to officer coronado i know there s good officers , but you just never know if there s going to be a good police officer or not when you see one , he said officer coronado wrote in a brief email just before the fifth anniversary of the shooting , i am still haunted by it
beijing at a chaotic conference in beijing in 1913 led by the chinese linguist and political anarchist wu zhihui , the teacups flew , as well as the words , as participants tried to work out what was the chinese language \? it was an urgent task two years before , the last imperial dynasty had fallen in a republican revolution led by sun yatsen reformers like mr wu knew that had to become a modern nation if it was to survive but china was home to hundreds of spoken languages and dialects and a fantastically hard writing system that only a few highly educated people and officials were familiar with , according to david moser , the author of a billion voices , a new book recounting the creation of modern chinese standard chinese referred to in china as putonghua , or common language is , mr moser said in an interview , a frankensteinian amalgamation of several northern dialects that was finally adopted as the national language by the government in 1955 , six years after the communist revolution but in some ways , he said , little has changed since that 1913 conference yes , you have a language , but if you want mass literacy , this thing is a disaster , said mr moser , who is the academic director at cet , a chinese language program in beijing , has a phd in psycholinguistics and chinese , and has lived in china for more than 30 years the written symbols are fantastically hard to master to make it easier to learn thousands of characters that do not correspond to the sound of words and must be memorized , a romanization system called pinyin was introduced but the reformers' most ambitious plan abolishing the characters altogether was never carried out you have to feel sorry for chinese school kids , said mr moser , who likened learning chinese to a cognitive traffic jam in the first years of their basic education , they must study and master two script systems , one foreign , the other familiar but devilishly hard to write and unreasonably timeconsuming to memorize in mr moser s book , the efforts to define a national language run parallel with the decadeslong fighting among warlords the kuomintang , or nationalists and the eventually victorious communists to control and redefine the chinese nation as he described it a major question he addressed is why the creation of a national language in china was so much more difficult than in , say , european nations china , much like the african continent , had an enormous array of languages and dialects but the chinese government mostly calls them dialects rather than languages , even if some are mutually unintelligible mr moser explained the political reasoning behind this hundreds of millions of people in china and elsewhere are learning chinese but without a phonetic system to guide pronunciation , it is famously difficult although young learners in china have little choice , outside the country , among the chinese diaspora communities , the pull of english is strong mr moser laid out some of the consequences what is saving chinese now , he said , is digitization
tbs is debuting its new comedy on sunday , with a 25hour bingeathon , playing the whole 10episode season on repeat , without commercials this is both unnecessary and perfect it s unnecessary because this punfilled cop show parody is pretty much the opposite of the kind of complex , serial story that it s perfect because this show is so disposable , jokefocused and light on plot , you could tune in at any time of day midseason , midepisode , even and be just as goofily entertained this show is created by steve and nancy carell , though it has none of the tragicomedy or ambition of the office , which mr carell starred in it s 100 percent funny business just the farce , ma'am detective angie tribeca \( \) surname notwithstanding , she s with the los angeles police department is a lone wolf , a straight arrow , a tough cookie , and her coworkers are equally committed to their clich s the perennially exasperated lt chet atkins \( of justified \) , the heatlampintense detective danny tanner \( deon cole \) and angie s new partner , jay geils \( hayes macarthur \) , who gradually cracks her shell angie tribeca is as much a nostalgia show as a parody the procedural cop shows it spoofs are less dominant today , and the humor recalls the '80s comedy of police squad ! and sledge hammer ! \( why the carells forwent the exclamation point on their show is beyond me \) but there are some 21st century updates , like the absurdly blatant product placements and the theme song , which closes on a primal scream la roger daltrey s yeah ! for csi miami that ends up being the cry of a cop who has suffered a different agonizing mishap in each episode no crime trope goes untweaked if a cop says , let s take out the trash while arresting a perp , his colleagues will leave , carrying garbage bags if a ventriloquist dies , the quirky medical examiner \( andr e vermeulen \) will autopsy the dummy and if a victim s widow hopes the police will catch the animal that did this , the answer will be thank you , ma'am but we think it was a human who did it god help me , i laughed at that one i did n't laugh at them all , by a long shot angie tribeca fires groaners and sight gags as haphazardly as an academy rookie at a shooting drill it could have used a more forceful veto in the writers' room but it moves fast and could hardly be better cast among many cameos , keeganmichael key is monty pythonesque as a german ferret smuggler \( i only hope mr cole , a grievous loss to blackish , gets more to do in a future season \) the most important case that angie tribeca cracks , however , is what to do with ms jones , a disarming actress who had sometimes gotten lost among bigger personas in the office \( , sue me \) and parks and recreation ms jones is hilarious in a subdued way , and angie s deadpan dialogue is made for her when the lieutenant orders her to let go of a case , she snaps letting go is not in my dna however , there is a little irish , a little german , lefthandedness and earlyonset dementia there s also a little irish and a little german did you want to see me , sir \? angie tribeca is n't groundbreaking television , and it has definite weaknesses but after a line like that , i forget what they are
the republicans are having a grand old time carrying on about democrats \( and now donald trump \) who are bent as ted cruz so cleverly framed it on putting little girls alone in a bathroom with adult men mr cruz is now running a particularly creepy ad harping on this idea but like so many things mr cruz and others in his cohort say , this is a gigantic lie no one is arguing that male heterosexual perverts \( as glenn beck puts it \) should be allowed to go into women s restrooms and attack people whether they are little girls , or older girls , or women of any age mr cruz is actually talking about laws , passed in enlightened areas of the country like north carolina , that ban the use of public women s restrooms by transgender women these women suffer bitter abuse , bigotry and discrimination in many parts of their lives some transgender women are gay some are not none are adult men and being transgender is not a perversion it s hard to know what is truly going on here , beyond the unceasing effort by smug politicians like mr cruz to claim some special understanding of religion and liberty and to claim that evangelical christianity , as practiced by a particular group of rightwing white men , is somehow under threat calling the 2016 election a religious liberty election on the glenn beck program , mr cruz said it has only been in recent years that the modern democratic party , aided and abetted by the mainstream media and hollywood , has decided that religious liberty is inconsistent with their extreme political protections , political bias and that s just wrong it s wrong all right entirely untrue the real pressure on americans to adhere to a particular religious frame of reference comes from the christian right , not the hollywood left rightwingers like mr cruz use religion as a cudgel in all kinds of areas starting with denying women the right to make medical choices and limiting the civil rights of lesbian , gay , transgender and bisexual americans not all republicans adhere to mr cruz s particular brand of intolerance in this area donald trump said people should be able to use the bathroom they feel is appropriate , and governor john kasich of ohio has said that he would not sign the kind of bathroom bill so in vogue on the extreme right there is nothing in any antidiscrimination bill that would encourage the hordes of heterosexual perverts that so concern mr beck and mr cruz to storm women s restrooms and assault innocent people and there is nothing in the recent spate of bathroom bills that is going to prevent that from happening but that s not really what the bills supporters want their real goal is to scare people , to divide americans , and to make us believe that some of us are better and more righteous than others
when arrives in hiroshima , , on friday , he will be the first sitting american president to visit the site where the united states , killing about 140 , 000 people and leading to the end of the visit has presented the white house with fraught choices , none of which will make everyone happy the white house has said that the president will visit hiroshima peace memorial park and lay a wreath at the cenotaph commemorating the bombing victims in the context of hiroshima , these sites are fairly politically neutral , honoring peace and lost lives but the inscription on the monument reads rest in peace for the error shall not be repeated , raising the charged question of which or whose error it refers to the white house has not said whether mr obama will visit the hiroshima peace memorial museum , a more difficult choice given its overwhelming portrayal of japan as victim , with little reference to its role as a wartime aggressor in the 1990s , the museum responded to criticism that it does not sufficiently acknowledge japan s own atrocities by adding material describing hiroshima s role as a wartime manufacturing site but because of a renovation , much of that content is not currently on display this may be one of the trickiest issues because critics in the united states are casting the visit as another stop on an apology tour even if mr obama does not apologize , it could be difficult to meet any survivor without expressing some regret and sympathy for what they have suffered about 84 , 000 survivors of the atomic bomb still live in hiroshima prefecture , and an additional 48 , 000 in nagasaki according to wednesday by the japanese public broadcaster nhk , close to 60 percent of them said they wanted the president to meet with them and hear their stories asked in on sunday if he would oblige , mr obama demurred , saying he had not completed his schedule on thursday , a survivors group said that three survivors had been invited to the wreathlaying ceremony there was no word yet on whether they would meet the president mr obama has already said he would not issue an apology for the bombings , and prime minister has not pressed for one a majority of americans say they believe the bombings were necessary to force japan s surrender and end the war president harry s truman , and many historians since , have argued that the bombings saved millions of lives by averting the need for a fullscale invasion they also say that japan , which had led a rampaging campaign throughout asia , had an opportunity to surrender before the bombings , but chose not to in that view , no apology is warranted critics of the bombings are skeptical that they truly precipitated japan s surrender the fact that cities , not military targets , were bombed , killing more than 200 , 000 people , has led some experts in both countries to conclude the bombings amounted to war crimes in that view , the president should apologize on behalf of the united states after laying a wreath at the peace memorial , mr obama is expected to make brief remarks i think you can expect me to speak to the horrors of war in general , to speak to the need for a world without and to speak to the usjapan alliance as an example of how we can move forward , he told nhk he may also sign the guest book , as secretary of state john kerry did during a visit in april it is a stark , harsh , compelling reminder , mr kerry wrote , not only of our obligation to end the threat of nuclear weapons , but to rededicate all our effort to avoid war itself since the president s speech will not include an apology , he will have to strike a delicate balance in referring to japan s aggression during the war some have wondered if he will mention the japanese attack on pearl harbor , along with other japanese war atrocities like the nanjing massacre in china or the bataan death march the wounds of world war ii are still intensely felt in other parts of asia that fell victim to japan s imperial war machine in china , people s daily , the official communist party newspaper , accused japan of being mr obama s righthand man in east asia , while his visit to hiroshima is seen as a false effort to portray japan as a victim rather than a chief aggressor during the war the official response in south korea has been more deferential the government has neither welcomed nor criticized the trip but some south korean news media , as well as south korean survivors of the bombings , have urged mr obama to pay tribute to a separate monument at the hiroshima peace memorial park , built by koreans in memory of the korean victims the japanese people , along with the mainstream news media , have been overwhelmingly supportive of mr obama s decision to visit hiroshima in a poll this week by the asahi shimbun , a liberal newspaper , 89 percent however , on thursday , a group of about 50 protesters marched past the peace monument in hiroshima carrying signs that read , no abe ! no obama ! no nukes , base war !
columbia , sc dropped out of the presidential race on saturday , ending a quest for the white house that started with a war chest of 100 million , a famous name and a promise of political civility but concluded with a humbling recognition in 2016 , none of it mattered no single candidacy this year fell so short of its original expectations it began with an aura of inevitability that masked deep problems , from mr bush himself , a clunky candidate in a field of gifted performers , to the rightward drift of the since mr bush s time as a consensus conservative in florida i'm proud of the campaign that we 've run to unify our country , mr bush said , his eyes moist , in an emotional speech here saturday night after his third straight disappointing finish in the early voting states the people of iowa and new hampshire and south carolina have spoken , and i really respect their decision mr bush s campaign had rested on a set of assumptions that , one by one , turned out to be flatly incorrect that the republican primaries would turn on a record of accomplishment in government that mr bush s cerebral and reserved style would be an asset and that a country wary of dynasties would evaluate this member of the bush family on his own merits we 've had enough bushes , his mother , barbara bush , observed prophetically before her son announced his candidacy last summer mr bush , 63 , the former twoterm governor of florida , failed to inspire republican primary voters whose mood and needs had changed dramatically since he left government in 2007 in what turned out to be the year of the unconventional outsider , he conducted his campaign as the conventional insider last summer , as prepared to declare his candidacy with an incendiary and improvised speech in new york city about the criminal records of immigrants from mexico , mr bush was in eastern europe , meeting with heads of state and delivering calibrated remarks about american diplomacy and as he stood on debate stages next to the likes of mr trump and senator ted cruz of texas , mr bush never seemed to convincingly play the fighter figure after promising to conduct a joyful campaign , mr bush instead found himself locked in , under gleeful attack from his rivals and heightened scrutiny from the political world he had thought was rooting for him in a painful twist of the knife , mr bush was overtaken by his former political prot g , senator , whose career he had nurtured in florida but by far his biggest liability , aides and advisers concede , was a pedigree he could do nothing to erase or dilute he was a bush through and through , at a time when voters sneered at the political and economic establishment that his family name embodied maria losito , 65 , and her husband , frank losito , 65 , retirees in palm city , fla , said they could not quite bring themselves to support mr bush the father was president , the brother was president , said ms losito how do i trust him that he s going to change things that his father and brother did n't \? but mr losito said he felt for mr bush it s sad in a way , he said , because he s pouring all this money in and he s not getting anywhere the long , slow tumble within the republican campaign was a nightmare scenario for mr bush , who was skeptical about whether to enter the race in the first place a successful business executive in florida , he had turned his family name and time as governor into a lucrative network of companies and consulting contracts , amassing a net worth in the tens of millions of dollars his wife , columba , who never relished politics , seemed ambivalent , and his immediate family was not eager for the scrutiny that a presidential run would invite but as 2016 approached , old friends and a powerful network of bush donors pleaded with him to become a candidate , assuring him they would raise the required money with astonishing speed and alacrity , they did just that more than 100 million for the supporting him , contributing to the campaign s air of confidence and strength still , not even mr bush s most loyal donors had seen him operate as a candidate in years and he was rusty he stumbled out of the gate struggling to handle both his famous last name and the legacy of his brother , president george w bush , who led the nation into a deeply unpopular war in iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that never materialized mr bush promised to campaign as his own man , first trying to distance himself from his family and later extolling his mother , father and brother at every turn when he rolled out a list of foreignpolicy advisers , they largely hailed from previous bush administrations in one of his campaign s lowest moments , he repeatedly bungled a question about whether he would have authorized the 2003 invasion of iraq , as his brother had , given the intelligence known today what seemed like the simple and inevitable answer did not arrive for days , after multiple , widely ridiculed attempts he was gaffeprone and awkward on the campaign trail , interrupting his own sentences on stage and appearing nervous and uncomfortable during debates mr bush seemed at his weakest during the primetime rumpuses , a problem that became indelible on oct 28 in colorado for that contest , mr bush had rehearsed a direct confrontation with mr rubio , his surging disciple , in which he had planned to mock the young lawmaker s tendency to miss votes in the senate but mr rubio was prepared and back on mr bush , leaving mr bush devastated , his aides scrambling and donors confused and angry mr bush improved somewhat as a debater , but he never seemed to dominate the heavily watched encounters the uneven performances earned mr bush a memorable moniker from mr trump , which the real estate developer repeated at every turn but in what many of mr bush s supporters now say was a strategic error , his campaign did not immediately push back against the schoolyard taunt another error , they concede , was the decision to put mike murphy a nimble and trusted adviser who knew the candidate s strengths and weaknesses in charge of mr bush s , where he was prohibited by law from coordinating with mr bush and his campaign inside the campaign s miami headquarters , few figures had the standing or inclination to challenge mr bush , even as he flailed loyal longtime aides , many of whom had never run a presidential election , spoke of letting jeb be jeb in the face of mountains of data showing that much of the electorate was not embracing him financial muscle , rather than a lucid message , became the hallmark of mr bush s political operation it snatched up marquee consultants and policy advisers it set up camps across the early states , promising a national operation it created elaborate , threedimensional mailers and it spoke of a shock and awe factor intended to spook potential rivals both the campaign and the supporting it relied heavily on expensive television commercials that never broke through the ads became a cautionary tale for how little impact such media could have in a raucous and colorful field dominated by mr trump , who boasted of saturating the news so thoroughly that he did not need to pay for many ads with mr bush s prospects dimming , even standard practices in politics , such as relentlessly attacking his rivals , seemed to backfire when the super pac intensified its spending on advertising critical of mr rubio , in an attempt to prop up mr bush s flagging campaign , party elders cried foul , saying it looked like sour grapes his onceintimidating financial might evaporated the smaller donations required to pay the bills of his campaign started to dry up , forcing the campaign to make cuts and dispatch its central staff to the campaign trail his team talked of resets and rebrandings mr bush trotted out his mother then his brother in truth , he grew and improved as a candidate his manner became both more forceful and freewheeling , impressing voters he met in person and after appearing so flustered by mr trump , mr bush recently found a way to cast himself as a serious alternative to him in a country fearful of global terror and economic decline but it was not enough mr bush liked to explain that the boldfaced exclamation point emblazoned on all of his campaign posters connotes excitement the problem was that mr bush himself never managed to deliver on that promise
remember the gores \? al and tipper \? at the democratic convention in 2000 , they shared that hungry , happy kiss , and it was more than a meeting of lips it was a window , or so we thought , into a partnership of enduring passion and inextinguishable tenderness they 're separated now have been for more than five years and the edwardses \? john and elizabeth \? he resembled a ken doll she did n't take after barbie that endeared them to voters endeared to voters only later did we learn about his double life , the furious fights and the copious tears we know nothing of other people s marriages nothing at all so why do we pretend otherwise \? why do we make so many assumptions and judgments \? and why , every election cycle , do we treat candidates' spouses and unions as the keys to their characters \? we ca n't trust what s paraded in front of us any more than we can take what journalists and opponents dig up as the essential truth a person s intimate life is n't readily fathomed , and on the inside tends not to look anything like it does on the outside bill clinton hit the campaign trail this week that brought back memories , or rather donald trump hauled those memories to the surface , and we were reminded anew of all that bill and hillary have been through \( and have put us through \) the infidelities , the intern , the lies , the smears we were also reminded of hillary s role in defending him how did that square with her claim to be a champion of women \? it s fair to ask but the fascination with the clintons as a couple goes beyond that question , beyond those scandals , to the belief in many quarters that we can divine something essential about each of them by the fact that they teamed up and stayed together according to her fans , it s a measure of her understanding that people are broken , of her capacity for forgiveness , of her belief in commitments according to her foes , it reveals a thirst for power that redeems any heartbreak and transcends all humiliation it could be proof of both or neither the answer is n't gettable talk with six different people who know the clintons well and you hear six different appraisals of their bond , each presented with unalloyed confidence i 've been told that they light up around each other as they light up around no one else i 've been told that there s no extraordinary spark there , just a storehouse of shared memories , an accretion of endurable disappointments , a daughter , a granddaughter and a friendship i 've been told that they 're really business associates , intricately involved in each other s lives because they 're jointly invested in the perpetuation of their political relevance i 've been told that they talk more than anyone would imagine i 've been told that they talk less in new hampshire on monday , when he his first encounters with her some 45 years ago , he called her the most amazing person and said , everything she touched , she made better maybe that was a deeply felt tribute maybe just a great line heidi cruz will also be in new hampshire this week she s a busy evangelist for ted , half of a couple who present themselves as perfect perhaps or perhaps , as the cringeworthy from a cruz campaign commercial suggest , they 're just equally meticulous about the script on which they 're collaborating , equally intent on a triumphant denouement i'm less and less interested in guessing , because i'm more and more aware of how compartmentalized people are , of how flawed and fruitless it is to extrapolate from one chamber of their lives to another the stingiest spouse and parent can be the greatest boss , and vice versa someone who s selfless and principled in one context is sometimes the opposite in another , as if there s only so much goodness to go around and no chamber resists exploration and explanation like that of a marriage or comparable relationship we 're certain that we have it figured out who musters the most patience , who makes the greatest sacrifices , who s pure , who s sullied until it falls apart then we gape at the pieces , because none are recognizable we 're certain that social climbing or religious devotion is a couple s glue , when what matters more is the secret language of goofy endearments that they speak or the unremarkable daily rituals that they 've grown to relish or the tempo of his speech or the timbre of her laugh and when we come to our sweeping conclusions , we 're not perceiving but projecting , and we 're using couples to cling to our idealism or validate our cynicism it s a foolish game under any circumstances it s a dangerous one en route to the election of a president
donald j trump s republican rivals will be playing catchup ahead of the new york primary , according to a new poll released on wednesday that shows the manhattan businessman holding a substantial lead in his home state a survey from monmouth university found that 52 percent of likely republican primary voters support mr trump gov john kasich , who has only won his state of ohio , comes in second with 25 percent , and senator ted cruz of texas trails with 17 percent mr trump is showing particular strength in new york city , long island and western new york if the numbers hold up , mr trump could net most of the state s 95 delegates on april 19 although mr trump has been criticized in recent weeks for his comments on abortion and nuclear weapons policy , most new york republicans were unfazed by the controversies , the poll suggested like many national polls , monmouth s survey also shows mr kasich as the strongest candidate in a hypothetical general election contest against hillary clinton however , none of the republicans are likely to turn new york red in november it is interesting that kasich would be a stronger nominee in trump s home state , but it is purely academic , said patrick murray , director of monmouth university s poll there is almost no probability that any republican would be able to win new york s electoral votes
senator raised significantly more money in the final three months of the year while maintained his pace in fundraising during that period , according to numbers released by the republican presidential hopefuls' campaigns mr cruz and mr carson were the first of the 2016 candidates to release broadstroke details of how much money they raised during the fourth and final quarter of the year the full filings , with details on donors and the amounts spent by the campaigns , are not required to be submitted to the until jan 31 mr cruz , who has been rising in polls , particularly in iowa , raised nearly 20 million from october through the end of the year , according to a memo released wednesday by his campaign the figures were intended to show a muscular operation that can convert money into votes , with the total representing a twothirds increase over the 122 million that mr cruz reported raising from july through the end of september we will conclude 2015 with having raised over 45 million , mr cruz s campaign manager , jeff roe , wrote in a memo that also laid out the campaign s number of volunteers , its fundraising leaders in crucial regions and its overall preparedness for the long nominating contest ahead , which starts with voting in iowa a month from now mr carson , meanwhile , reported raising roughly 23 million , a small increase from the nearly 21 million he raised in the previous quarter the figures were notable given that mr carson has recently slipped in polls after being pummeled by reports questioning some of the details of his life story , which he has used as the basis for his candidacy the retired neurosurgeon has also struggled to answer elemental questions on foreign policy as national security has risen as a significant issue for voters but several candidates had no plans to release numbers on thursday , according to aides for some , that was a function of the fact that the final day of fundraising could bring in more money for others , delaying a potentially bad story about low fundraising to the end of january , the day before the iowa caucuses , may be a factor on the democratic side , none of the three candidates had released their numbers by midday wednesday martin o'malley , who trails behind hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders , is the only candidate who has applied for federal matching funds he has reallocated staff members from his maryland headquarters to iowa in recent weeks , and has been said by people briefed on the matter to have had discussions about taking a bank loan based on the pending matching funds mr o'malley s aides declined to comment on the discussions such loans based on the expectation of matching funds are considered fairly standard aides to mrs clinton and mr sanders have recently tried to raise expectations for what the other side will report in its fundraising numbers while diminishing perceptions of their own totals , engaging in the common practice of setting expectations before the numbers are actually released mr sanders has a strong base of lowdollar donors who can be tapped repeatedly , while mrs clinton has relied more on traditional , larger fundraising events
masters of their fields , the photographer and the writer bonded over a shared vision of using their creative talents to address racial injustice that commitment led to the powerful , enduring 1952 photo essay but that life magazine project was not their only collaboration a new exhibition , for the first time shows images from a lesserknown 1948 project of theirs , harlem is nowhere on view through aug 28 at the , the exhibition offers the two men s counternarrative \( the reality , that is \) of the living conditions of black americans during that time among the show s more than 50 objects the known surviving material belonging to both a man becomes invisible and harlem is nowhere are newly discovered images , photographs that have never been exhibited and items that had not been definitely identified as belonging to either project the blackandwhite photographs are vignettes of life in harlem street scenes of adults and children political advocacy in real time and imagined scenes from invisible man , ellison s watershed 1952 novel the photographs are placed next to the passages that correspond with them , giving a sense of the tight collaborative process among the other highlights are drafts of captions for harlem is nowhere , and images include a man in an alleyway harlem in literal ruin with a clinic building acting as a bright light and a patient waiting to be seen , sitting in solitude , head in his hands ellison and parks lived parallel lives , and they intersect in a creative splendor , adam bradley , an associate professor at the university of colorado , boulder , who has written about ellison s work , said in a telephone interview they both understood the capacity of dark and light , light and shadow , black and white these artists were compelled to focus on harlem , their adopted home , which despite being the center of a cultural revival during the harlem renaissance , suffered a great economic toll tied to the depression they also witnessed the mounting postwar frustrations among their neighbors , black men who had been enlisted to fight but whose freedoms remained limited upon their return home harlem is nowhere gets at these disparities and shows the economic effects of segregation at the lafargue mental hygiene clinic in harlem , the first racially integrated psychiatric center of both staff and clientele in new york city it was also the site of an earlier photo and text collaboration , between richard wright and richard saunders , and studies there played a role in brown v board of education ellison really viewed the clinic as a prism for understanding africanamerican experiences , primarily with migration and urbanization and the precariousness of life in a ghetto , gabriel n mendes , an assistant professor at the university of california , san diego , who wrote a book about the clinic , said in a phone interview he was able to capture what africanamerican patients were reckoning with in regards to different forms of mental disorders but he also used lafargue as an elaboration of what africanamerican life was in a profoundly contradictory system ellison s notes reveal that he intended the project to address the disparities in north and south harlem , the disintegration of slum life and success of the clinic among other things in correspondence with wright , ellison said he hoped the project would make for something new in photojournalism scheduled to appear in '48 the magazine of the year , harlem is nowhere ended up lost when the magazine folded mere weeks before the article s publication after the magazine filed for bankruptcy , the project became entangled in court proceedings years after recovering his written text , ellison published it in shadow and act , a 1964 collection of essays , but none of parks s photos appeared with it the first step in the process of identifying works for both projects was the realization that there were dozens of images that were not included in the 1952 life story and were subsequently never published , michal razrusso , an assistant curator at the art institute of chicago , said , referring to mr parks s photo essay a man becomes invisible there were images that corresponded to nearly every major scene in the book that took place in harlem ms razrusso then initiated an effort in 2014 to identify the works she called it part scavenger hunt and part research there were clues , including information about the overlapping harlem projects , drafts of photo captions and more , but no way to verify which projects the photos belonged to when jeanchristophe cloutier , an assistant professor of english at the university of pennsylvania , found two manuscripts related to harlem is nowhere , both ms razrusso and mr cloutier were able to complete the puzzle and identify the images as luck and hard work through research would have it , the library of congress had what was known to be the only surviving photograph taken by parks from inside the clinic ellison and parks were not alone in their efforts to push the boundaries of mainstream news media and expose racial disparities in the united states other prominent artists from various genres who collaborated in the mid1900s included richard wright and edwin rosskam , whose 1941 book , 12 million black voices , depicted the lives of black citizens in the 1930s , and james baldwin and richard avedon , who produced a photography book , nothing personal , with text condemning the bleakness of life in 1960s america parks and ellison s a man becomes invisible was conceived as a response to the publication of ellison s novel , about a man who lives in a hidden world because of his invisibility to others beyond the professional work , the show also offers glimpses of their personal connection there was a solitary quality about each of them , said john callahan , ralph ellison s literary executor as ralph would talk about it , he would say , i could just walk with gordon , and he would n't expect me to say anything and i would n't expect him to say anything' i have a sense that there was an electricity and a casualness to their relationship mr bradley elaborated in some ways , their collaboration is akin to a great songwriting duo , he said one handles the music , the other lyrics , and there s never something that comes completely first they understood that the sum of their art would be greater than its individual parts
you already know duke , xavier , butler and even austin peay but when the s round of 64 begins thursday , fans can begin familiarizing themselves with a host of less familiar , more playful names scoochie yogi tubby tum tum middle tennessee state has brought a giddy , and weber state will have a dusty arizona s gregarious assistant coach is a harlem native nicknamed book if texas tech advances , some of the credit will surely go to pooh the history of basketball has always been colorfully interwoven with imaginative nicknames monikers that could instantly summon wonder \( magic \) , prompt a smile \( pickles \) or trigger a craving \( jellybean \) for the most part , nicknames have disappeared from basketball , replaced by tired initials \( lbj , cp3 , kd \) , corporate shorthand \( melo \) or nothing at all \( stephen curry \) knicks fans tried to label the rookie sensation kristaps porzingis with a cool alias , but none took that is why this year s ncaa tournament seems more like a throwback , a nod to the days when nicknames were vibrant and organic , borne of playground taunts , backyard boasts or , worse , the nursery , from which many of the more unfortunate nicknames emerged this year , the tournament offers a symphony that should please fans and onomasticians alike dayton s dayshon smith , better known as scoochie , is a bronx native stirring memories of when nicknames consistently rolled off the tongue , even if it was never clear how they got there in the first place smith , like many , has claimed ignorance regarding the origin of his nickname , blaming his grandfather for turning baby babble into a lasting sobriquet at least the name scoochie is different when his flyers face syracuse on friday , smith will be reunited with an assistant coach who once recruited him , adrian autry , who is said to have acquired the nickname red because of his hair color , even though it had already been claimed by notable coaches like red auerbach and red holzman pete gillen , a brooklyn native and former coach at xavier , providence and virginia , caught himself daydreaming when he brought up smith s name on cbs late sunday night , chuckling quietly as he reminisced about the names from the playgrounds of his youth batman , bullhead , sid , shorty , gillen said , listing a few of his favorites in a phone interview monday joey roastbeef joey clams threefinger willie was pretty good gillen added , and , of course , there was slice yes , of course , slice \( legal name barry rohrssen \) , now the associate head coach at st john s , whose campus is not far from the gym at st francis college , where his nickname was bestowed at a fivestar basketball camp by one of its founders , howard garfinkel rohrssen was not a great shooter he preferred cutting to the hoop so slice became his handle well before there was twitter the really good names stay alive , said tom konchalski , a longtime scout and the editor and publisher of high school basketball illustrated in new york , if you talk about the hawk , everyone knows who that is , he said , referring to connie hawkins , the former brooklyn playground legend konchalski cited dwayne washington as a personal favorite , although he preferred washington s lesserknown nickname \( pacman , because he stole the ball so much \) to his more common one \( pearl \) most of the nicknames in this year s tournament were endowed by family members rather than basketball peers kevin ferrell , a senior guard for indiana , earned his playful moniker , yogi , as a toddler because of his affection for the cartoon character yogi bear michigan s michael joseph albrecht , better known as spike , was so named because of his obsession over baseball cleats he wore at age 5 here i am , 20 years old , and people are still calling me spike ,  indeed , some names are hard to shake texas tech coach orlando smith will forever be known in basketball circles as tubby , though he has always remained relatively trim \( the nickname was given because smith adored bathing in a washtub as a toddler \) smith s assistant alvin williamson still answers to pooh because his aunt thought he resembled winnie the pooh nobody knows my first name , said speedy claxton , an assistant coach at hofstra , who got his wellknown nickname from a coach in an eighthgrade aau game now , claxton said , he cannot go through an airport without a security agent asking why his passport reads craig sometimes the would make my check out to speedy , claxton said , adding , that s how you know you have a real nickname when people do n't realize you have a first name nicknames , by historical definition , cannot be selfgiven , according to cleveland kent evans , a psychology professor at bellevue university in nebraska and a former president of the american name society he suggested that rap music and social media innovations like twitter handles might be behind the resurgence of nicknames , but that their popularity had waned in general society because given names had become much more varied forty or 50 years ago , when you had multiple mikes and johns and jims everywhere , you needed nicknames just to keep them apart , evans said workingclass people tend to use more nicknames than others , as a sign of camaraderie , and men are more likely to get nicknames than women , evans said what sort of impact a catchy nickname has on a person largely depends on the context of his social circle a name like tubby might not be as bad as it seems even something which sounds pejorative or nasty outside your own social group , you can accept it and like it , evans said , if it s used with good humor by your own friends some names just have to be altered the arizona assistant coach emanuel richardson was nicknamed pocketbook by his grandmother because she would catch him riffling through her purse the name was eventually shortened on the basketball courts , where book became a synonym for sprint to this day , my mom , my grandma , they still call me pocketbook , richardson said i tell them , if you want to still stay in this will , it had better be just book' claxton said his nickname used to make him feel special on the court , and he used it as a psychological advantage over opponents it definitely gave me confidence , he said it s cool having a nickname i kind of loved it if that is the case , tiny hampton , which faces topseeded virginia as a no 16 seed thursday , could be the most confident team in the tournament coach edward joyner jr goes by little buck , in deference to his father , who became known around winstonsalem , nc , as buck also playing for the pirates will be pastor don \( donald ross \) and swaggy p \( gregory hayden \) hampton s leading scorer , reginald johnson jr , is known as check check is an opportunity , never miss an opportunity , and i take advantage of everything , johnson said i gave that nickname to myself at the start of this season that might not pass evans s classic nickname guidelines , but it could stick anyway life s too short have some fun along your journey , gillen said like scoochie he s a terrific player , and he s got a great nickname you do n't meet too many scoochies
loretto , pa by the age of 12 , maureen powers , the daughter of a professor at the local roman catholic university , played the organ in the magnificent hilltop catholic basilica here and volunteered in the parish office but , she said , she was hiding a secret her priest sexually abused her for two years , telling her it was for the purpose of research by her high school years , she felt so tied up in knots of betrayal and shame that she confided in a succession of priests she said the first tried to take advantage of her sexually , the second suggested she comfort herself with a daily candy bar and the third told her to see a counselor none of them reported the abuse to the authorities or mentioned that she could take that step so when a in march that the diocese of altoonajohnstown , which includes loretto , engaged in an extensive coverup of abuse by as many as 50 church officials , ms powers , now 67 , decided to finally report her case she called the office of the state attorney general and recounted her story , including the name of her abuser , a prominent monsignor who was not listed in the grand jury report i just felt like now , someone will believe me , said ms powers , who retired after 30 years in leadership positions at the ywca in lancaster , pa she was not alone ms powers was among more than 250 abuse survivors and tipsters who called a hotline set up by the pennsylvania attorney general , kathleen g kane twenty agents were needed to answer the phones , and a voice mailbox was set up to handle the overflow nearly 15 years after boston suffered through a clergy abuse scandal dramatized in the recent movie , pennsylvania is going through its own painful reckoning from the state capitol in harrisburg to kitchens in railroad towns , people say they have been stunned to read evidence that priests they knew as pastors , teachers and confessors were secretly abusing children findings the grand jury report called staggering and sobering victims are coming forward for the first time to family and friends , and alumni of parochial schools are pulling out their yearbooks , marveling at how smiling faces hid such pain multiplying the outrage , the grand jury report supplied evidence that the police , district attorneys and judges in the altoona and johnstown area colluded with bishops in the coverup , quashing the pleas of parents who tried to blow the whistle on priests who sexually abused children some of those officials are named in the report , and some still hold public office it really hit home for me when i realized that these victims are my friends , my classmates , said , a democrat , whose district includes part of johnstown and who attended bishop mccort high school , where the grand jury found that the abuse was rampant our region is devastated by drugs , suicide , alcoholism , and then you wonder is this abuse tied into all of this \? bishop mark l bartchak of altoonajohnstown , who cooperated with the grand jury s investigation but did not see the report until it was released , tried to control the damage he urged victims to call the attorney general s hotline bishop bartchak declined to give an interview but he said in a letter to his diocese last month there is no mistaking that what has been made public this past week is filled with the darkness of sin , adding , we will pass through this darkness in altoona s massive cathedral , its dome looming over the nearby churches of other denominations , bishop bartchak ordered the removal of all banners and portraits honoring all the diocese s bishops his two most recent predecessors were depicted in the grand jury report as deeply culpable in having allowed known abusers to continue to have access to children bishop bartchak removed five accused priests from ministry in the last year , while the grand jury was investigating , said tony degol , the secretary for communications nevertheless , in the state capital , calls for full disclosure and accountability suddenly have new momentum , a republican and a former police officer from the philadelphia area , to the united states attorney for the western district of pennsylvania calling for an investigation under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act , known as rico this failure was colossal it was nothing less than organized crime , mr vereb said in an interview in his office , where he keeps his old nightstick on his desk there was no chance , if you were a victim , that you were going to get justice a flurry of negotiations has begun over bills that had been stalled for years to for both civil and criminal cases of child sexual abuse abuse victims and their advocates have long argued that just as there is no statute of limitations on murder , there should be none on the sexual abuse of children the legislator leading the charge to extend the statute of limitations is , a democrat from berks county still boyish at 44 , he is haunted by memories of being raped by a priest in middle school a priest he later learned went on to sexually abuse some of his friends he said he decided to run for office in 2013 after the second of those friends committed suicide on good friday a year ago , a third friend also took his own life if i had spoken up when i was 13 or 14 , i probably could have saved a lot of my friends i feel a lot of guilt , mr rozzi said i came here to do this he did not speak about his abuse until he was 39 , and since then he has not stopped he ran for office campaigning to change the statute of limitations , which imposes deadlines on when victims can bring civil suits or prosecutors can press charges victims of child sexual abuse in pennsylvania can file civil suits until they turn 30 , and criminal cases until they are 50 but mr rozzi says it can take even longer than that for abuse victims to come forward shame , confusion , fear and denial are all factors that can inhibit them from speaking out , so mr rozzi and his allies are pushing for several bills to address this problem one bill , scheduled for a vote in the house judiciary committee on tuesday , would remove all time limits for filing civil or criminal suits relating to child sexual abuse but this would apply only to people abused after the law is passed mr rozzi also wants to pass a temporary window in which adults victimized years ago could file suits no matter how long ago the abuse occurred other states have already passed similar window laws , including california , delaware , georgia , hawaii and minnesota these window laws can leave the church and other institutions open to legions of suits lobbyists with the and the insurance industry have pressed lawmakers to hold the line , and they were working the capitol s corridors last week amy b hill , a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania catholic conference , argued against any changes in the statute of limitations , saying , over time witnesses' memories become unreliable , evidence is lost or never found , and in many instances perpetrators or witnesses may be deceased however , pennsylvanians and their legislators say they are asking themselves why their state has been in national headlines so often over sexual abuse , and not just in the church the state has seen the conviction of a former penn state assistant football coach , , for sexually abusing boys two grand jury reports on child sexual abuse in the archdiocese of philadelphia the firstever msgr william j lynn for covering up child abuse and now , the prosecution of on charges that he drugged and sexually abused a woman who worked at his alma mater , temple university despite all of that , it was not until the recent grand jury report , and the attorney general s subsequent indictment of in hollidaysburg , on charges of covering up child abuse , that legislators who were siding with the church began to rethink their positions enough is enough , said , a democrat from berks county , after reading the grand jury report , which he called revolting for years , in his position as minority chairman of the judiciary committee , mr caltagirone helped to block legislation to extend the statute of limitations , but he said in an interview that he now favored it we were promised that changes would be made from the top down then , dear god , we learn this i have had it up to here the pennsylvania attorney general , ms kane , said that her work was far from finished , and that she was looking into allegations in another diocese in harrisburg , the deputy attorney

norristown , pa of the dozens of women who have said sexually assaulted them , andrea constand is the only one whose complaint has led to criminal sexual assault charges and kevin steele is the prosecutor who is now bringing her case to trial but if one considers the history of the case that began near here 12 years ago with a disputed encounter inside the entertainer s home , no parties are more responsible for mr cosby s legal troubles than ms constand s two lawyers , dolores m troiani and bebe h kivitz at virtually every turn in the legal journey , they have tenaciously challenged mr cosby , first during an initial , criminal investigation that never led to charges , then in subsequent civil proceedings in which they won an undisclosed financial settlement for ms constand in 2006 more recently , they supported the publication of confidential deposition testimony from their civil lawsuit in which mr cosby acknowledged obtaining quaaludes in an effort to have sex with women the acknowledgment was part of the new evidence cited by prosecutors in announcing the criminal charges last december this month the two lawyers were key witnesses at a pretrial hearing in the criminal case they have been strong advocates for their client over nearly 12 years now , and that support and continuity they have provided for andrea is the mark of a good advocate , said michelle madden dempsey , a law professor at villanova university mr cosby s legal team has long complained about their conduct , saying that they waged a campaign against mr cosby in public and suggesting that the two lawyers breached a confidentiality agreement they brokered between mr cosby and ms constand in 2006 neither of the women would agree to an interview , citing the confidentiality clauses but in their testimony here this month both made clear the central role that the cosby case had come to play in their lives ms troiani , 64 , forcefully declared how upset she had been at the treatment of her client when prosecutors declined to bring charges against mr cosby in 2005 yes , i am passionate and i'm still furious about it , she told the courtroom that is not how you treat an individual , any individual both women spent early parts of their careers in philadelphia , cutting their teeth as prosecutors in the district attorney s office during their careers , ms troiani prosecuted homicides and both prosecuted sexual offense cases , ms kivitz focusing on rape and child abuse ms kivitz , 60 , continues to be an adviser to the archdiocese of philadelphia on addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors and is on the board of an organization that works to protect victims of child sexual abuse ms troiani told the court this month that she was the first female prosecutor to try a rape case in chester county , west of philadelphia , a moment she recalled from the witness stand i had a judge tell me i had to find a better word than penis , she said i had defense attorneys asking if the woman had an orgasm they asked what she was wearing ms troiani suggested that , in the constand case , such perspectives had not evolved , but calcified she does not have the personality of someone who is intimidated , said james edward maule , a villanova university law professor who attended catholic elementary school with ms troiani and went to the same law school similarly , the former pennsylvania governor edward g rendell , who worked with ms troiani as the philadelphia district attorney from 1978 to 1986 , recalled how she seldom negotiated plea deals as a prosecutor she took tough cases with not overwhelming evidence , and she tried them , he said in an interview lynne m abraham , also a former philadelphia district attorney , who knows both women said , bebe is no less passionate but has a softer approach in 2001 , ms troiani and ms kivitz began a law practice together in one of philadelphia s main line suburbs four years later ms constand came to them for advice ms constand had been director of operations for the women s basketball program at temple university , where she enjoyed a mentor type relationship with mr cosby until one evening in january 2004 he had invited her to his home in montgomery county , she said , and gave her pills that made her feel nauseous and dizzy mr cosby digitally penetrated her mr cosby admitted the sexual contact , but said it had been consensual mr cosby has denied all the claims of sexual assault leveled at him by many women ms kivitz sat with ms constand as she filed her police complaint in 2005 and accompanied her to meetings with prosecutors when the district attorney declined to bring charges , the lawyers filed a civil suit against mr cosby as part of the suit , they included 13 anonymous jane doe witnesses , other women who came forward with similar accounts of drugging and sexual assault by mr cosby when they became public , the multiple accusations together depicted mr cosby as a sexual predator in interviews , several of those women said they respected the work ms troiani had done for ms constand but they said the financial settlement won by ms constand in 2006 came as a complete surprise one woman , beth ferrier , who accused mr cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in the mid1980s , said ms constand s lawyers had approached her about testifying she said ms troiani promised her she would get to meet ms constand and the other jane does but that did not happen , ms ferrier said all of us were just left hanging none of us knew what was going on but donna motsinger , who said she was assaulted in 1972 , said ms troiani was supportive and gentle throughout the process everything about her was a delight , ms motsinger said during the civil case , ms troiani questioned mr cosby for four days in the fall of 2005 and the spring of 2006 , fighting furiously with his lawyers as she pushed mr cosby to answer her questions she thought that cosby was getting a pass from everybody because he was everybody s granddad , ms abraham said of ms troiani she was n't putting up with it because she knew that her client had been wronged eventually , mr cosby admitted during the deposition that he had obtained drugs to give to women he was pursuing when you got the quaaludes , was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with \? ms troiani asked yes , mr cosby replied the depth of the cosby legal team s dissatisfaction with the two lawyers was evident during the pretrial hearing this month monique pressley , one of mr cosby s lawyers , pressed ms troiani , asserting that one of her motives in pursuing the case has been money ms troiani was unbowed asked if she conceded that she had profited from mr cosby s legal troubles , ms troiani responded enthusiastically i certainly did , she said , yes , absolutely ms kivitz and ms troiani are no longer law partners , though they still work as a team in representing ms constand the size of the 2006 financial settlement has never been disclosed and it is unclear what ms constand , a massage therapist , is paying the lawyers for their work on her behalf now
arlington , tex the are the third organization that has been seduced by the right arm of nathan eovaldi , whose whiplike pitching motion can hurl a baseball in excess of 100 miles per hour as hard as eovaldi can throw , and as much as his curve can dart and his splitter can dive , he has bounced from the dodgers to the marlins to the yankees because of his inability to harness his pitches but on monday , everything coalesced for eovaldi , an easygoing texan he pitched brilliantly , carrying a nohitter into the seventh inning and leading the yankees to a 31 victory over the  until nomar mazara s leadoff single in the seventh inning , eovaldi , 26 , had allowed only a fourthinning walk to mazara and a lone hardhit ball adrian beltre s drive to the warning track in left you can tell how good a guy is , and how good his stuff is , by the reaction of the hitters , said first baseman mark teixeira , who recognized how many uneasy swings the rangers took they 're swinging at pitches in the dirt , swinging at pitches over their head , because it s just an uncomfortable atbat though eovaldi is from the same hometown , alvin , tex , as nolan ryan , they had not met until last season and unlike ryan , who threw seven nohitters , eovaldi has never thrown one even in high school while eovaldi is also one of baseball s hardest throwers and wears the no 30 that ryan wore early in his career with the mets and angels , he did not pattern himself after ryan no , he said i just wanted to play baseball , really the backup catcher austin romine quickly developed a rhythm with eovaldi , who attacked the outer edge of the strike zone with his fastball against the aggressive rangers , and on the few occasions that he did fall behind , eovaldi was able to throw his breaking pitches for strikes eovaldi allowed only one other hit , a double that just eluded the reach of right fielder dustin ackley , and he was pulled after beginning the eighth with a walk to mitch moreland the lone texas run came when brett nicholas homered off dellin betances in the eighth , the first earned run he had allowed this season andrew miller pitched a perfect ninth for his fifth save nohitters are not exactly common for yankees pitchers while the cubs' jake arrieta has thrown two since aug 30 , the yankees have not had one since david cone s perfect game on july 18 , 1999 , and they have none on the road since allie reynolds s 10 win at cleveland on july 12 , 1951 but last season , his first with the yankees , eovaldi tantalized with the possibility in august , he retired the first 16 batters against minnesota , and in his next start , he pitched eight shutout innings in a 10 win over houston but he made only two more starts before ending the season on the disabled list with an inflamed right elbow his three starts this season did little to portend monday s performance , which lowered his era from 611 to 438 but once eovaldi got through the fifth inning , he and others started to think about the possibilities i 'd be lying if i said i did n't know what s going on , romine said but that s unchartered territory for me i 've never caught one before eovaldi said he was not superstitious , and he interacted in the dugout with teammates as he would have in any other game when mazara hit the ground ball that would ruin his bid , it went right where the shortstop would normally be stationed , but didi gregorius had been stationed up the middle as part of the yankees' defensive shift when it was hit i thought , it was an out , eovaldi said i feel like they work most of the time eovaldi , whose parents were in attendance , added , once it s over with , it s over with , and try to go as deep in the game as i can the yankees did not provide much support for eovaldi , but solo home runs by jacoby ellsbury in the third and starlin castro in the sixth were enough teixeira s double in the third drove in the other run alex rodriguez did not play because of an oblique injury , though it is not expected to keep him out beyond this series this was all the yankees could manage against cesar ramos a journeyman who was recalled to make the 11th start of his career , replacing the ace cole hamels \( groin \) but it was enough he s got no 1 stuff , teixeira said of eovaldi that s one thing that we 've all seen a guy that throws 97 miles per hour with a good splitter , a good curveball , that s no 1 stuff and he showed it tonight
on april 19 , 2011 , the los angeles kings and the san jose sharks were tied at 55 in game 3 of their firstround nhl playoff series when the broadcaster john buccigross posted on twitter , i got doughty and pavelski for my ot winners with that act , he started a tradition that now engages thousands of hockey fans as soon as a game heads to overtime buccigross said it was a little game he used to play with barry melrose and ray ferraro when they were on nhl 2nite our show did n't start until the last game finished , and when they 'd go to overtime , we 'd throw a dollar on the table and pick a guy from each team , and if your guy scored , you got the extra two bucks , and if none of our guys scored , we 'd take our dollar back , put it in our pocket and start the show the show has been off the air since 2004 when he sent that message out on twitter , he simply wanted to play the game again it was like an instant scratch ticket , buccigross said it was easy it heightened the experience of watching the game it gave you something to root for , and it was a way to gamble without losing any money but that first night , he got enough responses from his legion of followers that he kept doing it as more playoff games went into overtime he randomly picked a few winners among the correct guesses \( the gamewinner was scored by devin setoguchi for the sharks \) at the time , he offered only retweets as a prize for being right i noticed there was real currency in being retweeted , and people used to get real mad at me when they 'd guess right but i did n't pick them as one of the random winners i'm talking real mad but then they started getting really creative and including funny gifs with their disappointment tweet , so i started retweeting some of those , too , buccigross said twelve days later , when alex ovechkin scored with 68 seconds left in regulation to tie game 3 against the tampa bay lightning and force the extra session , buccigross gave the game a name and started using the hashtag bucciovertimechallenge \( tampa bay won the game on vincent lecavalier s overtime goal \) now , becomes an instant trending topic across north america anytime a playoff game , or even a regularseason game , goes into overtime most of the stuff i do happens by accident , buccigross said i'm not that smart , so if i come up with a good idea , there s a very good chance i did n't even mean to do it i had no intention of creating a brand i just wanted to see if it could trend so it threw it out there it caught on , and thousands participated by the time the boston bruins won the stanley cup that year buccigross thought , maybe next year , i 'll do tshirts he put the idea to his followers and decided to go for it he figured he would just send them to the winners , but as soon as he released the picture of a simple white tshirt with the hashtag across the chest , he started getting messages asking how to buy them demand was strong enough that he decided to sell them , with all profits to be donated to hockeyrelated charities at the end of the year that first year , he had no website for his business , so buyers would send cash or checks with their orders in the mail he raised enough money to donate 17 , 000 to charities like defending the blueline , the mario lemieux foundation , you can play , the travis roy foundation and hockey in harlem in its five years , the hashtag bucciovertimechallenge has been used nearly two million times , according to twitter with the introduction of and an expanded product line that now includes hats and tank tops , buccigross has been able to donate nearly 150 , 000 and expects to add at least 50 , 000 to that total this july he has generated enough interest that bauer , a hockey equipment manufacturer , and tiqiq , a ticket sales website , offer prizes for the winners buccigross s social media enterprises have grown beyond the overtime challenge in 2013 , he started using another hashtag , cawlidgehawkey when he did the playbyplay of the ncaa tournament for the first time he added this to his apparel line with a tshirt and hats in various school colors this year , he introduced a shirt with the thinmints hashtag , after the popular girl scout cookies that resemble hockey pucks , a reference he often uses on sportscenter when calling highlights buccigross stores his apparel in a room above his garage , where he personally packages each order and prints the shipping label before taking it to the post office on an average day , he will get up to 10 orders , but there are days , such as when he launches a new product , when he will get more than 100 orders he will spend a whole day getting them out the door with more than 300 , 000 , he knows his reach is large , but he also knows that he is reaching only a small slice of hockey fans still , there were more than 18 , 000 tweets with the hashtag last sunday after game 6 of the series between the islanders and the panthers went into overtime in a first , buccigross announced a winner on sportscenter that night buccigross said he happened to be working when it happened and thought it would be fun to introduce that twist because john tavares s goal in the second overtime  i love that people enjoy playing the game , but the real hysterical part for me is when it s trending , he said with a laugh it s just a silly little game , he added , but as a hockey community , we 've been able to do some really great things because of it i'm just really so shocked by what it s become
it s too late for more moderate leaders to overtake donald trump and ted cruz in 2016 , but the republican party definitely needs reform , readers wrote in response to a column by david brooks  republicans should deeply , broadly and thoroughly clean their teastained house , then , between elections , reconstitute the party of lincoln , teddy roosevelt and eisenhower , wm connelly wrote from warwick , england just now they are a party of naysayers , anarchists and unregulated militias , their actions empowering a feudal sort of aristocracy over traditional american democracy none of the republican candidates are moderate enough to attract some readers , even though they re not wild about democrats , either maybe rinos \( republican in name only \) should just dump the gop and form a new centrist party , sally gschwend wrote from uznach , switzerland as long as the republicans are in bed with the religious right , they are simply unelectable for broad portions of the electorate a few readers said moderate republicans have some good choices this primary season , but the media have ignored the sensible conservatives that should attract those mr brooks described as the silent majority the media latched onto trump and cruz because they are tabloid personalities they ignored the decent , centrist candidates with proven track records of good governance , gail hauptman wrote on facebook john kasich of ohio would be a very good president but most people have no knowledge of him because the media affords him no free publicity , as they have to trump even as mr brooks called on thoughtful state leaders and party activists to offer constructive policy leadership , some readers said it s the state and local realm where republican leadership has sometimes run aground in my state , the republicanled legislature and governor have destroyed urban public schools , poisoned the water in one of our major cities , failed to find a reasonable solution to our decrepit roads , and cut environmental funding so deeply that the proper state agencies cannot contain , much less repair , contaminated sites , steve wrote from grand rapids , mich in sum , local republican leaders have proved incapable of governance yet you want them to help save the national party good luck with that public distrust of democrats , republicans , government institutions and the media have grown to such an extent that people are willing to grasp at what looks like an outside solution , one reader said americans are feeling alienated in our own country , ginchinchili wrote from madison , miss if you re drowning and everyone around you keeps telling you to hang tight , help is on the way , and help never comes , eventually you ll stop listening to those around you and try something different anything different the rise of candidates like mr cruz and mr trump is the republican party s own doing , many readers said and , some argued , calling for a return to the party s historic values may be futile the whole tea party thing was your grassroots movement your southern strategy was an appeal to the grassroots uwteacher wrote from colorado your wholehearted embrace of obstructionism and barely concealed racism for the last seven years is part of your grassroots movement your simple minded embrace of an absolutist stance on guns is part of your grassroots he continued , what you want is a coup by the old ruling class , and the commoners don t seem to be willing to give ground

the city know that they have to do their jobs at a campaign rally , he made light of the rape and murder of an australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in davao , when mr duterte was mayor he

aquino , who was barred by term limits from seeking reelection , has voiced alarm about the prospect of a duterte presidency , saying it was tantamount to a return to the dictatorship of the ferdinand marcos years he had called on other candidates to unite to defeat mr duterte , but none agreed despite strong economic growth and resurgent foreign investment , the philippines still has high levels

2001 as a stapled handout to 800 ohioarea high school coaches has grown into an email blast sent to nearly 30 , 000 coaches in 17 countries , spreading the gospel of xavier with viral efficiency mario mercurio , the team s director of administration , knew the newsletters were catching on when he attended an eighthgrade basketball game coached by a friend a few years ago sitting behind the opposing team s bench , he noticed that team s coach was flipping through plays from the newsletter packet that mercurio had sent out earlier that week i felt bad that he was doing this against my buddy s team , mercurio said recently , but i got a great laugh out of that while most college coaches host summer camps and instructional clinics to share their knowledge , and secrets are rare by the end of a 35game season , it is still uncommon for a program to make some of its most precious proprietary information so public ricardo hill , the coach at walnut hills high school , a successful boys' program in cincinnati , gets newsletters from other programs , but he said none compared to xavier s not as indepth , hill said not even close mack said we 're sort of full disclosure here transparency has not appeared to hinder the musketeers \( 275 \) , who have spent 13 consecutive weeks in the top 10 and whose 26 regularseason wins were the most for the program since 20078 , when the team reached the round of 8 there are many reasons for the success but what might otherwise go unnoticed is that xavier has a rewards system based on offensive rebounds per minute gives players pop quizzes to determine the three teammates you would want in the foxhole beside you and had its staff read patrick lencioni s books on leadership such nuggets do not go unnoticed by the coaches on xavier s email list , which has grown so extensive it requires a thirdparty sender , mailchimp , to deliver all the weekly newsletters each summer hill , a recipient for six years , said that he regularly used plays he picked out of the packets and that he would have his players watch film of xavier s games to analyze how the musketeers ran their sets he said he assumed xavier s opponents did the same they have the confidence in themselves that they do n't care if someone gets it they still have to stop it , hill said mercurio said that about half of the plays included in the packets were actually ones run by the opposing teams i have n't told too many people that , he said , chuckling but the other half are plays that mack and the coaching staff might have noticed watching an nba game on television , or plays that one might see xavier running from time to time mack said he was not particularly concerned that opponents could take advantage of xavier s generosity it s 2016 we 're all open books , mack said it does n't take a whole lot of effort for a program to learn your plays and learn your drills in 2001 , when the newsletter began , things were different mercurio , who started working at xavier as a student in 1999 , said the former assistant john groce was the first to raise the idea of a newsletter to xavier s coach at the time , thad matta the first newsletters were mailed , and only to ohioarea high school coaches , ostensibly to help build relationships for recruiting we wanted something to separate xavier , mercurio said it quietly markets xavier , but it s also a service year by year , the list of recipients grew when sending the packets by mail became too expensive , the enewsletter was born from there , it grew exponentially as soon as we hit send on that first email , different guys would respond saying , hey , this is great , here s 50 email addresses , can you include them \? ' mercurio said at one point , the program was surprised to receive an email from a girls' coach requesting to add names to the list we did n't even know how it broke the gender barrier , mercurio said but she emailed us back a bank of like 4 , 000 women s coaches' emails it just grew and grew and grew the job of compiling the newsletter is handled largely by mercurio , but mack , a former girls' high school coach , still likes dropping off articles and handscribbled notes to include each week anything we feel that some high school coach out there might find some value to , he said

we have seen the rebuild it worked they are the reigning national league champions they have done some things right late friday night , they even brought back yoenis cespedes , the center fielder who helped spark them down the stretch  are we really ready for this \? can mets fans finally trust that the stewards of their team might know a bit about how to run a franchise \? for much of this week , as cespedes seemed bound to join the washington nationals where he would have reunited with daniel murphy the mets were cast in their familiar role as stingy and bumbling maybe those helpful selltheteam billboards would return to citi field you know , the ballpark that just hosted its first world series if you 're a mets fan , you might need to sit down for this it might shock you it might sound totally insane but here goes the mets could actually be doing this right yes , they have earned their fans' skepticism the wilpons' finances were ravaged by the berard l madoff scandal the mets staggered through six losing seasons in a row before 2015 they play in new york and still operate with a midmarket payroll all true so what if the mets were forced into a period of austerity \? maybe general manager sandy alderson has hit upon a better way to build a winner , like the kansas city royals , who just beat them in the world series with a modest budget and persistent dedication to a longterm plan perhaps it really is possible to show financial restraint in a competitive industry often fueled by desperation cespedes can still afford all the luxury cars he wants with a threeyear , 75 million guarantee or a oneyear , 275 million payday if he opts out after this season he gets to soothe his ego by pointing to his average annual salary the mets , most likely , get to dance this routine again next offseason but for another year , anyway , they should be able to protect their farm system by having cespedes now , instead of having to trade for a hitter like him that was part of their plan , it seemed , and logic was always on their side as ruthless as cespedes was in august and september against the dregs of the national league , let s not forget he all but disappeared in october his market value went down , and the mets might have gotten by with an existing gold glover , juan lagares , playing every day in center even the interest from the nationals , who were comfortable with a fiveyear commitment in the range of 100 million , did not scare the mets into the kind of risky longterm deal that has crippled them before a threeyear risk is a lot easier to absorb especially on a highly motivated 30yearold star who could headline next winter s weak freeagent class cespedes did not lift the mets to the playoffs by himself by the end of august , travis d'arnaud , david wright and michael conforto were in the lineup , too , and the bench was a lot better none of that was true at the allstar break but there is much to like about cespedes while he wilted in the postseason against better competition , he did finish third in the majors in total bases , behind colorado s nolan arenado and toronto s josh donaldson he is an electrifying presence you cannot look away when he hits in bringing him back on a reasonable deal , the mets would seem to have a good chance at a rare bigmoney win deals for bobby bonilla , vince coleman , kevin appier \( and his replacement on the payroll , mo vaughn \) , francisco rodriguez , oliver perez , luis castillo and jason bay were expensive mistakes the end of the johan santana contact was rough , too there have been exceptions carlos beltran , carlos delgado and billy wagner and even pedro martinez , for a while helped the mets in 2006 , when they nearly reached the world series but all around baseball , we see the immediate gratification of a splashy contract turn into a crippling , painful slog for the team and their fans and remember , the mets already have one frightening contract on the payroll , for david wright , the stalwart captain with spinal stenosis who is signed through 2020 checkbook championships are relatively rare the yankees have had the highest payroll in the american league in each of the last 12 seasons they have won a lot more games than the mets in that time , but both teams have made just one world series appearance eventually , the mets will have to vault into the upper tier of spenders , especially if they want to keep their vaunted young starting pitchers for a while they should be working hard on extensions for one or more members of their rotation , so they can lock up as much of their prime as possible in the meantime , the mets have found a way to make sensible decisions while fielding a championshipcaliber team they understand the urgency of the moment , without the desperation that leads to longterm pain
for years , the gaston sheehan auction house , familyowned and located in pflugerville , a small city in central texas , has been a trusted place used by federal marshals to sell the many things seized in criminal cases jewelry some impounded vehicles occasionally fine wine and sometimes paintings or antiques but gaston sheehan has rarely tried to compete with large art auction houses so it was a bit unusual when it took in nearly 5 million from the sale last year of 236 works of art , including a few by the likes of warhol and motherwell what made the works distinctive was their lineage all had been seized from the long island home of a dealer who orchestrated one of the largest counterfeit schemes in the history of the art world by her own admission , between 1994 and 2009 , the dealer , , had sold more than 60 fakes that she put forward as the work of modernist masters like rothko and pollock in reality , they were all created by a single forger in queens sold through two dealers who said that they , too , were hoodwinked , the fake paintings brought in 80 million , with 33 million pocketed , the government said , by ms rosales and her confederates despite ms rosales s penchant for fakery , though , federal authorities say they are confident that the art they seized from her home is all genuine , based on their own analysis , reviews of sale records and the assessment of a houston art appraiser during the appraisal , no issues arose that indicated the need for detailed authentication , said lynzey donahue , a spokeswoman for the united states marshals service if any art work had been found to be counterfeit , the usms would not have sold it but rather would have destroyed it indeed , federal officials were confident enough in the legitimacy of the art that they did not think it necessary to advertise that the works had once belonged to ms rosales they rarely make such identifications , officials said , except in cases , like the sale several years ago of bernard l madoff s possessions \( jewelry , furniture , even his socks and slippers \) , where they thought notoriety would increase interest in the case of ms rosales s private collection , ms donahue said a marshals employee spent weeks researching documents from her original purchases provided by her lawyer all of the works had been bought at established houses , including sotheby s and christie s this information was then passed to the appraiser for further verification the appraiser , stephanie reeves , said in an interview that she did not so much authenticate the paintings , drawings and other works as put a value on them the authenticity had largely been established , and thoroughly , she said , by the federal authorities by the time she had come on board they had a sale history , she said there was a lot of paper work backing them up ms reeves , an appraiser since 1999 , said she worked with the auction houses to clear up any gaps she found in the sale histories if i had a lot number but not the sale , or the title , but i did n't have it right , we sorted it out , she added as additional evidence of their typical due diligence , the marshals service has described how exacting it had been before selling some fine wine last year at gaston sheehan the bottles had all belonged to rudy kurniawan , a wellknown wine dealer convicted of fraud in the sale of purportedly rare wine that was actually old wines mixed together the auction of the genuine vintage wines proceeded only after the service smashed hundreds of other bottles that it determined were fake for the rosales trove , gaston sheehan put the art on presale display last march at pfluger hall , an events center downtown directly behind a fire station and about two miles from the auction house s office at least 20 to 30 major dealers came in from different parts of the us , and a smattering of people came in from this area , from dallas , houston , san antonio more than 50 people in all , said jason rzepniewski , an auctioneer at gaston sheehan though the auction house did not mention ms rosales as the prior owner in advertisements or in descriptions of the works provided to prospective buyers , mr rzepniewski said it did disclose that fact if people asked at the preview or if people phoned in bob sheehan , mr rzepniewski s colleague , said he thought many of the prospective buyers knew where the artworks had come from , especially because one of the items on sale was a portrait of ms rosales herself wearing a red hat red hat portrait of glafira 2010 \( it sold for 680 \) the people who came down here from new york , they knew what it was , mr sheehan said citing privacy concerns , the marshals service declined to make available any of the buyers most of the art purchased at the texas sale , which was , was not wildly expensive , and none secured the millions paid for some of ms rosales s faux masterpieces but there were a few noteworthy works , and when the bidding which was conducted online concluded on the first day of the sale in early march last year , 178 of ms rosales s artworks had been sold for 43 million the remaining 58 works were included in three sales over the following few months and brought in another 532 , 000 the highest price paid was for an oil on canvas , le bijou by richard pousettedart , which had been purchased at sotheby s in 2009 , according to the lot description it sold for 325 , 100 an abstract work by ad reinhardt , purchased at phillips auction house in 2008 , sold for 300 , 100 , and a couple of warhols , titled heaven and hell are just one breath away ! , from 1985 , which were bought at sotheby s in 2007 , together fetched 170 , 100 some works bore the mark of knoedler co , the very dealership that had sold most of the nowdocumented fakes knoedler , then new york s oldest gallery , closed in response to the burgeoning scandal in 2011 , and 10 buyers subsequently sued to get their money back five of those cases have been settled out of court one case , a 25 million lawsuit brought by the family of domenico de sole , now the chairman of sotheby s , against knoedler , its director ann freedman and the gallery s corporate owner is scheduled for trial later this month in manhattan mr de sole s lawyers say in court papers that knoedler and ms freedman conspired to sell him a fake mark rothko painting for 83 million in 2004 ms freedman has said that she believed the 43 paintings and drawings that knoedler sold were genuine and that she had bought several herself it is up to the judge in ms rosales s case to decide how the 48 million raised in the texas sale will be apportioned ms rosales , who pleaded guilty in 2013 to several charges , including tax evasion , and is now a cooperating witness , has yet to be sentenced , and any fine and restitution amounts have not been set she is free after posting 25 million bond , and the authorities , led by the united states attorney s office in manhattan , are trying to extradite her boyfriend and his brother from spain to face similar charges related to the fraud bryan c skarlatos , ms rosales s lawyer , said that buyers should have no concerns at all about the authenticity of the art seized from her sands point , ny , home , which has also been sold , records show the marshals plan to sell off more of ms rosales s former possessions later this month , though this time the items are not artworks , but automobiles her nissan and her mercedesbenz the cars are to be sold at a j willner auctions in lodi , nj , on jan 21
el segundo , calif people talked about d'angelo russell of the as if his two main interests in life , having fun and being good at basketball , were diametrically opposite pursuits what russell seems to be making his critics reconsider with every outlandish celebration , every expert pass , every prank at practice and every big shot is whether those two aims could productively coexist for him on an nba court after all it was a harder premise to argue earlier this season russell , the no 2 selection at the draft last summer , got off to a halting start , and coach byron scott publicly questioned his focus and maturity at every opportunity the scolding , the displays of tough love , were so regular that they felt at times like a primary team storyline alongside the impending retirement of kobe bryant yet a corner may have been turned by all accounts , russell has improved his work habits and gained the trust of his teammates and coaches on feb 21 , scott said russell who had been relegated to a bench role after starting his first 20 games would start for the rest of the season russell has responded , averaging 210 points and 48 assists in 10 games since scott s announcement that success , in turn , has afforded him the opportunity to express his personality this job is one of the best jobs in the world , russell said in an interview last week at the lakers' training center you get to do what you want if you save your money right , you can have what you want all your time goes to basketball you do n't have to do anything else at least at my age russell turned 20 on feb 23 he is the league s eighthyoungest player his age is what makes his skill set a dizzying blend of court vision and scoring savvy so exciting it is , too , often the explanation for his impishness and irreverence it is what makes people concerned about his ability to find a balance between playfulness and professionalism it is what compels so many people even larry nance jr , a 23yearold fellow rookie to refer to russell as a kid nance said he still just has the mentality of having fun , whether it is at practice or in a game or in the locker room he s always picking at people , joking , nonstop that s his personality a kid elements of that personality were on display during a recent interview in the lakers' practice gym as russell spoke , he kept making spasmodic moves toward a button on a table that controlled the buzzer he hit it 11 times during a 13minute conversation , making the loud horn blare erratically through the gym i hate talking to media , russell said at one point , biting the skin on his right finger i hate it , man you have to but it s crazy i thought there were only two things in this world that you had to do , and that was die and pay taxes now i know that you 've got to talk to media and i hate it russell had his attention affixed to the practice court , where metta world peace , tarik black , ryan kelly and robert sacre were engaged in a highintensity , fullcourt , oneonone drill russell s eyes darted from side to side three times he interrupted himself midsentence to scream across the gym when world peace stomped to the rim and dunked , russell said , oh , talk to him ! later , world peace dropped his shoulder and muscled to the hoop i'm enjoying the show ! russell said after world peace swooped inside for another dunk , russell shouted , he s really putting on a show , bro ! between outbursts , russell answered some questions he claimed he had been unfazed when scott relayed his criticisms on a daily basis to team beat reporters among other things , scott had said russell was not as mature as chris paul and kyrie irving when they were rookies , hinted that russell was overconfident , and questioned his practice habits such treatment felt jarring to some observers , and stood in contrast to the experiences of other high picks in last year s draft , like kristaps porzingis and karlanthony towns , who found immediate playing time , success and near universal praise to me , it was n't tough love , scott said this week it was more of this is what you 're supposed to do it s discipline this is your job , and this is what you 're supposed to do , and when you 're not doing it , there are consequences to that' russell was asked what effect the public reprimands , and ensuing news stories , had on him at the time none i did n't deal with it , he said i did n't care i did n't care at all i wish i could give you a better answer i did n't deal with it at all world peace , 36 , has become an unlikely mentor for russell \( when i first met him , i was like , i'm scared of this dude , ' russell said \) world peace said russell was less focused and less hungry early in this season in a rapid stream of words , he categorized the directives he has been giving russell to motivate him strewn with profanities , they mostly had to do with staying focused , not accepting disrespect from others , asserting his masculinity , becoming physically stronger and acting like an adult you do n't want to joke to the point where you 're being ineffective , world peace said but he gets it done on the court russell has flourished in recent weeks he has been somewhat liberated in a new offensive set that the coaches installed last month , and has felt more confident to try new things and to make mistakes scott s tone has changed , for the most part , to commendation and praise nance noted that the 6foot5 russell is playing in the context of western conference point guards , who might be the league s most skilled position group in the league russell has the skills to compete at that level a subtle eye for passing , a quick release and smart movement without the ball he has even displayed a burgeoning post game stealing moves and wisdom , he said , from bryant , a master of the craft although the lakers have the secondworst record in the league , russell has played encouragingly , and his antics now come across as endearing he pantomimed full body convulsions when nance dunked in a game against the golden state warriors he sank a halfcourt shot from his back in warmups after recording an assist under the basket against the orlando magic , he appeared to yell something at the basketball as it bounced away two weeks ago , he scored 39 points against the nets after nailing a deep 3pointer late in the game , russell pointed to his wrist and yelled , i got ice in my veins ! russell said in the interview it s cool now every time i make a shot , people are like and he jabbed his index finger toward his forearm it seems , over all , to be a period of good vibes and fun russell , who is from louisville , ky , marveled about los angeles the weather , the views , the food when he was drafted , he said he would buy a dog and fly his friends out constantly to see him he has done both of those things between that and basketball , there is not much else to worry about i knew this lifestyle was good , he said i knew it was cool , like something you could n't really complain about then i got here i 've seen it , witnessed it , and i lived it he paused for emphasis i ca n't complain about anything

wonju , south korea on a farm nestled between hills of chestnut and acorn trees , the aging spitz has had an easy life she follows her owner , gong inyoung , everywhere and he dotes on the dog , whose name is snow white yet on his farm in a valley southeast of seoul , mr gong , 55 , also raises dogs for their meat locked up in steel cages their entire lives , the animals are fed with discarded food mr gong collects from restaurants in nearby towns until they are ready to be sold to the slaughterhouse , 200 to 300 each year referring to the lives of snow white and the dogs raised for meat , he admits , it s the difference between heaven and hell mr gong recently struck a deal with , an animalrights group that has begun a campaign against dog farms in it is offering financial incentives to farmers 2 , 000 to 60 , 000 depending on the number of dogs involved who give up their animals to be adopted as family pets in the united states and elsewhere and switch to other livelihoods , like growing pepper or blueberries since last year , the group says it has shut down five farms mr gong agreed to free his 260 dogs only weeks before many of them were scheduled to die it is difficult to measure the global dogmeat trade , an industry that is deplorably regulated animal rights groups estimate that 30 million dogs , mostly stolen or feral , are killed each year for their meat in asia , in countries such as china and vietnam south korea has industrialized its dogmeat trade each year , more than 17 , 000 dog farms , some of them raising more than 1 , 000 animals each , supply 2 million dogs to meet the country s centuriesold appetite for dog meat , according to government data in mr gong s warehouselike complex of cages , visitors walk into a deafening cacophony huskies , rottweilers , golden retrievers and other breeds bark and paw at the wires retired tosa fighting dogs lie listlessly , some with their snouts badly mangled below the cages , feces piles up , creating an overpowering odor dog traders visit these farms to buy animals when the summer s dogeating season approaches at current rates , an 80pound dog goes for 250 they transport the dogs in cages so crowded they can barely move or even suffocate before they arrive at slaughterhouses for electrocution from the slaughterhouse , wholesale meat dealers supply the carcasses to backalley dogmeat restaurants , where customers , many of them older men , enjoy a hot bowl of vegetables , spicy condiments and shredded dog meat dog is raised and supplied just like cabbage is , mr gong said koreans call the dog dish bosintang , or soup good for your body it became popular when the nation was destitute and meat was scarce koreans are fiercely proud of their culinary history even those who shun dog meat often bristle at foreigners who criticize the practice to them , eating snails is unthinkable and forcefeeding ducks to produce foie gras cruel but as south korea has become wealthier , its tastes and attitudes toward animals has changed keeping pets has become more commonplace television programs on raising companion animals or rescuing abused dogs are popular in parliamentary elections in april , one small party championed animal rights increasingly south koreans , especially the younger generation , find the idea of eating dog meat appalling grandpa strokes my poodle on his lap and says , this is just the right size for a bowl of bosintang , ' said kim yoona , 14 , who recently visited a pet accessory store in seoul with his mother he s joking , but whenever he says that , i snatch my dog from him animal rights groups hope the campaign to free more dogs will boost public awareness about the animals' plight ahead of the winter olympics in south korea in 2018 , when the country will be more sensitive to its international image there is widespread public ignorance about the dogs bred for meat the myth that these dogs are somehow different from normal dogs' has fostered a societal indifference to their suffering , said wendy higgins , a humane society international spokeswoman our experience at all farms has shown that every breed of dog imaginable is found on a dog meat farm , including the pure breeds that are popular as companions , she said mr gong said he had moved into this valley southeast of seoul to breed specialpurpose animals , like guide dogs for the blind , after his music cafe in seoul went bankrupt in the 1990s oversupply and plummeting prices for specialty dogs forced him to sell the animals for meat ten years ago , he began to raise dogs for meat full time i am not particularly proud of eating dog meat , but i do n't think it s something we should be ashamed of either , he said no nation should be criticized for its food andrew plumbly , a humane society international campaigner , said , culture is never an excuse for cruelty when the two sides met recently , they found common ground mr gong saw no longterm future for his trade surveys show that most south koreans now eat chicken , beef or pork instead of dog meat on boknal , days when they traditionally eat food they believe helps beat the summer heat none of the young people mr gong knew , including his son , would touch dog meat he said the image of dog farms was not good on a recent day , mr gong saw off 17 of his dogs , the latest batch to be flown to the united states under the deal with the animal protection group he said he felt better when he saw pictures of the dogs living happily as family pets abroad he said he might try growing mushrooms now i was not ashamed of my way of making a living , but i was not proud of it either , he said , gazing at the dogs still held in cages while they were vaccinated and awaited flights out of south korea no one would do this if he could avoid it
these days many americans live in an alternative political reality , in which the simplest factual assertions are met with anger and derision when i , like many others , noted that job growth since obamacare went into full effect has been the fastest since the 1990s which is simply what the bls data say i got a barrage of mail from people claiming that i m crazy , a liar , etc similarly , but on of course a much bigger scale , a lot of what i m seeing in reactions to the state of the union amounts to the assertion that only an imbecile or a hack could believe obama s talk about the strength of the us economy relative to other advanced countries when that s a simple fact but that involves grading on a curve , one where the average is dragged down by the awful performance of europe what does the economic record look like compared with our own past \? not great , but not too bad unemployment is , of course , more or less back to precrisis levels , but that s in part due to falling labor force participation so what s happening to family incomes \? unfortunately , the census data on those incomes come with a long lag , but sentier research now produces much more timely estimates \( using the cps data \) , which are shown above what they say is that after a severe drop , median real household income is also roughly back to precrisis levels that s not a great result once upon a time we expected median income to be markedly higher at each business cycle peak than it was at the preceding peak but that wasn t true under bush , who also only more or less presided over a return to the previous peak on the eve of the great recession and the bushera economy only got there thanks to a disastrous housing bubble \( as an aside median income didn t rise much under reagan either \) so the obama macroeconomic record isn t just one of stabilizing the economy after a terrifying crisis he has also presided over overall income growth that , assuming we don t have another recession this year , will have been better than his predecessor and meanwhile we ve seen a dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured americans , so while income has been flat , income security is up substantially of course , none of this will make any dent on the conviction of the usual suspects that everything has been a disaster but really , obama has cause for satisfaction though not triumph

trump well , i can say this if the president , and if i were president now , i would certainly want to try and nominate a justice i'm sure that , frankly , i'm absolutely sure that president obama will try and do it i hope that our senate is going to be able mitch , and the entire group , is going to be able to do something about it in times of delay , we could have a diane sykes , or you could have a bill pryor we have some fantastic people but this is a tremendous blow to conservatism it s a tremendous blow , frankly , to our country dickerson so , just to be clear on this , mr trump , you 're ok with the president nominating somebody trump i think he s going to do it whether or i'm ok with it or not i think it s up to mitch mcconnell and everybody else to stop it it s called delay , delay , delay \( applause \) dickerson governor kasich , i want to get your thoughts on this justice scalia was a real believer , obviously , in the strict word of the constitution now , harry reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be , quote , shameful abdication of one of the senate s most essential constitutional responsibilities where do you come down on this \? kasich well , john , first of all , if i were president , we would n't have the divisions in the country we have today i do want to take a second as we reflected on judge scalia , it s amazing it s not even two minutes after the death of judge scalia , nine children here today , their father did n't wake up his wife , sad , but i just wish we had n't run so fast into politics here s my concern about this the country is so divided right now , and now we 're going to see another partisan fight take place i really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody if you were to nominate somebody , let s have him pick somebody that s going to have unanimous approval , and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination i do n't think that s going to happen , and i would like the president just to , for once here , put the country first we 're going to have an election for president very soon , and the people will understand what is at stake in that election and so i believe the president should not move forward , and i think that we ought to let the next president of the united states decide who is going to run that supreme court with a vote by the people of the united \( bell ringing \) kasich states of america \( applause \) dickerson dr carson dr carson , you , like others , put out a statement after the death was announced , and you said the president should delay you 've written a book on the constitution recently what does the constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation \? carson well , the current constitution actually does n't address that particular situation , but the fact of the matter is the supreme court , obviously , is a very important part of our governmental system and when our constitution was put in place , the average age of death was under 50 , and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for supreme court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal obviously , that has changed , and it s something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point but , we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country i looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that justice scalia had died , and they were truly nasty remarks and that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame and we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land but , right now , we 're not going to get healing with president obama that s very united nations clear so , i \( bell ringing \) carson fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time dickerson senator rubio , you 're a \( applause \) dickerson senator rubio , you 're a lawyer quickly , can you address the issue of whether the constitution tells us who has the power to appoint supreme court justices \? and then , also , the senate republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for senate excuse me , for supreme court nominations you seemed open to that what s your feeling on that now \? rubio well , let me first talk about justice scalia his loss is tremendous , and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family he will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic you talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the constitution , who understood that the constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment , but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning justice scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic his dissent , for example , on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work and , of course , his dissent on obergefell as well no 2 , i do not believe the president should appoint someone and it s not unprecedented in fact , it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a supreme court justice and it remind us of this , how important this election is someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the supreme court , and it will begin by filling this vacancy that s there now and we need to put people on the bench that understand that the constitution is not a living and breathing document it is to be interpreted as originally meant dickerson quickly , though , on this question \( applause \) dickerson very quickly , senator , on this specific question , though you were once in favor of dropping the threshold \( crosstalk \) rubio that s not accurate dickerson majority you were never in favor of that \? rubio no , i 've never there has been , for example , today , according to the changes harry reid made , appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority , but not supreme court justices and i think today you see the wisdom of why we do n't want that to change because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the senate , harry reid and barack obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice , like the ones barack obama has imposed on us already dickerson ok thank you , senator governor bush , i would like to ask you , conservatives for a long time have felt like that their republican presidents have picked justices that did n't turn out to be real conservatives bush right dickerson bernie sanders has said he would have a litmus test he would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn citizens united if they can have a litmus test for a nominee , what about you \? would you have a litmus test for a nominee \? and what would it be \? bush not on specific issues , not at all i think the next president if i'm president , i will appoint people i 'll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary the problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the senate because they did n't have a record and the problem is that sometimes we 're surprised the simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record , similar to justice scalia , that is a lover of liberty , that believes in limited government , that consistently applied that kind of philosophy , that did n't try to legislator from the bench , that was respectful of the constitution and then fight and fight , and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes of course , the president , by the way , has every right to nominate supreme court justices i'm an article ii guy in the constitution we 're running for the president of the united states we want a strong executive for sure but in return for that , there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination , and there s no doubt in my mind that barack obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the senate dickerson right , so , senator cruz , the constitution \( applause \) dickerson so , senator cruz , the constitution says the president shall appoint with advice and consent from the senate , just to clear that up so he has the constitutional power but you do n't think he should where do you set that date if you 're president \? does it begin in election year , in december , november , september \? and once you set the date , when you 're president , will you abide by that date \? cruz well , we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming supreme court justices in an election year and let me say , justice scalia dickerson just can i i'm sorry to interrupt , were any appointed in an election year , or is that just there were 80 years \( crosstalk \) cruz eighty years of not confirming for example , lbj nominated abe fortas fortas did not get confirmed he was defeated dickerson but kennedy was confirmed in '88 cruz no , kennedy was confirmed in '87 dickerson he was appointed in '87 cruz he was appointed in dickerson confirmed in '88 that s the question , is it appointing or confirming , what s the difference \? cruz in this case it s both but if i could answer the question dickerson sorry , i just want to get the facts straight for the audience but i apologize \( booing \) \( laughter \) cruz justice scalia was a legal giant he was somebody that i knew for 20 years he was a brilliant man he was faithful to the constitution he changed the arc of american legal history and i 'll tell you , his passing tonight , our prayers are with his family , with his wife , maureen , who he adored , his nine children , his 36 grandkids but it underscores the stakes of this election we are one justice away from a supreme court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states we are one justice away from a supreme court that will reverse the heller decision , one of justice scalia s seminal decisions , that upheld the second amendment right to keep and to bear arms we are one justice away from a supreme court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of americans and the stakes of this election , for this year , for the senate , the senate needs to stand strong and say , we 're not going to give up the us supreme court for a generation by allowing barack obama to make one more liberal appointee and then for the state of south carolina , one of the most important judgments for the men and women of south carolina to make is who on this stage has the background , the principle , the character , the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court \? that will be what i will do if i'm elected president dickerson all right \( applause \) thank you , senator cruz all right , we 're going to move on to national security here , and we are going to i want to read a quote from secretary robert gates , former defense secretary robert gates , who served for eight year under eight presidents and this is what he said about republican candidates , quote , part of the concern that i have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works so , in that spirit , we 're going to work tonight to be more specific mr trump , i want to start with you you have said as president , you 'll get up to speed very quickly you 'll know more quickly as president than any of the experts so , you 've been elected president it s your first day in the situation room what three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world \? trump what we want to do , when we want to do it , and how hard do we want to hit \? because we are going to have to hit very , very hard to knock out isis we 're going to also have to learn who our allies are we have allies , socalled allies , we 're spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people we have no idea who they are in syria do we want to stay that route , or do we want to go and make something with russia \? i hate to say iran , but with russia , because we and the iran deal is one of the worst deals i have ever seen negotiated in my entire life it s a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal but very important \( applause \) not only a disgrace , it s a disgrace and an embarrassment but very important , who are we fighting with \? who are we fighting for \? what are we doing \? we have to rebuild our country but we have to i'm the only one on this stage that said do not go into iraq do not attack iraq nobody else on this stage said that and i said it loud and strong and i was in the private sector i was n't a politician , fortunately but i said it , and i said it loud and clear , you 'll destabilize the middle east that s exactly what happened i also said , by the way , four years ago , three years ago , attack the oil , take the wealth away , attack the oil and keep the oil they did n't listen they just started that a few months ago \( applause \) dickerson senator rubio just 30 seconds on this question , senator rubio are those the questions you would ask \? rubio no i think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of no 1 is , what are we doing in the asiapacific region , where both north korea and china pose threats to the national security of the united states no 2 is , what are we doing in the middle east with the combination of the sunnishia conflict driven by the shia arc that iran is now trying to establish in the middle east , also the growing threat of isis and the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating nato in the european theater , particularly in central europe and in eastern europe , where vladimir putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries , already controls 20 percent of georgia and a significant percentage of ukraine dickerson let me ask you a followup , a full , proper question , then \( applause \) violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability and so , that s just the crises overseas barack obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office we face international health crises , from ebola to zika so , there is a lot of opportunity for crisis , as you have talked about what would you point to in your past to show voters that you 've been in a crisis and that you 've been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you 're president \? rubio well , let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago one of the hardest decisions you 'll ever make in congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict , because you are now putting your name , on behalf of the people of your state , behind a military action , where americans in uniform could lose their life so , in 2014 , barack obama said he would not take military action against assad unless it was authorized by the senate , beginning on the committee of foreign relations , where i am one of its members and it was hard because you looked at the pictures i saw the same images people saw i'm the father of children i saw the images of these little children been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders , and we were angry something had to happen , and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution and then i looked at barack obama s plan barack obama s plan , which john kerry later described as unbelievably small , and i concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation , it would make it actually worse it would allow assad to stand up to the united states of america , survive a strike , stay in power and actually strengthen his grip so it was a difficult decision to make , and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it , and i voted against barack obama s plan to use force , and it was the right decision dickerson dr carson , i want to ask you a question \( applause \) dr carson , you said you 've had more 2 am 2 am phone calls than anybody up on this stage but when those 2 am phone calls came , you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did , all of that learning so if you were to be president , though , you would n't have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 am phone call comes so is n't that a liability \? carson no , it is n't first of all , let me go back to your first question for me it was n't phrased as who gets to nominate supreme court appointees of course that s the president so i know that there are some leftwing media who would try to make hay on that secondly , thank you for including me in the debate two questions already this is great now , as far \( laughter \) \( applause \) as far as those 2 am phone calls are concerned , judgment is what is required and the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very , very difficult and very unique one of the things that i was known for is doing things that have not been done before so no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before that s where judgment comes in and that , i think , is a situation that we 're in right now , a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation , and it comes in very handy in those situations dickerson governor kasich , russia is being credited \( applause \) russia is being credited with bombing usbacked rebels on behalf of assad in aleppo and syria they 've also moved into the crimea , eastern ukraine you 've said you want to punch them in the nose what does that mean \? what are you going to do \? kasich first of all yes first of all , look , we have to make it clear to russia what we expect we do n't have to declare an enemy , rattle a sword or threaten , but we need to make it clear what we expect no 1 is we will arm the folks in ukraine who are fighting for their freedom they deserve it there will be no ifs , ands or buts about it secondly , an attack on nato , trumped up on any excuse of russianspeaking people , either in the nato countries or in finland or sweden , is going to be an attack on us and look , i think we have an opportunity as america to put something really great together again the egyptians , the saudis , the jordanians , the gulf states , they all know they 're at risk we need to look into europe , we look at france , we look at germany and the migrants we look at belgium , we look at britain everybody now is being threatened by radical islam we have an opportunity to lead you know , the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership sometimes they may they may make a remark here or there that we do n't like , but frankly , the world needs us and we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people , those who respect civilization , the rights of women , the rights to protest , to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we 've ever seen dickerson governor \( applause \) governor bush bush yes dickerson you said defeating isis requires defeating assad but would n't that also put us into conflict with russia , a country that supports assad \? so does n't that mean , effectively , assad s there to stay \? bush no , it does n't , and that s the problem the lack of leadership in this country by barack obama , john kerry , hillary clinton , thinking that this is a policy that works , this policy of containment with isis it s a complete , unmitigated disaster and to allow russia now to have influence in syria makes it harder , but we need to destroy isis and dispose of assad to create a stable syria so that the four million refugees are n't a breeding ground for islamic jihadists this is the problem donald trump brought up the fact that he would he 'd want to accommodate russia russia is not taking out isis they 're they 're attacking our our our team , the team that we 've been training and the team that we 've been supporting it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that russia could be a positive partner in this they are on the run they are making every time we step back , they 're on the run the question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do what three things would you do i would restore the military , the sequester needs to be reversed i would have a strategy to destroy isis , and i would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to iran s ambitions , and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for iran to do what it s doing , which is to move towards a nuclear weapon those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do \( bell ringing \) bush in 2017 dickerson mr trump , you 're \( applause \) dickerson mr trump , you were mentioned here you did say that you could get along very well with vladimir putin you did at one point say let russia take care of isis trump \( inaudible \) called me a genius , i like him so far , i have to tell you let me just tell you this jeb is so wrong jeb is absolutely self just so you understand , you know what that is \? that s jeb s special interest and lobbyist talking look , let me just tell you something , jeb jeb is so wrong you got to fight isis first you fight isis first right now you have russia , you have iran , you have them with assad , and you have them with syria you have to knock out isis they 're chopping off heads these are animals you have to knock 'em out you have to knock them off strong you decide what to do after , you ca n't fight two wars at one time if you listen to him , and you listen to some of the folks that i 've been listening to , that s why we 've been in the middle east for 15 years , and we have n't won anything we 've spent 5 trillion dollars in the middle east with thinking like that we 've spent 5 \( bell ringing \) trump lindsey graham , who backs him , had zero on his polls let me just say something we 've spent we 've spent i only tell the truth , lobbyists we 've spent 5 trillion dollars all over the we have to rebuild our country we have to rebuild our infrastructure you listen to that , you 're going to be there for another 15 dickerson all right trump you 'll end up with world war iii dickerson all right , governor bush , please respond bush the very basic fact is that vladimir putin is not going to be an ally of the united states the whole world knows this it s a simple , basic fact \( applause \) bush they 're not taking out they 're not even attempting to take out isis they 're attacking the troops that we 're supporting we need to create a coalition , sunniled coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy isis and bring about stability and you ca n't do that with assad in power he has trump we 're supporting troops bush let me finish trump that we do n't even know who they are dickerson ok , settle bush this is ridiculous trump we 're supporting troops that we do n't even know who they are dickerson all right , mr trump , all right trump we have no idea who they are dickerson gentleman , i think we 're going to leave that there i 've got a question for senator bush this is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows trump oh , yeah , yeah bush this is a guy who thinks that hillary clinton is a great negotiator in iran trump let 44 million in new hampshire , it was practically \( inaudible \) bush this is a man who insults his way to the nomination trump 44 million give me a break \( crosstalk \) dickerson all right , all right , gentlemen , gentlemen , let s leave it there so i can ask a question of senator cruz , who s also running for president \( laughter \) \( applause \) dickerson senator cruz , you talked about the first gulf war as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after isis but there were 700 , 000 ground troops as a part of that , and you do n't have a ground component to your plan why \? cruz well , we need to focus on what the objective is , you know \? your question about the first three questions you would ask in this situation room i think it is a problem if the president , commander in chief , we 've elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on day 1 if you look at the threats facing this country , the single gravest threat , national security threat , is the threat of a nuclear iran that s why i 've pledged on day 1 to rip to shreds this iranian nuclear deal , and anyone that thinks you can negotiate khamenei does not understand the nature of khamenei when it comes to isis , we 've got to have a focused objective one of the problems of barack obama and hillary clinton s foreign policy , and , sadly , too many establishment republicans in washington , is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country they focus on nation building , they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy , and it ends up undermining our national security now , with regard to isis , we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war they 've declared a jihad on us now , what do we need \( bell ringing \) cruz to carry that out we need overwhelming air power , we need to arm the kurds , who can be our boots on the ground , and if ground troops are necessary , then we should employ them , but it should n't be politicians demonstrating political toughness it should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief \( applause \) dickerson very quickly , 30second followup you 've said that , essentially , the kurds would be the american ground forces in there the criticism that experts have on that is that the kurds only can work within their territory if they take larger amounts of territory , you have an ethnic war with the arabs so the kurds ca n't really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs cruz we have kurds in both iraq and syria they are fighting isis right now they are winning victories right now isis is using american military equipment they 've seized in iraq and the obama administration refuses to arm the kurds , the pesh merga , the fighting forces who have been longtime allies we ought to be arming them and letting them fight now , if we need to embed special forces to direct our overwhelming air power , if it is required to use ground troops to defeat isis , we should use them , but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage the first persian gulf war , we launched 1 , 100 air attacks a day today , we 're launching between 15 and 30 we 're not using the tools we have , and it s because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy dickerson all right mr trump \( applause \) dickerson on monday , george w bush will campaign in south carolina for his brother as you 've said tonight , and you 've often said , the iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment in 2008 , in an interview with wolf blitzer , talking about president george w bush s conduct of the war , you said you were surprised that democratic leader nancy pelosi did n't try to impeach him you said , quote which , personally , i think would have been a wonderful thing when you were asked what you meant by that and you said for the war , for the war , he lied , he got us into the war with lies do you still believe president bush should have been impeached \? trump first of all , i have to say , as a businessman , i get along with everybody i have business all over the world \( booing \) trump i know so many of the people in the audience and by the way , i'm a selffunder i do n't have i have my wife and i have my son that s all i have i do n't have this \( applause \) trump so let me just tell you , i get along with everybody , which is my obligation to my company , to myself , et cetera obviously , the war in iraq was a big , fat mistake all right \? now , you can take it any way you want , and it took it took jeb bush , if you remember at the beginning of his announcement , when he announced for president , it took him five days he went back , it was a mistake , it was n't a mistake it took him five days before his people told him what to say , and he ultimately said , it was a mistake the war in iraq , we spent 2 trillion , thousands of lives , we do n't even have it iran has taken over iraq , with the secondlargest oil reserves in the world obviously , it was a mistake dickerson so trump george bush made a mistake we can make mistakes but that one was a beauty we should have never been in iraq we have destabilized the middle east dickerson but so i'm going to so you still think he should be impeached \? bush i think it s my turn , is n't it \? trump you do whatever you want you call it whatever you want i want to tell you they lied they said there were weapons of mass destruction , there were none and they knew there were none there were no weapons of mass destruction \( booing \) dickerson all right ok all right governor bush when a member on the stage s brother gets attacked bush i 've got about five or six dickerson the brother gets to respond bush do i get to do it five or six times or just once , responding to that \? trump i'm being nice bush so here s the deal i'm sick and tired of barack obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had \( applause \) bush and , frankly , i could care less about the insults that donald trump gives to me it s blood sport for him he enjoys it and i'm glad he s happy about it but i am sick and tired trump he spent 22 million in \( crosstalk \) bush i am sick and tired of him going after my family my dad is the greatest man alive in my mind \( applause \) bush and while donald trump was building a reality tv show , my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe and i'm proud of what he did \( applause \) bush and he has had the gall to go after my brother trump the world trade center came down during your brother s reign , remember that \( booing \) bush he has had the gall to go after my mother hold on let me finish he has had the gall to go after my mother trump that s not keeping us safe bush look , i won the lottery when i was born 63 years ago , looked up , and i saw my mom my mom is the strongest woman i know trump she should be running bush this is not about my family or his family this is about the south carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead i'm that person dickerson governor kasich , would you weigh in on \( applause \) dickerson governor kasich , please weigh in kasich i 've got to tell you , this is just crazy , huh \? \( laughter \) kasich this is just nuts , ok \? jeez , oh , man i'm sorry , john dickerson why is it nuts \? talk about it give us your sense of kasich oh , well , listen , i think being in iraq , look , we thought there were weapons of mass destruction colin powell , who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time , said there were weapons there \( applause \) kasich but , but , the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war the sunni , the shia and the kurds , never gotten along in fact , that country was drawn the borders of that country were drawn after world war i by westerners that did n't understand what was happening there the tragedy of it is that we 're still embroiled and , frankly , if there were n't weapons of mass destruction , we should never have gone i do n't believe the united states should involve itself in civil wars civil wars are not in our direct interest , and if you and look , i served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the pentagon after 9 11 by secretary rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced the fact is , is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest we should not be policemen of the world , but when we go , we mean business we 'll do our job we 'll tell our soldiers , our people in the service , take care of your job and then come home once we 've accomplished our goals that s what we need to do dickerson thirty seconds , senator rubio rubio i just want to say , at least on behalf of me and my family , i thank god all the time it was george w bush in the white house on 9 11 and not al gore \( applause \) and you can i think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things , but he kept us safe and not only did he keep us safe , but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction , saddam hussein was in violation of un resolutions , in open violation , and the world would n't do anything about it , and george w bush enforced what the international community refused to do and again , he kept us safe , and i am forever grateful to what he did for this country \( applause \) trump how did he keep us safe when the world trade center the world excuse me i lost hundreds of friends the world trade center came down during the reign of george bush he kept us safe \? that is not safe that is not safe , marco that is not safe rubio the world trade center came down because bill clinton did n't kill osama bin laden when he had the chance to kill him \( applause \) trump and george bush by the way , george bush had the chance , also , and he did n't listen to the advice of his cia dickerson all right , dr carson , we have a cleansing bush can i just dickerson we have a cleansing bush i'm not going to invite donald trump to the rally in charleston on monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak trump i do n't want to go \( laughter \) bush i'm rescinding the invitation i thought you might want to come , but i guess not dickerson all right well , dr carson , i have got a question now for you a moment of pause here you have said , dr carson , that referring to yourself , that people bought into the idea that , quote , a nice person ca n't be tough on terrorists you have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military , which could lead to more civilian casualties so , explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against isis \? carson well , first of all , let me just address the iraq question you know , i was not particularly in favor of us going to war in iraq , primarily because i have studied , you know , the middle east , recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years and when you go in and you remove one of those dictators , unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them , you 're going to have chaos now , fortunately , we were able to stabilize the situation , and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation \( applause \) now , having said that , in terms of the rules of engagement , i was talking about , you know , obama has said , you know , we should n't bomb tankers , you know , coming out of refineries because there may be people in there , or because the environment may be hurt you know , that s just asinine thinking and the fact of the matter is \( applause \) you know , we obviously , you 're not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage you have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not dickerson all right , thank you , dr carson we 're going to have to take a commercial break here thank you to all the candidates we 'll be right back with cbs news s 2016 debate in greenville , south carolina \( applause \) \( commercial break \) dickerson we 're back with the republicans who could be president the topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it we 'll turn the questioning over to kimberley strassel of the wall street journal and major garrett of cbs news kim \? strassel mr trump trump yes strassel you have made a lot of promises and you have also you 're the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements the committee for a responsible federal budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional 12 trillion to 15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 77 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them are you proposing more than you can actually deliver , at least not without big deficits \? trump first of all , the when you say i'm the only candidate , if you listen to the democrats , they want to do many things to social security , and i want to do them on its own merit you listen to them , what they want to do to social security , none of these folks are getting elected , ok , whether they can do it or not i'm going to save social security i'm going to bring jobs back from china i'm going to bring jobs back from mexico and from japan , where they 're all every country throughout the world now vietnam , that s the new one they are taking our jobs they are taking our wealth they are taking our base and you and i have had this discussion we 're going to make our economy strong again i'm lowering taxes we have 25 trillion offshore we have 25 trillion that i think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 25 , they have no idea what they 're doing or saying , as they 've proven very well we 're going to bring that money back you take a look at what happened just this week china bought the chicago stock exchange , china , a chinese company carrier is moving to mexico , air conditioning company not only the ones i talk about all the time , nabisco and ford and they 're all moving out we have an economy that last quarter , gdp did n't grow it was flat we have to make our economy grow again we 're dying this country is dying and our workers are losing their jobs , and you 're going strassel but in terms of trump i'm the only one who is going to save social security , believe me strassel ok but how would you actually do that \? can i ask you \? because right now , social security and medicare trump because you have tremendous waste i 'll tell you strassel they take up twothirds of the federal budget , and they 're growing trump you have tremendous waste , fraud and abuse that we 're taking care of that we 're taking care of it s tremendous we have in social security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old now , you know they do n't exist they do n't exist there s tremendous waste , fraud and abuse , and we 're going to get it but we 're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into social security their whole life and then all of a sudden they 're supposed to get less we 're bringing our jobs back we 're going to make our economy great again garrett senator cruz \( applause \) john mentioned this is about dollars and incentives we also want to talk about economic growth engagements you have proposed a consumption tax , you called it the back tax some analysts compare it more to an attributed valueadded tax from the perspective from economic growth in building wages , how does that work , and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the valueadded tax would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation , not of growth \? cruz well , let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands everyone understands that how that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the obama economy , and we 've got to bring jobs back we 've got to get people back to work we 've got to get wages going up again we 've got to get people moving from parttime work to fulltime work we all agree on that , but it s not going to be solved with magic pixie dust it s just going to be solved by declaring into the air , let there be jobs we actually have to understand the principles that made america great in the first place now , where do you get economic growth \? if you look at cause and effect over our nation s history , every time we lessen the burden of washington on smallbusiness owners , on job creators , we see incredible economic growth you do that through tax reform and regulatory reform my tax plan typical family of four , first 36 , 000 you earn , you pay nothing in taxes no income taxes , no payroll taxes , no nothing above 10 percent , everyone pays the same simple , flat 10 percent income rate it s flat and fair you can fill out your taxes on a postcard , and we abolish the irs if you want to see the postcard , i 've got it on my website garrett now , the question conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time , but especially on this consumption valueadded tax system in europe , where it exists , it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending , and that s why conservatives have long resisted it why and what would you do as president to make sure that does n't happen \? cruz now , major , the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a vat a vat in europe is a sales tax the business flat tax is not a sales tax , it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business one of the things that s critical is we 're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax , with abolishing the obamacare taxes , with abolishing the payroll taxes , which are the biggest taxes paid by most working americans , and with abolishing the death tax , which is cruel and unfair and you asked about economic growth the nonpartisan tax foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 49 million new jobs , it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone s income by double digits that s how you turn the country around , not just hoping and praying for it , but implementing policies that work strassel ok , i have a question , a related tax question senator rubio , you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates , 35 percent some economists say , it would limit its potential to boost economic growth you do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the child tax credit normally , it s liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side s approach \? rubio well , because i'm influencing social policy this is their money this is the money of parents you do n't earn the tax credit unless you 're working that s your money , it does n't belong to government here s what i do n't understand if a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment , they get to write off their taxes but if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children , they do n't \? this makes no sense parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have family formation is the most important thing in society so what my tax plan does , is it does create , especially for working families , an additional child tax credit so that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money , not the government s money , to invest in their children to go to school , to go to a private school , to buy a new backpack let me tell you , if you 're a parent that s struggling , then you know that 50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids i'm going to have a tax plan that is profamily , because the family is the most important institution in society you cannot have a strong country without strong families \( applause \) strassel governor kasich , this on is on size of government in 2013 , you pushed through a medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the republicans in your state total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected , including yourself how can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs \? kasich yeah well , first of all , those numbers , incorrect we are our medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates , and our medicaid program in the second year grew at 25 percent and kimberley , let me tell you , when we expand medicaid and we treat the mentally ill , then they do n't live under a bridge or live in a prison , where they cost 22 , 500 a year when we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons , we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons , and we save 22 , 500 a year guess what else \? they get their lives back and the working poor , they 're now getting health care and you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses , particularly cancer so , what i would tell you is , we 've gone from an 8 billion hole to a 2 billion surplus we 've cut taxes by more than any governor in america by 5 billion we have grown the number of jobs by 400 , 000 privatesector jobs since i 've been governor our credit is strong our pensions are strong and frankly , we leave no one behind economic growth is not an end unto itself we want everyone to rise , and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get and that is exactly the program we 're driving in ohio and , boy , people ought to look at ohio , because it has got a good formula \( applause \) garrett governor bush , a question for you but if you want to jump in , please bush i 'd like can i can i garrett jump in , and then i 've got a question for you bush look , i admire the fact that governor kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health i think that s a high priority all across this country , but expanding obamacare is what we 're talking about , and obamacare s expansion , even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it , is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren we should be fighting obamacare , repealing obamacare , replacing it with something totally different \( applause \) when i was as a private citizen , florida was confronted with the choice the governor was supportive of doing what john did so was the florida senate a committed speaker of the house asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion i did , and it was n't expanded there , just as it was n't expanded in south carolina under governor haley \( crosstalk \) garrett real quickly , jump in , because i have got a question for governor bush , but jump in kasich yeah , let me say a couple of things first of all , when jeb was governor , his first four years as governor , he expand his medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine ok \? it s just a fact now , with obamacare , i 've not only sued the administration , i did not set up an exchange and he knows that i'm not for obamacare , never have been but here s what s interesting about medicaid you know who expanded medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job \? president ronald reagan now , the fact of the matter is , we expanded to get people on their feet , and once they 're on their feet , we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation garrett understood , governor kasich kasich that s what we 're doing in our state bush south carolina south carolinians need to know this , because the cato institute , which grades governors based on their spending , rank him right at the bottom garrett yeah , governor bush , fine bush and governor haley is ranked at the top \( crosstalk \) garrett let me get in a question from bush no he mentioned my name garrett i understand , i understand bush let me finish , though no , no , no hey , wait , wait , wait just hold , major , hold , major hold on , major \( crosstalk \) bush south carolinians want to make that , they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win kasich let me let s tell you garrett i have a question on economic growth , governor bush \( applause \) kasich major major , we ca n't we 've got to look , i have got to correct the record and the fact of the matter is , we went from an 8 billion hole to a 2 billion surplus we 're up 400 , 000 jobs our credit is rock solid and i do n't know garrett a \( inaudible \) , governor kasich look , the bottom line is the people of this of this country and this state want to see everybody rise , and they want to see unity , and i do n't want to get into all this fighting tonight , because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning garrett i know , understood governor bush kasich and i'm going to stay positive about what i want to do from the \( applause \) garrett governor bush , from the perspective , economic growth viewed from this perspective of economic growth , you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers the americans for tax reform , a conservative tax group you 're probably aware of , has said no republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains and many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy , but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency \? bush of course not it wo n't have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income in fact , it s not just hedge fund people , but people that are doing they 're in the business of investing other people s money , getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate they should be paying ordinary income that s their business they 're grateful to be able to make a lot of money , i'm sure and what we do is lower the rates it s not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are , right now , getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn , pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room that s not a problem at all what we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates , to shift power away from washington , dc that s what i did as governor of the state of florida , 19 billion dollars of tax cuts , and it stimulated seven out of the eight years florida led the nation in job growth \( applause \) dickerson dr carson , before we go to break , could you give us your sense of this conversation about either medicaid or economic growth through taxation \? carson well , first of all , let me just mention on the tax issue bencarsoncom , go read about it , because my tax plan has been praised by cato , by wall street journal forbes said it is the best , the most progrowth tax plan , and it s based on real fairness for everybody starts at the 150 percent poverty level , but even the people below that have to pay something , because everybody has to have skin in the game , and the millions of people ca n't , you know , talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game and it deals with corporate tax rate , and makes it the same as everybody else \( bell ringing \) carson everybody pays exactly the same dickerson doctor carson and , as far as medicare and medicaid , my main goal is to get rid of obamacare and put the care back in the hands of \( inaudible \) garrett dr carson dickerson dr carson , i'm sorry , we have to go to a commercial the free market wants what it wants back soon with the 2016 republican debate in greenville , south carolina \( commercial break \) dickerson welcome back we 'll begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the republican campaign , immigration but before i turn it back to major garrett and kim strassel , i have one question for mr trump mr trump , in the republican national committee s spanishlanguage response to the state of the union , congressman diazbalart said , quote , it s essential that we find a legislative solution , talking about immigration , to offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows what does that mean to you , a humane solution to those who live in the shadows \? trump i want everybody taken care of , but we have to take care of our people in this country we 're not taking care of our people we have no border we have no control people are flooding across we ca n't have it we either have a border , and i'm very strongly i'm not proposing i will build a wall i will build a wall remember this , the wall will be paid for by mexico we are not being treated right \( applause \) we are not being treated properly if we do n't have borders , if we do n't have strength , we do n't have a country people are flowing across we have to take care of our people believe me garrett senator rubio \( applause \) for the purposes of the lines lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform , define amnesty rubio well , first of all , i think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that i 've never supported that i do not support that i think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws what i think is clear about this issue to begin with is we 're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first , illegal immigration is brought under control you go back to 1986 , when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border it did n't happen , and as a result , people have lost trust in the federal government it is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law , but actually prove to people that it s working they want to see the wall built they want to see the additional border agents they want to see everify they want to see an entryexit tracking system forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas and only after all of that is in place , then we 'll see what the american people are willing to support on this issue i think the american people will be very reasonable , but responsible , about how you handle someone who has been here a long time , who can pass a background check , who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit but you ca n't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all \( applause \) strassel senator cruz senator cruz , you have promised to deport illegal aliens you have also promised to reverse president obama s executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children as president , you would have the names and addresses of the some 800 , 000 of those that have registered under that action now , you have said that in this country , we should n't go door to door , look for illegals , but in this case you would have a list would you use it \? cruz well , you know , your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage you know , in a republican primary , everyone talks tough on immigration everyone is against illegal immigration in a republican primary but as voters , we 've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they do n't walk the walk there are sharp differences on amnesty if you look at the folks on this stage , when harry reid and chuck schumer and establishment republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan , i stood with jeff sessions and steve king and the american people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan \( applause \) strassel so would you would you use the addresses \? cruz now , that moment strassel would you pick them up \? cruz that moment was what reagan would call a time for choosing when it comes to deciding which side of the line you 're on , the rubioschumer amnesty plan \( booing \) cruz apparently supported by the donor class , which is why washington supported it the rubioschumer amnesty plan passed the senate , and it was on the verge of passing the house house leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the democrats overruling most of the republicans and the question for anyone on illegal immigration is , where were you in that fight \? where did you stand \? you are right there is a difference between senator rubio and me on this question \( crosstalk \) strassel senator rubio , your reply rubio we 're going to have to do this again , ok \? when that issue was being debated , ted cruz , at a committee hearing , very passionately said , i want immigration reform to pass , i want people to be able to come out of the shadows and he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here not only that , he proposed doubling the number of green cards he proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers now his position is different now he is a passionate opponent of all those things so he either was n't telling the truth then or he is n't telling the truth now , but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true \( applause \) cruz major , i get a response to that garrett very quickly , senator cruz strassel all right senator cruz your response , senator cruz cruz you know , the lines are very , very clear marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally i oppose citizenship marco stood on the debate stage and said that but i would note not only that marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty in the state of florida , as speaker of the house , he supported instate tuition for illegal immigrants in addition to that , marco went on univision in spanish and said he would not rescind president obama s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office i have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action , including that one \( mix of applause and booing \) cruz and on the question \( crosstalk \) rubio well , first of all , i do n't know how he knows what i said on univision , because he does n't speak spanish and second of all , the other point that i would make cruz \( speaking spanish \) rubio look , this is a disturbing pattern now , because for a number of weeks now , ted cruz has just been telling lies he lied about ben carson in iowa \( applause \) rubio he lies about planned parenthood he lies about marriage he s lying about all sorts of things and now he makes things up the bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it and they see the truth behind all these issues and here is the truth , ted cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country cruz that is simply \( crosstalk \) rubio and only now does he say \( crosstalk \) cruz that is absolutely false what he said is knowingly false and i would note , if you want to assess if you want to assess rubio well , we 'll put on our website , marcorubiocom we 're going to \( crosstalk \) cruz who is telling the truth \( crosstalk \) cruz if you want to assess who is telling the truth \( applause \) cruz then you should look to jeff sessions , who said , without ted cruz the rubioschumer amnesty bill would have passed , and ted was responsible you should look to rush limbaugh and mark levin , that said \( crosstalk \) garrett governor bush , i want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect , if you will bush thank you garrett you have said illegal immigrants , quote , broke the law , but it s not a felony , still quoting you , it s an act of love , it s an act of commitment to your family mr trump has , as you are well aware , denounced that statement over and over do you still believe it \? what does that mean to you \? and how does that inform your approach to immigration reform \? bush great question i feel like i have to get into my inner chris christie , and point out that the reason why i should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that did n't pass \( applause \) bush this is this is the problem we need a leader to fix this problem and i have a detailed plan to do just that , including controlling the border , dealing with the visa overstayers , making sure that we have a path to legal status , not to citizenship , for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine , learn english , do n't commit crimes , work and pay taxes that is the better approach garrett fundamentally , do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue \? bush the great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice they want to come to provide for their families that does n't mean it s right that does n't mean it s right we should pick who comes to our country we should control our border coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally but the motivation , they 're not all rapists , as youknowwho said they 're not that these are people that are coming to provide for their families and we should show a little more respect for the fact that they 're struggling it does n't mean we should n't be controlling the border that s exactly what we should be doing garrett mr trump trump look \( applause \) trump when i announced that i was running for president on june 16th , illegal immigration was n't even a subject if i did n't bring it up , we would n't even be talking now , i do n't often agree with marco , and i do n't often agree with ted , but i can in this case the weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is jeb bush they come out of an act of love , whether you like it or not he is so weak on illegal immigration it s laughable , and everybody knows it bush so , you know \( bell ringing \) bush this is the standard operating procedure , to disparage me that s fine trump spend a little more money on the commercials bush but , if you want to talk about weakness , you want to talk about weakness \? it s weak to disparage women \( applause \) trump \( inaudible \) i do n't know what you 're talking about bush it s weak to denigrate the disabled and , it s really weak to call john mccain a loser because he was a trump i never called him i do n't call him bush that is outrageous the guy s an american hero \( applause \) trump he also said about language bush the simple fact is i 've also laid out my plans on \( inaudible \) immigration trump language two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody , and that s fine nobody reports that he gets up and says that , and then he tells me , oh , my language was a little bit rough strassel ok trump my language give me a break garrett governor kasich , here in south carolina earlier this week , you said the idea , the concept of deporting 11 million undocumented workers bush \( inaudible \) just , for the record \( inaudible \) make sure my mother s listening , if she s watching the debate i did n't say that i was going to moon somebody trump you did say it , you did say it been reported in 10 different news garrett we will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later , i assure you governor kasich , you said earlier this week in south carolina , the concept , the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts why is it you are so opposed to that idea \? senator cruz has said it s a simple application of existing law the application of that is not inhumane , it is just why do you disagree \? kasich before i get to that , this is the ninth or 10th debate what i 've been watching here , this back and forth , and these attacks , some of them are personal i think we 're fixing to lose the election to hillary clinton if we do n't stop this \( applause \) kasich i mean , the fact is you know what \? i would suggest , why do n't we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we 're for , and let s sell that , and the republican party will be stronger as a result garrett what are you for on immigration \? kasich \( off mike \) \( inaudible \) first of all , i'm for sealing the border , ok \? and then i'm for a guest worker program people can come in , work and go back home we have n't closed the border because special interests , i believe , blocked it then , we have 11 and a half million people here if they have not committed a crime since they 've been here , make them pay a fine and some back taxes , and give them a path to legalization , never to citizenship it is not going to happen that we 're going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes i 'll tell you this within the first hundred days , i will send a plan like this to the congress of the united states , and if i'm president , i 'll bet you dollar to doughnuts right now , it will pass \( bell ringing \) that is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country , in my judgment , will support , and so will the bulk of the congress of the united states \( applause \) strassel moving subjects dr carson , this week morgan stanley agreed to pay a 32 billion fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis you have a lot of democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives , so two questions should financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis , and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that \? carson well , first of all , please go to my website , bencarsoncom , and read my immigration policy , ok \? because it actually makes sense now , the as far as these fines are concerned , you know \? here s the big problem we 've got all these government regulators , and all they 're doing is running around looking for people to fine and we 've got 645 different federal agencies and subagencies way , way too many , and they do n't have anything else to do i think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability , economic viability of our society now , that does n't mean there are n't some people out there who are doing bad things but i'm not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden you know , when you consider how much regulations cost us each year , you know \? 2 trillion dollars per family , 24 , 000 per family , that happens to be the same level as the poverty level \( bell ringing \) carson for a family of four if you want to get rid of poverty , get rid of all the regulations dickerson senator cruz , i have a question for you speaker paul ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty arthur brooks , who is the president of the american enterprise institute , says , quote , if we are not warriors for the poor every day , free enterprise has no matter how you have been , in your campaign , a warrior for the poor \? cruz i think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the obama economy had been the most vulnerable it s been young people it s been hispanics it s been africanamericans it s been single moms we have the lowest percentage of americans working today in any year since 1977 and the sad reality is big government , massive taxes , massive regulation , does n't work what we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth , let small businesses are the heart of the economy twothirds of all new jobs come from small businesses if we want to lift people out of poverty you know , i think of these issues from the perspective of my dad my dad fled cuba in 1957 he was just 18 he could n't speak english he had nothing he had 100 in his underwear and he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school today , my dad is a pastor he travels the country preaching the gospel now , i think about all of these issues how would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes \? if we had obamacare in place right now , the odds are very high my father would have been laid off , because it s teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off if he did n't get laid off , the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28 , 29 hours a week we need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs , and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work garrett mr trump mr trump \( applause \) i was with you in pendleton , south carolina , earlier this week at the rodeo arena it was a bit chilly there you promised the crowd , and they rose to their feet , that if ford or a company like were to move a factory to mexico , you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold trump or a tax garrett right so my question is , based on your understanding of the presidency , where do you derive that power \? would you need the consent of congress to go along \? and do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole and or threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the us economy \? trump i would build consensus with congress , and congress would agree with me i 'll give you an example , because i do n't like the idea of using executive orders like our president it is a disaster what he s doing i would build consensus , but consensus means you have to work hard you have to cajole you have to get them into the oval office and get them all together , and you have to make deals let me just tell you , i mentioned before , china big chinese company bought the chicago exchange kerry is moving and if you saw the people , because they have a video of the announcement that carrier is moving to mexico , ok \? well , i 'll tell you what i would go right now to carrier and i would say i am going to work awfully hard you 're going to make air conditioners now in mexico you 're going to get all of these 1 , 400 people that are being laid off they 're laid off they were crying they were it was a very sad situation you 're going to go to mexico you 're going to make air conditioners in mexico , you 're going to put them across our border with no tax i'm going to tell them right now , i am going to get consensus from congress and we 're going to tax you when those air conditioners come so stay where you are or build in the united states , because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers \( applause \) dickerson all right mr trump , thank you so much we 're going to take a break for a moment we 'll be back in a moment with the cbs news republican debate \( commercial break \) dickerson we 're back now from greenville , south carolina , with the candidates for the republican presidential nomination mr trump , i have a question for you presidents have to , on the one hand , be firm , but also be flexible you have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things , from abortion to hillary clinton but you have said , rightly , that it s just like ronald reagan , who changed his mind on things but at the same time , you 're criticizing senator cruz for what you say is a change on immigration he disputes that , of course so , why is your change of opinion make you like reagan , and when he changes his opinion , it s a huge character flaw \? \( laughter \) trump john , in life you have flexibility you do have flexibility when you 're fighting wars , you 're going one way , you have a plan it s a beautiful plan it ca n't lose the enemy makes a change , and all of a sudden you have to change you have to have flexibility in ronald reagan , though , in terms of what we 're talking about , was the great example he was a somewhat liberal democrat who became a somewhat , pretty strong conservative he became most importantly , he became a great president he made many of the changes that i 've made i mean , i 've seen as i grew up , i 've seen , and as i get older and wiser , and i feel that i am a conservative now , i also feel i'm a commonsense conservative , because some of the views i do n't agree with and i think a lot of people agree with me , obviously , based on what s happening dickerson which conservative idea do n't you agree with \? trump well , i think these people always hit me with eminent domain , and frankly , i'm not in love with eminent domain but eminent domain is something you need very strongly when jeb had said , you used eminent domain privately for a parking lot it was n't for a parking lot the state of new jersey too bad chris christie is not here , he could tell you the state of new jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people i mean , it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development now , just so you understand , i got hit very hard it s private , it s private eminent domain you understand that they took over a stadium in texas , and they used private eminent domain , but he just found that out after he made the charge dickerson all right governor bush , i think by they , he is referring to your brother , these on the hook for your brother trump yeah well , jeb would n't have known about it bush so , there so , there is all sorts of intrigue about where i disagree with my brother , there would be one right there you should not use eminent domain for private purposes a baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo \( laughter \) trump you should n't have used it then , jeb dickerson but that was his brother bush it s very different transmission lines , pipe lines , bridges and highways all of that is proper use of imminent domain not to take an elderly woman s home to build a parking lot so that highrollers can come from new york city to build casinos in atlantic city strassel senator cruz , you were mentioned in the mix here , your response \? cruz you know , flexibility is a good thing , but it should n't you should n't be flexible on core principles i like donald , he is an amazing entertainer , but his policies for most of his life trump thank you very much , i appreciate it cruz for most of his life , his policies have been very , very liberal for most of his life , he has described himself as very pro choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion right now , today , as a candidate , he supports federal taxpayer funding for planned parenthood i disagree with him on that that s a matter of principle , and i 'll tell you trump you probably are worse than jeb bush you are single biggest liar this guy s lied let me just tell you , this guy lied about ben carson when he took votes away from ben carson in iowa , and he just continues today , we had robocalls saying , donald trump is not going to run in south carolina , where i'm leading by a lot i'm not going to vote for ted cruz this is the same thing he did to ben carson this guy will say anything , nasty guy now i know why he does n't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues cruz don , i need to go on trump he s a nasty guy cruz i will say , it is fairly remarkable to see donald defending ben after he called , pathological , and compared him to a child molester both of which were offensive and wrong but let me say this you notice donald did n't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for planned parenthood and donald has this weird pattern , when you point to his own record , he screams , liar , liar , liar you want to go trump where did i support it \?

what we just saw \? i do n't think so and you know , i when i got into this race , i decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs washington , dc , and my first inclination was to run away , but i did n't do it because i'm thinking about our children and the fact that we are the united states of america and anybody up here is going to be much better than what s going to come on the other side and what happened tonight with with justice scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election , and we cannot be tearing each other down \( applause \) dickerson dr carson , i let me ask you a different question when you were you were the first one , really , to talk about political correctness everybody now talks about it , but that was really what sparked your your rise politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make , just always selling happy , nice things so in the in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect , tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect \? carson well , first of all , i'm not a politician , so i'm never going to become a politician but here s what here s what people need to know people need to know that free college is not it s a nonstarter you know , you have to look at our economic situation we 're on the verge of economic collapse and , you know , we 're it s not just the 19 trillion , but it s also the 200 trillion in unfunded liabilities what we need to think about is , what does that do to the average person \? when we have a debt of that nature , it causes the fed to change their policy , it causes the central bank to keep the the rates low , and who does does that affect \? mr average , who used to go to the bank every friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg , that s gone that part of the american dream is gone all of these things are disappearing , and bernie sanders and people like hillary clinton blame it on the rich they say those evil rich people , if we take their money we can solve the problem it s not the evil rich people it s the irresponsible , evil government \( applause \) dickerson governor kasich governor kasich , you 've been described as the democrats' favorite republican you talked about in new hampshire , democrats would come up to you and say , i hope you win why will that help you win a republican nomination \? kasich you know , john , i think all people are the same look , i did 106 town halls , and i 've been doing them left and right here in south carolina the first thing we have to do is grow the economy , and i know the formula because i was chairman in washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs , and the same that we 've been able to do in ohio you need commonsense regulations so small business can flourish , you need lower taxes both on business and individuals , and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues and when you have that formula , combined with work force that s trained , you can explode the economy and create many jobs i have done it twice , and i want to go back to washington and do it again john , the thing is , is i think that there are people now , these bluecollar democrats my dad was a bluecollar democrat the democratic party has left them when they 're arguing about being socialists , they 've left they have lost those bluecollar democrats and you know what i think they get out of me is my sense of what they get out of me , and it s embarrassment about campaigns , you brag about yourself but i think i'm a uniter , i think people sense it i think they know i have the experience , and that i'm a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise and i 'll tell you , i love these bluecollar democrats , because they 're going to vote for us come next fall , promise you that \( applause \) dickerson mr trump , let me ask you a question presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you 're wrong you do n't necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you 're wrong a lot can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said , donald trump , you 're wrong , and you listened to them \?

bush i think the dysfunction in washington is really dangerous , that s what i think and we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems , someone who does n't cut and run someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes someone who does n't disparage people someone that does n't brag , for example , that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great , because he could use the legal system someone trump that s not let me respond that s another lie i never went bankrupt ! \( crosstalk \) dickerson hold on , mr trump \( crosstalk \) trump no , but it s another lie dickerson hold on , mr trump trump no , but it s another lie this guy does n't know what he s talking about just a lie bush we need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems and right now , both republicans and democrats in washington do n't get it people are struggling 63 percent of americans ca n't make a 500 car payment most americans are living paycheck to paycheck and we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy , reforming the things that are broken and i'm that person dickerson ok , mr trump , your response \( applause \) trump let me just tell you jeb goes around saying , just like the biggest business leaders in this country , i 've used the laws of the land to chapter i bought a company , i threw it immediately into a chapter , i made a great deal i uses the laws to my benefit , because i run a company bush yeah trump excuse me , jeb ! bush yeah trump i never went bankrupt , never now but you do n't want to say that now , let me just say , i 've used it , just like the biggest leaders in the country let me tell you something florida florida , he put so much debt on florida you know , we keep saying he s a wonderful governor , wonderful governor he put so much debt on florida , and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office , florida crashed i happened to be there it s my second home florida crashed he did n't do a good job as governor bush here we go trump and you have n't excuse me , you have n't heard that you listen to the good record in florida you take a look at what happened , as soon as that year ended he got out , florida crashed too much debt he loaded it up with debt , and his spending went through the roof \( crosstalk \) trump by the way dickerson the bells are ringing , sir trump he was not a good governor bush here s the record here s the record we led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years when i left there was 9 billion of reserves , 35 percent of general revenue no state came close to that trump take a look at your numbers bush when i during my time , we were one of the two states to go to aaa bond rating we did n't go bankrupt like trump did and call it success when people are laid off , when vendors do n't get paid that s not success what we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income personal income during my time went up by 44 percent trump florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office bush the government grew by trump went right down because of what he did to it bush half of that dickerson all right thank you senator rubio , i want to ask you a 30second question , no president can rubio thirty seconds dickerson no well , i 'll ask the question , you do what you want rubio i speak fast \( laughter \) dickerson no president can know everything , right \?

how did you what did it take to ensure that the american people , despite all of the difficulties of the time you know , you look back at that time , the american military was in decline our standing in the world was in decline we had hostages being held in iran our economy was in bad shape the american people were scared about the future they were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit and yet somehow ronald reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism and he turned america around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership i wish ronald reagan was still around this country needs someone just like that and if our next president is even half the president ronald reagan was , america is going to be greater than it has ever been \( applause \) dickerson all right that s going to have to be it there , senator rubio we have got to go to a break we will be right back with the cbs news republican debate in greenville , south carolina \( commercial break \) dickerson time now for closing statements you will each have one minute , and we 'll begin with governor kasich kasich well , i want to thank the people of south carolina you 've been fantastic and look , what i want you to know is i'm going to send a lot of power , money and influence back to where we all live but as i 've traveled around south carolina , i 've noticed something you know , it s that people have a sense that you 're not going to wait on a president you know , when i was a kid , we did n't wait on presidents to come to that little bluecollar town and fix things you know , the lord made all of us special the lord wants us to be connected i believe we 're part of a very big mosaic and i 'll send the power back and whoever gets elected president here , hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and social security and the border but the spirit of the america rests in all of us it s in our guts it s taking care of our children it s taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband it s fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs you see , i think what the lord wants is for to us engage , and in america , the spirit of america does n't come from the top down the spirit of america rests in us and i want to call on everyone in america to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone thank you all very much and i hope i can have your vote in south carolina \( applause \) dickerson dr carson dr carson , you 're next carson this is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents some people say it s the new normal , but there s nothing normal about it in an exceptional american i , like you , am a member of we , the people , and we know that our country is heading off the cliff joseph stalin said if you want to bring america down you , have to undermine three things our spiritual life , our patriotism and our morality we , the people , can stop that decline , starting right here in south carolina if all the people who say , i love ben carson and his policies , but he ca n't win , vote for me , not only can we win , but we can turn this thing around you know , we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we 're supposed to pick and how we 're supposed to live we , the people , are the only people who will determine that and if you elect me as your next president , i promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one thank you \( applause \) dickerson governor governor bush bush thank you all very much the next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge that s almost certain it could be a pandemic , a major natural disaster or an attack on our country the question for south carolinians and americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the oval office \? because that s the question it s not the things we 're talking about today it s the great challenge that may happen i believe i will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the united states i will unite this country around common purposes because i did it as governor of the state of florida when i was governor , we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months our state was on its back we recovered far faster than what people thought because we led we want to challenge rather than cutting and running that s what we need in washington , dc we need someone with a servant s heart that has a backbone , that is n't going to focus on polls and focus groups the focus will be on the american people to keep them safe and secure i ask for your vote next saturday \( applause \) garrett thank you , governor strassel and now , marco rubio rubio thank you , and thank you for watching tonight this is a difficult time in our country our economy s flat , it s not creating the jobs it once did , and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck our culture s in trouble wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong all the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault and around the world , america s reputation is in decline our allies do n't trust us , our adversaries do n't fear us , iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video these are difficult times , but 2016 can be a turning point that s why i'm running for president , and that s why i'm here today to ask you for your vote if you elect me president , we are going to reembrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them we are going to be a country that says that life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws we 're going to be a country that says that marriage is between one man and one woman we are going to be a country that says , the constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president , they come from our creator we are going to be loyal to our allies like israel , not enemies like iran and we will rebuild the us military so no one will there test it vote for me i will unify this party i will grow it we will win this election , and we will make the 21st century a new american century \( applause \) dickerson senator cruz \?

st petersburg , russia with ice hockey s top federations gathered in russia for the men s world championship , some people here are looking ahead two years that the would no longer cover the costs of insurance and transportation for nhl players to participate in the olympics , starting with the 2018 pyeongchang games in south korea , the league s continued olympic participation was put in jeopardy everyone would like to see the nhl players participate , said matti nurminen , general director of the finnish ice hockey association everyone wants to see a tournament with the best on best , that s for sure , but the ioc sees things differently now compared to previous olympics , and that has caused some challenges for our sport there s a bill to pay , and now they 're trying to find the money to cover it the travel and accommodation expenses are expected to be negotiated with sponsors in cooperation with the ioc and national olympic committees , but the real sticking point is insurance premiums could climb to 10 million for the 2014 sochi games in russia , the bill was 7 million this issue goes beyond health insurance it is about insuring the future income of a player and his value as an asset to the team should a longterm injury occur in the same way a private owner lends art to a museum and asks it to pay an insurance premium to display a painting , the nhl and its team owners are asking the ioc to pay the insurance premiums on the assets they are lending out for the international showcase it is not an abstract problem at the 2014 sochi games , the islanders' john tavares tore a knee ligament while playing for canada and  with the ioc no longer willing to cover those premiums and the international ice hockey federation unable to cover the cost by itself , the governing bodies are reaching out to all parties involved to find a resolution the iihf has asked the national associations and the national olympic committees if they are willing to cover that , but from our perspective , that responsibility rests on who is organizing the event and who is collecting all the revenues from the event , nurminen said in our opinion , the same party should pay the bills , and that s not us all the countries replied to the iihf that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel or any of the other expenses that are related to having the nhl players participate in pyeongchang at least 150 nhl players are expected to be selected for their countries' olympic teams , requiring the league to shut down for the duration of the games european leagues plan to make their players available , but none will have to shut down for three weeks , as the nhl will discussions among the nhl , the olympic committee and the ice hockey federation are continuing , with an unofficial deadline set for the end of this year , when the nhl begins planning for the 201718 season the agreement between the nhl and the olympic committee for the sochi games did not come until seven months before the event , but the expectation was that a deal would be completed because of how important hockey is to russia that is not the case with south korea and the national federations , especially those in canada and the united states , need time to develop a plan b if the nhl decides not to make its players available before 1998 , the canadian and united states olympic teams were composed of former college and junior hockey players , while the european squads consisted of players from professional leagues because of the disparity , the level of talent missing without nhl players , and the success of the olympic basketball tournament with the nba s participation , the ioc struck a deal with the nhl to ensure the inclusion of its players and a competition among the world s best players tom renney , now the president and chief executive of hockey canada , was the coach for the canadian team in the last nonnhl olympics , in lillehammer , norway , in 1994 it s possible to find success without nhl players , but it requires a lot more hard work , and we 'd like to know as soon as possible if we need to do it that way again so we can get started , he said jim johannson , the assistant executive director for hockey operations at usa hockey , said we like to talk about the growing depth of the american talent pool , and if s do n't participate , we 'll find out pretty quick just how much depth we have if the nhl declines to shut down for nearly three weeks to allow players to participate in the olympics , the impact will be farreaching the lack of nhlers at the olympics would of course impact the commercial value for the games for tv broadcasters , as well as for sponsors and spectators around the world , said ren fasel , president of the iihf since 1994 without a doubt , it would also impact the iihf s efforts to develop the game worldwide the olympic platform offers us a wide range of opportunities to present our game to a global audience we have 74 member national associations within the iihf , and so many of these players picked up sticks for the first time after watching ice hockey at the olympics the nhl has no tangible stake in the olympics not only does the league have to shut down its season and risk the health of its players , it earns no revenue directly from the event with all the issues related to going to the olympics and the balancing act it is and what it does to the season , i'm not sure that there would be a lot of appetite for us , on top of that , to have to pay for the privilege , gary bettman , the nhl s commissioner , said last month we do n't make money going to the olympics in fact , we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the ioc has n't even let us join in promoting our participation in the olympics that is why the nhl and the nhl players' association brought back the , which will be held in toronto in september and takes place every four years while the national federations welcome the opportunity for another men s international tournament featuring nhl players , they say it cannot replace the olympics for now , one thing is certain the national federations are unwilling to take money away from their player development programs to pay the bill as a federation , we 're stuck between a rock and a hard place , renney said we know that every elite hockey player wants the opportunity to compete for a gold medal at the olympics we know that it is very important to them , and we want to help them achieve that in any way we can but most hockey players do n't even come close to that level , and if we take money away from our development programs to cover that cost , how many kids wo n't have the opportunity to play hockey because we do n't have the money to offer them free equipment to try it out \?
sydney , australia the authorities said thursday that two pieces of debris found in were highly likely to have come from malaysia airlines flight 370 , which has been missing for more than two years a third piece of debris , found in and bearing part of the logo from the engine maker rollsroyce , has yet to be analyzed darren chester , the australian infrastructure and transport minister , said in a statement that an investigation team from malaysia had found that both pieces of debris were consistent with panels from a malaysia airlines boeing 777 aircraft the analysis has concluded the debris is almost certainly from mh370 , mr chester said martin dolan , a commissioner at s transport safety bureau , said there were no serial numbers on the two parts but we are very certain these are from mh370 , he said in a telephone interview he said drift modeling by australian scientists had indicated that ocean currents were likely to carry debris from the southern indian ocean , where the plane is believed to have crashed , to the coasts of mozambique and r union island in july , beachcombers found a wing part known as a flaperon on r union , a french island east of madagascar it was later confirmed to be from flight 370 in february , blaine gibson , an american lawyer and adventurer , discovered on mozambique s coast , a triangular piece of fiberglass composite mr dolan said a family from south africa , on a sailing vacation , found the other piece , and that they had taken it home to durban before realizing it could be a part of flight 370 , which disappeared on march 8 , 2014 , with 239 people on board the plane vanished en route to beijing from kuala lumpur , malaysia , and is believed to have veered off course , flown south for several hours and crashed into the southern indian ocean four search vessels have been scouring the seabed off the remote southwestern coast of australia for wreckage from the plane , but none has yet been found there mr dolan said that the debris from mozambique would be analyzed in an attempt to learn more about the plane s last minutes , but that any new information was unlikely to affect the ongoing search in the southern indian ocean a more detailed report on the debris will be prepared in consultation with the malaysian authorities , he said

, the mercurial actor known equally well for box office hits and bizarre performance art , took up a 24hour residence on friday in a tiny , makeshift performance space at one of the most prestigious universities in the world , where he said he would chat with any visitor willing to brave the long lines and the cramped quarters the university \? oxford the space \? an elevator the student union had invited mr labeouf to give a talk on saturday at the university in england , and the performance piece , branded with the hashtag elevate and broadcast online via a , was part of his response mr labeouf said that he would still give a talk , but that he would also be on display inside the elevator for the 12 hours before and after it \( aside from bathroom breaks \) the performance piece was meant to share the soapbox with the lessfamous people around him , he said on the live stream , as well as to defuse his anxiety about addressing an auditorium full of geniuses whatever performance anxiety mr labeouf may have felt appeared to have dissipated in the more intimate , if fluorescently lit , space of the elevator \( called a lift in britain \) , where he chatted with small groups of visitors who waited as long as eight hours to make small talk with a movie star he was accompanied in the elevator , which served three floors during the performance piece , by the artists nastja s de r nkk and luke turner , with whom he has frequently collaborated , but mr labeouf did most of the talking as each group of gawkers came and went , there was one question that the actor , wearing a disney sweatshirt turned inside out and leaning against the wall in one corner , said he was asked again and again why are you in the lift \? mr labeouf said he understood why that particular question kept coming up it s a weird thing , he said to one visitor i do n't have any celebrity friends , he confided to another visitor \( and the more than 10 , 000 people watching them online \) i have shame about that like i have shame about wealth that s why you 'll never find me in a lamborghini mr labeouf is no stranger to public attention \( and peculiar public displays \) a former disney child star , he segued into blockbuster action movies as an adult before throwing himself into a kind of solipsistic performance art that both made statements about and was powered by his celebrity in 2014 , he at the berlin premiere of his film nymphomaniac wearing a tuxedo and a paper bag over his head that bore the message he also wore a bag over his head during another performance piece that year at a los angeles gallery , where he later said a visitor him a year later , in the angelika film center in manhattan for 24 hours to watch all 29 of his movies back to back and in reverse order members of the public were invited to watch him do that , too , via a live stream mr labeouf s offstage persona can be as unpredictable as his art over the past 10 years he has had a series of that frequently in 2013 , from a broadway production of orphans after castmates , including alec baldwin , complained about his volatile behavior none of that appeared to be on display on friday , though , as mr labeouf politely greeted visitor after visitor to his boxy little stage he handed out slices of pizza , chatted about his favorite movies \( the little mermaid , groundhog day and raging bull \) and gave his thoughts on american politics \( it s bernie sanders or nothing \) what s it like being a celebrity \? one young man asked sometimes it s really cool , and sometimes it s not so cool , mr labeouf said there s positives and negatives , like all things another visitor wanted to know what mr labeouf s soul consisted of , but he did not answer for some fans , the experience of sharing an enclosed space with mr labeouf proved overwhelming one young woman from brazil burst into tears as her time in the elevator came to an end , and mr labeouf hugged her as she wept drive safe , he told her i am very emotional in this moment , she said between sobs it is weird to meet people who think like you
on tuesday afternoon , the will play an exhibition game against the cuban national baseball team in havana the moment will surely stand out , but it will not be nearly as groundbreaking as the game the played there 17 years ago that game occurred on march 28 , 1999 , at a time when the united states' embargo against cuba made american business ventures in cuba virtually impossible peter angelos , the owner of the orioles , was a strong critic of the economic blockade of the island nation , however , and sought to foster improved relations between the countries through baseball he had previously been denied requests to take his team to cuba , but when president bill clinton announced an easing of travel restrictions , angelos , a clinton donor , appealed again and was granted permission to pursue his idea bud selig , then the baseball commissioner , appointed sandy alderson , now the mets' general manager but then one of his key deputies , as his point man alderson , angelos and a small contingent of other baseball officials went to cuba in early march to lay the groundwork for the trip weeks later , the orioles played the cuban national team , the first time a major league club had been in cuba in 40 years five weeks later , there was a rematch in baltimore in recent interviews , participants in those games looked back , often with a little bit of wonderment at what occurred , i always felt the embargo was a mistake and it did not work in my mind , it was unfortunate and never should have happened so i felt we had to put all that aside and reestablish the dialogue i felt the two countries could get together and put behind their differences , and what better way to start than through baseball , the national sport of both countries \? , i do n't think mlb would have done it without peter really pushing it it ended up costing him a lot of money because he had to cover all the losses i was for it i wanted to go play the cuban team i had always dreamed of playing internationally , but i never had the chance to play in the olympics i knew it was going to be historic , interesting and unprecedented the orioles and major league baseball needed permission from the united states government before any game could take place both clinton and his secretary of state , madeleine albright , weighed in on the matter what i recall was most fascinating was all the preliminary work , the advance work both in washington and havana we went to the white house and talked with sandy berger , who was the national security adviser at the time we went to the state department we did n't have to talk anyone into it , but there were clearly different elements of the government with different points of view it was president clinton and peter angelos who kind of rammed it through the big issue was , what is going to happen to the revenue \? will it end up benefiting the castro government \? i kept saying , there is n't going to be any revenue because of the cost of the television production , the cost of transporting the players and the upgrade of the stadium and all the accommodations and so forth and i heard that the average ticket price for the game was , like , 10 cents unfortunately , most of the attendees were probably party officials espn had already committed its schedule for the day we were considering i remember they were willing to clear their schedule , but they were n't willing to pay for anything , including the cost of the production , which i believe included bringing the equipment in from florida there were things that we were prohibited from bringing in that had to be brought from canada outfield padding , for instance the whole stadium had to be upgraded , the turf , the dirt infield because of the sanctions , you could n't bring in anything that was going to stay in the country everything you brought in had to stay with you , or if it stayed in cuba , it had to be licensed or come from a third country so a lot of the supplies , especially the groundskeeping equipment and supplies , came from canada , before the game , we were worried because in our league , we do n't use wooden bats we only had about 10 to 15 days to practice with wooden bats there were a lot of expectations for us from the fans they wanted us to do good and show our talent eventually we got used to it , but at the beginning , we broke a lot of bats , , who in order to get on the plane , i had to be listed as a special assistant to the owner , because the cubans would not allow journalists but they were n't fooled when we got there , a cuban official came up to me and said , welcome , peter schmuck , special assistant to peter angelos and reporter for the baltimore sun' i remember the smell of the country it smelled good , if that does n't sound too strange it smelled like burnt orange peels we landed in a darkened airport we were coming in on a commercial flight , but they cleared us to land everything was dark there was a bus there and an official from the cuban government welcomed us very heartily , and we got on a bus and drove into havana what we witnessed was the capital of cuba that was literally crumbling in the dust from the embargo that we had imposed upon the country there were some hardliners in their government who were n't terribly thrilled with the whole idea so , not everyone was happy to see the americanos there were a lot of intermediaries and translators people were constantly saying , the room is bugged' it was like the cold war we had people pass us notes to take to the united states the night before the game , cuba s president , fidel castro , hosted a state dinner his brother raul was there , too , we got to the hotel and my wife said to me , i want to see downtown havana on a saturday night' the phone rang in our room and everything reminded me of my days in the 1950s because of what you saw , whether it was phones , hotels , cars , everything this voice on the other end said , palace , 7 o'clock' i said to my wife , we 'll stay there for 15 or 20 minutes , meet him and then go' we get there and after about 45 minutes , in comes fidel dressed exactly as you had seen him for 40 years he invited us to stay for dinner we did n't leave until 3 o'clock in the morning i could tell you it was a sevencourse meal , but it might have been a 27course meal i lost track there was a lot of conversation it was a remarkable experience we had a great time meeting with him and talking about the problems that we were both confronted with we americans , at least i did , felt we should get back together again , and he seemed very willing and eager to talk about that , although i told him clearly that i had no authority to discuss that it was just a personal opinion a number of owners came along with us they had an absolute firstrate state dinner with fidel raul was there , and it was very cordial , very nice and very positive it was confirming what i was hoping for the assumption that we could not get together was simply not a correct assessment a bunch of other owners flew in on their own we kept saying , you guys cannot fly in on your private planes , ' but they did anyway we had the dinner with castro this guy is a historical figure , so it was interesting to meet him through his interpreter , the thing he wanted to know about was the baseball academies in the dominican republic you could tell he was interested in the possibility of doing it there i recall him saying that he was a better basketball player than baseball player , that a lot of the baseball stuff was apocryphal a number of cubanborn players and coaches , as well as some american politicians , opposed the trip on the grounds that it would strengthen fidel castro s regime cookie rojas was the thirdbase coach of the mets at the time bobby valentine was the manager of the mets , and rey ordonez , a cuban defector , was the team s shortstop the cubanborn rafael palmeiro was the orioles' designated hitter i strongly disagreed with the decision because i did not want anything to support castro i thought it was a bad idea , so i decided to sit out in protest i talked to bobby valentine and told him my feelings , and he said he respected my position and that he understood rey ordonez did the same thing i understood the protests rafael palmeiro did n't go it was a very polarizing issue , and it still is but it was an attempt by a very forwardthinking owner , using baseball as a way to bridge a divide between two countries and normalize relations i thought there could be some kind of reaction because castro was characterized as a communist and in all kinds of negative ways the orioles beat cuba , 32 jose contreras , who later defected to the united states , pitched eight scoreless innings in relief for cuba , allowing only two hits and striking out 10 cuba tied the score in the eighth inning on a runscoring single by omar linares , and harold baines put the orioles ahead for good with a base hit for the orioles in the 11th the cubans should have won that game , as i recall the atmosphere was very festive i told my wife , i will sit with you and peter' but this young assistant came over and he said that fidel would like us to sit with him i told my wife , you just got dumped for fidel' so , that s where i sat , and i got a lot of mail from south florida , which was n't very pleasant but it was obvious to me the guy loved baseball i did not watch i had no interest whatsoever we were there for a purpose baseball was a device to help foster good relations between two countries but once the game started , it was all baseball your mindset was no longer on the political ramifications you were just concentrating on winning the game when the starspangled banner' was played , along with the cuban anthem , fidel stood up there was no problem the ballpark was completely full and the fans were very excited , jumping up and down , cheering eighth inning , runner on , linares hit a groundball base hit and we tie the score , 22 i was jumping up and down , i was so excited unfortunately , we lost in the 11th contreras stood out he clearly had major league stuff when the game is over , we go back and they put on a wonderful buffet alberto juantorena was there he is the only guy to win the gold in the 400 and 800 meters at the olympics if you knew anything about track and field , you knew who he was i was always a huge track and field guy and i still am , so i was thrilled to meet him we had a little trouble getting out of cuba i have no idea what it was , but we got held at the airport no one ever said what it was , but we waited a while and i was getting very restless , as i normally do but we eventually got out of there on may 3 , 1999 , the cubans traveled to camden yards in baltimore for the return leg of the series and won , 126 the cubans had planned to stay the night and leave the next day , but they mobilized their party ahead of schedule , presumably to thwart possible defections one former player , who had become a team coach , did defect , and six others from the delegation , none of them players , missed the hastily arranged flight but they returned home soon after they were going to play the game that night in baltimore and they were going to fly out the next morning but they were so worried about defections that they decided to fly out that night after the game they took people straight from the ballpark and rousted people out of the hotel and took off into the night , and they left about seven or eight people that they missed at the hotel one of them defected i really wanted to make the trip to baltimore , but i could not get my visa i was very sad i sent castro an oriole jacket with the no 1 on it he is a very committed baseball fan , and he could talk baseball like the professionals i contacted him that way , and i would get messages from his local people in washington , why do n't you come down again to cuba \? that was 1999 i am thankful that it has finally happened again , but that was what , 17 years ago \? i did n't think it would take this long i would like to think that it was an early precursor of what we have today i thought it would happen sooner , but it did n't it was , obviously , a very sensitive political issue but i'm delighted it is happening now it was a lot of fun it was exciting i was sitting behind home plate with the commissioner and castro was there sitting next to the commissioner i was wearing a baltimore orioles cap , which i felt uneasy wearing , since i had been with oakland for so long being there and meeting the people , it changed my view of the embargo we had a good understanding of how big it would be , but we did not have a lot of information we sensed that it would be very big for cuban sports we thought we would have an opportunity to get to know each other , the players but it did not really happen we did n't have much interaction our owner was really forwardthinking i mean , you see what s going on today he was 17 years ahead of the curve time cures everything thanks for calling it brings back some pleasant memories
london the revelation of vast wealth hidden by politicians and powerful figures across the globe set off criminal investigations on at least two continents on tuesday , forced leaders from europe to asia to beat back calls for their removal and claimed its first political casualty pressuring the prime minister of to step down public outrage over millions of documents leaked from a boutique panamanian law firm now known as the papers wrenched attention away from wars and humanitarian crises , as harsh new light was shed on the elaborate ways wealthy people hide money in secretive shell companies and offshore tax shelters the repercussions have come quickly in iceland , prime minister sigmundur david gunnlaugsson , confronted by demands for his resignation after documents revealing that he and his wealthy wife had set up a company in the british virgin islands led to accusations of a conflict of interest , asked his deputy to take over on tuesday in britain , prime minister faced calls for a government inquiry and accusations of bald hypocrisy by championing financial transparency when the leaks showed that his family held undisclosed wealth in tax havens offshore in pakistan , where roughly 20 percent of the population live on less than 125 a day , prime minister nawaz sharif angrily rebuffed opposition calls to resign , defended his riches as legally acquired , and demanded that his opponents back up their allegations of wrongdoing his daughter said on twitter to critics prove or apologize officials in france , germany , austria and south korea said they were beginning investigations into possible malfeasance , from money laundering to tax evasion france s finance minister , michel sapin , told parliament the government was putting panama back on a blacklist of havens for tax evaders the leaked papers cover nearly 215 , 000 companies and 14 , 153 clients of the panamanian law firm mossack fonseca shared with reporters at 100 news media outlets working in 25 languages , the documents include politicians , celebrities , sports figures and close associates of some of the world s most powerful people , like president of russia and members of china s ruling politburo in china , where the figures identified in the leaked papers include a brotherinlaw of president xi jinping , the government denounced reports about them as a groundless attack its media censors purged mentions of panama and blocked internet search inquiries with that word and in russia , where officials also dismissed the leaked documents as a baseless political attack on mr putin , the prosecutor general s office said tuesday it would look into the reports that highprofile russian individuals were beneficiaries of offshore companies the ripple effects from the documents extended across continents , from a west african diamond mogul to relatives of a former south korean president and soccer celebrities in latin america even the chilean head of transparency international , a prominent anticorruption advocacy group , was forced to step down after his name appeared in the leaked papers as an agent for offshore companies in the bahamas none of the published leaks have identified american officials so far nor do they necessarily show evidence of crimes but anger and reproach about the revelations have started to swell nonetheless corruption , whether private or public , is enabled by secrecy , said john marti , a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at the international law firm dorsey and whitney , based in new york the revelations , he said , are kind of pulling back the curtain on the secrecy that exists president obama , while not commenting directly on the leaked documents , said money shielded by tax avoidance is a huge problem and could be in the trillions of dollars a lot of this stuff is legal , not illegal , mr obama said and unless the united states and other countries lead by example in closing some of these loopholes and provisions , then in many cases you can trace what s taking place but you ca n't stop it gabriel zucman , a professor at the university of california , berkeley , and the author of the hidden wealth of nations , said in an interview with national public radio that the panamanian law firm represents a fraction of the total in riches obscured from public scrutiny you know , it s just one firm in one tax haven , and there is much more going on , mr zucman said , calculating that about 8 percent of the world s financial wealth is held in tax havens so that s about 76 trillion today , a huge amount of wealth it was not immediately clear how mr gunnlaugsson s decision to step aside would affect iceland , a tiny island nation of 323 , 000 that is still recovering from the global financial crisis eight years ago in a reflection of the political turmoil and maneuvering that the panama papers have created , the prime minister s office issued a statement on tuesday night saying that he had proposed stepping down in favor of his deputy for an unspecified amount of time as a sort of indefinite leave of absence and not a formal resignation it was unclear whether mr gunnlaugsson , who would remain leader of his party , would succeed in his effort to avoid a formal resignation in the face of significant public anger mr gunnlaugsson had after the leaked documents revealed that he and his wealthy partner , who is now his wife , had set up the company in the british virgin islands in 2007 through mossack fonseca the documents suggested that he sold his half of the company to her for 1 on the last day of 2009 , just before a new law took effect that would have required him as a member of parliament to declare his ownership as a conflict of interest mr gunnlaugsson had said that the leak contained no news , adding that he and his wife , anna sigurlaug palsdottir , had not hidden their assets or avoided paying taxes but the company , wintris inc , lost millions of dollars as a result of the 2008 financial crash , which crippled , and the company is claiming about 42 million from three failed icelandic banks as prime minister since 2013 , mr gunnlaugsson was involved in reaching a deal for the banks' claimants , so he was accused of a conflict of interest the controversy of the leaks was also loud in britain , in part because it illustrated the outsize role of britishgoverned territories as tax havens the leader of britain s opposition labour party , jeremy corbyn , called for an independent investigation into the tax affairs of all britons linked to the panama revelations including mr cameron s family and for britain to impose direct rule on its overseas territories and dependencies , if necessary , to get them to comply with british tax law the government needs to stop pussyfooting around on tax dodging , mr corbyn said the focus of anger in britain centered on mr cameron s late father , ian , a stockbroker and investment manager , who was among those named as having used the panamanian law firm to set up a company based in the british virgin islands , a british territory while there was no suggestion of illegal activity , the overseas investment fund paid no british tax the labour party wants to know if the prime minister retained any interest in the offshore fund , which mr cameron denies , and wants him to publicize his tax returns with economic inequality a growing political issue in britain , mr cameron s privileged upbringing and personal wealth make him vulnerable to such attacks , particularly at a time when his government is reducing spending on welfare payments to the poor in a further embarrassment to mr cameron , who has claimed leadership in the global fight to crack down on tax havens , the documents also reveal that britain s selfgoverning overseas territories , especially the british virgin islands , proved a favored location for companies handled by mossack fonseca the political temperature over the leaked documents has been rising in britain since monday , when , asked whether mr cameron s family still had money offshore , his official spokeswoman , helen bower , described this as a private matter mr cameron s denial came only on tuesday holding money offshore would not be illegal , providing interest earned was declared to the authorities despite saying that he is very relaxed about calls to publish his tax returns , mr cameron has not done so reports about the cameron family s panamanian connections first surfaced in 2012 when it emerged that ian cameron was a director of a fund established in panama in 1982 called blairmore holdings , named after a family mansion in scotland the leaks have shown how the company used bearer shares , which do not identify owners by name , to conceal who was investing in blairmore holdings mr cameron said i own no shares , no offshore trusts , no offshore funds , nothing like that his office said later that neither he , his wife nor his children benefit from any offshore funds
unity state , south sudan after hearing republican presidential candidates big government and burdensome regulation , i 'd like to invite them to spend the night here in the midst of the civil war in  you hear gunfire , competing with yowls of hyenas , and you do n't curse taxes rather , you yearn for a government that might install telephones , hire a 911 operator and dispatch the police from afar , one sees the united states differently and seem to think that america s achilles heels are immigration and an activist government but from the perspective of a war zone , these look more like national strengths indeed , take what trump is clamoring for weaker government , less regulation , a more homogeneous society in some sense , you find the ultimate extension of all that right here no regulation ! no long lines at the dmv , because there is no dmv in the conflict areas in practice , no taxes or gun restrictions no obamacare no minimum wage no welfare state to breed dependency no sticky rules about eminent domain and certainly no immigration problem yet it s a funny thing in a place that might seem an antigovernment fantasy taken to an extreme , people desperately yearn for all the burdens of government and tolerance of social diversity that americans gripe about in a country where to belong to the wrong tribe can be lethal , south sudanese watch american aid workers arrive a mixed salad of blacks and whites , asianamericans and latinos , men and women with some astonishment these americans come in all flavors of faith christians , jews , muslims , atheists and more and while they may snap at one another , they do n't behead one another one lesson of south sudan is that government and regulations are like oxygen you do n't appreciate them until they 're not there two political scientists , jacob hacker and paul pierson , argue that america s achievements rest on a foundation of government services but that we americans suffer from \( that s also the title of their book coming out this month \) and do n't appreciate this we are told that the united states got rich in spite of government , when the truth is closer to the opposite , they write every country that journeyed from mass illiteracy and poverty to modernity and wealth did so , they note , because of government instruments that are now often scorned these instruments also create a sense of national identity that eclipses tribal identities , even if this process is still incomplete in america i came across a group of homeless women and girls in the south sudan swamps , hiding from soldiers who would have killed or raped them one teenager was wearing a castoff tshirt that read obama girl , so i asked her if she knew who barack obama was she was confused there are no functioning schools in the area , so she ca n't read and did n't know what her shirt said but i explained that did n't help , for she had never heard of obama i asked her friends if they knew , and finally i found one woman who did she said shyly that obama is president of the united states these women and girls are all members of the nuer tribe , which the army of south sudan has often targeted and which remains to some degree marginalized in the central government and the nuer are related to the luo tribe , which is the tribe of so a nuer now cannot in practice become president of south sudan , but someone of similar ancestry can be president of the united states that s an inclusiveness that enriches america and that should be a source of pride yet trump sunders that unity and divides us by heritage he turns us from americans into people of many tribes what we americans excel at are our institutions we have schools , laws , courts , police , regulators , bureaucracies , safety nets arms of a government that is often frustrating but always indispensable these institutions are the pillars of our standard of living from the perspective of a south sudanese war zone , our greatest challenge is n't big government or immigration , but the threat to those pillars from those who miscalculate our national strengths and weaknesses it s odd that some conservative candidates should be so antigovernment when an intellectual forerunner was thomas hobbes , the 17thcentury philosopher who rightly warned that life in the natural state is trump and cruz would do well to remember his point government , laws and taxes are a burden , indeed , but they are also the basis for civilization
beijing nearly 20 years after the appearance in of one of the most shocking firstperson narratives of the cultural revolution , the cowshed memories of the chinese cultural revolution , the new york review of books has written by ji xianlin , the account appears with a new introduction by zha jianying , a writer and media critic based in new york mr ji , who was a distinguished professor of languages at peking university , offers a rare and harrowing description of life as a prisoner of the red guards the title refers to the flimsy structures with dank floors and reed mats where victims of the red guards at the university , including mr ji , were kept in the cowshed , starving was augmented by physical exertion and the constant threat of beating , he wrote after the cultural revolution , mr ji held prominent positions at the university and was admired in government and media circles he died in 2009 at 97 , having written , he said , the book he hoped would break the silence about the cultural revolution during his nine months in the cowshed , mr ji was forced to haul baskets of coal , weed a garden and handplow fields of rice near the campus he describes being humiliated by the red guards as they lined up the inmates with heads bowed , and then subjected them to taunts and shouts every morning , the red guards ordered their prisoners to write a saying of , and if one word was wrong in the transcription , you risked being slapped in the face , at the very least ms zha is the author of two nonfiction books in english , tide players and china pop , and five books of fiction and nonfiction in chinese tide players , about the movers and shakers of contemporary china , first appeared as a series of essays in the new yorker and was chosen as one of the best books of 2011 by the economist she grew up in beijing , attended peking university and now divides her time between new york and beijing she wrote the compelling introduction to the cowshed , where she notes that the depiction of the atrocities rekindled some of the nightmarish memories from my own childhood in beijing mr ji s account is important , she says , because official archives remain closed , and serious books about the period are remarkably few ms zha notes that mr ji , worried about stepping on people s toes , toned down the final version and kept most of his persecutors unnamed his goal , she wrote , was not to seek revenge but to give an honest historical document time is obviously a factor a less obvious but more important factor is censorship the forgetfulness has n't happened naturally there is something insidious behind the phenomenon the human desire to turn away from past trauma is perhaps universal , but the amnesia many chinese display these days is highly selective if you ask them about the opium war or the japanese invasion , for instance , they wo n't shrug their shoulders they are likely to treat you with a lecture those events occurred much earlier , yet are well remembered because the state constantly reminds people about china s humiliation at foreign hands every chinese kid is schooled in those history lessons but an internal mess \? that s a totally different matter the cultural revolution was instigated by mao , supported by the entire party leadership , with millions of chinese participating in the violence and persecution it s a thoroughly homemade nightmare and the same party continues to rule today so is it surprising that the topic has been quietly muzzled \? do you wonder why the government would like people to forget about it and why many chinese happily obliged \? in this context , it s remarkable the cowshed was published at all it benefited from a relatively relaxed political moment and the author s status as an eminent scholar although promotion of the book was quietly blocked , it has enjoyed several editions , multiple print runs , and an estimated sale of several hundred thousand copies maybe not a lot for a country of 13 billion people , but for such a brutally dark book , and under these restricted circumstances , it has done quite well the crushing of the individual in the name of a collective agenda is a common experience in all totalitarian societies in that sense the cowshed can indeed be compared to darkness at noon and many other fiction and nonfiction works coming out of the former soviet bloc and beyond but in my opinion , darkness at noon is essentially polemics in the form of a novel koestler uses his protagonist s torment to dramatize a central tension in the communist revolution , the one between its noble end and its brutal means the power of the cowshed lies not in its arguments but in the specificity and abundance of facts this is a survivor s testimony with so many amazing lived or witnessed details , which give you a vivid and visceral sense of how an entire persecuted community of individuals lived under the reign of terror some of it reveals distinctive features of the maoist society , such as the process of ideological coercion and the savagery of mob violence but ji s account of the sadistic tortures and the human degradation in the labor camp , all that horrific abuse in a closed environment they also remind me of holocaust memoirs such as elie wiesel s night as some of the cultural revolution victims have told me we are the jews in this country this is our holocaust well , the fading away has not really happened naturally , so if you scratch the surface , all the poisoned blood will flow the cultural revolution tore so many families apart i know instances where couples divorced and children denounced their parents some families have patched up and reconciled later , but others are totally destroyed in one case , a woman made a critical remark about mao at home her son and husband reported her she was taken away and shot recently the son finally made a tearful confession in a video program because he has been eaten alive by remorse all these years my mother did this was in the 1980s she was standing in a long line in a fish market , and suddenly she recognized the man in line before her this man had led a night ransack of our home during the cultural revolution he had also beaten her during an interrogation so she confronted him the guy was shocked when he recognized her he stammered people stared but my mother was pretty feisty and would n't let go she kept on reminding him of the awful deeds he had done so the man gave up the fish line and disappeared into the crowd the silence about the past is deafening amid the clamor about the future the government wants people to move on and focus on the positive therefore as the ghosts are kept in the closet , you hear this relentless chant about economic growth , about national unity and social harmony this means impunity for the perpetrators of past wrongs it has also created fear on the part of the victims the strategy has worked after several decades of this policy , most people just do n't give a damn about the cultural revolution those who want to make a fuss about it are viewed as either troublemakers or out of it actually the situation is mixed with the former red guards many have grown profoundly disillusioned some have become reformers or even dissidents others , i suspect , do n't like what they see when they look in the mirror but wo n't admit it because they do n't have to but i certainly cannot rule out the no apology , no regret camp , just as we cannot rule out the existence of pure evil which is to say some people have not a shred of conscience do you think they would want to poke that delicate spot \? no , it s avoided like a plague academic institutions in china are state institutions they all have a party secretary sitting on top , and they all toe the official line on political matters ji s past suffering is sometimes mentioned in the more commercial media , but there it s usually done in a breezy , sugarcoated language maestro ji had endured hardship , yet his love for our motherland has never diminished , blah , blah , blah quite nauseating stuff it did n't help that ji himself held up patriotism as a shield he clung to it till the end of his life
hong kong art basel in hong kong highlighted many of asia s top artists last year , but none had more visibility than cao fei her oldschool , video gameinspired installation , same old , brand new , lit up all four sides of hong kong s tallest building , the 108story international commerce center , with a playful reimagining of our earliest digital entertainment around the same time , the palace museum in beijing released an app developed by moujiti studio that lets people view centuries of the museum s porcelain collection in high definition while combing through historical details the evolving versatility of digital technology continues to offer new platforms and exposure for chinese artists both ancient and modern changing how art is made , marketed , distributed and sold it is the biggest shift for chinese art since the easing of state control nearly four decades ago a group of new media artists has evolved in recent years , with pioneers like zhang peili and feng mengbo being joined by post'80 artists like wang yuyang and xu wenkai embracing an interconnected consciousness , such postinternet artists are expanding the country s art market many of these artists have risen to prominence after initially expanding their own horizons mr xu , also known by his art handle , aaajiao , was a computer science major during his college days in central china , and for him and others , technology served as a gateway to art the most important possibility offered by digital technology is a kind of education in the values of technological culture , he said it shatters location , ethnicity and politics , and because of that , it makes us equals for works produced by artists long deceased , technology also offers big benefits lulu li , a partner and creative director at the beijingbased moujiti , said digital innovations made it easier to appreciate ancient works of art after all , in a lifetime one can only visit so many museums and historical sites physically , ms li said with the rise of digital museums and smart museums , technology like virtual reality and augmented reality can bring immersive experiences that help us access cultural content ms li said that about 20 people worked on the app for the palace museum , from the initial creative concept and userexperience planning to sketches , userinterface design , animation , sound design , program development , hardware integration and more additional collaborations with the museum are in the conceptual stage , she said it s rather revolutionary , she said digital technology not only makes it possible for china s hidden treasures to be accessible by chinese people , it also helps transmit this knowledge globally such advances are also making it easier for the current generation of chinese artists who want to show their work to a wider audience but in terms of helping them survive , there is not an app for that yet for individual artists , there s really not any complete platform out there , mr xu said in terms of whether there are digital platforms that enable people to make money off of art , i 'd say they exist from auctions on the chinese social media platform wechat to every kind of big auction site , these internetbased platforms already have an obvious benefit , he said yang kai founded one of those auction sites , 99yscom , in 2003 to address counterfeiting and quality issues in chinese art auctions we primarily auction paintings , the majority of which are contemporary , mr yang said almost all of the website s users gain access to the site via mobile devices , he said , with more than 50 percent using their phones and 40 percent using tablets mr yang said the site s record price for an individual painting was 100 , 000 yuan , or about 15 , 300 in addition to auction sites and the ubiquitous wechat , chinese artists are also marketing themselves and selling via instagram , facebook , youtube and ecommerce sites like jdcom and taobaocom platforms such as these that rely on usergenerated content are more often than not used by artists to sell physical art new options , such as the eo1 digital art display by electric objects of new york , offer a curated and subscriptionbased platform for artists last october , the company joined with the internet art nonprofit organization rhizome at the new museum in new york to offer the panda edition eo1 , featuring limitededition art by ai weiwei and jacob appelbaum their pandatopanda artwork featured toy pandas stuffed with shreds of printouts of the surveillance documents leaked by the former national security agency contractor edward j snowden we primarily work with artists who use or engage with technology in their practice , said zo salditch , a founder of electric objects who works on the curation side we believe that these artists are making work that represents the present and future of art electric objects' other founder , jake levine , added our mission is to bring to art what the internet has already brought to every other category of media it reduces the cost of distribution to zero , and creates an opportunity for artists to reach and grow their fan base directly electric objects commissions new and original work from artists , to whom it pays a fee artists keep full ownership of their intellectual property while giving electric objects a perpetual license to distribute their artwork , ms salditch said the company wants to include artists from around the world , including chinese artists china is a hotbed of creative activity , she said i can imagine all sorts of wonderful collaborations mr xu said it was still early for products such as eo1 in the chinese market in terms of chinese consumers in the wider sense , i think this type of digital art platform is still not very visible , he said one of the biggest challenges facing artists or companies trying to make money in china on new digital channels for selling art is the ethos of digital media itself , ms cao said the monopolistic sales and collection of art have a conflict that is difficult to harmonize with the sharing' and free' nature of digital media , she said in addition to structural challenges within the industry , there is the possibility that , as digital technology and media become increasingly intertwined with artistic expression in china , governmental intervention could become an issue mr xu struck a sanguine note when asked about potential government restrictions on freedom of expression by new media artists the chinese government s control of the internet is much more conservative than its cultural policies , he said the integration of technology and art wo n't actually change much , for now
ottawa she was bullied relentlessly she suffered from , and other ailments her living conditions were unbearably cramped 20 relatives taking refuge in a twobedroom government nursing station for more than a year after a sewage backup made their home uninhabitable still , it came as a shock when sheridan hookimaw , a sociable 13yearold girl , took her own life last october , her greataunt said it was the kind of shock , the aunt said , that has become all too familiar since september , 101 people in the attawapiskat first nation , a remote aboriginal community with about 2 , 000 residents , have attempted suicide that is about 5 percent of its population there were an astonishing 11 on saturday alone it s quite scary when you hear the air ambulance at 2 in the morning , 3 in the morning , said jackie hookimawwitt , sheridan s greataunt that s the youth being taken out overwhelmed , the chief and the council of the attawapiskat community have declared a state of emergency it was more of a call for help than a legal measure , and once again it has focused s attention on longstanding problems in the region i hope it gets governments to react , said grand chief alvin fiddler of the nishnawbe aski nation , the regional body for aboriginal groups around james bay you see right across the territory a lack of proper housing , a lack of proper health care , the lack of access to clean drinking water unfortunately , suicide attempts are quite , quite prevalent in many of our communities , he added it is not the first time that charlie angus , the federal member of parliament for the area , has seen a state of emergency declared after a suicide crisis swept native communities we go through spikes with these crises , and we are definitely in a very , very dire moment , he said , adding that attawapiskat had gone through a similar wave of suicide attempts in 2009 and 2010 i 've lost count of the states of emergency attawapiskat is only about 60 miles from an openpit diamond mine owned by de beers , yet it has the unenviable distinction of being unusually poor even by the standards of aboriginal communities while the diamond mine has provided some employment , most of the community of about 2 , 000 people survives by hunting moose and caribou in the surrounding boglike muskeg or by fishing its only connections to the outside are ice roads in the winter or by air grand chief fiddler said there had been no clear pattern to the recent suicide attempts men and women , young and old have tried to kill themselves while drugs and alcohol have played a role in some of the attempts , mrs hookimawwitt , who has a doctorate in education and who has taught in the community and been involved in academic research on it , said that none had been found in the system of her greatniece and while underlying causes can be identified , isolating what precisely has set off the attempts has been elusive while some attempts among children and teenagers may have been prompted by ms hookimaw s death , her greataunt said , that does n't explain the older men whatever the cause , mrs hookimawwitt said that she and others were now hiding and securing knives , ropes and prescription medications it reaches into your house , she said the declaration did spur some action on monday , health canada , a federal department , said it was sending two counselors to the area and working with a regional health authority the province of is flying in a team of mental health nurses and social workers its minister of health will travel to attawapiskat later this week the problems facing attawapiskat and numerous other aboriginal communities have long been known but the current crisis comes at a time when relations between aboriginal groups and the federal government appear to be transforming after 10 years of tense relations with the conservative government of former prime minister stephen harper , many aboriginal leaders are buoyed by promises from prime minister justin trudeau to make their issues a priority his government s recent budget included an additional 84 billion canadian dollars , spread over five years , to deal with aboriginal issues there are good things happening in our country , said grand chief fiddler , who met with mr trudeau last friday that openness , that type of dialogue , it filters down to the different departments of the government cindy blackstock , the executive director of the first nations child and family caring society of canada , pressed a case that led the canadian human rights tribunal to rule in january that the government s underfunding of native youth problems was a form of racial discrimination she said she was waiting for mr trudeau s positive words to be turned into concrete action she estimated that governments spent 30 to 40 percent more on nonaboriginal children through a variety of programs this is our confederate flag , ms blackstock said there s no excuse for a country that is as wealthy as ours for racial discrimination like this mrs hookimawwitt said she had seen some positive events in her community s otherwise bleak crisis last week , a group mainly of teenagers from a neighboring aboriginal community walked along ice roads for two days to attawapiskat to raise awareness of the suicide problem after a feast , she said , they lined up to comfort ms hookimaw s relatives as a drummer played an increasingly loud beat it was very emotional it was sacred , mrs hookimawwitt said these kids made that happen that gives me hope
arthur , i do n't usually spend time worrying about the mental health of prominent republicans , but i 've actually found it painful to watch these ted cruz endorsements i \( gasp , choke , gag \) am going to vote \( retch \) for the jerk who is n't donald trump the cruz endorsements may not have been the first choice in a lot of cases or as lindsey graham put it , he was my 15th choice what can i say \? but this is what often happens i ca n't figure out whether the right metaphor for these kinds of political alliances is a shotgun wedding or a marriage of convenience maybe a convenient shotgun wedding \? good try , but this is n't anything near normal i 've heard a lot of sullen endorsements over the years , but i 've never heard one where the selling point was he s not completely crazy did you hear lindsey graham \? i 've that all these thoughtful republican elders should endorse , who actually is n't crazy at all what think you \? i concede that it is particularly gobsmacking this year , but my point is that you always wind up with endorsements that reflect limited options and lessthanideal alliances just look at all the presidential nominees who wound up with running mates they could n't stand you had jfk and lbj , or , going back a bit , coolidge and charles gates dawes many republican leaders have decided that their objective is to maximize the odds of derailing donald trump , pure and simple many like kasich but do n't think he has a shot , so endorsing him is expressive more than helpful speaking of nominees and their running mates , any early predictions \? i'm seeing hillary clinton with somebody male , younger and maybe hispanic anyone who falls into that category , feel free to send a r sum 10 , 000 young guys just printed them out and put them in the mail wow , i 've set the millennials in motion on the republican side , the vicepresidential pick is the least of their problems some hopeful types are envisioning a cruzkasich ticket but i do n't see what value kasich brings to that pairing his selling point is that he s inclusive , but if he signs up to run with a stupendously divisive presidential candidate , that advantage evaporates gets em ohio , or so the thinking goes plus i can imagine cruz being a lot less divisive in the general i know you 'll think this sounds insane , but i can actually imagine unity and consensusbuilding emerging as general election themes if it comes down to clinton and cruz will anyone buy it \? who knows unity is n't always a plus with cruzkasich you 'd have two guys who are enemies of reproductive rights , whose tax plans do n't add up , with education policies that hurt the public schools one does have some potential for working well with others , but unfortunately he s not the one running for chief executive hey , now that i 've mentioned education i do n't think we 've argued about schools yet are you game \? you bet but first , i just ca n't let enemies of reproductive rights slide by kasich is basically prolife , for sure like millions of americans he holds pretty according to most polling , including some abortion exceptions , and that other important issues belong in the conversation about respecting life early childhood , infant mortality , the environment , education his view is no abortions except for rape , incest and life of the mother i 'd argue that the mainstream view is that the whole subject is uncomfortable and women should just deal with it with their doctors that s actually a minority position according to gallup , just 29 percent of the country believes abortion should be completely unrestricted , which illustrates why the issue is so inherently polarizing but you were saying about the schools i'm troubled by kasich s record on public education ohio has hundreds of privately run charter schools , many of them run by forprofit organizations state funding has favored the charters over the traditional public schools none of this has worked out well hear that whirring sound \? you just turned on the wonkomatic machine predictably , charters are turning out to be neither a total panacea nor an awful failure their successes depend hugely on leadership so some have done poorly and others have saved kids from failing in traditional schools as a general matter , though , charters are really promising a nationwide study published last year by stanford s center for research on education outcomes that kids in urban charters gained 72 more days of learning per year in reading than in traditional schools , and 101 days in math here in washington , dc , we have an excellent schools chancellor , kaya henderson , who has really gone to bat for charters and even though dc charters poorer kids and more minorities than traditional schools , they 're yielding faster improvement and better results obviously there are some good charter schools as long as they operate within the regular school system and do n't get any advantage in public funding , i do n't have any problem with them even though i do think a lot of the success stories are due to the fact that the students tend to have motivated parents some disadvantaged kids get a big boost and succeed those who do n't do so well often get nudged out the door but my real concern is the charters run by forprofit companies the whole idea of mixing profit and public education is terrible the research on this is mixed obviously , forprofit universities even those named after presidential candidates have not all covered themselves in glory , and that market is really in flux the forprofit idea only works if you assume the customers can make well , educated decisions have you ever asked a group of college students if they know what the interest rates on their loans are \? i rest my case good point nobody would label most college students as especially highinformation consumers \( or voters for that matter \) but the data on forprofit education at lower levels tell a different story an interesting out of florida state university shows no significant performance difference between forprofit and nonprofit charter schools as a general matter , the public sector seems to do best in a supervisory role over schools , rather than running them directly but i'm agnostic on specific tactics really , i just want lots of experimentation the one thing we know for sure is that conventional schooling is simply not delivering the goods , especially for poor kids i 've always been amused by the idea that the major thing wrong with public schools is teachers' unions public schools are as good as their management if the principals and superintendents are smart and hardworking , the schools will have good teachers and good policies if only the major complaint with teachers' unions is that they protect mediocrity in spite of the leadership remember those stories about the socalled rubber rooms in new york where terrible teachers would be temporarily parked instead of fired \? almost every publicschool teacher i meet has stories like this well , every publicschool teacher from new york which should be way more aggressive about getting rid of the rubber room inmates no school system can afford to tolerate dead weight teachers , but management is often unwilling to put in the time and effort it takes to terminate them properly it is true that teachers' unions can make it hard for a school system to make quick , dramatic reforms they do slow things down but look at that from the teachers' perspective i 've talked with multitudinous veteran educators if they 've worked at one school for a couple of decades , they 've probably gone through three or four new superintendents , each of whom announced a dramatic new plan for reform that threw everyone into a tizzy for a couple of years , until things quieted down and the next superintendent came in with yet another big idea so they do tend to be cynical idealistic about the kids , but cynical about the reforms for sure changing objectives and unstable leadership make for big problems and there are so many great teachers but again , the real issue with many unions is that they focus on protecting adults instead of serving kids i think this is as much a moral issue as a policy issue , which is why many reformers from both sides are coming together against the status quo this is a losing issue for the left you know the conservative rap on democratic candidates on this that they are so in the pocket of publicsector unions that they ca n't function as reformers at all can hillary break out of this \? what reform are you looking for \? we 've been working since the first bush administration on setting standards for academic achievement the teachers certainly do n't like all the testing , but i do n't hear hillary clinton denouncing the common core it s the republican candidates who , by the way , also totally misrepresent the entire enterprise there are lots of good out there , but most of the boldest proposals are vehemently opposed by a core education constituency i always start with expanding education choice charters and voucher programs to empower parents but you have to pair that with a concerted effort to lower barriers to entry and make it easier to open schools throw in a plan for the nearmonopolies on training administrators and certifying teachers and , get serious about vocational and technical training as well as apprenticeships in the trades hillary could have a big moment if she stands up to entrenched interests and fights for some of these reforms on behalf of kids and families you underestimate the democrats i 've never heard any of them denounce vocational and technical training almost everybody agrees there need to be changes in teacher education everybody likes choice , but not at the expense of the system that s taking care of the vast majority of the students you know , i think you and i could work this out together why columnists and think tank presidents do n't run the country is a complete mystery to me next week there will be a lot on the races the easter weekend primaries were good to bernie , and north dakota is coming up for the republicans enjoy your week , gail
i am on a sleeper train , traveling from moscow to anapa , a town in southern russia , on the shore of the black sea it is april 26 , 1986 , a week before my sixth birthday we have been en route for nearly two days and the provisions we brought from home are running down the train has stopped at the station in rostovondon , 700 miles away from our home on the outskirts of moscow from my upperlevel bed i can see out the window to the platform , where a lively scene is unfolding the typical hustle and bustle of a major station , older women selling hot meat and potato pies , fried chicken and pickles , people rushing in and out of the train no one has any idea about what is going on 500 miles northwest in chernobyl radioactive fallout clouds from the reactor and official information about the incident have not reached us yet , and they will not do so for some days but the event is afoot it will catch up with us , before we have a chance to catch up with it , if at all in the meantime , life will continue to wind through its normal course and i am observing its ebbs and flows on the rostovondon platform from inside the train compartment in which i am traveling this trip , like the others i would take over the years , was mandated by doctors and sponsored by the healthcare system of the soviet union because i had severe seasonal allergies to birch , oak , and other tree pollen that left me breathless , i was sent to another climatic zone , where none of the vegetation prevalent in central european russia flourished i thus had to spend a part of the spring transplanted , among palm trees and cypresses once i arrived in in the resort town of anapa , i could again breathe freely , and would spend the rest of april , may , and a part of june there , where , unbeknownst to me , i would be receiving dangerous amounts of radiation from chernobyl s fallout jean baudrillard calls this the logic of seduction , by which we flee toward the very thing we are trying to escape but the impression that one can flee from the calamity that is our civilization is no less immature than the sunny ideology of progress itself there are no escape valves by train , i was speeding toward another , still greater catastrophe spawned by the same total system not soviet totalitarianism but a pernicious handling of nature that undercuts life and prevails both in capitalist and socialist economic systems that was the logic of seduction i was subject to for more than six weeks from the end of april until midjune 1986 i was exposed to huge quantities of radiation in anapa most of that time was spent outdoors at the beach , in parks or promenades until not so long ago i was not aware of this perhaps because of having undergone the uncanny nonexperience at a young age or due to mistakenly believing later that the plumes of radioactive materials travelled exclusively north , through belorussia and the baltic countries to sweden and norway , blazing new european cartographies it is difficult to talk and write about chernobyl the very structure of witnessing breaks down once the event , with all its extraordinary and deathbearing potential , practically merges with everyday life thanks to its imperceptibility what is there to say about an exposure to radiation that cannot be seen or smelled or heard or touched or tasted \? those of us who have been in its eerie precinct are like objects , onto which certain effects have been inflicted , rather than subjects in control and aware of what is going on bypassing our consciousness , material witnessing has been incorporated into us , as plants incorporate the external elements into their physical structures it has been converted into a part of the flesh the radiation accumulated in the thyroid gland , the elements of strontium that , imitating calcium , have bound themselves to the bones for the exposed bodies and minds , this might be too much to bear , however consciousness has been exploded not so much as an aftereffect of a violent shock but thanks to becoming superfluous plants , too , live through occurrences without formulating them in speech their articulations are wholly material the patterns observable on their extensions , from tree rings to the position of branches , are bodily witnesses to a history of growth and to its environment if it so difficult to talk about chernobyl , then why not delegate the act of testimony to plants , living beings that do not speak , at least not in human voices and languages were we to do so , we would perhaps allow exposure to become expression , and vulnerability a way of bearing witness rooted in the ground , plants are unable to escape radiation s harmful effects visitors to the red forest near chernobyl s ground zero will see pine trees turned reddish , their fallen trunks accumulating on the ground over the last 30 years they are not decaying or being digested into the earth as compost as they should but some plants are adaptable soybeans experimentally grown in chernobyl s radioactive environment have displayed drastic changes in their protein makeup , enabling them to strengthen their resistance to heavy metals and to modify their carbon metabolism their exposure to the world is of one piece with learning from the world and giving plenty of things back to it only our , human , exposure suggests vulnerability , passivity and helplessness we live in the shadow of an everpresent threat that our insatiable desire for energy would consume the entire world , without sparing us either this threat is not an amorphous prospect it attained reality in april 1986 , and before and after , with varying degrees of intensity at three mile island and fukushima still , our addiction to what is economically convenient persists it is stronger than fear economy overrides ecology heedless to the alarms that have been ringing for some time now , we have not yet woken up from our energy nightmares animals and plants are returning to chernobyl s exclusion zone because human beings are gone , not because the soil is more fertile we could celebrate this , trend finding in it a kind of saving grace , a laboratory for a vibrant planet that would survive the human onslaught long after our species is extinct or , we could fight against the nihilistic indifference that spawns our destructiveness thirty years after chernobyl , the risks of using atomic energy are no longer a matter of the future they are already actualized the greatest risk is that we carry on as though chernobyl never happened as though our consciousness has not exploded together with the power plant s unit 4 reactor as though the world and our picture of it were still intact as though the selfregenerative capacities of the body and of the environment were endless as though finitude were infinitely resilient , ready to be reborn from the ashes each time anew , like the phoenix we mistake it for this essay is adapted from the , featuring the art of ana s tondeur , comprised of photograms , or direct imprints on photosensitive paper , of plants grown in chernobyl s radioactive soil for more on her work consult her  is a research professor of philosophy at the university of the basque country , vitoriagasteiz , spain he is the author of pyropolitics , dust , through vegetal being , with luce irigaray , and other books  , an anthology of essays from the times s philosophy series , edited by peter catapano and simon critchley , published by liveright books
paris ten young muslim men , bored by a mundane life in and haunted by a feeling of uselessness , as one put it , were seduced by a leading islamic state recruiter in europe in 2013 within months , they were in under the watchful eyes of hooded , kalashnikovwielding militants , doing pushups , fiddling with weapons and imbibing the ideology but the harsh regimen , most have since told investigators , was not to their liking , and it was not long before they hastened back to their families in the strasbourg area , where they were almost immediately picked up by the french authorities what to do with hundreds , perhaps thousands , of such young men in europe is now among the biggest challenges facing governments and security services after the and terrorist attacks , which were carried out in part by europeans who had spent time in syria with the islamic state , france and other countries are grappling with how far to go in tightening laws to prosecute , monitor and restrict the movements of returnees at the heart of the debate is whether to take preemptive legal action against people who have not committed terrorist acts or even been implicated in a plot , but who have simply been to syria and possibly received training in islamic state camps several urgent factors have propelled the debate the steeper risks of terrorist attacks , the fact that monitoring the sheer numbers who have returned is overwhelming security services , and the difficulty of building cases against suspects who may have been trained and indoctrinated in distant lands at least 14 european countries have made receiving terrorism training a criminal offense nine have made travel to the war zones of syria and iraq an offense in france , more than 900 people have left the country to be jihadists , making it europe s biggest wellspring of foreign fighters the government is now debating whether to allow house arrest even if there are merely serious reasons for thinking someone has been in an overseas war zone two trials involving french jihadist cells were held in paris this month , with the defendants in one of them receiving sentences of up to 10 years on charges of criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing acts of terrorism setting policy for dealing with returning jihadists is just one example of how europe , like the united states after the sept 11 attacks , is being forced to weigh security concerns against civil liberties even before the paris and brussels assaults , cases like the one in strasbourg were highlighting the difficult choices posed by european citizens coming home from syria at least 1 , 300 european jihadists have returned to the continent , and those are only the ones identified by the police three times as many europeans may have gone to syria , some slipping back undetected , with disastrous consequences one member of the strasbourg group , foued mohamedaggad , returned after the others and was not detected by the authorities he ended up as one of the three killers at the bataclan concert hall in paris , where 90 people were shot dead on nov 13 of the nine others from strasbourg known to have gone to syria , two were killed there in january 2014 , but seven returned , were quickly arrested in may 2014 and now await trial the record of their interrogations afterward is a dance of denial that they intended any harm in europe this is a radical , extremist islam which has nothing to do with basic islam , and which i disavow , foued s brother , karim , told investigators , according to documents recounting the interrogations there is no policy covering all of europe , and in some instances the returning jihadists are not immediately locked up though they are almost always placed under some form of monitoring , this puts a big strain on the police and intelligence services fifteen to 20 officers per jihadist are required for constant surveillance , said magnus ranstorp of the national defense college in sweden , a country where about 80 have returned in belgium , the biggest percapita furnisher of jihadists in the european union , 50 to 120 have returned but after the recent attacks , and with the islamic state promising more terrorist strikes , a period of relative laxity is over , analysts said they will be arrested , and the evidence will be gathered , said edwin bakker , director of the center for terrorism and counterterrorism at leiden university in the netherlands more prosecutions are being undertaken preventively , even when there is little firm evidence of a plot , as the french examples show but the strasbourg cases illustrate the difficulties of building a prosecution the strasbourg group , all men in their mid to late 20s , had met in hookah bars and fastfood joints they included a delivery driver , a service station attendant , a physical education instructor , several who were unemployed and a petty criminal their departure for syria in december 2013 had been well publicized so when they returned , from february to april 2014 , france s internal security agency , the dgsi , knew whom to look for , and where after their return , the investigators listened and watched , finally pouncing on may 13 , 2014 , in the same workingclass neighborhood they had left in the eyes of the authorities , their crime was simple being enlisted by a wellknown french recruiter , traveling to syria and islamic state safe houses or training centers , training with kalashnikov rifles and other weapons , and returning to france yet in their interrogations , none of the men admitted wrongdoing , and several insisted that they had gone to syria for humanitarian reasons the men now claim to reject islamic state ideology and tactics and profess regret for their stupidities , as one put it under questioning but investigators are well aware that islamic state training manuals urge recruits to practice the art of taquiya , or concealment one suspect in strasbourg , mohamed hattay , went through five interrogation sessions before admitting he had even been to syria as a result , the authorities try to find evidence from mobile phones , social media posts and other sources that shed light on motivations and true intentions we know sometimes people try to suggest they are disillusioned , but they are just hiding it , said gilles de kerchove , the european union s counterterrorism coordinator when we intercept their communication , we discover it is not true , he said the seven strasbourg suspects portray themselves as full of regret for having made the trip to syria i was n't brought up with that way of thinking , and i am totally against it , one of the men , miloud maalmi , told interrogators in 2014 when i was there , they kept me isolated , and they made me undergo truly abominable things , mr maalmi said i want to turn the page another of them , radouane taher , said , once i got there , i understood very quickly what a mess i had gotten myself into , and that i had fallen in with a bunch of madmen even escaping was a risk , karim mohamedaggad said each one of us , we had to play games in order to flee the country , because our lives were in danger , he said yet investigators said they had found photographs on facebook , phones and computers showing some of the men posing with the islamic state flag , wearing military gear and holding rifles there were also photographs of decapitated corpses , the investigators said in addition , all had been recruited in france by mourad far s , who said in a 2014 that he was the principal recruiter for jihadists in france he met mr maalmi at a mcdonald s in kehl , germany , across the river from strasbourg all the jihadists the newspapers are talking about , they passed through me , mr far s told vice from syria mr far s is now in jail in france it is difficult to tell from the mostly bland answers in the transcripts how radicalized the suspects became , though the investigators were able to catch them in inconsistencies and evasions this interrogation contradicts the two preceding it there being no place in this part of the story for humanitarianism , ' the investigators noted in their summary of statements by ali hattay , another suspect liberalminded french jurists have criticized what they call the criminalizing of intentions but france remains under after the nov 13 attacks the people that return now , they will probably be hunted down , said mr bakker , of the center for terrorism and counterterrorism the general approach is really to try to convict these people , he added in the past there was the attitude , let it go' but we 've really gone beyond that
do you remember the bush boom \? probably not anyway , the administration of george w bush began its tenure with a recession , followed by an extended jobless recovery by the summer of 2003 , however , the economy began adding jobs again the pace of job creation was n't anything special by historical standards , but conservatives insisted that the job gains after that trough represented a huge triumph , a vindication of the  so what should we say about the obama job record \? the relevant number , as i 'll explain in a minute hit its low point in february 2010 since then we 've gained 14 million jobs , a figure that startled even me , roughly double the number of jobs added during the supposed bush boom before it turned into the great recession if that was a boom , this expansion , capped by last month s really good report , outbooms it by a wide margin does deserve credit for these gains \? no in general , presidents and their policies matter much less for the economy s performance than most people imagine times of crisis are an exception , and the obama stimulus plan enacted in 2009 made a big positive difference but that stimulus after 2010 , and has very little to do with the economy s current situation the point , however , is that politicians and pundits , especially on the right , constantly insist that presidential policies matter a lot and mr obama , in particular , has been attacked at every stage of his presidency for policies that his critics allege are jobkilling the former house speaker , john boehner , once used the phrase in less than 14 minutes so the fact that the obama job record is as good as it is tells you something about the validity of those attacks what did mr obama do that was supposed to kill jobs \? quite a lot , actually he signed the 2010 , which critics claimed would crush employment by starving businesses of capital he on high incomes , especially at the very top , where average tax rates rose by about six and a half percentage points after 2012 , a step that critics claimed would destroy incentives and he enacted a health reform that went into full effect in 2014 , amid claims that it would have catastrophic effects on employment yet none of the dire predicted consequences of these policies have materialized it s not just that overall job creation in the private sector which was what mr obama was supposedly killing has been strong more of labor markets also show no evidence of predicted ill effects for example , there s no evidence that obamacare led to a shift from fulltime to parttime work , and no evidence that the expansion of led to large reductions in labor supply so what do we learn from this impressive failure to fail \? that the conservative economic orthodoxy dominating the republican party is very , very wrong in a way , that should have been obvious for conservative orthodoxy has a curiously inconsistent view of the abilities and motivations of corporations and wealthy individuals i mean , job creators on one side , this elite is presumed to be a bunch of economic superheroes , able to deliver universal prosperity by summoning the magic of the marketplace on the other side , they 're depicted as incredibly sensitive flowers who wilt in the face of adversity raise their taxes a bit , subject them to a few regulations , or for that matter hurt their feelings in a speech or two , and they 'll stop creating jobs and go sulk in their tents , or more likely their mansions it s a doctrine that does n't make much sense , but it conveys a clear message that , whaddya know , turns out to be very convenient for the elite namely , that injustice is a law of nature , that we 'd better not do anything to make our society less unequal or protect ordinary families from financial risks because if we do , the usual suspects insist , we 'll be severely punished by the invisible hand , which will collapse the economy economists could and did argue that history proves this doctrine wrong after all , america achieved rapid , indeed unprecedented , income growth in the 1950s and 1960s , despite top tax rates beyond the wildest dreams of modern progressives for that matter , there are countries like denmark that combine high taxes and generous social programs with very good employment performance but for those who do n't know much about either history or the world outside america , the obama economy offers a powerful lesson in the here and now from a conservative point of view , mr obama did everything wrong , afflicting the comfortable \( slightly \) and comforting the afflicted \( a lot \) , and nothing bad happened we can , it turns out , make our society better after all
the notion of authenticity in dance is a mare s nest it often turns out that what you thought were definitive versions of familiar classics \( giselle , swan lake , apollo \) are very far from the original of all the choreographers whose work keeps returning to the stage , martha graham is the one whose pieces raise the most questions can we see her in the dances performed in her name today \? celebrations for this troupe s 90th anniversary reached a climax on monday with its closingnight gala at city center , introduced by the company s artistic director , janet eilber the gala fare , however , included an excerpt from graham s 1934 celebration , danced by men sorry \? what \? if you know graham history , you know that for the first 11 years her company was allfemale it was a big deal when she admitted her first male dancer in 1937 \( yes , reader , she married him \) and for some people it reduced her work rather than enhancing it were we seeing a new 2016 genderreverse treatment of this originally female dance \? yes , we were , but nobody informed the gala audience sorry \? what \? i can imagine the opening of george balanchine s allfemale \( also from 1934 \) being danced by men in fact , i 've seen some men do it but it s impossible to think the george balanchine trust would sanction a stage performance without at least making clear to the audience that it was an alternative version does the graham company think the difference of gender is unimportant \? other questions arise about choreographic musicality according to the performances on monday , graham s \( we saw an excerpt from this 1929 allfemale dance \) featured dance moving through silence and music playing through choreographic stillness and the version given of steps in the street \( from chronicle , 1936 , also allfemale \) demonstrated choreography through two stretches of extended silence these silent sections , i'm now told , were made for the 1989 revival by the graham dancer yuriko they 're done well , but they do n't ring true if graham used music and silence with such peculiar emphasis here , why has n't this entered the dance history books \? it s utterly unlike the safe examples of musicality in her tanagra solo , set to erik satie s second gnossienne , or in her appalachian spring \( 1944 , aaron copland \) , from which we saw the duet for the bride and husbandman labeled simple gifts' theme and variations the issue of whether those older graham dances were originally like what we 're seeing now is a fraught one graham herself modified her works over the years by the time i began watching this troupe \( 40 years ago \) , there were complaints from some graham alumni and admirers that the graham essence was being lost but such controversies always surround alternative versions of classic choreography \( balanchine experts often talk of versionitis , an infinitely subtle form of dispute that could keep graham researchers very busy indeed \) what was the graham essence \? it was hard to tell on monday as we entered the theater , a silent color film on a loop was showing three women dancing \( a seated man was briefly visible \) this was graham s , a piece \( about two minutes long \) presented in graham s first concert in 1926 a review in dance magazine at the time noted three gopis in their lovely draped batik costumes of melting colors and their young faces brightened by the warm flowers in their shining hair this became part of a longer theatrical work \( six to seven minutes long \) , the flute of krishna , that graham premiered some weeks later in rochester , with stage direction by rouben mamoulian , who also directed the film of the same name monday s audience was told none of this , though these facts would have heightened the gala s historical interest considerably \( ms eilber is a good speaker for an event like this , i wish she had introduced each item \) what we also were n't told was that three gopi maidens was an orientalist example of very early graham picturesque , soft , sensuous like tanagra , it actually seems pregraham , reflecting the thenpopular denishawn style in which graham had begun her career the jump from those 1926 items to the advanced sculptural modernism of heretic \( a dance for a soloist at odds with an ensemble \) and the 1930 \( a celebrated solo \) is startling , though monday s audience was n't encouraged to notice this in between , we were given the awful 90 years in 90 seconds film by justin scholar they say that drowning people find their lives flash before their eyes , and mr scholar takes that view of graham history once we were into the tense physical rigor of the 192930 works , however , we entered the style that made graham great for perhaps 30 years yet in excerpts that is n't always evident the duet for husbandman and bride from is the sweetest and most polite section of that great work out of context , it gives a misleadingly conventional impression it was danced by aur lie dupont , the paris opera ballerina now becoming that institution s director of dance she was sweet , polite and charming but largely devoid of the tension crucial to graham style \( she also led the lament from graham s 1981 , a piece of ritualistic twaddle from a period when graham was moving into selfparody \) better , as her appalachian spouse , was the young dancer lloyd mayor the attack , sweep and openness of this man s style is remarkable he also produced the most musical dancing of the evening the dancing in woodland , set to string music by irving fine , was entirely fresh , too this piece is related to classic graham in the drama it creates between its isolated female soloist \( xin ying \) and the ensemble of four couples the couples , following the formula now standard in much choreography , were malemale , femalefemale , malefemale and femalemale and ms xin s isolation poignantly suggests that she would like some of what they 're having it s a shapely , touching work , with sharp , piercing moments of real graham incisiveness missing , though , is any graham heroism it s hard not to wish ms xin s passive , schoolgirltype role had more blaze , more pain , more oomph
london american airlines flight 109 , traveling to los angeles from london , was more than two hours into its journey and close to keflavik , iceland , when several passengers and crew members suddenly and mysteriously became ill those aboard were startled , news reports said , and the pilot decided to fly back to london the plane landed safely but on thursday , the mystery of what happened on the plane , which captured headlines in and beyond , remained unclear the daily telegraph in britain , citing a passenger on the flight , that one crew member had fainted american airlines said in an emailed statement that two passengers and several flight attendants had complained of lightheadedness during the flight on wednesday , prompting the captain to return to heathrow airport near london it said there were 172 passengers and 16 crew members on the boeing 777 , which landed at 5 05 pm news reports said the plane had been met by paramedics , police cars and firefighters passengers and crew members were evaluated by health officials , american airlines said , but none requested further medical attention luggage was removed for inspection , the daily telegraph reported the aircraft was inspected by maintenance workers upon arrival , the company said , but it declined to elaborate we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience , it said the london ambulance service on twitter that it had been called to heathrow on wednesday , although it did not specify whether the intervention was in connection with the american airlines flight we checked over six patients who were feeling unwell , it wrote they were discharged on scene although it remained unclear what had caused people on board to become ill , and loss of consciousness are among a range of symptoms that have been associated in the past with jet engine fumes leaking into the cabin modern commercial jets are designed to siphon heated air , drawn from the engines , for use in cabin pressurization and airconditioning systems occasionally , that air can become contaminated with traces of engine oil or hydraulic fluid , provoking acute symptoms , sometimes called aerotoxic syndrome , that later subside airlines and regulators closely monitor such risks , but some pilots' and flight attendants' unions worry about the health risks of repeated exposure to toxic substances four alaska airlines flight attendants against boeing last year after they fell unconscious when toxic fumes entered the cabin during a flight in 2013 , forcing an emergency landing in chicago their lawsuit claims that boeing was aware of the health risks from contaminated bleed air , while the company has long maintained that cabin air is safe to breathe news reports of the american airlines flight fit a classic pattern suggesting contamination by engine oil , said susan michaelis , head of research at the global cabin air quality executive , a group representing aviation industry workers lowlevel contamination of cabin air by oil happens on all flights , ms michaelis said , but in most cases it is not detected by people on board aviation regulators acknowledge that engine fuel leaks are the primary cause of cabin air contamination , but they insist that the phenomenon poses a limited risk to passenger safety nonetheless , the international civil aviation organization , based in montreal , published guidelines last year aimed at raising industry awareness of the problem
they are about two inches wide , squarish , and five inches tall they hail from the toggenburg valley of northeast switzerland , and they are held in the highest regard by experts around the world they are glass bottles used to hold athletes' urine samples , and they are central to the account of a former russian antidoping official who says that the host country executed at the 2014 sochi olympics imperceptibly switching out drugtainted urine from the squat containers long thought to be tamperproof i tried to break into these bottles years ago and could n't do it , don catlin , the former head of the ucla olympic analytical laboratory , said it s shocking the bottles , used for testing at the olympics since the sydney games in 2000 , are made by berlinger , a swiss company founded in 1865 as a mechanical cotton weaving mill until this week , they were largely ignored vessels in the global fight against doping now they are prominent characters in an extraordinary ploy that affected the results of the winter olympics , according to grigory rodchenkov , who ran s antidoping laboratory for a decade his accounts of the doping operation were first reported by the new york times this week berlinger s bottles were first presented to the s medical commission in the late 1990s , in a meeting in lausanne , switzerland , said andrea berlinger , the sixth generation of her family to run the company dr catlin , then a member of that commission , recalled that the berlingers showcased various bottle designs to a roomful of doctors all of us were particularly pleased and excited by this bottle , he said , because it looked pretty bulletproof according to dr rodchenkov , it is not russian officials somehow figured out a way to remove the cap without breaking it , he said , enabling him to replace the steroidtainted urine of top athletes with clean urine , stockpiled in soda bottles and other containers in the months leading up to the games we 're all a bit speechless , to be honest , ms berlinger said friday we 're seeing a lot of support no one can believe it the mechanics of how the feat was pulled off are a mystery to dr rodchenkov i truly believed this was tamperproof , he said in a recent interview in los angeles , holding a clear berlinger bottle with a blue stripe in his hand this is like a safe i cannot think how to get under this russian officials dr rodchenkov s accounts of a staterun doping program these allegations look absolutely groundless , dmitry s peskov , the spokesman for president vladimir v putin , told russian news agencies in a conference call they are not substantiated by any trustworthy data , they are not backed by any sort of documents all this simply looks like slander by a turncoat berlinger bottles come in sets of two one for the athlete s a sample , which is tested at the games , and the other for the b sample , which is used to corroborate a positive test of the a sample metal teeth in the b bottle s cap lock in place , so it cannot be twisted off the bottles are either destroyed or retain visible traces of tampering if any unauthorized attempt is made to open them , berlinger s website says about the security of the bottles the only way to open the bottle , according to berlinger , is to use a special machine sold by the company for about 2 , 000 it cracks the bottle s cap in half , making it apparent that the sample has been touched dr rodchenkov said that for at least 15 russian athletes who won medals at sochi , both the a and b samples were substituted before they were tested none of the bottles' caps which are branded with unique sevendigit codes showed any signs of having been opened each night at sochi , dr rodchenkov said , sealed bottles were passed through a hole in the wall of the storage closet that served as his shadow laboratory the bottles were handed to a man who he believed worked for the russian intelligence service , the fsb within two hours , he said , those same bottles were returned to him , their caps unlocked magicians were on duty , dr rodchenkov said , suspecting that fsb officers had studied the toothed metal rings that lock the bottle when the cap is twisted shut according to him , they collected hundreds of them leading up to the olympics dr catlin theorized that heat had been applied to remove the bottles' caps he said he had expressed some concern about the bottles years ago , asking if they could be outfitted with internal thermometers , to show if the sample had been frozen or heated but that s just a wild guess , he said after his account was published , dr rodchenkov sent a letter to the world antidoping agency and the ioc , calling on them to examine the b samples of russian athletes from the 2014 sochi games , whom he offered to help identify bryan fogel , an american filmmaker who helped dr rodchenkov flee to los angeles , where he now lives , also signed the letter while those samples would not contain traces of steroids , dr rodchenkov told the times , they would bear evidence of tampering he said there would be scratch marks around the necks of the bottles , where the metal rings are he also said that common table salt could be found in some of the samples when he replaced tainted urine with clean urine , he added salt or water to the new urine to match the chemical specifications of the original sample ms berlinger said the bottles were the international standard at major sporting competitions , including the world cup each bottle costs about 15 , she said more than 2 , 000 athletes competed in the sochi games olympics officials have long believed the cost of the bottles to be a critical expense to ensure the integrity of the games , dr catlin said ioc officials have called dr rodchenkov s account very detailed and very worrying , calling on antidoping authorities to investigate his claims asked on friday for its reaction to dr rodchenkov s proposal to reexamine the b samples of russian athletes , a spokeswoman for wada confirmed receipt of dr rodchenkov s letter we are currently determining our path forward , which we will be in a better position to communicate next week , she wrote by email in the letter , dr rodchenkov and mr fogel asked to be present during any examination of the b samples in lausanne , requesting that the investigation be carried out by a committee of scientists and an independent observer this could cause all kinds of problems , dr catlin said wada has got to get on this
which household gadget do people in believe can kill you \? \( a \) microwave \( b \) blender \( c \) electric fan \( d \) portable cd player the correct answer is c it sounds like the plot of an xfiles episode people are said to have died merely from leaving their electric fans blowing overnight but across south korea , many people believe the whirring blades can cause death and to address those fears , manufacturers equip fans with sleep timers how , exactly , might the electric breeze kill \? theories abound in south korea , among them that the cold air circulating in a sealed room could cause hypothermia , leading to organ failure or maybe they suck out the oxygen , causing suffocation some fear that the fan itself converts oxygen molecules into carbon dioxide for the record , none of these theories are true but that has not stopped the korean news media from reporting on supposed fan deaths even the government has endorsed the lethalbreeze idea in 2006 , the statefunded korean consumer protection board listed asphyxiation from electric fans and airconditioners as one of the top five recurring summer accidents the agency warned according to the advisory , there were 20 cases of fan asphyxiation between 2003 and 2005 to prevent asphyxiation , it said , timers should be set , wind direction should be rotated and doors should be left open among dubious koreans and , well , everyone outside samsung s homeland , it is widely suspected that fan death was a ruse hatched by the country s former authoritarian government in the 1970s to discourage citizens from using too much electricity the country has since been transformed into a thriving democracy , but the myth proved to be a match for electric fans it survived

kabul , afghanistan faced with a choice between two obvious candidates to take over the one the young son of the insurgency s founder , the other chief of the haqqani terrorist network a small slice of the group s leadership instead chose none of the above on wednesday breaking four days of silence after their previous by an american drone strike , the taliban announced that a lesserknown deputy of the group , mawlawi haibatullah akhundzada , a conservative cleric in his 50s , would take over and continue the group s war against the afghan government despite a lack of military credentials , mawlawi haibatullah became seen during a as a throwback to core religious values and a possible figure to unify around after months of leadership struggle and violent schisms , according to insurgent commanders who were briefed on the selection process for afghan officials and their american allies who are struggling to hold back an aggressive taliban offensive this year , that is unlikely to offer any immediate comfort any idea of joining peace talks is a deeply divisive one within the taliban ranks , and the statement announcing mawlawi haibatullah s selection emphasized victory and omitted concession described by the taliban spokesman as quiet , deeply patient , and a listener , mawlawi haibatullah served as a judicial leader during the days of the taliban government in and is seen as a consensus builder still , his announcement early wednesday came as surprise to many taliban commanders the two men seen as the chief rivals for the leadership sirajuddin haqqani , the insurgency s daytoday operations leader and mullah muhammad yaqoub , in his 20s and the son of the group s founder , mullah muhammad omar were named as deputies on wednesday , according to a statement from the taliban s core leadership council in quetta ,  the announcement on wednesday was also the taliban s first public confirmation that their leader for the past year , , had in fact been killed in a drone strike in pakistan s baluchistan province , for years for the insurgency s leadership the taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid on wednesday said mullah mansour had been buried two days ago in an undisclosed location inside afghanistan although mullah mansour presided over one of the most dramatic years of taliban battlefield gains since the group was ousted from kabul in 2001 , he also deeply alienated some of the group s most influential commanders , including some who  after the revelation last summer that the group s revered founder , mullah omar , had been dead for at least two years and that mullah mansour had been issuing leadership decrees in his name while hiding the fact of his death mullah mansour worked quickly to try to head off challengers to his ascent but the leadership change , and the subsequent battles as mullah mansour put down rebel commanders who would not be brought into line , was an unparalleled airing of the taliban s inner personality disputes , after years of maneuvering that had been cloaked by fear and mystery and reports of mullah mansour s extensive personal wealth and frequent travel abroad were at odds with official taliban accounts that portrayed him as a modest leader who lived conservatively after that , mawlawi haibatullah , a village preacher s son who grew up in kandahar province and showed no signs of flash in his personal background , may have been especially attractive to a tight inner circle bent on rebuilding a more unified taliban still , some commanders expressed surprise over his selection on wednesday , saying most of the group s top leaders had felt strongly about choosing either mullah yaqoub or mr haqqani mawlawi haibatullah is not very well known among the taliban here , said qair fasihuddin , the taliban shadow governor of badakhshan province but obviously , we are obedient to the leadership and we fully accept their decisions both those candidates , however , had factors that may have worked against them mullah yaqoub is believed to be less than 25 years old , and lacked experience he was only recently made a member of the leadership council , and was given nominal military authority in 15 afghan provinces mr haqqani , who leads the feared haqqani militant wing of the taliban , was named the second deputy to mullah mansour last year in recent months , he is said to have mostly taken over the taliban s military operations but he is considered by some commanders to be uncomfortably close to pakistan s military establishment in the end , the decision on mawlawi haibatullah was made by a small group of about 24 permanent members of the leadership council and about a dozen other influential clerics late on tuesday , according to mr mujahid , the taliban spokesman analysts with insight into the taliban movement suggested the change in leadership would do little to shift the group s policy away from fighting and toward talking peace mullah abdul sallam zaeef , a former taliban member close to its founding leader , said mullah haibatullah was widely respected within the insurgency as a religious scholar the unity of the taliban is critical , whether for the taliban as a movement or for hopes of peace , mullah zaeef said noting that there was still a standing religious fatwa to fight any foreign troop presence in afghanistan , he added the insistence on fighting is not the solution in afghanistan but at the same time , the reason for the fighting needs to be done away with as long as there remains a motive for the fatwa , any leader going against that will find itself in isolation hailing from panjwai district of kandahar province , mawlawi haibatullah belongs to the noorzai tribe his family moved to pakistan after the soviet invasion , and mawlawi haibatullah has spent a good part of his life in pakistan , largely in quetta first as a refugee , then as a longtime religious student , and over the past 14 years as a taliban figure in exile he rose to prominence as a judge during the taliban government in the 90s , holding a variety of roles across military and civilian courts mullah omar was said to have valued his religious opinions and kept him at his side in the movement s judiciary commission after the insurgency s leadership moved to pakistan before he became a deputy to mullah mansour last summer , mawlawi haibatullah was an influential figure among clergy running the madrasas in pakistan that produce a large number of taliban fighters one of the reasons that the taliban chose haibatullah as leader is that as a religious scholar , he can reunite different factions of the taliban and prevent disintegration , said habibullah fawzi , a former taliban diplomat some of the leaders of a breakaway taliban faction that revolted against mullah mansour are also from the noorzai tribe , and mawlawi haibatullah is believed to have been involved in trying to mediate their return but a spokesman for the breakaway faction , mullah abdul manan niazi , said on wednesday that the choice of mawlawi haibatullah was unacceptable he said that members of the faction mostly crushed by mullah mansour , with their leader had not been consulted his swift selection , along with the promotion of the powerless mullah yaqoub , was intended to create a situation in which mr haqqani holds the real power , mullah niazi said sheikh haibatullah is not the right choice for us , mullah niazi said , using the term for an elder scholar he has been selected quite similarly to mansour with no consensus of all mujahedeen it will never be acceptable to us
chicago by 25 , donnell flora was a regular in the court system here he had been convicted of shoplifting , found guilty twice in stolen property cases and sentenced to prison for drugs but those past sins were minor compared with what officials said happened on april 28 , 2014 , when mr flora gave his 14yearold niece a gun she used to shoot two of her peers on the south side one of the girls , endia martin , 14 , died from a gunshot wound to her back the other victim , a 16yearold , has recovered on monday , mr flora , now 27 , was sentenced to 100 years in prison 65 years for endia s murder , plus 35 years for the attempted murder of the other girl the authorities said the motivation for the shooting by mr flora s niece , who is awaiting trial for murder in juvenile court , was a dispute about a boy officials said the handgun used in the shooting had been illegally transferred and then falsely reported stolen before it ended up in mr flora s possession endia s death stood out among the hundreds of killings here each year , both because of her age and because of the petty motive derrick rose , the chicago bulls basketball player , and in the months since , endia s name has frequently been invoked as a tragic example of chicago s proliferation of guns and homicides there is no excuse or rationalization for giving a child a gun to take to a ridiculous fight about a boy none , judge thaddeus wilson said monday in court ,  the police said mr flora accompanied his niece to the site of the shooting in his wheelchair , which his lawyer said he uses because he was shot and paralyzed in chicago years earlier after endia s shooting , prosecutors said , a 16yearold took the gun from mr flora s niece and returned it to mr flora that 16yearold has since been convicted and sentenced to probation chicago is struggling to contain a surge in violent crime through march 13 , , double the total from that period in 2015 other crimes , including robbery and aggravated battery , are also up , according to chicago police department statistics last week , and wounded during a narcotics investigation , and the suspect was killed by the police also this month , the father of a 9yearold boy killed last year was after monday s hearing , prosecutors praised the lengthy sentence we are pleased with this sentence for a man who gave a deadly weapon to a 14yearold girl , which she used to end the life of another 14yearold child , anita alvarez , the state s attorney for cook county , said in a statement we hope that this sentence brings some measure of justice to the families of both victims as they continue on their path to healing joel brodsky , mr flora s lawyer , said monday evening that he believed judge wilson was sending a message with his sentence but mr brodsky said he thought 100 years was excessive for mr flora , who he said did n't intend that anybody be killed or hurt his family has been impacted by gun crime , mr brodsky said he was shot and paralyzed his brother was shot and killed now a gun crime has put him in prison the rest of his life
near end of albert camus s existentialist novel the stranger , meursault , the protagonist , is visited by a priest who offers him comfort in the face of his impending execution meursault , who has not cared about anything up to this point , wants none of it he is an atheist in a foxhole he certainly has not been a strident atheist , but he claims to have no time for the priest and his talk of god for him , god is not the answer some 70 years later , kamel daoud , in his 2013 novel the meursault investigation , picks up the thread of camus s story in one scene late in that novel , an imam hounds harun , the brother of the unnamed arab who was killed in the stranger in response , harun gives a litany of his own impieties , culminating in the declaration that god is a question , not an answer harun s declaration resonates with me as a teacher and student of philosophy the question is permanent answers are temporary i live in the question any honest atheist must admit that he has his doubts , that occasionally he thinks he might be wrong , that there could be a god after all if not the god of the judeochristian tradition , then a god of some kind nathaniel hawthorne said of herman melville , he can neither believe , nor be comfortable in his unbelief and he is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other dwelling in a state of doubt , uncertainty and openness about the existence of god marks an honest approach to the question there is no easy answer indeed , the question may be fundamentally unanswerable still , there are potentially unpleasant consequences that can arise from decisions or conclusions , and one must take responsibility for them anyone who does not occasionally worry that he may be a fraud almost certainly is nor does the worry absolve one from the charge one may still be a fraud , just one who rightly worries about it on occasion likewise , anyone who does not occasionally worry that she is wrong about the existence or nonexistence of god most likely has a fraudulent belief worry can make the belief or unbelief genuine , but it cannot make it correct people who claim certainty about god worry me , both those who believe and those who don t believe they do not really listen to the other side of conversations , and they are too ready to impose their views on others it is impossible to be certain about god bertrand russell was once asked what he would say to god if it turned out there was one and he met him at judgment russell s reply you gave us insufficient evidence even believers can appreciate russell s response god does not make it easy god , if he exists , is deus absconditus , the hidden god he does not show himself unambiguously to all people , and people disagree about his existence we should all feel and express humility in the face of the question even if we think the odds are tilted heavily in favor of a particular answer indeed , the openminded search for truth can unite believers and nonbelievers in a previous essay in the stone , gary gutting reconceived pascal s wager rather than consider it as a bet on whether god exists , which has tremendous consequences on one side and relatively trivial consequences on the other , we should consider it as a bet on whether to embrace a doubt of indifference or a doubt of desire a doubt of indifference is simply a matter of not caring , and it has no clear benefits by contrast , a doubt of desire approaches the question with the hope that a higher power could be found that would provide greater meaning and value to human existence as gutting sees it , the choice is obvious of course , nonbelievers will object that there are various secular alternatives for finding meaning and value in life additionally , there is an assumption built into pascal s wager that we are talking about the god of the judeochristian tradition nonbelievers may see no reason to favor that particular deity so gutting s doubt of desire needs to be more explicitly conceived as an openness to the question in which the nonbeliever explores what various religious traditions have to offer the nonbeliever might embrace the ethical teachings of christianity , the yogic practices of hinduism , the meditative techniques of zen buddhism , or any of the vast array of teachings and practices that the world s religions have to offer such embrace may lead the nonbeliever to belief in god , or it may not this proposal should be taken in the other direction as well there should be no dogmatic belief the believer should concede that she does not know with certainty that god exists there is no faith without doubt the trappist monk thomas merton wrote that faith is a decision , a judgment that is fully and deliberately taken in the light of a truth that cannot be proven it is not merely the acceptance of a decision that has been made by somebody else indeed , belief without doubt would not be required by an allloving god , and it should not be worn as a badge of honor as nonbelievers should have a doubt of desire , so , too believers should have a faith inflected by doubt such doubt can enliven belief by putting it at risk and compelling it to renew itself , taking it from the mundane to the transcendent , as when a christian takes the leap of faith to believe in the resurrection we can all exist along a continuum of doubt some of us will approach religious certainty at one extreme and others will approach atheistic certainty at the other extreme many of us will slide back and forth over time what is important is the common ground of the question , not an answer surely , we can respect anyone who approaches the question honestly and with an open mind ecumenical and interfaith religious dialogue has increased substantially in our age we can and should expand that dialogue to include atheists and agnostics , to recognize our common humanity and to stop seeing one another as enemy combatants in a spiritual or intellectual war rather than seeking the security of an answer , perhaps we should collectively celebrate the uncertainty of the question this is not to say that we should cease attempts to convince others of our views far from it we should try to unsettle others as we remain open to being unsettled ourselves in a spirit of tolerance and intellectual humility , we should see ourselves as partners in a continuing conversation , addressing an enduring question william irwin is a professor of philosophy at king s college , the author of and the general editor of the   , an anthology of essays from the times s philosophy series , edited by peter catapano and simon critchley , published by liveright books

syosset , ny goaltender thomas greiss and his wife , brittney , were running errands in his enormous truck during a late january snowstorm that ultimately canceled the team s home game that night against philadelphia greiss decided to take his wintry outing a step further , using a towrope to extricate several lessprepared and potentially stranded motorists out in the windswept mess none of them apparently realized their helper was the islanders goaltender , signed last summer as a free agent to back up jaroslav halak , in what may have been one of garth snow s savviest moves in his decade as general manager but with halak who had a career high in victories last season as the islanders finished with 101 points very likely to miss at least the next six weeks with a lowerbody injury , greiss may not be anonymous much longer he treats his onice role in the same easygoing manner in which he hastened to aid neighbors in distress it was no big deal to help people it took me five minutes , said the softspoken greiss , a native of fussen , germany it s never nice to be stuck i was just happy to get them back on the road the islanders , who were 2 points behind the secondplace rangers with two games in hand heading into saturday s contest at boston , will need a similarly unflustered approach from him as their starting goaltender they spoke confidently of the team s immediate challenge with greiss in net , backed up by the rookie jeanfrancois berube , who has started two games this season thomas has played very well , said john tavares , the team s captain obviously , we miss jaro and he s a big part of our team , but we remain confident in our goaltenders it s a strength for us greiss , 30 , was a thirdround draft pick in 2004 by the san jose sharks who played exclusively in germany before joining the sharks' ahl team in worcester , mass , in 2006 after parts of four seasons with the sharks , greiss started 20 games two seasons ago for the phoenix coyotes last season , he was marcandre fleury s understudy with the pittsburgh penguins , registering nine wins this season , the 6foot1 greiss already had a careerhigh 18 victories heading into the weekend and was among the league leaders in save percentage his success with the islanders has not surprised tavares i realized how good thomas was when we started practicing in training camp , tavares said he s a big dude with an ability to be quick , and he has that elastic type of movement it never seems like he s out of the play greiss has been such a positive revelation that there is no discernible sense of panic among the islanders as they head into a stretch run of 17 games over four weeks i 've been on teams where the backup ca n't carry that much of a load , but thomas has been a blessing for us , right wing cal clutterbuck said shooting against him in practice all the time , he s hard to score on greiss takes praise in stride having logged more games in the ahl than the nhl , he surely knows that work ethic and determination are essential as pressure increases for a franchise that has not won a playoff series since 1993 i'm always calm , trying to stay relaxed , he said i just want to play my game this straightforward outlook heartens islanders coach jack capuano , who appreciates players who quietly put in necessary and extra effort behind the scenes for me , it s his work ethic and battle level , which for a goalie can go unrecognized , capuano said i see him in the gym constantly before practice plus there s the attention he gives to video with the coaches capuano accepts that part of this season s script has yet to be written as the islanders try to secure home ice in the opening round of the playoffs for a series that could pit them against the rangers we 're in for a fight , he said this is new territory for thomas we 'll see how it goes , and i'm hoping he will get rewarded for the way he works and his attention to detail greiss also brings a critical teambonding element that teammates cite , his dry wit he s a funny guy , clutterbuck said a lot of times , goalies keep to themselves and can be a bit oddballish , but he s right in there he s a good guy to have around , for sure

recife , brazil so many distraught mothers stream into the infant ward clutching babies with abnormally small heads that the receptionist sends them outside , to see if they can find a chair to wait under the mango tree there s shade there , at least , said maria helena lopes , 66 , as she greeted one young mother after another we 'll call you when we 're ready roziline ferreira took three buses to get here , grasping her 3monthold son , arthur , all the way tears swelled as she looked at him , recalling how the symptoms of the had struck her during the second month of her how would she ever be able to care for him , she wondered \? what kind of life would he have \? it gets me angry when someone on the bus looks at arthur and asks , what s wrong with his head \? ' ms ferreira said i tell them , nothing s wrong , he s just different' but then i think to myself , yes , something s wrong my son will never be like the other boys' this povertystricken city near the equator is at the center of a nightmarish health crisis that has set off alarms across the western hemisphere mothers began showing up at the oswaldo cruz hospital with their affected babies as early as september , stunning doctors and leaving even the most experienced among them scrambling to figure out what was going on i would like to dream it is n't happening , said the head of the infant care unit , dr angela rocha , who began working at the hospital in 1973 we 've had our share of epidemics , but this is unprecedented before last fall , medical reports of babies born with brain damage and unusually small heads a condition known as were so uncommon in that only about 150 cases were registered each year in the entire country now brazilian officials are investigating thousands of them , and they contend that the mosquitoborne zika virus is the cause virus specialists are , if any , between zika and the rash of microcephaly cases in brazil , an undertaking that international officials warn  but whatever the cause , there is no doubt that brazil is experiencing a significant increase in microcephaly , said an official for brazil s health ministry who was not authorized to speak publicly we would n't have declared this situation a health emergency if this increase had not been detected the zika epidemic has spread much faster than science s understanding of it researchers here believe that the virus made the leap from polynesia to brazil during the 2014 world cup soccer tournament since then , as many as 15 million people in brazil are believed to have been infected , and the virus has spread to in the americas the most common symptoms are relatively mild , like and , and most people with the virus feel no ill effects at all but as zika continued to spread across brazil , particularly here in the northeast , doctors began to encounter a steady stream of women cradling babies with unusually small heads i saw this dramatic increase in cases with my own eyes , said dr vanessa van der linden , a neurologist in recife who was among the first doctors to detect an increase in microcephaly cases last year she said she was shocked when the babies began appearing at the public hospital where she works , the hospital bar o de lucena , and at her private practice altogether , she has examined about 60 cases in the last six months , she said 10 times the rate of cases she came across in previous years i never witnessed anything like it , dr van der linden said she began suspecting a new cause for the microcephaly after testing the mothers for other possible factors , like , and none of the tests showed that these ailments could have been responsible , prompting researchers to examine the link to zika this is an emergency because the situation is unprecedented , dr van der linden said dr rocha , at oswaldo cruz hospital , said that she and her team had also examined about 10 times as many babies with signs of microcephaly as they normally would , turning recife into a harbinger of what officials fear could unfold on a much broader scale many of the mothers were already overwhelmed by poverty now they are grappling with an incurable condition that can involve , impaired cognitive development , delayed motor functions , problems with speech and  some of the mothers hope the microcephaly is something that will pass , and just have an empty gaze when i tell them it will not , said dr rocha , 67 , a pediatrician others simply start to cry when the reality sets in two months ago , selma alves de oliveira , 38 , gave birth to a daughter , maria das gra as it was her eighth child , inevitably increasing the strain on her and her husband , who farm beans and potatoes on a small plot of land near recife but unlike her others , this child was born with microcephaly , requiring multiple bus rides or paying someone to drive them to recife for medical care our lives have been turned upside down , she said the time spent coming here , waiting here for hours , is time i ca n't spend feeding my family i love my daughter and want the best care for her , but this is hard the full extent of the crisis is still far from clear reporting microcephaly became mandatory across the country only in the last few months , after officials documented the jump in cases here in the northeast brazilian officials said this week that reported cases of had now climbed to 4 , 180 since october , a 7 percent increase from the previous tally last week officials have examined more than 700 of the cases in 462 of them , either no microcephaly was found , or it was caused by something other than an infection , like alcohol or by the mother during pregnancy , a spokeswoman for the health ministry said so far , infections have been confirmed as the cause of 270 cases of microcephaly yet even in that group , the zika virus was found in only six infants officials warned against reading too much into that number , though , because the zika virus has a very short period during which it can be detected properly when an infant is identified as a suspect , the infection had to occur six to seven months earlier , said claudio maierovitch , director of the department of surveillance of communicable diseases at brazil s health ministry the chances of detecting it are tiny , he said officials are still investigating 3 , 448 other cases even under normal circumstances , the oswaldo cruz hospital , founded in the 1920s and named for the legendary brazilian epidemiologist who led sanitation campaigns against the , embodies the challenges of the country s public health system waiting rooms lack airconditioning weeds threaten to envelop a rusted swing set perched behind the infant care unit puddles of stagnant water where viruscarrying mosquitoes can breed persist along sidewalks even so , arlindo batista , who manages the snack bar outside the ward for the babies with microcephaly , said he had been shattered by the influx of babies it s one of the saddest things i 've ever seen , said mr batista , 43 , who tried to lighten up the area by hanging decorations from the ceiling for the coming carnival celebrations sometimes the women come to sit down here for a little cup of coffee they hold their babies and turn quiet i do n't know what to say faced with so many cases , doctors here in recife say that brazil needs to intensify its battle against the virus on many fronts , from expanding mosquitoeradication campaigns to developing a vaccine it s fine and it s necessary to have an academic discussion about the statistics , but we 're here on the ground dealing with the increase in microcephaly cases , dr van der linden said
colorado springs senator captured a majority of colorado s delegates to the republican national convention on friday , outmaneuvering , whose lack of an organized national campaign once again allowed mr cruz to gain at his expense as the fight for the republican campaign moves into a period in which a handful of delegates could decide the nomination , mr trump s losses here were a troubling sign colorado awards its delegates differently from the way most states do instead of holding a statewide primary the kind of contest mr trump is used to commanding through his dominating and ubiquitous media presence it is using a series of caucuses before this week , registered voters selected local delegates , who tend to be more conservative party loyalists , ones mr trump has had trouble winning over those delegates , in turn , have been voting this week on delegates to the national convention , most of whom are pledging their support to one candidate or another by friday night , mr cruz had taken 21 of the state s 37 national delegates mr trump and gov of ohio had none thirteen others will be decided on saturday at the state convention mr cruz , who has built a statewide network of supporters that includes conservative members of congress , state legislators and grassroots activists , is expected to do well there , too the remaining three delegates are party leaders who are automatically appointed he is the only candidate scheduled to speak to the group mr trump was invited but is not planning to attend mr kasich will send a surrogate , john sununu , the former new hampshire governor last week , mr trump struggled to pick up support at the north dakota republican convention , a process similar to colorado s mr cruz appeared to have at least several backers among the 28 delegates elected there but because they are not officially committed to any candidate , no one could claim a lock on the state s delegation at one of the colorado district caucuses on friday afternoon , the strength of mr cruz s organization was on full display the campaign flew in representative jim bridenstine , republican of oklahoma , to give the crowd a pep talk senator ted cruz has been in the trenches over and over and over again fighting for the conservative constitutional principles that we hold dear , he said delegate candidates strolled up and down the aisles holding cruz campaign signs with their names and ballot position written in marker a small group of trump volunteers wearing blue make america great again hats aided his efforts , passing out their preferred delegate slates and cheering from the back of the ballroom alan cobb , an adviser to the trump campaign who was in colorado springs on friday to manage the delegate efforts , set expectations low a pickup of one delegate would be worthwhile , he said , given how little effort the campaign had put into the state we made the conscious decision back in october that colorado , because of the structure , just did n't make sense for us to invest a lot of time and resources in , he said it does n't lend itself to the kind of campaign we have and the folks who support us after colorado , the trump campaign plans to focus on wyoming , which will name a slate of delegates next weekend the campaign will then turn to larger prizes like pennsylvania , which has a trove of uncommitted delegates who are likely to be a decisive factor in determining the party s nominee
the has concluded that the zika virus in babies born to infected women , which adds to the growing evidence that the virus is a major public health emergency yet republicans in congress are refusing to appropriate the money needed to respond to this crisis a zika outbreak began last year in brazil and has spread to other countries in a paper published in on wednesday , cdc researchers say there is enough evidence to determine that the mosquitoborne virus is causing , a condition in which babies are born with small heads zika has also been linked to neurological disorders in adults president obama in february for more than 18 billion to fight zika , but republican lawmakers refused to act the government should use money that had been appropriated for other diseases , like ebola they have also made vague promises to provide more funds before the begins in october after weeks of fruitless talks with congress , the administration said that it would shift nearly 600 million to antizika efforts from ebola and other programs that is not sufficient and could increase the risk of another outbreak of ebola , which remains a persistent threat the world health organization says there have been of that deadly disease in liberia and guinea recently the federal government has already been forced to for state and local health departments because it needed the money for zika programs congressional inaction is also depriving the fights against and tuberculosis of money lawmakers might be tempted to consider zika a distant threat , but that is a dangerous misconception there could be hundreds of thousands of zika cases in puerto rico , with possibly hundreds of babies affected , , the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases as of wednesday , 475 people were known to have the virus in american territories , 58 of them pregnant women , a smaller number of cases have been reported in states involving people who contracted the virus while traveling medical experts say that zika can spread quickly without warning , in part because most infected people have mild symptoms or none at all the mosquitoes known to spread zika are found in , and experts say florida , louisiana and texas are particularly at risk public health officials say zika can also be transmitted by unprotected sex government researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working on a zika vaccine scientists are also perfecting mosquitoes to produce offspring that die young , but that approach requires more testing in addition to research , programs are needed to prevent infections by encouraging people , especially pregnant women and their families , to protect themselves from mosquitoes and to practice safe sex having learned from its slow response to ebola , the obama administration is trying to move faster against zika but if congress does n't do its job , the public will be put at needless risk

he said , tearing maize , or corn , from ragged stems growing between rows of pumpkins one winter afternoon you invest , and you do n't make money now , though , mr velasco says he plans to expand to meet demand from an unexpected source in new york , los angeles and beyond , a taste for highquality mexican food and its earthy centerpiece , the handmade tortilla , has created a small but growing market for the native , or landrace , corn that is central to life in these plains and to mexican identity santa ana zegache , a zapotec community of about 3 , 000 , is a grid of quiet streets and adobe compounds known for its pugnacious residents and elaborate 17thcentury church farmers here grow darkyellow , white and burgundy corn on small plots , much as they have since the plant was domesticated in thousands of years ago they eat part of what they grow and sell the rest , keeping the seeds for the next season corn is in our roots , said lorenzo gaspar montes , 50 , a police officer who farms seven acres of land in santa ana , citing the mayan myth in which deities created humans from corn grows some 59 varieties of corn and consumes more of the grain per capita than almost anywhere on earth it s in every dish we make , mr montes added the appetite for native maize offers hope to smallholders who have been hammered over the past 20 years by competition from cheap american corn and could save varieties that would otherwise disappear as farmers put down their tools and take off to el norte hundreds of thousands of small growers have given up their farms over the past two decades , after a government program to support prices ended , subsidies targeted larger farms , and free trade with the united states drove down corn prices mexico imports about 10 million tons of corn from the united states a year , nearly a third of what it consumes nearly half of santa ana s men are working in the united states , residents estimated many of those who stayed behind became police officers in oaxaca city , 20 miles north by day , the village is sleepy a group of children playing basketball in the main square a barefoot grandmother shooing a dog from her gate after losing so much to the united states , said mr velasco , the farmer , it makes us very proud that someone from abroad wants to eat our corn mexican cuisine of the blackkingfishwithpineapplepur eandcilantro variety , not the burrito variety has become de rigueur in the past couple of years as top chefs have opened mexican restaurants and taco joints in the united states and europe chefs buy native corn from mexico and grind it inhouse to make masa , or dough , for tortillas , tamales , tlacoyos and tetelas a trend that is also growing in mexico there seems to be no more coveted addition to a restaurant kitchen these days than a hulking metal mill for grinding corn softened with ash or slaked lime daniela sotoinnes , chef de cuisine at , s mexican restaurant in the flatiron district of new york , said she often talked with american chefs about which maize they preferred c nico \? bolita \? chalque o \? a conversation that would have been unimaginable a few years ago cosme imports its corn from , a californiabased company selling mexican corn it was founded in 2014 by jorge gaviria , a former chef who got the farmtotable bug during a stint on an organic pig farm in tuscany mr gaviria , who darts around the mexican countryside buying corn in batches as small as 100 kilos , has about 100 clients in the united states and europe , making him the dominant player on a very small field the company expects to import 400 tons of corn this year , up from 80 tons in 2015 , and plans to open tortiller as on the east and west coasts of the united states if corn really takes off , you could get a repeat of the quinoa story , said mr gaviria , referring to the sudden popularity of the andean grain , as his taxi bumped along a pitted road to mr velasco s farm outside santa ana mr velasco , who harvested about six tons of corn last year , sold half to masienda , for about 60 cents a kilo he kept a ton to feed his family and sold the rest to local consumers for around 50 cents a kilo mr gaspar , the police officer , sold masienda one ton of corn this year , mr velasco will rent more land and sell everything to masienda other than what his family eats the price was less important than the fact that jorge buys the lot , he said martha willcox , a geneticist at the international maize and wheat improvement center near mexico city , said she hoped that demand for landrace corn would give some young people a reason to farm rather than to emigrate if each of these guys reaches 70 and their kids are in the united states , this ends , said dr willcox , gesturing to workers sorting pink cobs of a rare strain , belatove , into neat piles mr gaviria is collaborating with dr willcox and flavio arag n cuevas , a local geneticist , to improve landrace strains and increase the production of varieties that are at risk of dying out because too few people are planting them luis herrera estrella , the director of the national laboratory of genomics for biodiversity in guanajuato state , said that the gourmet maize market had the potential to provide a livelihood for , say , 20 percent of smallholders however , the only way to make most farms viable , he said , was to introduce more technology , including transgenic corn a highly sensitive issue in mexico , where planting genetically modified corn is banned if farmers could not raise their yield above one ton per acre a quarter of the yield of commercial producers in the united states more of them would give up , he said we should try to sustain this way of life and this way of farming using all of the technology at our disposal , dr herrera said if demand continues to grow , there could be risks , experts said local consumers could be priced out , as happened with quinoa farmers could sell their entire crop , and keep none to eat if it just becomes about demand , it will ruin everything , said amado ram rez , an agricultural engineer based in oaxaca city whose project , itanoni , works with corn farmers to improve yields and methods mr ram rez , who said he sold corn to a gourmet taco stand in copenhagen , , said urbanites could disrupt an ancient farming system whose value was cultural , spiritual , economic and ecological mr gaviria said masienda buys only the surplus production of farmers after they have put aside corn for their families it s a subsistence crop , not a cash crop , he said in santa ana zegache , the farmers do not seem to think that their lives will be turned upside down by threestar chefs in manhattan mr velasco said he was just glad to have his crop eaten by humans rather than sheep plus , he said , we 're happy to make some money
in a delightfully perverse bit of programming , the esteemed pianist opened his carnegie hall on wednesday evening , after a hero s welcome from the audience , with mozart s unassuming sonata in c \( k 545 \) in the composer s words , a little piano sonata for beginners mr hamelin , having spent much of his early career exploring pianistic showpieces on the fringes of the repertory , has a commanding technique but there was no sense of slumming or condescension as in his for hyperion , mr hamelin approached the relative simplicities with warmth and affection from there , he upped the ante repeatedly , starting with a fascinating take on mozart , the giga , bolero e variazione , by ferruccio busoni , a composer after any piano virtuoso s heart mr hamelin made easy work of it , again showing his affection for mozart , even once removed then came ravel s gaspard de la nuit , the first of the evening s major pianistic tests ravel proves a supreme colorist in the work s three movements , based on poems by aloysius bertrand ondine , with its billowing , watery flow le gibet \( the gallows \) , desolate in its inexorable tread and , named for a tormenting dwarf scarbo , in particular , is notorious among pianophiles for its difficulties even mr hamelin could be seen to be working hard , though , given his remarkable composure , there was never a fear that anything significant would go wrong much the same could be said of liszt s punishing b minor sonata mr hamelin , summoning tremendous power , played it magisterially , without ever losing sight of the fine thread connecting its various episodes the only slight disappointment of the evening came in mr hamelin s own piece , pavane vari e , tucked in before the liszt disappointment not in the playing , but in the work itself composed in 2014 and performed here in its new york premiere , it is based on a pavane , belle qui tiens ma vie \( beautiful one who holds my life \) , by the 16thcentury composer thoinot arbeau a strikingly beautiful love song , mr hamelin calls it , and that was how it sounded in his initial presentation of the theme , but it was never to be heard with any clarity again here , for whatever reason , mr hamelin lost his taste for simplicity from the first variation , he smothered the gorgeous tune in filigree , apparently harking back to those pianistic showpieces of yore you could occasionally make out wisps of the melody and the harmony , as if in xray , and the piece , as a whole , had logical contours and a certain grandeur , but none of it seemed to have much to do with poor arbeau the audience evidently had no such misgivings mr hamelin offered three encores amid tumultuous ovations a chopin polish song , arranged by liszt gershwin s liza , arranged by earl wild and debussy s prelude feux d'artifice
the nba on friday to an about a fanmade video that highlighted multiple forceful fouls on  the article first appeared online thursday and centered on hsiuchen kuei , 48 , of san jose , calif , whose video , too flagrant not to call , has been viewed on youtube more than one million times in the video , kuei depicts several instances , in which lin was the recipient of hard contact around his head and wonders why no flagrant fouls were called after reviewing our extensive officiating database , we have found no data that suggests jeremy lin is disadvantaged by our officiating staff , the nba wrote in a statement posted to its website the nba s response to the video and article was based on leaguewide foul statistics the league said that over the past three seasons , lin ranked 21st among all players in total drives to the basket , with 1 , 537 , and that he had drawn the seventhhighest number of fouls among the 23 players who attempted more than 1 , 500 drives during those seasons furthermore , the nba wrote , given the infrequency of flagrant fouls \( roughly 1 per every 500 foul calls \) , it is not statistically significant that none of mr lin s 814 fouls drawn were deemed flagrant but kuei was not as concerned about aggregate data or how lin compared with leaguewide totals as she was about specific instances , in which opposing players were not penalized for delivering blows to his head the nba reiterated that it did not believe any of the plays shown in the video which included hard hits on lin from kobe bryant , carmelo anthony and james harden , among others were flagrant fouls
london high above a main thoroughfare in the city of oxford , in an alcove framed by twirly columns , a statue of cecil john rhodes , the archimperialist who shaped britain s empire and the destiny of its farflung subjects in africa , peers down inscrutably on the people below if you were n't looking for it , you might miss it in recent weeks , though , the statue has provoked , as was another monument to him last year , , where he built his fortune and power before his death in 1902 but , , it has sometimes been tempting to ask what it is all about the unhealed wounds of africa s colonial heritage or fears among westerners that their version of history may be sacrificed on an altar of racially tinged revisionism , an echo of an equally fiery debate on some american campuses certainly , it seems beyond dispute that colonialism , along with the slave trade and the encroachment of foreign faiths in lands that had not requested them , burned an enduring scar on africa s selfregard and selfesteem but , said , who does not want the statue pulled down , our history is not a blank page on which we can write our own version of what it should have been according to our contemporary views and prejudices as africa peers into the uncertainties of 2016 , there seems to be a disconnect between the preoccupation with the past at oxford , where rhodes studied intermittently between 1873 and 1881 , and the continent s broader concerns in the present consider , for instance , the , the capital of burkina faso , last week that killed at least 30 people , which underscored two of the continent s most pressing challenges the spread of jihadism and recurrent threats to its democratic renewal in light of such onslaughts , said , a zimbabwean filmmaker , the months to come may be a nervous year in which the african union must harness what collective power it has to protect its citizens from the biggest madness of the millennium the attack came just days after the inauguration of president roch marc christian kabor , who won in decades a marked contrast to contests in rwanda , uganda and zimbabwe , where incumbents have shown little interest in relinquishing power elsewhere , many african countries may well be concluding that their continent is as much a hostage to the economic and political maneuvers of outsiders as it was in rhodes s day this time , though , it is china s economic retreat that has sent shock waves through africa , shaking the markets on which mineralproducing nations depend for export earnings , weakening their currencies and threatening jobs , living standards and political stability none of that , of course , diminishes the passions of the campaign to consign the contentious statue of rhodes in oxford to the same fate as , say , monuments honoring saddam hussein in baghdad some activists argue that its removal would be a form of spiritual decolonization , a notion that has also provoked debate whereas the real decolonizers sought to throw off the yoke of history , said , a writer and broadcaster , rhodes must fall' campaigners appear to have let the past recolonize them in his will , rhodes created a trust that has allowed nearly to study at oxford for over a century in 2003 , himself endorsed a body called the mandela rhodes foundation in conjunction with the original trust to benefit poorer south africans some questioned the twinning of the names , but mr mandela demurred we shall once more that others may deem unbridgeable , he said for a newer generation , it seems , the statue of rhodes on its plinth above oxford s high street is simply a bridge too far
washington the islamic state calls them inghimasi zealous foot soldiers who intend to fight to their deaths and as the americanbacked coalition has reclaimed territory from the group in , that fervor has kept prisoners from being much of a problem the shooting only stops when almost every islamic state fighter has been killed but that could change as the coalition moves toward the islamic state s largest urban strongholds mosul , iraq , and raqqa , syria raising a potential problem for the united states if the coalition is successful and thousands of ordinary members of a collapsing islamic state have nowhere left to retreat , will they start to surrender in greater numbers \? and if so , who will be responsible for imprisoning them \? after the experiences of the past decade in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the obama administration is determined not to revive largescale detention operations but it is far from clear whether allies on the ground especially rebels in syria are prepared to hold large numbers of prisoners , raising the prospect of an ugly aftermath to any victory if they 're not killed but detained , we are concerned about the standards of care , who would do it and how it would be done , peter maurer , the president of the international committee of the red cross , said in an interview william k lietzau , who oversaw detention policy at the pentagon from 2010 until 2013 , said there was widespread opposition in the upper levels of the obama administration to conducting wartime detention but the alternative , he said , could lead to war crimes if americanbacked local fighters encounter more potential prisoners than they can handle if the numbers start climbing , they 're going to shoot them and you 'll never hear about it , mr lietzau said no one wants a repetition of the chaos that occurred in afghanistan during the in december 2001 , of taliban prisoners of war who had surrendered to forces loyal to an americanbacked warlord were killed yet while international human rights groups say they , too , are concerned about the humane treatment of detainees , there appears to be little desire among them for the united states to run a new wartime prison such groups have spent the past decade criticizing abuses at the former prison operations at bagram air base in afghanistan and at abu ghraib in iraq , as well as at the prison at guant namo bay , cuba , which is still open american officials , for similar reasons , have said they do not want the responsibility for handling large numbers of islamic state captives the united states does not intend to engage in the longterm detention of isil detainees , nor will we send any such detainees to the detention facility at guant namo bay , said myles caggins , a national security council spokesman , using the government s preferred acronym for the islamic state , also known as isis in a recent interview , falih alessawi , the head of the security committee in anbar , iraq , said that when iraqi security forces recently , they detained 1 , 870 people of those , he said , about 300 have confessed to being members of the islamic state , while the rest maintained they were civilians but so far , capturing an islamic state fighter after a battle has been rare most of the foreign militants are either suicide bombers with suicide vests or car bombs , mr essawi said many of them were killed in the coalition airstrikes or iraqi air force strikes or killed in the battles , and some of them have withdrawn to other areas it is also possible that islamic state fighters and other members would try to hide , throw away their weapons and melt into the local population , said mr maurer , of the red cross christoph wilcke , a human rights watch researcher who specializes in iraq , said that scenario could permit islamic state fighters who are responsible for specific atrocities like the in 2014 to escape prosecution i am interested in detention issues for the sake of justice , mr wilcke said the alternative would be sweeping up large numbers of people , taking them to a holding facility , and attempting through interrogations to identify them and determine what they had done but who has the legal authority to prosecute people in the anarchic regions of syria is not clear and whoever takes custody of prisoners would become responsible for coming up with a longterm plan for any detainees deemed to be dangerous but who for some reason cannot be prosecuted , because of a lack of admissible evidence , or repatriated , because they might be tortured such problems have bedeviled the obama administration s attempt to close the prison at guant namo bay and there would also be a diplomatic complication the islamic state has attracted thousands of followers from many countries , including from europe , raising the prospect of negotiations with foreign powers that have different standards and levels of interest in how their own nationals are handled the potential for a large number of prisoners presenting these kinds of challenges for somebody has been raised at planning meetings for months both inside the obama administration and with coalition partners , according to officials familiar with internal deliberations but with no good options , the obama administration s default policy is to take custody of the highestvalue detainees for interrogation , something the united states has done only twice with islamic state prisoners both were later moved to kurdish prisons the assumption is that the shiitedominated iraqi government or the iraqi kurdish forces will hold and , if appropriate , prosecute any suspected foot soldiers and sympathizers they capture we 're not equipped for longterm detention , said col steve warren , the spokesman for the american military forces in baghdad we 're not set up here for that , so we 're not in that business mr wilcke , the human rights watch researcher , said that his group has received some accounts of abuses in kurdish prisons , and more frequent and severe accounts of abuses in governmentrun prisons in iraq he also pointed to an iraqi trial of 40 people who were accused of being islamic state members and were sentenced to death in a brief proceeding in february human rights groups criticized the trial as a sham process that relied on  if you ask me if they have a plan or the capacity to hold these people , my answer would be look at how they have dealt with sympathizers in kurdistan , there has been no due process , and in baghdad , stark violations like torture and sentencing 40 people to death in two hours , he said i do n't think there is much planning going on at any level and whatever the shortcomings of the iraqi authorities , there are more problems in syria , where the united states is working with rebel militias known as the syrian democratic forces , or sdf , but not with the government of president bashar alassad we take the treatment of detainees very seriously and have every reason to believe the sdf will do so , as well , colonel warren said but pressed to say what the american plan is for any suspected rankandfile islamic state members who may be captured by the syrian democratic forces , he said there was none , noting that the united statesled coalition does not provide direct supervision over their detention practices it s clearly a dilemma , said raha wala , the director of national security advocacy at human rights first on the one hand , detention operations post9 11 have been incredibly problematic from a treatment and legal position but on the other hand , the answer ca n't be simply to wash our hands of it and turn over operations to local partners who may not follow the same principles that western governments would follow in terms of adherence to human rights norms so you 're sort of in between a rock and a hard place
berlin after the horror in brussels , europe is mourning once more rightly , the states of the are also focused on bringing the perpetrators to justice and preventing a followup attack cooperating more effectively on counterterrorism while tightening security at airports and train stations would be a start but we must not lose sight of the bigger picture the islamic state s goal in brussels was to scare us and drive a wedge between us , and it seems to be succeeding here in germany , and across the continent , rightwing , antiimmigration parties are calling for their nations to turn inward , away from one another in italy , the antiimmigrant northern league wants an immediate closure of borders and mosques the prime minister of poland , beata szydlo , doubts that her nation of 40 million can meet its commitment to take in 400 refugees this year meanwhile , nigel farage , head of the uk independence party , suggests that the attacks prove that his country would be safer outside the european union these appeals to emotion play into the terrorists' hands just when what europe must do is face its shared challenges with new unity at home , and a new readiness to act in the middle east within europe , it is time for a comprehensive compromise , and my own country , germany , should set the example germany cannot urge solidarity on the refugee question without giving ground on the economic and energy issues that divide the european union concretely , that means accepting budget deficits that exceed european union limits in countries like france and italy that are suffering from high unemployment among the young it also means reevaluating plans to expand the nord stream pipeline system that runs from russia to germany , bypassing poland and other eastern member states , who see in this a threat to their energy security only by making concessions in these areas can we create the basis for a compromise about refugee acceptance that includes fair distribution of asylum seekers throughout the european union as for the middle east , it s important not to conflate the question of how to treat the people fleeing war and terror in syria , iraq or afghanistan with that of how to combat the radical militants who receive inspiration and training in those countries and it s important to remember that the brussels attacks , like the last november , appear to have been carried out by citizens of european countries defeating that internal threat requires reaching out to muslim communities that feel marginalized , with too many young men who , seeing no prospects , fall victim to the siren song of jihadism nevertheless , it is clear how directly events in the middle east can affect our stability our disputes over how to treat asylum seekers are straining european unity as never before and just as events in the middle east are confronting europe with enormous challenges to meet together , the region is becoming less vital for the united states in the atlantic last month , the journalist jeffrey goldberg reported that president obama sees the middle east as no longer terribly important to american interests and not amenable to america s efforts to improve it , and therefore a place where america risks its credibility and power when its efforts lead to warfare and american deaths that is an assessment shared by many americans it reflects longterm trends like america s growing independence from middle eastern oil , the comparatively greater challenge posed by china s rise and the increasing economic importance of asia and latin america so any assumption that the united states will take the lead on every issue is outdated if europeans are not prepared to take on more responsibility , the west may lose its ability to shape events in the middle east how should europeans adapt \? how should we respond to this paradigm shift \? first , the european union must be willing to commit more money to the region we must improve conditions in refugee camps in countries like jordan and lebanon , where a euro goes about 30 times as far as it would in germany we must invest more in the region s economic future , particularly in the young democracy of tunisia if young north africans see stability and prosperity in their own communities , they are far less likely to feel pressed to emigrate second , europe needs a unified middle east policy that takes care of our own security we have no lack of institutions rather , we suffer from a lack of will and a reluctance to discard antiquated notions of national prestige in foreign policy because individual member states so frequently act alone , our union of 500 million people punches below its weight for example , a recent french proposal to restart israelipalestinian peace talks , with the goal of a twostate solution , would have been stronger coming from the socalled e4 1 , a grouping of france , britain , italy , germany and the european union s high representative for foreign affairs this grouping needs to play a permanent role in middle eastern affairs its first order of business should be working with the united states to persuade russia to forgo using its veto and allow the creation of humanitarian zones in syria under a united nations mandate since these zones will need military protection , europe would then have to back up its diplomatic initiative by contributing troops to an international peacekeeping mission libya , too , requires more political and military engagement european training and support for local moderate forces could make a vital contribution toward stemming chaos in a country just 300 miles from italian soil finally , the new reality demands that we preserve the validity of the transatlantic partnership in the 21st century more help from the united states on the refugee question namely , accepting many more refugees would be very welcome at the same time , european politicians must tell their voters that , as the united states pivots away from the middle east , europe will have to bear a greater burden , because so much is at stake for us in the end , of course , europe wo n't be able to solve every problem alone the united states will remain a major force in both the middle east and europe , and the west will need to work together to ensure common interests vital on both sides of the atlantic for example , that iran sticks to the terms of the nuclear deal , and that a newly assertive russia is restrained none of this will be easy , but i do not believe we have a choice for the bombs that exploded in belgium on march 22 were aimed not just at the people of brussels , but at european unity and ideals we cannot , and will not , allow terrorism to tear europe apart
the slate of best new artist nominees at the 2011 grammy awards was the most stacked in recent memory justin bieber , a teen heartthrob who would go on to become the only relevant solo male pop star of the 2010s so far drake , at the beginning of his quest to fully meld hiphop and rb mumford sons , a band that delivered roots rock with arena muscle and florence the machine , glam artrock innovators , of course , was none of these artists it was , a jazz singer and bassist who had released her third intimate album certainly , the national academy of recording arts and sciences the governing body that administers the grammy awards has oodles of jazz aficionados among its members \( all of whom can vote in any category they desire \) and certainly ms spalding plays with earthiness and infectious vim but her win also smacked of a phenomenon that routinely afflicts the grammys , which despite years decades of curveball winners , remains the music industry s most coveted honor it showed that maybe the most powerful contingent of grammy voters are people who vote against the obvious choice let s call them the deniers , voters who , as much as they are voting for an artist to win , are voting for another one or several others to lose this is kanye west and amy winehouse for album of the year in 2008 , or green day and , again , kanye west in the same category three years earlier it s the fact that three of the best album nominees in 2013 were it s the in 2009 \( certainly , had ms spalding not been nominated in 2011 , you could have counted on mumford sons , the most traditional act in the lot , to win \) at the 58th annual grammy awards on monday night , it might mean olderfashioned acts like alabama shakes or chris stapleton beating kendrick lamar or the weeknd it happens frustratingly often such gestures are often votes against change , against the natural evolution of pop music the act of denial verges on jury nullification like any awards , the grammys reflect the biases of the people who take part in it , a human process beset by human weakness and at this point , it s a truism that the grammys carry a heavy bias against youthoriented genres like teenpop and hiphop voting membership in the academy skews old , as it often does with bigumbrella organizations of this sort and in this world and perhaps nowhere else there remains a perceived divide between music made before and during the modern era of extreme studio manipulation that s a big reason why , especially in categories that span all genres , hiphop and mainstream pop have fared so poorly \( and when pop acts have won , or younger acts of any kind , it s generally because they pledge fealty to older ways of doing things \) in the world of pop music consumption , the deniers \( or those like them \) are a relative minority but in the cloistered world of grammy voters , they represent something much closer to the majority \( the academy does not release demographic information about voters \) there have been backlashes to this state of affairs before , mr west said , i do n't care about the grammys i just would like for the statistics to be more accurate he added i do n't want them to rewrite history right in front of us at least , not on my clock this year the awards do have a chance to make a change , with 11 opportunities to win in nine categories prestige is a funny thing , especially since it s often conferred upon one generation by the preceding one , which almost certainly believes in and upholds a different set of values satisfying your fans and also your elders may be an impossible balancing act that s not to say elders are without merit , or vision or even a sense of justice viewed more generously , the votes of the deniers are votes for the underdog why use the grammys to celebrate someone who sells oodles of albums and gets ample radio play when the show can shine a light on a deserving artist generally ignored by the spotlight \? and it should be said ms spalding is a genuine talent , deserving of acclaim but depressingly often , the grammys end up the site of a sad battle an older generation wielding its fading power to spite the younger generation given that it s the highestprofile show of its kind , the awards rarely feel balanced , or reflective of the now instead , the enterprise ends up being a safe space for the passions of the few a vanishing subculture acting out in plain sight
lagos , nigeria the collapsed price of is putting pressure on oil exporters around the world , from canada to kuwait but perhaps no country is less prepared to survive prices at about 30 a barrel than , which until a few years ago relied heavily on petroleum exports for its revenue while countries like saudi arabia and russia have saved past oil profits for rainy days , nigeria has no such insulation what s worse is that nigeria is especially dependent on imports of basic goods the cracks are starting to show while the official rate does n't reflect it , nigeria s currency , the naira , is the world s worst performing this year the economic troubles could hardly have come at a worse time last year , nigerians elected muhammadu buhari as president after he ran on a zealous anticorruption platform unfortunately , mr buhari s insistence on maintaining the peg at the current official exchange rate is not only crippling production , it is also encouraging corruption he should abandon it as soon as possible and allow the naira to devalue nigeria has pegged the naira to the dollar for decades , adjusting the exchange rate according to international supply and demand but even as nigeria s economy has faltered , since last spring the peg has remained fixed at around 1985 naira to the dollar this rate is being maintained at the president s insistence , undermining any notion of central bank independence to keep the rate fixed , the central bank has to preserve its foreign currency reserves , a difficult task as oil export revenue has fallen how does it do that \? by making it more difficult for nigerians to obtain hard currency at the official rate primarily , the central bank has restricted access to foreign currency to importers who can demonstrate that the goods they 're bringing into nigeria are necessary but nigerians are innovative a large parallel currency exchange has taken shape , in which importers trade naira for dollars at up to twice the official rate the trade is too blatant to be called a black market last month , for example , i saw several currency exchange businesses at the lagos airport that offered 380 naira to the dollar nigerian newspapers even include reports of the unofficial exchange rate the buhari government hopes that the fixed exchange rate will prevent inflation yet inflation has risen sharply to the highest rates in almost five years the prices of many imported goods have almost doubled , suggesting that they reflect the black market exchange rate rather than the official rate i recently saw this problem firsthand when i visited one of the country s largest manufacturers of cardboard box packaging its production lines were either slowed or shut down thousands of employees were seeing their hours , and wages , cut back in some cases , the company had been unable to import materials like labels in other cases , the company s customers had run out of items to box this is how bad policy turns a currency crisis into a recession what s more , rationing foreign currency creates the wrong type of competition as imports become more expensive , nigeria s companies should be looking for new ways to produce with fewer imports they 're not instead , businessmen are trying to use their political networks to compel the central bank to sell them dollars at the low official rate , to deny dollars to their competitors , or both the economist recently reported that bank officials levy a 30 percent charge for the favor not only are these schemes a bad use of entrepreneurial cunning , they also undermine hopes for the corruptionfree nigeria this president promised mr buhari says that devaluing the naira would hurt too much , that the imports on which nigerians depend would become expensive , and rising prices would damage households across society usually , the pain of devaluation comes with a silver lining of promoting exports but nigeria hardly exports anything other than oil and gas in fact , it often ca n't produce what it needs for itself , even goods it should be exporting , like cereals and gasoline in other words , as mr buhari notes , devaluing the naira would bring about the worst effects of a weak currency , inflation , and provide none of the best , like increased exports mr buhari must be frustrated his predecessor , goodluck jonathan , enjoyed oil prices over 100 for most of his presidency and oversaw some of the highest government revenues in nigeria s history he also issued three bonds on international markets in favorable global capital markets conditions at the time were excellent for building nigeria s domestic production capacity mr jonathan also presided over a systematic looting of the public coffers swollen by borrowing and the oil surplus in his presidency , is said to have vanished from the national oil company the rest of the surplus expanded government payrolls , especially in the runup to elections , and funded questionable building projects , often never finished mr buhari s administration has proposed a sensible budget , issued plans for incentives to invest in agriculture and mining , and is seeking investors to build more energy infrastructure but none of these plans will be possible if the government maintains an artificial exchange rate if mr buhari really wants to build credible and transparent institutions , he should start by giving the central bank the independence to manage the currency and foreign reserves and get it out of the business of deciding what goods can and cannot be imported , or which firms can obtain foreign currency mr buhari has loudly proclaimed his commitment to fighting corruption but his view that he can protect nigeria s economy from global macroeconomic headwinds through an exchange rate peg borders on superstition he has been told that his anticorruption campaign is not an economic policy , but he may be more interested to hear that his economic policy is a petri dish for corruption
thanks to stone readers who submitted a response there were more than 10 , 000 to my article , are these 10 lies justified \? judging from the number of replies , the task of determining when it is or is not acceptable to lie is obviously one that many people have faced in their own lives many of you gave your own examples of lies told and why you believed they were or were not justified it was heartening to find so many people prepared to reason thoughtfully about important moral issues with few exceptions , readers disagreed with me about the legitimacy of one or more of the lies , all of which i believe are justified \( you can revisit the original article , here \) the results , as well as the original scenarios that you were asked to respond to , are below a man lies to his wife

couple claiming to be married with two children and an income that was sufficient to pay the rent would try to rent a house if they were told that the house was not available , a white tester couple with the same family and economic profile would be sent if they were offered the rental there would be persuasive evidence of racial discrimination  in order to test whether arthroscopic surgery improved the conditions of patients knees a study was done in which half the patients were told the procedure was being done but it was not little cuts were made in the knees , the doctors talked as if it were being done , sounds were produced as if the operation were being done the patients were under light anesthesia it turned out that the same percentage of patients reported pain relief and increased mobility in the real and sham operations the patients were informed in advance that they either would receive a real or a sham operation  we heap exaggerated praise on our children all the

president kennedy gave a conference when asked whether he had discussed any matters other than cuban missiles with the soviets he absolutely denied it in fact , he had promised that the united states would remove missiles from turkey  a woman s husband drowned in a car accident when the car plunged off a bridge into a body of water it was clear from the physical evidence that he desperately tried to get out of the car and died a dreadful death at the hospital where his body was brought his wife asked the physician in attendance what kind of death her husband suffered he replied , he died immediately from the impact of the crash he did not suffer i had a chance to read through a selection of the comments that went along with your answers and i d like to reply to some of them here , and in some cases , question those answers in cases where i quote responses , we ve edited slightly for clarity and continuity some of the disagreements arose from the stated definition of a lie i used a lie is saying something that one believes to be false with the intention of getting someone else to believe it is true some people challenged the definition others accepted it but claimed that , according to it , some of my lies were not lies here is an example i would urge that none of these cases constitute lying in the philosophically relevant sense in ordinary discourse we might indeed refer to any or all of these actions as lying the original definition is too broad if i lie in the morally unacceptable sense i do not merely intend that the other believes something false , but i do so primarily to serve my own purposes , not his i would not claim that my definition is the only legitimate way of defining a lie one objection is that it cannot encompass baldfaced lies like the child with his hand caught in the cookie jar who insists he is not taking a cookie but i do think that on methodological grounds we should not build into our definition the judgment that lies are wrong in the reader s proposed definition it is built into the definition of an unacceptable lie that it serves the liar s purposes not the hearers since the wellknown theoretical lie to the nazi at the front door does not serve his nefarious interest this makes the lie unacceptable by the reader s definition that sort of moral judgment that should not be settled by a definition here one reader accepted my definition , but claimed that my lies do not fall under it many of your examples are actually not lies by your own definition many of your scenarios are situations where the person being told the mistruth is not expected to believe in the long run , but only temporarily if we intend that the misdirection be only temporary and be done for justifiable reasons , most people wouldn t consider it a lie i regard this as a very important point about the justification of lies but one that should not be built into the definition of a lie yes , the lie told to the wife about where she was going \( to her surprise party \) will be revealed as a lie very shortly , and that may be an important part of its justification but why say it is not a lie at all \? now to the substantive disagreements let me start with the scenario where a woman lies at a job interview about planning to have a family , since i was fairly confident about it and was much less so after reading the responses here are two that made me think one wrote i was a bit conflicted on how to answer this , being a woman who has been asked this very question when i was in my 20s , i could easily side with either answer and would not consider it a lie of terrible consequence but i think that it bodes well for us to deal with difficult situations in truthful ways , facing discomfort , so that we build on forging a stronger , more secure voice i now say answer yes then query the heck out of the questioner how will this affect my chances of securing the position \? how many other women have you hired that have answered yes \? etc and another wrote in responding to the questions as she did , the woman is tacitly accepting an institutional structure that is unfair to women she may get the job in the specific instance , but other women applying for similar positions might still have such inappropriate questions asked to them if , instead , the woman responded that it was none of the department s business , and was denied the position on what appears to be discriminatory grounds , she can bring a discrimination lawsuit i do not think this is a case where the woman is obliged to lie at most it is permissible for her to lie and permissible for her to tell the truth to argue that it is not permissible to lie means that she must put more general considerations , such as challenging unjust situations , ahead of her own legitimate career ambitions but i do appreciate the first reader s views about building a voice , and character , to deal with difficult and uncomfortable situations the lie which dealt with the decision of a doctor to tell a woman that her husband died painfully was the one that received the most dissenting votes it was close to a 50 50 split i was pretty ambivalent as well about this one another reader wrote the wife would be unlikely to find out the true circumstances of her husband s death , but we cannot be certain and i am unsure i have the right to decide whether she should have the information another person wrote the doctor lies out of a paternalistic instinct to protect , denying the woman agency and dignity a third person i cannot know whether in such a situation the woman would prefer the truth or the lie i cannot make that decision for her others spoke of damaging the trust between doctors and patients what is interesting here is that people can have quite different bases for thinking the lie impermissible the first person is worried about the trust issue even though it is unlikely this lie would be found out but she adds to her argument that she may not have the right to determine whether the woman should know the truth or not the second person appeals to a kantian theme of respecting the agency and dignity of any rational agent the third person raises what for me is the crucial issue is the woman s request a genuine appeal for the truth or does she really want to be told what would cause her the least suffering going forward \? this then leads to the further question of whether , if she wants to be lied to , we ought to act in accordance with her wishes or not my own view is that the case is difficult because of our uncertainty about what the woman is really asking if we were certain she wanted the truth , and that she would not be haunted for years by reenactments in her mind of the death , we ought not to lie but if it were certain she wanted her own hopes for an instant death to be confirmed , it is permissible to do so the scenario concerning what to tell a child about his parents death is a case in which some people disagreed because of their views of what is likely to happen to the child in the future one reader said that telling the weakened child that his parents were alive was a devastating lie that can do a lot of psychological damage later , even though it may help in the short term another wrote , telling him the truth at this juncture does nothing for him there is no harm to him from having this knowledge delayed , and there may be great benefit a middle ground \( withholding information \) was suggested by another , who said that lying to the child gives conflicting information which will confuse his recovery further down the road it would be more appropriate to delay giving any information , rather than providing false information note that the readers disagree among themselves about whether the consequences for the child s welfare would be promoted or hindered by being lied to my own view is heavily influenced by what i believe about the consequences of the lie but , in my case , there is a further issue one of the major reasons for opposing lying is that it is an interference with the autonomy or agency of the person being lied to in the case of a young child and here there may be disagreements about where to draw the line in terms of age the child is either not autonomous at all or has relatively little autonomy therefore , i am much more willing to consider the issue in terms of the good or bad consequences of lying some readers suggested alternative things that the child could be told let s talk about it when you are feeling stronger i agree that if that would satisfy the child until he was stronger it would be better than lying the general point here is that two people who seem to have a moral disagreement about the morality of lying may be instead having an empirical disagreement about what the consequences are of a particular lie many readers reasoned in terms of general frameworks for thinking about the morality of lying the lie about the job interview brings up the concept of lying for selfbenefit , and the idea that perhaps being truly moral for its own sake is a pointless endeavor i believe the actual value of being moral needs to be investigated i would hold that these lies increase happiness and diminish suffering , so are warranted as for the lie told by president kennedy , it seems to me perfectly clear that an official acting in that capacity is dutybound to his post the woman who lies in the job interview lies for her own sake out of a belief that her employer will be unable or unwilling to act morally , implicitly denying the employer s ability to make a moral choice she treats the employer as a means to employment only , rather than as a fellow human being for me truth seeking making isn t so much about right or wrong but what works for being a satisfied , competent and substantially rich human being what we tell other humans in the course of our lives ought to be the truth , even when it is painful , because they deserve to live in a real world where they know as much as possible the debate is really about how an action is described in the first place a determination that depends crucially on an assessment of the actor s motivation another reader referenced the great essay by adrienne rich , on lies , secrets and silence rich emphasizes the importance of truthtelling for being in an honorable relationship with another person it means that most of the time i am eager , longing for the possibility of telling you , we both know that we are trying , all the time , to extend the possibilities of truth between us we find here almost every position that has ever been put forward by philosophers to explain what is wrong with lies , when they are wrong the first comment suggests a strategy that has not been examined sufficiently the idea that one way of justifying a lie is to accept that it cannot be morally justified but that we sometimes are permitted to ignore morality in the pursuit of certain valuable ends that are fundamental to our life my own view is that there is no one factor that makes all wrongful lies wrong some lies are wrong because they have bad consequences some lies are wrong because they betray trust some are wrong because they are the outcome of vicious traits such as cowardice or selfishness some are wrong because they deny the autonomy of rational agents this makes the development of ethical theories more complicated than one would wish but as einstein \( quoting the physicist ludwig boltzmann \) , once observed , if you are out to

washington speaker on tuesday forcefully denounced s refusal to distance himself from the former leader david duke but mr ryan did not shift from his position that he would support mr trump if he became the s presidential nominee , a perplexing contradiction that reflects the growing anxiety on capitol hill over the billionaire businessman s ascent if a person wants to be the nominee of the , there can be no evasion and no games , mr ryan told reporters in washington after his weekly meeting with house republicans they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry this party does not prey on people s prejudices we appeal to their highest ideals this is the party of lincoln mr ryan , who did not mention mr trump by name , brought into sharp relief the intense struggle facing congressional republicans especially those in tough reelection fights as they move to simultaneously run from mr trump s positions and largely proclaim fealty to his increasingly possible rise to the top of their ticket let me make it perfectly clear , senate republicans condemn david duke and the kkk , and his racism , senator , republican of kentucky and the majority leader , said tuesday on capitol hill that is not the view of republicans that have been elected to the united states senate , and i condemn his comments in the most forceful way mr mcconnell stopped short of saying what only a very few congressional republicans have said that he will not pull the lever for mr trump if he is the nominee the inherent paradox of renouncing a candidate you also provisionally support was raised tuesday to near contortionist levels for instance , republicans now repeatedly say they must support any republican nominee over a democrat largely to protect the supreme court seat that opened up with the death of justice antonin scalia , a position that mr mcconnell says they will not agree to fill until after the election any republican nominee is going to have a better supreme court nominee , said senator cory gardner , republican of colorado , moments after he said his first job was to show america that trump is a wolf in sheep s clothing but republicans acknowledge that they have no proof that mr trump would pick the conservative jurist they crave to wit mr trump has repeatedly embraced policies and political figures disliked by his party he that paul volcker , the former chairman of the federal reserve , whose policies fueled the recession in president ronald reagan s first term and who then became a trusted economic adviser to the presidential candidate barack obama , was a great pick for the nation s central bank job congressional republicans dominated by the party s conservative wing dislike many of mr trump s policies , are out of step with their frontrunner on social issues and are embarrassed by his antics yet they insist that at the end of the long , arduous day , none of those traits would be disqualifying we will have to work on changing some of his ideas , said senator orrin g hatch , republican of utah , smiling weakly he s a good businessman and many said that while his views were at odds with voters in their states , mr trump s overall candidacy was not , and so they would support him if for no other reason than they will need his voters , too i have a primary , said senator johnny isakson , republican of georgia , who added he would not endorse anyone in the race it is almost as if republicans are dating someone they will not introduce to their mother , but have reluctantly agreed to marry because they cannot do better for a group with 9 percent favorables telling people how to vote , said senator jeff flake , republican of arizona , an outspoken critic of mr trump , i do n't think that s going to work one exception is senator ben sasse , the freshman republican from nebraska , who began a oneman attack on mr trump , explaining why he would never vote for him a house republican , representative scott rigell of virginia , did proclaim tuesday that love for our country eclipses my loyalty to our party as he declared he would never support a nominee so lacking in the judgment , temperament and character needed to be our nation s commander in chief but mr rigell has already announced his retirement at the end of the year yet for all the wishful thinking about mr trump s imminent demise they said repeatedly that even if he cleaned up in tuesday s primaries , he could still lose the nomination fight republicans have not strongly coalesced around an alternative many senate republicans were behind the nowfailed campaign of former gov jeb bush of florida support for other candidates has been scattered senator marco rubio of florida has the endorsement of about a dozen senators , while senator ted cruz has none still , they press on it s not going to be , snapped the usually affable mr gardner , who is trying to elevate mr rubio mr mcconnell , who has spent much of his public life pressing against the most flagrant bigotry in politics , is in a particularly tough spot by not fully dismissing mr trump s candidacy over the david duke episode and while mr ryan has been careful to try to ignore mr trump s gardenvariety outbursts and name calling , he becomes agitated over remarks that he feels violate the inclusiveness of the party this is fundamental , mr ryan said and if someone wants to be our nominee , they must understand this i hope this is the last time i need to speak out on this race democrats are using the issue to pummel republicans senator harry reid of nevada , the minority leader , was sharply critical of mr ryan on tuesday and his refusal to say he would not support mr trump talk is cheap , mr reid sneered

belfair , wash a gunman who killed four people at a home in rural washington state called an officer he previously encountered to say he had shot his family , leading to an hourslong standoff friday that ended with his suicide , the authorities said a 12yearold girl related to the victims survived and was taken to the hospital for an evaluation , the mason county sheriff s chief deputy , ryan spurling said her condition was not immediately known the officer who took the shooter s call went to the home across puget sound from seattle with another deputy the authorities negotiated with the man for about three hours before a swat team entered the house in a heavily wooded area and found the bodies the gunman apparently came outside the home and shot himself , sheriff casey salisbury said it s a terrible tragedy the identities of the gunman and the victims were not released jack pigott , who lives down the road , said he heard gunshots thursday night but none friday the couple who lived in the house about 25 miles southwest of seattle were in their 40s and had been married for four or five years , mr pigott said the wife had two teenage sons who were adopted from russia during a previous marriage she also had a daughter who was adopted from china mr pigott said the husband had a heating and air conditioning contractor business he had recently been hospitalized , mr pigott said , but he did not know why when he returned home , he was on a lot of medications , mr pigott said of the man it was common for the family to do shooting practice , mr pigott said , and that is what he thought of when he heard the gunfire i was getting a load of wood into the house , and i hear some gunshots , he said four or five , a pause and then another round
if republican party leaders dislike donald j trump so much , why have n't they done more to stop him \? they should be able to in the party decides , a book i wrote in 2008 with marty cohen , david karol and john zaller , we argued that the leaders of party coalitions have great influence over the selection of a presidential nominee before then , the conventional wisdom was that such broad and diverse coalitions of politicians , activists and interest groups within parties were largely shut out of the nominating process by primaries and caucuses in the 1970s this led to a freeforall among narrowly factional candidates in 1976 , jimmy carter emerged from a crowded field to win the nomination despite having no connections to most leaders in the national party we argued that since that 1976 contest , party leaders had been exerting influence by coordinating on their choice during the invisible primary the period before any voting when the leaders observed , met with and vetted candidates then supporting that candidate throughout the process when party leaders work together , they nearly always win , we said the book s argument became influential the party decides was the mostcited and the mostmaligned book of this election cycle by nate silver while we stand by the theoretical contributions of the book , events in 2016 show that it has earned some of its criticism this year s election has not followed our script mr trump is the clear frontrunner , but is loathed by the party establishment until the past week , almost no nationally prominent republicans had endorsed him another top candidate , senator ted cruz , is no more popular with republican leaders party leaders have been obsessing and scheming , but until recently , they had barely taken any action they seem to have finally settled on senator marco rubio , far later than we would have expected if mr rubio wins , it would be at best a partial victory for the party decides the parties converged on a favorite candidate early in eight of nine contested nominations from 1980 to 2000 , with that selected candidate winning all eight since then , in only two out of six races has the favored candidate won either the theory was wrong all along , or at the very least , we need to think harder about why the party leaders can coordinate sometimes and not at other times here are some possible explanations for one , the invisible primary has become far more visible , with more televised debates that have greater audiences and more media scrutiny by early 1999 , for example , party leaders had evaluated and chosen to back george w bush long before most people had turned their attention to the nomination in contrast , by 2007 , the parties' conversations about the candidates were entirely public together , the two parties in the 2008 campaign several factors the fragmented media market , super pacs , new media have made it easier for factions both within and outside the party to coordinate on their own the tea party and the progressive movement can empower candidates like rand paul , ted cruz and bernie sanders campaign finance laws have undermined parties and empowered individual candidates most think newt gingrich and rick santorum lasted longer in 2012 than they would have without super pacs in several contests , party leaders were hesitant to challenge candidates who appeared to have independent support in the 2004 democratic contest , most party leaders did not want howard dean as the nominee , but his fundraising was impressive it took mr dean s failure in the iowa caucuses to embolden party leaders to back john kerry that the evolving political environment would give the party leaders trouble is no surprise the invisible primary itself evolved as a response to the 1970s reforms , but it took party leaders a few cycles to work it out they may yet work out these changes as well even without those obstacles , coordination was going to be especially difficult for republican leaders in 2016 to see why , look no further than the house of representatives in october , house republicans struggled to find a speaker who could win the support of the conservative as well as more mainstream party members that same cleavage is now doing for the presidential nomination what it did for the routine in congress we argued in the book that you should think of the party as a collection of different , often competing groups that nevertheless find ways to bridge their differences right now , the largest divide is between those groups that some call party regulars , or the establishment , and more ideological groups the tea party , religious conservatives and other movement conservatives jeb bush was a clear early choice among many regulars , but he was just as clearly not the choice of movement conservatives and mr cruz , rejected by the national party , has been embraced by many movement conservatives before voting began , mr cruz led in endorsements from politicians at the state level , where the tea party movement has been most effective we argued that the party wants a candidate who is acceptable to all factions , not just half of them mr cruz or mr bush is \( or was \) the first choice of his own group , but unacceptable to the other s neither is the choice of the whole party who could appeal to both sides , the way that speaker paul ryan has tried to do in the house \? would it be scott walker , mr rubio , mr christie , or someone else \? the party never really decided i suspect many party members were just waiting for mr trump to go away they wanted to evaluate the field without him but mr trump never faded , and now they find themselves well into the primaries without having settled on an alternative mr trump is n't the candidate of any particular group in the republican coalition his voters are often identified with the ideological wing , but many ideologues also object to him as a  changes in the media environment may have made it easier for mr trump , but he is a character few politicians can match his style ben carson is a more typical charismatic outsider exploiting the changes , and he surged , then declined party leaders might have pushed aside mr trump if they 'd had an easy choice among the acceptable candidates since they did n't , the trump distraction kept them from choosing anyone none of this is what the book predicts , but it s not the first time a party has delayed picking a favorite in the nomination process in the 1988 democratic primary , party leaders were similarly divided among the , with michael dukakis , governor of massachusetts , gaining decisive support only after he won in new hampshire in 2004 , few party leaders endorsed a candidate , uncertain about who could stop mr dean only after john kerry won iowa did most in the party unite behind him in 2008 , both parties failed to coordinate around a single candidate we learned later that some democrats who had been reluctant to oppose hillary clinton had privately encouraged barack obama to challenge her after iowa , his party support became public that year , among republicans , mitt romney and john mccain both had backing from different factions of the party in most of these cases , party leaders seemed to use iowa as a winnowing tool , recalling the way they used primaries before the 1970s reforms most famously , john f kennedy needed to show he could win the votes of noncatholics in west virginia before the party would back him in 1960 lately , the leaders have let voters help them figure out which candidate , among the acceptable , they should coordinate on in 2016 , the republicans may be very slowly doing just that mr rubio may join mr dukakis and mr kerry as someone party leaders flocked to after the voters narrowed the field in the months before iowa , many party leaders had already begun to back mr rubio , and that support accelerated once voting began it picked up even more once mr bush dropped out of the race if this were to end in a victory for mr rubio , that would be meaningful from our perspective if mr trump is the nominee , many in the party will come to terms with that the recent string of trump endorsements is a sign that this might be underway but even this movement is if party leaders were merely following the polls , they 'd be for mr trump by now as we observed in the book , when candidates garner the support of party leaders , their poll numbers often rise but when candidates improve in the polls , endorsements do not necessarily follow but not jumping on the trump bandwagon falls far , far short of making a decision the longer it takes for the party leaders to find a champion , the less it looks as if they are deciding and the more it looks as if they are just following even if they follow to a partyacceptable candidate let s say mr rubio somehow does win the nomination on the one hand , that means that the party leaders would have stopped a frontrunner in the middle of the process , no minor feat unlike the way the house chooses its speaker , sequential primaries and caucuses are not suited to finding compromise on the other hand , what took them so long \? such indecision has not been a problem for the democrats this cycle the democratic party has its own factions , but that conflict has mostly been worked out within party circles this made the democratic leaders' choice much easier and having backed mrs clinton , party leaders are now going to the mat for her , just as they have done when outsiders challenged their choice in previous elections mrs clinton s march to the nomination shows that parties are still able to make decisions but mr trump s success demonstrates that that ability may now be much easier to disrupt
beijing the over air pollution in the chinese capital almost brought this city to a standstill in december , with schools shut , construction halted and driving restricted now , in a swift policy shift , beijing plans to issue a red alert based on higher thresholds , despite government pledges to better address the toxic air a red alert , the highest level of a fourtier warning system , will be issued if the daily average air quality index is forecast to exceed 500 for one day , 300 for two days or 200 for four days , xinhua , the state news agency , reported on sunday , quoting beijing s environmental agency the new standards will take effect before the end of march , it said the air quality index , used in many countries , is an aggregate measure of various pollutants in the air currently , any reading above 200 for more than three days in beijing will prompt a red alert , which activates numerous contingency plans that can disrupt jobs and businesses beijing s air quality is among the worst in the world , and much of the smog comes from industrial pollution and the burning of coal the red alert issued in december came as a surprise to many because air pollution in the city had routinely been worse a number of times during the winter over the past three years , the air quality index exceeded 500 , a level deemed hazardous to human health those offthecharts episodes did not activate red alerts , even though the state news media instructed people to reduce their outdoor activities the new standards will also be applied to neighboring provinces that have suffered from severe air pollution , xinhua reported ma jun , a prominent environmental researcher in beijing , said the change highlighted officials' worries about the social disruption a red alert could cause with the new standards , he said , officials must reassess some of the contingency measures that come with the warning there will be multiple times of red alerts in a year if we continue using the current standards , which will bring about a high social and economic cost , mr ma said , alluding to the contingency measures they include the closing of factories and schools and strict limits on the use of cars among the issues at stake is children s health , he said , arguing for the need to reevaluate the emergency measures after the imposition of the new standards the xinhua report said the response measures would remain the same , but each city affected would be able to decide if primary and middle schools should be temporarily closed mr ma argued that schools should continue to be closed even if beijing declared a lower warning next week , the chinese communist party will convene its parliament , where air pollution is expected to be a major topic the chinese news media reported over the weekend that beijing was considering a plan to build five ventilation corridors to improve urban air circulation the corridors , each at least 1 , 500 feet wide , would run through the city , passing through parks , innercity lakes and public spaces also being planned , the reports said , are an unspecified number of narrower corridors it is not clear how much the project would cost or when it would be finished the main role of ventilation corridors is to reduce the blockage of wind by the city to facilitate a heat exchange between the city and its peripheries and the spread of pollutants , wang fei , vice director of the beijing municipal commission of urban planning , was quoted by xinhua as saying thus , the urban heat island effect and pollution can be reduced , mr wang said , using a term for warmth in urban areas caused by human activity the announcement followed the publishing last week of on the website of the governmentcontrolled science daily , officially called science times in english it said the root cause of the smog in beijing was declining wind power , which it said was the result of an increased planting of trees where none had been before , lower atmospheric pressure and desertification in inner mongolia , a province north of beijing we could n't help asking , did we plant the trees in the wrong place \? the article said it also attacked the widely held view that smog comes from automobile exhaust , coal burning and industrial emissions , labeling such beliefs ridiculous liu shuhua , a professor of atmospheric sciences at peking university , expressed doubts about the ventilation corridors the weak vertical atmospheric circulation means ventilation corridors will have a very limited role to play , he said they will only improve ground ventilation more studies need to be undertaken to back up beijing s plan to build ventilation corridors , and many details are still lacking , said edward ng , a professor at the school of architecture of the chinese university of hong kong who helped design ventilation corridors in hong kong beijing has very low ground wind , he said , meaning that the corridors would not be effective to disperse smog he said that reducing industrial emissions remained crucial to tackling the issue but , he said , many chinese cities are hoping to join beijing in the development of such tools he said he would be in xi'an , the capital of the northwestern province of shaanxi , this week to discuss a plan to build ventilation corridors with officials there

a couple of years ago , i trespassed across america i 'd set out to hike the proposed route of the keystone xl pipeline , which had been planned to stretch over a thousand miles over the great plains , from alberta , canada , to the gulf coast to walk the pipe s route , roads would n't do i 'd have to cross fields , hop barbedwire fences and camp in cow pastures much of it on private property i 'd figured that walking across the heartland would probably be unlawful , unprecedented and a little bit crazy we americans , after all , are forbidden from entering most of our private lands but in some european countries , walking almost wherever you want is not only ordinary but perfectly acceptable in sweden , they call it allemansr tt in finland , it s jokamiehenoikeus in scotland , it s the right to roam germany allows walking through privately owned forests , unused meadows and fallow fields in 2000 , england and wales passed the countryside and rights of way act , which gave people access to mountain , moor , heath or down nordic and scottish laws are even more generous the 2003 scottish land reform act opened up the whole country for a number of pastimes , including mountain biking , horseback riding , canoeing , swimming , sledding , camping and most any activity that does not involve a motorized vehicle , so long as it s carried out responsibly in sweden , landowners may be prohibited from putting up fences for the sole purpose of keeping people out walkers in many of these places do not have to pay money , ask for permission or obtain permits we 're not nearly as welcoming in america travel across rural america and you 'll spot no trespassing and private property signs posted on trees and fence posts everywhere and even where there are n't signs , americans know they do n't have the implicit permission to visit their town s neighboring woods , fields and coastlines long gone are the days when we could , like henry david thoreau on the outskirts of his native concord , mass , freely saunter through the woods and over the hills and fields , absolutely free from all worldly engagements might we be better off if we could , like a scot or a swede , legally amble over our rolling fields and through our shady woods , rather than have to walk alongside unscenic , noisy and dangerous roads \? the organization reported that from 2003 to 2012 over 47 , 000 pedestrians were killed and an estimated 676 , 000 were injured walking along roads our lack of safe and peaceful walking places may also contribute to the nation s status as one of the more sedentary countries in the world according to a 2012 study by the lancet , over 40 percent of americans do n't get the recommended amount of exercise per week if we want to create more safe and scenic walking spaces , we should look to europe s roaming laws for ideas on opening up our countryside but would a european right to roam law work in the united states \? jerry anderson , a drake university law school professor who has studied american and british property law , says that emulating britain s righttoroam laws would be difficult because of the takings clause of our fifth amendment , which declares that private property cannot be taken for public use , without just compensation it s not impossible , said mr anderson you would have to compensate the landowners , and then the question would be , how much compensation is a public right of access worth \? ' the amount of compensation is difficult to determine because britain and other countries with roaming laws do n't have anything like our takings clause in britain , landowners were not compensated when their exclusionary rights were compromised by roaming laws laws like those in england , wales and scotland would probably be declared unconstitutional here america , though , started off with an expansive set of roaming rights and traditions brian sawers , a visiting scholar at emory university school of law , says that the right to roam specifically the right to hunt on private , unenclosed land was cherished by early americans because it distinguished them from the english , whose aristocracy held exclusive hunting rights and owned the great majority of the country the right to roam was something we had and lost , said mr sawers roaming rights began to erode in the late 19th century , according to mr sawers in the south , states passed trespassing laws for racial reasons , seeking to keep blacks from hunting and fishing so as to starve them into submission elsewhere , wealthy landowners of the gilded era became concerned with game populations , and trespassing and hunting laws were passed to restrict immigrants , he said in 1922 , the supreme court in mckee v gratz ruled that in areas where there is a common understanding , the public may be permitted to hunt , fish and travel unenclosed land however , this right is revoked the second the landowner posts a no trespassing sign , according to mr anderson this is referred to as a landowner s right to exclude , which , over the years , has grown only more powerful and absolute in a series of supreme court decisions but our understanding of property and our unquestioned devotion to the right to exclude may need to be reconsidered in an age when america is increasingly characterized by growing populations , sprawling cities and suburbs , and far less green space according to the department of agriculture , from 1982 to 2007 , 41 million acres of american forest and farmland were developed , roughly the size of wisconsin a report by the forest service predicts that the urban and developed area in the country will increase by between 41 percent and 77 percent by 2060 , which means that as many as 69 million acres of additional farm , range and forest land could be developed , about the size of colorado while by my count about 28 percent of the united states is publicly owned and thus potentially good roaming land \( in the form of national parks , national forests , bureau of land management property , as well as state parks and recreation areas \) , much of this land is inaccessible to people longing for a morning stroll from their front door by my count , the five states with the highest percentages of land owned by the state and federal government nevada , utah , alaska , idaho and oregon have more than half of the public land in the nation , but only about 2 percent of the population the far more densely populated states on the east coast say the original 13 colonies plus the district of columbia have about 30 percent of the nation s population but only a tiny percentage of its public land and several midwestern states are almost entirely owned by private landowners about 1 percent of kansas and iowa , for instance , is owned by the state and federal government even if a national right to roam law is unlikely , there are ways that state governments can create better green and coastal walking spaces now the , a nonprofit that advocates better beach access , reports that several states , including maine , massachusetts and virginia , have favored the interests of beachfront property owners by limiting public access to shorelines hawaii and oregon , on the other hand , have granted generous public access to their coasts some american landowners might bristle at the thought of walkers invading their privacy but right to roam laws are not freeforalls for walkers in sweden , walkers are required to stay at least 65 yards from homes and could be sentenced to as many as four years in jail for destroying property scotland s right to roam does not give a right to hunt , shoot or fish these laws are often friendly to landowners because , under many circumstances , landowners are given immunity from suit if the walker has an accident resulting from natural features of the landscape on the landowner s property in the united states , landowners can be held responsible if someone gets hurt on their property our neighbors' no trespassing signs have n't all been posted to serve as unfriendly messages often , they 're legal suits of armor as popular as a right to roam might be in america , there has never been a mainstream conversation about one there are a few advocates in law journals , but none have made a splash outside of their field it s more or less off the radar of america s leading walking organization , america walks , a nonprofit that works for better walking communities ian thomas , a spokesman , says his organization is exploring this issue and plans to develop an official stance in the near future on my hike , i walked over montana grasslands , through south dakota canyons and across nebraskan cornfields i watched kansas sunsets and oklahoma sunrises and camped on soft beds of texas pine needles i saw my country the way a scot or a swede might see his so peaceful and pretty i often felt like i was deep in a national park while the bundy family and radical ranchers out west talk of seizing public land for themselves , we should be having the opposite conversation about opening up the country for everyone something as innocent and wholesome as a walk in the woods should n't be

' she said , cracking a smile that s great bring a check' the department of health and human services announced a 10 million grant on wednesday for health services in michigan , including 1 million for a health center in flint that is treating those affected by the water white house officials said the federal government had already provided nine million liters of water and 55 , 000 water filters it s a little too late , jimmie stephen , a truck driver , said as he walked down saginaw street in downtown flint on tuesday the epa had a job to do , and they ignored it none of the politicians have helped us i think the community is just going to have to band together to resolve our problems mr obama had been under pressure for months to visit flint white house aides said he after receiving a letter from an 8yearold girl , amariyanna copeny , who is known among many in the city as little miss flint after receiving a briefing from federal officials who have been on the ground in flint for months , mr obama urged residents to use filters for their drinking water and to make sure that children received medical checkups at the end of the briefing , he took a sip from a glass of flint water after saying , filtered water is safe karen weaver , the mayor of flint , told the high school audience that mr obama deserved credit for a robust response to the crisis we asked for help , mr president , and you answered the call , she said but critics have said the federal government was conspicuously absent during the crucial months before the crisis was declared , when residents were drinking the leadtainted water , and state and local officials were largely  emails from last summer , which were among thousands of pages of messages and documents , show a lack of alarm about the crisis on the part of some epa officials susan hedman , a regional administrator for the agency , , and gina mccarthy , the administrator of the epa , withstood withering attacks by republicans during a house oversight committee hearing about the agency s failure to step in she had argued that states bore primary responsibility for  officials at the epa pointed out wednesday that a commission that state officials were primarily responsible and that investigations into the crisis had led to indictments of people at the state and local levels monica lee , a spokeswoman for the agency , said the federal government had not been told the truth about the situation in flint we ca n't serve our oversight role when the state is lying to us about what they 're doing , ms lee said mr obama also used his visit to flint as an opportunity to pressure republicans in congress to support billions of dollars in improvements to infrastructure around the country he tweaked them and some of the party s presidential candidates , who have suggested deep cuts to federal environmental programs the president chided republicans for a corrosive attitude that does not support government investments in public infrastructure it s a mindset that says that environmental rules designed to keep your water clean or your air clean are optional or not that important , mr obama said that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that results in lead in your water it leads to systemic neglect it leads to carelessness and callousness
paris the qualifying cutoff for the tennis events at the rio de janeiro olympics comes the monday after the , adding pressure on many of the players on the olympic bubble who are now getting their last chance to secure the ranking points necessary to reach the games but a goldmedal goal has proved far from universal among the players the 80thranked ernests gulbis , whose surprise run to the fourth round in paris will propel him into the top 60 and therefore inside the olympics ranking cutoff , said he had already decided not to compete in rio , in part because of the lack of incentives for participation i really do n't like that in olympic games there is no points and no prize money , gulbis said it s a little bit like tennis tourism , from my side while none of the shortlisted medal contenders have withdrawn , several men who would have safely qualified for the competition have indicated that they have no intention of competing months before the games are to begin , five of the men who fall between 15th and 23rd in the atp rankings have ruled themselves out they are the over30 veterans john isner , kevin anderson and feliciano l pez and two players in their early 20s , bernard tomic and dominic thiem gulbis is not alone in citing the lack of ranking points for olympic performance which had previously been on offer for the men s singles since 2000 and the women s singles since 2004 as a reason for not competing isner , a member of the atp player council , said he had lobbied for increased ranking points at the olympics after being frustrated at receiving only 135 points for reaching the quarterfinals in 2012 \( by contrast , the atp tournament held that week in washington offered 500 points to the champion , even though its field had been depleted by the olympics \) paltry though they may have been in the past , isner said the absence of ranking points was a very , very big factor in his decision not to play in rio , as was his not wanting to miss the atp tournament in atlanta , where he has won three titles in a row he noted that two other formerly topranked americans , andy roddick and mardy fish , had skipped the 2008 and 2012 olympics still , isner said most of the feedback he had received about his decision had been negative i 've been called unpatriotic i do n't think it s that , said isner , who plans to represent the united states in july in a davis cup quarterfinal against croatia in oregon i do n't consider myself that at all for gulbis and anderson , the increased davis cup participation mandated for olympic eligibility was an additional problem the atp also stopped awarding ranking points for davis cup victories this year those changes came after years of negotiations between the atp and wta tours and the international tennis federation , which oversees the olympic tennis events as well as the davis cup and fed cup team events the itf believes that players are honored to play the olympics , and that for the majority of players , ranking points are not a consideration for their participation , said nick imison , an itf spokesman eric butorac , president of the atp players council , said a sticking point between the itf and the atp had been the abandonment of a payment structure in which the itf compensated the smaller atp tournaments that were adversely affected by the olympics every four years they helped compensate , because they make so much money off of our players , and they disrupt the tour a lot , butorac said of the itf and the olympics this year , the itf said they were n't going to compensate , and they basically told us that they did n't care if we had points or not some top players who still intended to compete , including the men s world no 1 , , and the fourthranked stan wawrinka , expressed frustration at the decision not to give ranking points to be quite frank , i do n't see a reason why not , djokovic said we have the best players in the world participating in arguably the fifth grand slam it s of that importance for all of us even more because it happens every four years i mean , it s a subject for discussion i would definitely encourage people to rethink of getting points out there butorac said that when negotiations ended last year , most players did not object to the end of ranking points in the olympics some wanted it , but the majority that i asked said that they really did n't want them , and that the olympics should be about representing your country , butorac said the olympics means a lot of different things to different people there are some players to whom it s bigger than winning a grand slam other players , they 'd rather win a masters series title than win the olympics and that s not to say that anyone s right or wrong i get kind of upset when people criticize someone like isner for not playing , because he s trying to live a professional tennis career whether or not he plays in the olympics is his own business tennis players are independent contractors , and they should be able to do what they want the 15thranked thiem , a promising 23yearold who plays a fourthround match in paris on monday , has in particular faced criticism in his homeland over his lack of olympic interest the sports editor of the austrian newspaper kronenzeitung published an open letter calling on thiem to play thiem , who said he hoped to break into the top 10 of the atp this year , said his conception of tennis had never included the olympics , where the sport was reintroduced as an event in 1988 after having been absent for most of the previous century i still think that swimming and athletics are the real olympic sports , thiem said roberta vinci , the runnerup last year , planned to play in rio but echoed thiem s thoughts on the sport s attachment to the event probably if you think one big tournament in tennis , you think wimbledon , roland garros , not the olympics , vinci told wta insider if you want to swim , the olympics is unbelievable those who have tasted olympic gold possess a deeper attachment to the event andy murray , who won gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles in london , expressed confusion over why other players did not want to play in the games there are different reasons for playing tournaments , sometimes , murray said for me , davis cup and olympics , i'm not playing for ranking points , a fourtime gold medalist , said her olympic triumphs were her most prized accomplishments the proudest moment for me when they do the oncourt announcements are the olympic results , williams said for me , that feels legitimate she later expressed bewilderment at ranking points becoming a sticking point who needs ranking points if you 're playing for a gold medal \? she said the canadian milos raonic , ranked ninth , lost in the second round of his lone olympic appearance but expressed a similar sentiment points or no points , it does n't really matter , he said i think the goal and the target is very simple you 're there to win a medal the shinier the better
tel aviv all wanted in 2016 was a president who would be friendly toward his government for the last eight years , president obama and mr netanyahu , s prime minister , have disagreed over iran , israeli settlements and just about every other issue the democratic party has meanwhile drifted further from israel its candidates in this year s election are bernie sanders , who boycotted mr netanyahu s last year , and the more likely nominee , hillary clinton , whose history of thorny relations with israel s prime minister began in the mid1990s , when her husband clashed with the first netanyahu government , and continued through her tenure as mr obama s secretary of state so mr netanyahu and his colleagues in one of israel s most hawkish coalitions ever have been biding their time , waiting for mr obama to vacate the white house in the hopes that he 'd be replaced by a republican with whom they could finally see eye to eye that should n't come as a surprise polls regularly show that republicans are of israel than democrats , and republican candidates tend to hold positions on issues from iran to the that parallel those of a majority of israeli voters and then along came  israel depends on an america that asserts itself abroad israel needs bipartisan support it needs stable , predictable american foreign policy it desires candidates who sing israel s praises as often and as loudly as they can mr trump , who looks poised to capture the s nomination , offers israel none of those mr netanyahu has every reason to be concerned and disappointed by what the american political system has produced this election cycle on foreign policy , mr trump certainly uses muscular language he says he would bomb the hell out of the islamic state that s a welcome change from mr obama , whose equivocations about the use of force have made america look weaker in the eyes of israel s enemies and mr trump has also been in line with the netanyahu government in condemning the nuclear deal with iran but many of mr trump s statements on foreign policy suggest he has last september , for example , he said russia wants to get rid of isis we want to get rid of isis maybe let russia do it let them get rid of isis what the hell do we care \? that poses a problem for israel the last thing israel wants is an america that refuses to lead that is , except when it comes to israelipalestinian relations , because if there s anywhere the netanyahu government might want to see a handsoff america , it would be on that issue but here , mr trump suddenly wants to take the lead he promises he would broker a peace deal between israel and the palestinians and assures that he would do it as a neutral guy for israel neutral is a code word with one meaning unsupportive in fact , neutral is how to describe mr obama s policies by way of expressing displeasure there are other ways mr trump echoes the obama administration he has that the lack of progress on the israelipalestinian conflict has to do with israel s lack of enthusiasm rather than , as mr netanyahu and most republicans believe , because the palestinians are n't a serious partner for peace and then , of course , there is mr trump s unpredictability while previous presidential candidates did not always support policies that were to israel s liking , most of them had a fairly comprehensible agenda mr obama wanted to get a deal with iran , to pull out of iraq and to promote peace between israel and the palestinians whatever the netanyahu government thought about his policies and it disliked most of them mr obama almost always tried to do exactly what he promised mr trump , on the other hand , is vague about his plans , if he has any sometimes he promises to destroy the islamic state , other times he wants to leave the task to russia he criticizes the iran deal , but unlike some other republican candidates , does n't say he will rip it up if he is elected in recent weeks , mr trump has repeatedly called himself israel s biggest and best friend when it comes to israelunited states relations , friendship is a word with many definitions early in his presidency , mr obama as a friend to israel is partly to hold up a mirror and tell the truth when he disagreed with its policies it s no wonder that these days , the american president and his israeli counterpart often look more like adversaries than friends israel s government hoped a new president would restore a more traditional definition of friendship one based on mutual trust and support but if the choice comes down to mrs clinton or mr trump , that s unlikely from a president clinton , israel s hawkish government would come under more of the same pressure it received from the obama administration from a president trump anything is possible the rocky relations of the obama era have damaged the americanisraeli alliance and eroded israel s standing in washington and around the world four or eight more years of bickering could cause even more lasting damage to the one foreign relationship that is truly critical to israel s future

houston james harden scored 35 points , including the gamewinner with 27 seconds left , and the took advantage of stephen curry s absence to secure a 9796 victory over the golden state warriors in game 3 of their firstround playoff series on thursday night the victory cuts houston s deficit to two games to one in the bestofseven series game 4 is set for sunday in houston shaun livingston stole a pass from trevor ariza , and ian clark s layup put golden state up by 1 point with 106 seconds left harden then took the ball to the other end and stepped back for the jump shot to win the game golden state had a chance to win after that , but draymond green dribbled the inbounds pass off his foot and out of bounds marreese speights came off the bench to lead the warriors with 22 points , and klay thompson had 17 the warriors blew out houston in the series opener with curry on the court and pulled away late in game 2 to go up two games to none even with curry , last year s most valuable player , watching from the bench with a sprained right ankle curry was not on the bench with the team for thursday s game , and it was unclear where he was during the game after coach j b bickerstaff pleaded with his team to be nastier , the rockets were much more aggressive and scrappy than they had been in the first two games , and they led by as many as 17 points in the first half dwight howard added 13 points , 13 rebounds and 2 blocks for houston , and michael beasley finished with 12 points andre iguodala made a 3pointer to cut the lead to 9392 with about 2 minutes 45 seconds remaining , and clark gave golden state its first lead since 20 on a jumper that made the score 9493 beasley gave houston a 9594 lead with two free throws with 41 seconds left golden state , which set the nba record for wins in a regular season with 73 , had won 14 of 15 and six straight over houston before thursday night s loss golden state used an 81 run , led by 6 points from livingston , to cut the lead to 8180 with nine minutes remaining harden scored the next 5 points to power a 70 run that pushed the lead to 8880 midway through the quarter curry was feeling better on thursday and wanted to play , but the warriors decided that the possibility that he would reinjure his ankle before it was fully healed was not worth the risk coach steve kerr said the team would have a better feel for curry s availability for sunday after seeing how he responds to the next two days of practice houston led by 12 points in the third quarter before a 102 spurt by golden state , with 6 points from speights , cut the deficit to 7872 entering the fourth quarter the rockets led by 3118 at the end of the first quarter , thanks to 14 points from harden howard was active early , moving from several feet away to leap and block a shot by festus ezeli that caused howard to crash to the court in the first quarter houston was up by 16 with about two and a half minutes left in the first half before golden state scored the last 9 points of the second quarter to cut the lead to 5548 things became testy in that span after howard picked up his third foul , tangling with andrew bogut while fighting for a rebound howard received a technical when he threw the ball into the stands in frustration after being called for the foul
after a long year of too much polling , posturing and propaganda , american voters are now at last making choices the runup to the iowa caucuses , which took place on monday night , shows it s time to move beyond the emotional venting that has been broadly common to both parties , but could not have been more different in the particulars the republican candidates , for the most part , showed no real sign of wanting that to happen gov john kasich of ohio kept up his extremely longshot attempt to inject a tone of decency and hopefulness into the republican contest , but trailed well behind in all the precaucus polls and spent his time in new hampshire senator ted cruz of texas , who scored a significant victory in iowa over donald trump by staking out the most extreme right , ran his usual meanspirited attacks on just about everybody senator marco rubio of florida , who fared well on monday night , tried to put a younger and more charming face on the basic republican message of anger , xenophobia , fear and hate , but at a rally on saturday night he fairly quickly veered into demonizing president obama , misrepresenting vital issues like obamacare , and using critical national security issues mostly to stoke americans' insecurities at least mr rubio has distinct ideas mr trump , who sucked up most of the oxygen in the campaign , seems to have none on monday , at a rally in cedar rapids , mr trump ran through his repertoire of selfcongratulation , and when the crowd started to dwindle and quiet down , he resorted to his rabblerousing sound bites we 'll build a wall on the mexican border , repeal obamacare and replace it with something really good , eliminate the national debt and stop terrorists from using our internet at one point in the last few days , mr trump promised to buy a farm and move to iowa , and said he had not spent more on his campaign operations in iowa because he felt sorry for his competition secure , apparently , in his belief that he can say anything and none of his supporters will care the only thing that made mr trump s performance on monday seem less absurd was that he followed sarah palin mr trump would be reaganesque , she said , in a way that would tell any enemy , uhuh , we 're america so we win you lose she said the republican congress , which was implacably opposed to virtually anything proposed by mr obama , had given him a blank check and , of course , rightwing republicans are the only real americans the democratic contest , at least , was a competition of ideas bernie sanders and hillary clinton were in a virtual dead heat at the caucuses though they criticized the republicans , and each other , they did so with more civility than the republicans and in service of talking about what they wanted to do , not what president obama failed to do still , their contest has been largely framed as a choice between head and heart mr sanders is all about heart on sunday , he talked about revolution , as he always does he kept asking his audience if they wanted to hear another radical idea and spoke not about just upending the washington power structure , but about tearing it down his highly enthusiastic crowd cheered his promises to break up the banks , regardless of whether that is remotely possible mrs clinton , while exuding a great deal of fire and energy at a big rally on sunday night near des moines , frames her candidacy much more cerebrally and pragmatically she made rousing calls to protect women s rights , on wage equality and on health care , but her primary pitch was that she has detailed ideas and the ability to make them happen i do n't think we can wait for ideas that sound good on paper but ca n't get through the gridlock in washington , she said , in her most pointed but still oblique attack on mr sanders with a few of the weakest candidates starting to drop out , weary voters can only hope that the campaign will further clarify itself and become more substantive in coming weeks as it moves to new hampshire and beyond
in what can be debated as an extraordinary feat of either sticktoitiveness or poor judgment or perhaps both a professional baseball player has failed a doping test for a third time , resulting in a lifetime ban from major league baseball it is the first time baseball has handed down the most severe punishment under its antidoping program that player , pitcher jenrry mejia , now carries unrivaled ignominy baseball has had far more famous players involved in drug scandals barry bonds , alex rodriguez and mark mcgwire among them but none received a lifetime ban for three failed tests for performanceenhancing substances mejia s agent , peter greenberg , said mejia had no comment on friday after major league baseball announced the violation mejia , 26 , apparently had an oldfashioned approach to drug cheating in each case , he was caught using anabolic steroids , substances that have long been easy to detect in a urine sample two of his positive tests involved boldenone , a steroid that has been used in horse racing mejia s case highlights how , despite baseball s longstanding efforts to strengthen its drug program , players continue to see incentives in trying to gain an edge mejia grew up poor in the dominican republic , shining shoes for 8 a day as a child , according to the starledger he made his major league debut with the mets in 2010 , and in the seasons that followed , he began to carve out the beginning of what stood to be a lucrative career as a formidable relief pitcher he made a little less than half a million dollars in 2013 and a little more than that the next season , then jumped to 26 million last year , only to forfeit much of it because of his first two doping violations this year , much of his 24 million salary was again not going to be paid because of the continuation of the second suspension but now , he will not make any of that salary , and his chances of making double or even triple that amount a year in the seasons ahead may have been tossed aside as well mejia can appeal for reinstatement after one year , but the minimum length of the ban is two years it is conceivable that he will pitch in the major leagues again , but there is a good chance that he never will a 6foot , 205pound righthanded relief pitcher who , as a rookie in 2010 , was giddily compared to mariano rivera , mejia rebounded from injuries to become a capable closer for the mets in the 2014 season he was injured again at the start of the 2015 season , and it was then that he was first suspended for drug use , drawing an 80game ban for testing positive for stanozolol i know the rules are the rules , and i will accept my punishment , but i can honestly say i have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system , mejia said at the time several weeks after he returned from that suspension , he was penalized again , for a full season of 162 games , for testing positive for stanozolol and boldenone , synthetic derivatives of the hormone testosterone i think , not surprisingly , there s a tremendous amount of disappointment , the mets' general manager , sandy alderson , said then i think to some extent anger , to some extent amazement that this could happen so soon after a previous suspension was completed , and some sadness in the sense that this is having a tremendously adverse effect on a very promising major league career still , the mets gave mejia a new contract for the 2016 season , hoping he could still provide depth in their bullpen after he served out the 99 games left in his second suspension as well , they still viewed him as a valuable asset in seasons to come , as he was not eligible to become a free agent until the winter of 2018 but then came his third positive test , and again , the substance was boldenone the mets , in a statement , that they were deeply disappointed in mejia his absence from the 2015 postseason may have hurt the mets in the world series , when their bullpen had trouble with a relentless kansas city lineup his continued absence may have an impact , too baseball began issuing penalties for positive doping tests in the 2004 season after the 2005 season , the drug program was stiffened , extending the suspensions for first , second and third violations to 50 games , 100 games and a permanent ban the penalties were stiffened again before the 2014 season , to 80 games , 162 games and a permanent ban another major leaguer , the infielder neifi perez , also tested positive three times under baseball s regimen but that was for a banned stimulant , not a steroid , and the transgressions , in 2007 , culminated in an 80game suspension beyond the regular round of mandatory and random tests that every player is subject to , a player who tests positive for performanceenhancing drugs is subject to six unannounced urine collections and three unannounced blood collections in the subsequent 12 months and again each year for the rest of his career , so long as the player remains on some team s 40man roster that put mejia under increased scrutiny and helped lead to his downfall the mets signed mejia at 17 , and he made the openingday roster just three years later , making him the youngest met to do so since dwight gooden the mets quickly concluded that he would best be used as a starter but five starts into the 2011 season , mejia tore an elbow ligament pitching in a minor league game and needed tommy john surgery he did not pitch again in the majors until september 2012 his elbow problems lingered , both mentally and physically his 2013 season ended prematurely when he had surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow as the mets' current rotation began to take shape in the last few years and emerged as one of the best in baseball , the team shifted mejia to the bullpen it was a role he was initially hesitant to accept because he feared that working as a reliever not knowing when or how often he would pitch might lead to still another arm injury but mejia gave in , and in 2014 he became the mets' closer , ultimately embracing the role he even started to follow the lead of other closers and developed his own save dance an emphatic gesture in which he would raise both hands above his head and bring them down as if he were breaking a board over his knee he recorded 28 saves in 31 chances that season but even after he lost his role as the closer last season , and even after his second suspension , he still seemed to have a future with a nowformidable mets club but now he does n't
daytona beach , fla jeff gordon had no frame of reference as he stood along one of the concourses at the lavishly renovated daytona international speedway , he chuckled at the realization that in my 23 years of coming here , this is the first time i 've actually seen this speedway from this side of the fence he was referring to the fans' side of the racetrack , which opened in 1959 and , in recent years , had gone from quaint to antiquated to archaic it is no secret that while fan interest in many sports remains healthy , falling attendance at stadiums and arenas is a growing concern there is the cost and the hassle of getting there and , not to be minimized , the appeal of a plush lounge chair in front of a flatscreen television that can be paused for bathroom breaks nascar s answer was a 400 million renovation of daytona just in time for speedweeks and sunday s 58th running of the daytona 500 i'm blown away by it , said gordon , 44 , a fourtime series champion who has retired to the broadcasting booth our fans are in for a great experience i may not have seen the way this place was before , but i 've been to super bowls and a lot of different events , and i can tell you this place has elevated itself to be as good or better than any other major sports venue i 've been to known as daytona rising , the renovation was two and a half years in the making , all while the site continued to host events it was backbreaking , said joie chitwood iii , the racetrack s president we did n't postpone a single event if anyone ever asks you to operate a venue while undergoing a construction project , politely decline it was incredibly hard but in the end , it was all worth it fans apparently feel the same way what officials are calling a stadium now has 40 escalators , compared with none previously there are now 17 elevators , 11 more than before in addition , there are spacious concourses that allow clear sightlines to the racetrack , 1 , 400 television screens , 60 luxury suites , lounge areas , interactive displays and grandstand chairs to sit in , rather than metal bleachers it s absolutely great , said mike roselli , 36 , a nascar fan from brodheadsville , pa it reminds me of the new yankee stadium it s almost as if they went there first before building this they did an awesome job , and you can tell that they really took the fans' aspect of it seriously the fans' aspect was , in fact , a continuing initiative part of the concept is not only to get fans to come to the venue but also to interact with them , engage them and , of course , market and sell to them the wifi signal is strong and free well , sort of to receive it , fans must register through their email and sign off on fine print that allows nascar and its corporate sponsors to gather information on them , and even to keep track of them as they meander through the stadium the purpose is to see what captures their attention , and for how long and , perhaps just as important , what does not interest them chitwood noted that one of the project s biggest challenges in the renovation was how best to facilitate the flow of fans roselli , who estimates that he has been to 13 daytona 500 races , said you always had to wait in line before i do n't see that happening now not only do they have more entrance points , they scan your ticket when you come in and if you go out , so that you can come back in again the old speedway had fans entering at ground level and then primarily climbing stairs its six elevators were allpurpose you 'd have situations where fans , workers and maybe a food cart were all crammed into the same elevator , chitwood said we 've eliminated that what was not eliminated was one of the speedway s timehonored perks fans bringing coolers chitwood insisted that even the notion of separating fans from their coolers was never considered we had a focus group once , chitwood said , and an older gentleman , who was kind of cantankerous with us , finally said i know what you 're trying to do you 're trying to take my cooler away from me' we assured him we were n't and we have n't what the new speedway does not have are the 46 , 000 seats that were on the backstretch like many new stadiums and arenas , daytona is buying into the notion that less is more , with several other racetracks having already downsized the new speedway will accommodate what it did when it opened 57 years ago 101 , 500 fans chitwood believes that there will not be a revenue dip and that the financial difference will be offset by increased and upgraded concessions and food offerings , more and markedly better luxury suites , and , of course , finding creative ways to bring in more corporate sponsorship money toward that end , nascar sold what it calls four injectors entrance points and interactive areas for fans to sunoco , florida hospital , toyota and chevrolet highly interactive , the areas are emblazoned inside and out with corporate logos and other marketing mechanisms for instance , you can buy a chevrolet at a local dealership and , for an additional cost , pick it up inside the speedway jeff chew , chevy racing s manager for strategic planning and operations , said his company s injector area would feature 23 chevrolets spread over 20 , 000 square feet of space spanning three concourse levels this was important to us , as we feel that we 're part of the very fabric of nascar , chew said we 've had more championship drivers than any other manufacturer neither he nor nascar s chief executive , brian france , would divulge the cost of such prime real estate at the sport s premier venue it s tricky because we do n't enjoy the publicprivate partnerships like other leagues do with public financing of stadiums and arenas , france said that s a challenge what they 've done on the public enterprise model is build something that works for us , works for our fans , and we could actually pay for although other leagues need a new location when they build a new venue , even if it is just across the street , that was not the case at daytona , chitwood noted while everything else has changed , he said , what has n't changed is that when you look at that startfinish line , you know that it s the same one that lee petty crossed when he won the first daytona 500
augusta , me she was afraid of being alone and prone to anxiety , a diminutive 66yearold woman with a poor sense of direction , hiking the appalachian trail by herself , who wandered into terrain so wild , it is used for military training she waited nearly a month in the maine woods for help that never came geraldine a largay chronicled her journey in a blackcovered notebook that summer of 2013 , and she kept writing after she lost her way , even as her food supply dwindled along with her hopes of being found her last entry reflected a strikingly graceful acceptance of what was coming when you find my body , please call my husband george and my daughter kerry , she wrote it will be the greatest kindness for them to know that i am dead and where you found me no matter how many years from now it would be two years before a logging company surveyor stumbled upon her campsite and remains , solving a mystery that had tormented her family and defied teams of experienced searchers ms largay , a retired nurse from tennessee , had survived nearly a month on her own longer than many old backwoods hands thought possible before dying of exposure and starvation on thursday , the maine warden service released more than 1 , 500 pages of its files on her disappearance , shedding light on the fears of her friends and family and the search that pursued countless false leads the documents include brief excerpts from her journal and the plaintive text messages she tried in vain to send to her husband from a place beyond the reach of cell towers lost since yesterday , she texted off trail 3 or 4 miles call police for what to do pls in fact , she had set up camp less than two miles off the trail there , with her black tent and her possessions neatly sorted into ziploc bags , she penned a note to her husband on the cover of the journal george please read xoxo ms largay had adopted the trail name inchworm , making light of her pace , but that pace had taken her nearly 1 , 000 miles from harpers ferry , wva , where she and a friend , jane lee , had set off on april 23 , 2013 her husband of 42 years , george largay , drove ahead and met them in prearranged spots with supplies , and sometimes took them to motels for showers and a night indoors on june 30 , in new hampshire , ms lee cut short her hike to tend to a family emergency , but ms largay insisted on continuing later , ms lee would tell an investigator that geraldine had a poor sense of direction , the warden service s investigative report said ms lee said that geraldine had taken a wrong turn on the trail , more than once , and ms largay became flustered and combative when she made these kinds of mistakes ms largay , a meticulous planner , was gregarious and made friends easily on the trail but she feared the dark and being alone , said ms lee , who told park wardens that george did not know the extent of geraldine s inability to deal with the rigors and challenges of the trail but after he reported his wife missing , mr largay told an investigator that gerry was probably in over her head her doctor would tell investigators that once she ran out of the medication she took for anxiety , she could suffer panic attacks ms largay spent the night of july 2122 in the poplar ridge leanto in western maine , less than 200 miles from the end of the trail her smile was so infectious that before she set off the next morning , a fellow hiker , dottie rust , asked to take her picture in the photo , she is beaming and wearing her backpack , her socks pulled high , as hikers do to ward off scrapes and blisters it was about 6 30 am , the last time anyone was known to see her alive by 11 am , she was lost in somm trouble , ms largay wrote in a text message to her husband got off trail to go to br now lost she asked him to call the appalachian mountain club to c if a trail maintainer can help me somewhere north of woods road xox the message was never received ms largay had left in one its most rugged sections , with thick underbrush and fir trees packed so tightly they almost seem to merge you step off the trail 20 or 50 feet and turn around , it s very difficult to see where the trail was , said douglas dolan , 53 , a volunteer who spent time last summer doing trail maintenance in the area if you did n't know which way the trail was , you could easily walk in circles for hours ms largay sought high ground , possibly hoping for a cell signal she tried over and over to send messages , but none went through on july 23 , she set up camp , laying her tent atop sticks and pine needles , under a canopy of hemlocks that probably obscured her from airborne rescuers she tied a shiny silver blanket between two trees , possibly to attract attention , and nearby trees had burn marks it looks like some sort of fire was attempted on those trees by gerry , wrote lt kevin adam , of the warden service , in a report she was supposed to meet mr largay on july 23 , at route 27 in wyman township the next day , he reported her missing multiple agencies and volunteers joined the hunt , with searchers on foot , on horseback and in helicopters she was less than a mile from the trail , close enough that searchers probably passed near her without realizing it investigators questioned hikers who might have crossed paths with ms largay , and they tested the dna on a discarded bandaid and they were inundated with false tips to be pursued people suggested that she had been murdered , that she might be lodged in treetops , that she had fallen in the river and that she had been spotted at a women s shelter in tennessee some hikers thought they might have seen her on the trail but were n't sure others had seen sketchy men who they thought might have done her harm psychics called to report visions of her , including one who insisted , incorrectly , that she had broken her ankle search efforts were scaled back on aug 4 ms largay kept writing daily observations and letters to her family in her journal until aug 10 , even drawing out a calendar to keep track of the days she wrote a final entry that she dated aug 18 , though investigators are not sure the date is accurate her remains were found on oct 14 , 2015 , inside her sleeping bag , in a campsite she had kept neat until the very end around her was the ample gear she had hauled items like a blue and white bandanna , a rosary , birthday candles , lighters , dental floss , a sewing kit and two water bottles , one still containing water when ms largay s family visited the patch of wilderness , two weeks later , they left a white wooden cross , decorated with messages etched in black marker one , written in a child s hand , said , i wish you were here
the united states justice department has opened an investigation into statesponsored doping by dozens of russia s top athletes , two people familiar with the case said tuesday the inquiry escalates what has been a roiling sports controversy into a federal criminal case involving foreign officials the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york is scrutinizing russian government officials , athletes , coaches , antidoping authorities and anyone who might have benefited unfairly from a doping regimen , according to the people , who did not have authorization to speak about the inquiry publicly prosecutors are believed to be pursuing conspiracy and fraud charges federal courts have allowed prosecutors to bring cases against foreigners living abroad if there is some connection to the united states that connection can be limited , such as the use of an american bank a report published by the world antidoping agency in november accused russia of the chemist identified as a linchpin in that operation grigory rodchenkov , the longtime head of russia s antidoping laboratory that he worked for years , at the direction of the russian government , to help the country s athletes use banned , performanceenhancing substances in global competition and go undetected dr rodchenkov is among the people under scrutiny by the united states government , said one of the two people with direct knowledge of the case russian officials have responded to the accusations with both defiance and contrition while often emphatically dismissing the claims as a western conspiracy intended to discredit russia , they have sometimes struck a more conciliatory tone , perhaps seeking to win the favor of sports officials in control of their country s ability to compete in the coming summer olympics in rio de janeiro the russian sports ministry in a statement last week after dr rodchenkov s claims were published in the times it did not specify what those problems were then , , a british newspaper , the russian sports minister , vitaly mutko , said that russian officials , coaches and athletes had made serious mistakes , but he stopped short of outlining them or admitting to any state involvement in their inquiry , united states prosecutors are expected to scrutinize anyone who might have facilitated unclean competition in the united states or used the united states banking system to conduct a doping program elite russian athletes have competed in several major sporting events in the united states , like the and international bobsled and skeleton championships in lake placid , ny the inquiry , which originated with the federal bureau of investigation , would have to clear several hurdles before charges could be filed even if prosecutors are able to establish jurisdiction , securing the cooperation of russian authorities in pursuing evidence and witnesses and in ultimately delivering any charged defendants to the united states would be all but impossible it is rare for the united states government to take on sports doping cases in february 2012 , the united states attorney in los angeles , andr birotte jr , into lance armstrong and his postal service cycling team that had explored whether mr armstrong and others defrauded sponsors by operating a doping program the united states antidoping agency , not a government entity , pursued the case mr armstrong was ultimately stripped of his seven titles and barred from cycling for life for what usada called the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen but prosecutors for the eastern district in brooklyn have taken on highprofile sports corruption cases before for several years , the office has been investigating corruption within fifa , world soccer s governing body that case , , has so far resulted in charges against 40 soccer officials and business executives , as well as two corporations more than a third have pleaded guilty highly international in scope , the fifa case has implicated people of two dozen nationalities , and it has required the cooperation of various foreign authorities in making arrests , ruling on extradition requests and sharing information about bank transactions while the eastern district s fifa investigation and russian doping investigation are independent inquiries , there is an overlap between the two matters prosecutors from the business and securities fraud section and the organized crime division are involved in both , and certain public figures have overlapping ties to russian sports and global soccer mr mutko , russia s minister of sport , is a member of fifa s ruling council , a position he has held since 2009 he was appointed in 2008 to his current role in russian government by president vladimir v putin in his account to the times , dr rodchenkov , who oversaw russia s antidoping lab in moscow for a decade , said he often took direct orders from mr mutko s deputy , yuri nagornykh , especially leading up to the sochi olympics in 2014 in sochi , dr rodchenkov said , he staged an elaborate darkofnight operation to destroy russian athletes' tainted urine samples on orders from the government in a news conference last friday , mr nagornykh disputed dr rodchenkov s claims there s no doping program in russian sport , he said there was none and will be none in the wake of the report last fall , which cast shadows on not just the moscow laboratory but also russia s antidoping agency , dr rodchenkov said that mr mutko had summoned him to the sports ministry s headquarters and requested his resignation dr rodchenkov fled to the united states , fearing for his safety , he said bradley d simon , a criminal defense lawyer of simon and partners in new york , confirmed that he was representing dr rodchenkov but declined to comment on the justice department investigation currently living in los angeles , dr rodchenkov , 57 , has said he has no intention of returning to russia i have no choice , he said in a recent interview i am between two flames
kansas city , mo it seemed like a sports marketer s invention , this opening series between the and the what better way to celebrate the new season than a rematch of the reigning league champions \? the nfl frequently rigs its schedule that way but for major league baseball , it was a coincidence the tentative 2016 schedule was released to the public on sept 8 , before the postseason even began whatever the reason , on sunday , for the first time in history , the most recent world series opponents were to face off on opening day the quirk in the scheduling also meant that the mets the world series losers had to endure the championship celebrations of the royals firsthand , a humiliation that was new , too the yankees endured a similar sort of indignity in 2005 , though , when they opened their season at boston and had to watch the red sox unfurl their 2004 championship banner and receive their championship rings the red sox had earned their trip to the world series by finally beating the yankees in the postseason despite trailing , three games to none , in the american league championship series for the mets , the schedule put them on hand for two separate celebrations because the royals planned to unveil their banner before sunday s game and then hand out championship rings to the players before the second game of the series , on tuesday \( the second game would normally be a lowattendance event , so stretching out the celebration may merely have been a way to help sell tickets \) it does n't bother me , mets manager terry collins said they won they are going to have them , and we 've got to suck it up and get ready to play do n't get caught up too much in anything more look , when the bell rings , let s get after it i do n't care what the pregame stuff is about still , the royals , aware of the unusual circumstance of having their vanquished opponent in the building for the events , also planned to show a video honoring the mets' achievement last year in winning their first national league pennant since 2000 collins said he appreciated the gesture , calling the royals a class organization it s great , he said , because it was an exciting world series and both teams certainly worked hard to be there now it s a new year and a new 162 , and that s all we 're concerned about dillon gee watched the world series as most people did on television from his couch at home he had spent nine years in the mets' organization , nine years in which the mets had failed to make the postseason but by the time they finally earned a return trip , gee was not on their roster i was excited for the guys at the time , gee , now a reliever for the royals , said before sunday s game against his old team they were my buddies , and i played a lot with those guys , so i was happy to see them getting to that stage and having fun and succeeding that was fun he added that it was no fun to be at home after being with the team for four and a half years it was what it was , and in the end i was happy for the guys , he said gee did not pitch well last year , going 03 with a 590 era before being sent to the minors in june he never returned , even after rosters expanded to 40 players in september after the season , the mets released gee , and he signed a minor league deal with the royals on dec 14 i try not to dwell on the past , he said it is what it is it was an unfortunate chain of events that s the way it goes sometimes gee made his major league debut with the mets in 2010 and exceeded expectations but during his tenure , the mets' rotation added so much talent that there was no room for him the royals have assigned gee to the bullpen , where he is expected to be versatile i was thinking about what i would feel like going into the series , but really , i just want to win because i'm on the other team , he said there are no hatchets that need to be buried or anything like that i just want to win games yoenis cespedes started sunday s game in left field , juan lagares played center , and michael conforto was the designated hitter terry collins said part of his reasoning was that he wanted lagares patrolling the large outfield at kauffman stadium this is a big outfield , collins said you better have some guys that can go out there and get it

swept major primaries in florida , north carolina and ohio on tuesday , rebounding from her upset loss to in michigan a week earlier and securing a political and psychological victory for her campaign the results were a significant setback for mr sanders , who was counting on his fiery arguments against free trade to help him prevail across the industrial midwest he spent heavily trying to win ohio , as well as tuesday s contests in illinois and missouri , but he came away with his presidential bid looking increasingly hopeless , since mrs clinton is far ahead in amassing delegates needed to win the nomination early wednesday , the associated press declared mrs clinton the winner in illinois , too votes were still being counted in missouri for mrs clinton , tuesday s doubledigit victories netted her so many delegates that her lead over mr sanders is now about three times what barack obama s was over her in 2008 on a personal level , too , she and her advisers were reassured that regardless of her michigan defeat , her political arguments about jobs and the economy had potency in states that will be major battlegrounds in november the top issue for ohio democratic primary voters was the economy , and most of them favored mrs clinton a majority of voters also said that trade with other nations takes away american jobs , and more than half of them supported mrs clinton in michigan , mr sanders captured this group by double digits mrs clinton was bullish and beaming at her victory party in west palm beach , fla , after the first three states were called in her favor we are moving closer to securing the nomination and winning this election in november , she said to cheers from a rowdy crowd of 1 , 300 people more than in any other primary night speech , mrs clinton aimed her remarks in south florida at the leading republican candidate , donald j trump , who boasted of his own victory just miles away when we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants , banning all muslims from entering the united states , when he embraces torture , that does n't make him strong it makes him wrong , mrs clinton said , as she called on all americans to fight against bluster and bigotry mr sanders , speaking at a campaign event in arizona , which holds its contest next week , stuck to his scathing assessment of the american economic system and promised to overhaul campaign finance rules he criticized walmart as not paying living wages , but also repeated his creed against global trade that has particularly hit the midwestern industrial belt i say to corporate america , you want us to buy your products , start manufacturing those products here in america , not in china , mr sanders said mr sanders also used the evening to criticize mrs clinton for having a and relying on large donations she has received money from the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry , he said to loud hisses and boos from the crowd of 7 , 200 people she has given speeches on wall street for 225 , 000 a pop ohio was the prize that mrs clinton and mr sanders coveted the most , a bellwether state in american politics that would bestow not only delegates but also a new political story line for the winner a clinton comeback or a sanders surge , given that he was a longshot there until recently after her loss in michigan and mr sanders s persistent criticism of her record on global trade mrs clinton s aides seemed exasperated that her detailed policy positions to bring jobs back to the hardhit midwestern states were a harder sell than what they said were the unrealistic promises offered by her opponent they huddled to retool her economic pitch so that it resonated better in midwestern states in hopes of competing more strongly with mr sanders after having lost michigan , we came into , particularly , ohio with a renovated plan , said her spokeswoman , jennifer palmieri at a rally in youngstown , mrs clinton addressed union members packed onto a factory floor at m7 technologies , reminding them of the work she had done as a senator from new york to bring jobs back to the depressed upstate areas i stood up for our companies in new york , she said i will stand up for our companies in ohio and across america , mrs clinton said it s exciting for me i am really totally committed to bringing back manufacturing the clinton campaign dispatched former president bill clinton to akron and toledo , two predominantly white workingclass cities that mr sanders also campaigned in mrs clinton also racked up delegates in heavily black areas of ohio , including courting voters in cleveland mrs clinton s victories in florida and north carolina were due in large part to minorities black voters in both states , and hispanics in florida as well the sanders campaign had been expecting to lose florida , given that only democrats could participate in the primary and he tends to perform better when independents are in the mix but mrs clinton was also broadly popular in the state , which was reflected in exit polls by edison research mrs clinton drew support from about seven in 10 hispanic voters and nearly eight in 10 black voters she was backed by a slim majority of white voters , who accounted for about half of the electorate down from twothirds in 2008 she was favored by voters who put a high priority on experience or electability , and she was the solid choice when voters were asked who had the better chance of defeating mr trump in november in ohio exit polls , mrs clinton was far ahead among black voters , but she and mr sanders ran closely among white voters as in michigan , mr sanders was drawing huge support from independents and voters under age 30 , while mrs clinton was popular with democrats and voters over 45 as ohioans streamed to the polls on tuesday , several voters described intense feelings for their favored candidates at the alliance church in reynoldsburg , a middleclass columbus suburb , sediena barry , who installs office equipment , said she decided to vote for bernie sanders moments before facing the horseshoe of electronic voting machines young people were told , get an education and work hard and you 'll get ahead , and none of us are , said ms barry , 34 , who complained that she is taxed at a rate higher rate than bosses who make a halfmillion dollars a year james moore , a restaurant manager , said he voted for mrs clinton for my personal future and my family s future he added all her ideals line up with what we want to happen for both candidates , tuesday s primary results represented a major turning point in the race roughly half of the 4 , 765 democratic pledged delegates have now been awarded but their campaigns offered sharply different takes clinton advisers noted that mr sanders had reached the halfway mark without showing any progress at narrowing her sizable lead in delegates , leaving him only one way forward to win a series of landslides through the june primaries and pick up significantly more delegates than mrs clinton that situation is highly unlikely , and clinton advisers made it clear on tuesday that they were confident about holding the delegate lead and ready to focus toward the general election we think she will be the nominee , we 'd like for this process to obviously be resolved as quickly as it can , but that s ultimately not up to us and we 're prepared for it to go on , ms palmieri said as the voting was underway sanders advisers , while acknowledging they were far behind in the delegate count , said that the race was now shifting to their advantage and that they expected to win more delegates than mrs clinton in the coming primaries and caucuses they argued that mrs clinton s best states were behind her the primaries across the south and in texas where her popularity among blacks and hispanics resulted in troves of delegates looking ahead , sanders advisers predicted success in states with large liberal populations , like wisconsin and california , and those with caucuses , a format that rewards voter enthusiasm and turnout and has favored mr sanders recently mr sanders has even talked about prevailing in new york , mrs clinton s home state , given the high numbers of progressive voters and workingclass democrats who share his disgust with wall street we 're now entering a period where we think we 'll win most if not all of the contests before the april 19 primary in new york , said tad devine , a senior adviser to mr sanders regardless of how much momentum we have after tuesday , the calendar is shifting in our favor now we just have to win some major showdowns , like in new york and new jersey , to raise questions about whether she can really win the presidency mrs clinton prevailed in ohio in 2008 against mr obama and referred to that victory frequently during their campaign , arguing that the democrats' best hope in any general election was the winner of that state s primary it s a state that knows how to pick a president , mrs clinton said at her victory rally in columbus in 2008 and no candidate in recent history , democrat or republican , has won the white house without winning the ohio primary mr obama , of course , did go on to win the general election and ohio that november but after tuesday , mrs clinton is optimistic once again that her adage will prove true
port charlotte , fla phil niekro was a 21yearold pitcher in class a when his manager , red murff , gave him a compliment that propelled him to the hall of fame if niekro could control his knuckleball just a little better , murff said , he would pitch in the big leagues that was in 1960 niekro would pitch through 1987 and earn 318 victories that s what really got me going , and that s what i'm trying to convince eddie gamboa , niekro said by telephone on sunday it s not a second or third pitch it s pitch everything comes off your knuckleball , and he has n't gotten to that yet , i do n't think gamboa , 31 , is a nonroster invitee of the tampa bay rays who showed up sunday at charlotte sports park for the first day of workouts for pitchers and catchers he wears no 73 , befitting someone with no major league experience sort of last april , before a weekend game at camden yards , the baltimore orioles called gamboa to the majors he rushed to the ballpark , arriving in midgame and reporting directly to the bullpen he spent two days on the active roster but did not pitch he wished he had , of course , but added that his knuckler might not have been ready gamboa s brief promotion could be the extent of his major league career but he offers hope , at least , for the future of the major league knuckleballer , a species that seems to number no more than four or five but always more than zero at any given time i told eddie , listen , you 've got to let it happen , ' said charlie haeger , who threw knucklers for three teams and is now the rays' pitching coordinator if you try to rush it , if you try to push this thing and do n't properly get the process taken care of , you can be at a disadvantage think about it a regular guy can get away with a 95mileanhour pitch down the middle we do n't get away with those very often the process is longer , but the career can be obviously extended with what we 're doing , too r a dickey of the toronto blue jays is the only knuckleballer in a major league starting rotation at 41 , dickey is the oldest player in the american league and the third oldest in the majors , behind the mets' bartolo colon and miami s ichiro suzuki , who are 42 because throwing a knuckleball does not engage the muscles that impart spin on a ball , those who throw it tend to last much longer learning the pitch resets a pitcher s clock steven wright , who has made 11 starts for boston in the past three seasons , converted to the knuckleball five years ago while in the cleveland farm system he is 31 , and his career may just be starting i remember when i first started throwing it , mark shapiro told me , you 're the one guy where age is just a number , ' wright said , referring to the indians' president at the time it does n't matter to us , you 're 21 again you just need to grow with it the more you throw it , the better feel you 'll get for it , the more confidence you 'll get with it , and we just want you to build off of that' confidence is an issue for gamboa , a factor that has , so far , helped keep him from joining dickey and wright on major league mounds for the orioles' class aaa team last season , gamboa walked 84 and struck out 79 , with a 461 era depressing , to say the least , he said it was really tough , because i came from a career where walks were never an issue i always pitched to contact to put people on base and give a free base , that was tough , physically and mentally but i went to winter ball this offseason , and i mixed it in with all my pitches i was fortunate things went really well gamboa estimates that he threw the knuckleball only 40 percent of the time in winter ball if he could control it better , he said , he would happily throw it more often niekro said gamboa must trust the pitch he s got to get up to that 80 , 85 percent , niekro said that s what i keep telling him every time he gets into a little trouble or does n't quite get the knuckleball over or does n't feel good , he goes back to the other stuff , and he kind of gets them out and stays with the other stuff , other than committing or recommitting to the knuckleball the whole ballgame you 've got to commit to it that s what wakefield finally did tim wakefield had pitched parts of two seasons in the majors when pittsburgh released him in 1995 he signed with the red sox , who arranged for him to work with phil and joe niekro , another longtime knuckleballer , who died in 2006 wakefield pitched 17 seasons for boston dan duquette , who signed wakefield for the red sox and now directs the orioles' baseball operations , brought phil niekro to spring training to see another minor leaguer in 2013 a coach suggested niekro also look at gamboa , who was then a conventional pitcher with ordinary stuff gamboa had fiddled with a knuckleball since he learned it from his father at age 12 at merced high school in california , he clinched the sacjoaquin section division i championship by using a knuckleball to strike out the final hitter for elk grove when he showed it off again in an impromptu audition for the greatest knuckleballer alive , niekro , the pitch still worked he threw about six or seven pitches , and i said , boy , this guy s got a major league knuckleball , ' niekro said he shared his opinion with duquette , and from then on , gamboa has tried to ride his knuckler to the majors he knows he must throw it more , and he plans to do so eventually , i think i'm going to get to that , because the goal is to have a long career , gamboa said when you get older , you start losing fastball , you start losing arm speed so with the knuckleball , arm speed , none of that matters so i want to work toward that i still feel like i have enough arm in me to battle at this level and miss some bats other knuckleballers are also hoping for a chance niekro said he had gotten more and more inquiries for help since 2012 , when dickey won the national league cy young award for the mets besides signing gamboa this winter , the rays signed jeff howell , a converted catcher who threw knuckleballs in class a last season the scarcity of former knuckleballers to teach the pitch makes it harder to spread but in haeger , at least , gamboa will have a nearby resource to help the pitch survive it always seems to be on the brink of extinction , but it always endures it s never going to be mastered , haeger said i do n't think there is such a thing but it can be utilized , that s for sure it s an unpredictable pitch for us at times but it s really unpredictable for the guys with the bats
the have not been a dominant team for a while now , but it is still noteworthy that they are currently in the grips of a fivegame losing streak , are an unsightly 815 on the season and are firmly in last place in the american league east it is as bad a start as the storied franchise has had for some time their april record of 814 was the first losing mark in that month since 2008 and left them in the cellar at the end of the month for the first time since 2007 to find a worse april record for the team , you have to go back to 1991 , when the yanks started 611 seven games under 500 is also a worst for the team under joe girardi , the manager since 2008 excellence , of course , has been expected of the yankees for just about forever their last fullseason losing record was 1992 they have not completed a year last in their division since 1990 , and finishing in the basement then was a bigger embarrassment than it would be now , since in 1990 there were seven teams in the american league east instead of the current five the reasons for the yankees' slow start are varied the most glaring involve the offense and starting pitching of their regular position players , only second baseman starlin castro has a particularly impressive batting average , with a 314 mark carlos beltran , mark teixeira and alex rodriguez , the somewhat elderly middle of the batting order , are hitting 250 , 225 and 203 that is not very good , although all are batting much better than chase headley \( 156 \) the veteran andrew miller has been flawless as the closer , but the yankees' rotation has a 410 wonloss mark masahiro tanaka has begun well , but the other four starting pitchers all have eras over 500 the yankees are surrendering 49 runs a game , which was the secondworst figure in the league entering monday , when the yankees were idle in particular , the yankees have struggled against good teams their record against 500 teams or better is 311 , which was the before monday s games still , they have played only 23 games and if nothing else , the yankees' record is better than that of the houston astros , whom they lost to in the wildcard game last season , and the minnesota twins in the national league , the braves are worse than the yankees with a 619 mark after monday s loss say the yankees are 6 to 1 to come back and win the division , and a credible 281 to win the world series , putting them just about in the middle of the pack \( atlanta is in a much more hopeless position , at 500 to 1 \) but odds are little consolation when you are in last place , and the other team in town , the mets , is doing just fine the yankees' current predicament is sort of amusing to yankee haters , and none of it is that surprising to those who have watched yankee greats like mariano rivera , andy pettitte and derek jeter retire in recent seasons , and other stalwarts , like c c sabathia , start to fade new stars have not exactly taken their place and while the buzz around the team has been limited over the last three seasons , the yankees managed at least 84 wins in each of them and did get into that one wildcard game , as futile as it turned out to be the slow start this season may end up being an aberration but the current numbers suggest that the good times in the bronx may be on hiatus for a while
if you ever have the good fortune to see a sierra nevada bighorn sheep , the experience might go like this on a sunny morning in yosemite national park , you walk through alpine meadows and then up a ridge to the summit of mount gibbs at 12 , 764 feet above sea level you unwrap a chocolate bar amid breathtaking views of mountain and desert and then you notice movement below binoculars reveal three sturdy ewes perched on a wall of rock , accompanied by two lambs and a muscular ram the sight fills you with awe and also with gratitude for the national parks , forests and , yes , environmental regulations that keep the american dream of wilderness alive unless your binoculars are unusually powerful , you are unlikely to notice that many of those sheep wear collars manufactured by lotek wireless of newmarket , ontario you will , therefore , remain unaware that gps and satellite communications hardware affixed to those collars allows wildlife managers in distant airconditioned rooms to track every move made by those sheep like similar equipment attached to california condors , pronghorn antelope , pythons , fruit bats , african wildebeest , whitetailed eagles , growling grass frogs , feral camels and countless other creatures , those collars are the only visible elements of the backlot infrastructure that now puts and keeps so many animals in the wild mostly hidden from view , this infrastructure is proliferating and improving so quickly , thanks to advances in digital technology , that wildlife managers are seizing more and more of nature s relevant dials predator and prey alike and turning those dials to keep nature looking the way we want it to undeniably in the service of good , this technological revolution in the human relationship to wildlife is also accelerating the ancient human project of bringing the physical world under our control in the case of the sierra bighorn , a genetically distinct subspecies of wild sheep , there were likely more than a thousand before the 1849 gold rush brought domestic sheep into the high sierra those domestic sheep carried diseases for which bighorn had no defense in the late 1970s , a field biologist named john wehausen counted 250 survivors , none inside yosemite national park in 1979 , mr wehausen began a recovery effort that included translocation of sheep back into the area around mount gibbs , where there had once been a herd but then a state moratorium on the sport hunting of mountain lions caused an increase in lion numbers , and some of those lions began to prey on bighorn then a mid1990s drought depressed the deer population , causing even more lions to become sheep specialists bighorn numbers crashed , and the total population dropped to near 100 in 2000 , the federal government listed the sierra bighorn under the endangered species act the subsequent sierra nevada bighorn sheep recovery program , an interagency collaboration , tacitly acknowledged that our biggest and bestprotected wild ecosystems are so badly compromised that we can no longer fence them off and hope for the best starting in the early 2000s , the recovery program employed ancient and contemporary technology netguns , fired from helicopters , were used to capture bighorn outfitted with collars that carried both gps and vhf radio transmitters professional hunters , meanwhile , tracked and darted every mountain lion in the area to outfit them with collars that carried vhf radio transmitters biologists at computer monitors began to watch bighorn movements anytime a lion killed multiple bighorn in a short period of time , those hunters used vhf radio telemetry and specially bred lion hounds to find and kill it once bighorn herds grew large enough to spare members , biologists moved them around to establish new herds in longvacant habitat and to inject biological diversity into smaller herds like the one on mount gibbs this was done through operations that read like science fiction about humans trapped in a game reserve managed by alien overlords in march 2013 , according to tom stephenson , the program director , a fixedwing aircraft circled above an established herd on mount langley , a 14 , 026foot peak technicians onboard that airplane used radio telemetry to guide a lowflying hughes 500 helicopter toward five pregnant female sheep known from previous dna testing to carry diverse genetics the helicopter herded the pregnant sheep up a mountainside a man leaned from the helicopter and fired a net gun that tangled up one female after another another man , known as a mugger , jumped out and tackled the netted females , hobbled and blindfolded them , and then wrapped them in bags that dangled from the underside of the helicopter the sheep were flown to a parking lot for blood draws that allowed disease testing and more dnasequencing , as well as ultrasound testing for bodyfat analysis and skeletal measurements of their fetuses next , they were trucked some 100 miles north , transferred into bags hanging below another helicopter , flown up near mount gibbs and freed to give birth among sheep they 'd never met the view through those binoculars , in other words , lovely as it might be , will also be a deeply human cultural product people have always manipulated the natural world the most primitive farms are humanmanaged ecosystems european aristocrats fenced off game reserves in the middle ages western american land managers have argued for more than a century over how to protect livestock from predators and government agencies have long dumped hatcheryraised trout into streams so that we can have fun catching them radio collars and speciesrecovery projects have been around for a while , too in california alone , starting back in the 1980s , biologists saved both the peregrine falcon and the california condor from extinction more and more , though , as we humans devour habitat , and as hardworking biologists thank heaven use the best tools available to protect whatever wild creatures remain , we approach that perhaps inevitable time when every predatorprey interaction , every live birth and every death in every species supported by the terrestrial biosphere , will be monitored and manipulated by the human hive mind conservation metrics , for example , a california technology startup , is developing software to process immense data sets from remote camera traps or , say , dna samplers that might one day sit in wilderness streams and filter dna fragments as a way of counting species in a given watershed mark hebblewhite , a wildlife biologist at the university of montana , integrates realtime moisture and temperature data from satellites with data from accelerometers attached to birds' wings to keep tabs on bird flocks in migration allow tim boucher , a nature conservancy scientist , to map wilderness terrain down to an astonishing fivecentimeter resolution as for manipulation , african game managers use similar drones to herd wild elephants away from farms where they might get shot a still more intriguing example comes from western europe , where large predators were mostly killed off by the renaissance fifteen years ago , biologists in trentino , italy , traveled to slovenia to capture 10 european brown bears , smaller cousins of grizzlies these bears were released into the italian alps with extraordinary success 10 bears are now 50 it s exciting to have these large , iconic carnivores roaming central europe where they were extirpated centuries ago , said francesca cagnacci , a researcher on a followup project predictably , a few of the brown bears in italy began to eat farmers' chickens , tear up commercial beehives and generally wreak havoc wildlife managers initially responded by outfitting problem bears with collars that allowed precise mapping of their movements then a pilot project tested sensors placed around local farms and other temptations these sensors detect a signal broadcast by collars attached to bears and other wildlife , and then communicate with one another in a wireless network that delivers deterrents in random patterns bear spray fired by hidden guns , followed the next time by sirens and bright lights , and then by robotic dogs lurching out of robotic doghouses accompanied by the prerecorded sound of barking bear hounds if all goes according to plan , the entire system collars , sensors , deterrents will be operational at the end of the summer like most people , i would miss the unmanipulated wild if it entirely disappeared , and i like a point that mr hebblewhite makes about technological breakthroughs tempting us to overestimate our own cleverness even with the latest digital tools , he notes , ecosystems , and specifically the challenge of restoring broken ones , remain profoundly more complex than any phenomenon or system that humans have ever mastered putting astronauts into space , that was child s play , by comparison , he says the only thing rivaling an ecosystem for complexity is the human brain mr hebblewhite also argues that conservation success stories like the bighorn or the return of wolves to yellowstone contribute to what he calls the lego fallacy , the idea that ecosystems are like those lego sets where you build the millennium falcon and if a piece goes missing all you have to do is find a replacement and pop it back in put another way and a vast majority of conservationists would agree the best strategy is still just to avoid destroying habitat in the first place , and sometimes to let developed places become wild again take the return of wolves to central europe , made possible by the fact that humans no longer hunt and trap and poison them with the same dedication they once did all on their own , wolves found corridors to recolonize most of the alps and central europe , ms cagnacci says they are now in germany , denmark and even close to holland ! it s like what ! \? wolves in holland ! ' and it happened because people left the mountains and the forests to live in cities it was an unconscious rewilding , and it is more successful than the bear reintroduction once you break something and try to put it back together , you have to decide what exactly you want the restored version to look like if you happen to be a government agency in a democracy , that means reassembling ecosystems based on the desires of competing interest groups in the rockies , where grizzlies , wolves and elk support tourism and real estate values , wildlife managers who track all those animals have to contend with homeowners who do n't want the family dog ripped in half and hunters who wonder why , when it comes to eating elk , we 'd want to give wolves priority over humans in picking the tastiestlooking bulls the sierra nevada bighorn sheep recovery program eventually had to stop killing mountain lions because too many californians hated the idea of government hunters shooting those beautiful cats , regardless of the benefit to bighorn sheep decisions like these , based on public opinion , might someday dictate the subtlest interactions between animals everywhere still , surveillance and manipulation of the wild sure beats doing nothing , especially when technology can make conservation easier take the recording devices that have become the spyware of the backcountry as recently as a few years ago , researchers trying to count great gray owls in yosemite had to hike into the forest , hoot , wait for response hoots from actual owls , and do their best to tell those owls apart now the same researchers can set out sensors that record every noise in the forest computers then crunch this data \( a week s worth runs to a jawdropping 23 terabytes \) and identify the voices of distinct owls machinelearning software may soon make this easier by identifying the sound , say , of a particular female owl responding to a particular male bringing food to the nest , or of a juvenile begging for food , either of which would indicate the presence of a nesting pair remote cameras have also proliferated in wilderness backcountry and these , too , are a big help to wildlife conservation in january 2015 , for example , the field biologists stephanie eyes and toren johnson snowshoed out to retrieve the memory card from a motionsensor camera in an obscure corner of yosemite according to sarah stock , a yosemite biologist , that camera had been baited with scent tucked into a white athletic sock nailed to a tree , part of an effort to lure and identify rare highaltitude carnivores like pine martens and wolverines the pair pitched their tent , crawled in , plugged that memory card into a small handheld camera , and saw images of the first sierra nevada red fox known to have entered yosemite national park since 1916 , when a ranger killed the last one documented there this recent sighting prompted a petition to the federal government to list the socalled greater yosemite population of the sierra nevada red fox as threatened that , in turn , set in motion a recovery effort in the park , directed by ms stock , that has already deployed more cameras with luck , these catsize canids might become a common sight along yosemite s trails then there is the tantalizing possibility raised by the gps satellite that picked up a signal from the collar of gray wolf or7 as he wandered from oregon into california in 2011 there had not been a wolf sighting in california since 1924 , so or7 s walkabout and the fact that he wore a collar was responsible for the listing of gray wolves as a california endangered species or7 eventually meandered back to oregon to start a family he is now the breeding male of the socalled rogue pack in southern oregon just last year , however , a wildlife surveillance camera picked up images of a different wolf pack in northern california that discovery led to the development of plans for protecting the pack and accommodating wolves elsewhere in the state , should they proliferate in densely populated california , as wolf numbers grow , the obvious next question will be , what about grizzly bears \? grizzlies are the california state animal , after all , featured prominently on the california state flag despite the fact that no grizzly has been sighted in california since wolves disappeared , in 1924 bernie tershy , a conservation biologist at the university of california , santa cruz , and a cofounder of conservation metrics , points out that california has immense reaches of plausible grizzly habitat , public sentiment that favors wildlife conservation and a robust technology industry if huge predatory carnivores can be made to coexist with humans anywhere , it has to be here unsightly collars on all those predators might well diminish the romance , but that would be a small price to pay for the pleasure of their enduring company on this earth i loved working in really remote parts of the world where the wildlife was there just because it was there and no one was managing it , says mr tershy , who spent years as a field researcher and i love seeing bears without collars , but they 're going to have to get along in densely populated areas just like people do
became the presumptive republican presidential nominee on tuesday with a landslide win in indiana that drove his principal opponent , senator , from the race and cleared the way for the polarizing , populist outsider to take control of the party after months of sneering dismissals and expensive but impotent attacks from republicans fearful of his candidacy , mr trump is now positioned to clinch the required number of delegates for the nomination by the last day of voting on june 7 facing only a feeble challenge from gov of ohio , mr trump is all but certain to roll into the republican convention in july with the party establishment s official but uneasy embrace in the democratic contest , senator rebounded from a string of defeats to prevail in indiana over , who largely abandoned the state after polls showed her faring poorly with the predominantly white electorate but the outcome was not expected to significantly change mrs clinton s sizable lead in delegates needed to win the democratic nomination mr trump s victory was an extraordinary moment in american political history he is now on course to be the first standardbearer of a party since dwight d eisenhower , a fivestar general and the commander of allied forces in europe during world war ii , who had not served in elected office mr trump , a real estate tycoon turned reality television celebrity , was not a registered republican until april 2012 he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to democrats , including his likely general election opponent , mrs clinton and , at various points in his life , he has held positions antithetical to republican orthodoxy on almost every major issue in the conservative canon , including abortion , taxes , trade , and gun control but none of this stopped him with his ability to speak to the anxieties of voters , and his shrewd use of celebrity and memorable putdowns , mr trump systematically undercut veteran politicians in a field of candidates that many in the party had hailed as the strongest in at least three decades he was underestimated by leading republicans and democrats time and again , and he succeeded while spending far less money than most of his rivals and employing only a skeletal campaign staff after mr cruz exited the race tuesday night , mr trump appeared subdued and projected a more sober than usual mien as he absorbed the ramifications of the indiana victory it has been some unbelievable day and evening and year never been through anything like this , mr trump said putting aside the venom he has spewed at mr cruz this year , mr trump said of the senator , he is one hell of a competitor he even veered toward empathy for mr cruz , saying he knew how tough it is to be brought low by a brutal defeat of the 17 republicans who ran for president this cycle , mr cruz a onetime ally of mr trump s proved to be his strongest and most tenacious rival , winning 11 primaries and caucuses but the firstterm senator s appeal among traditional conservatives was no match for mr trump s fiery and uncompromising vow to fight for the interests of average americans who have lost faith in the country s political leadership republican primary voters made clear that they found mr trump s brand of hardedged nationalism more attractive mr cruz , speaking to supporters in indianapolis , said he could not fight on without a viable path to victory tonight i'm sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed , he said , as some admirers called out for him to reconsider without mentioning mr trump by name , mr cruz said we gave it everything we got but the voters chose another path as remarkable as mr trump s achievement is , his expected nomination also poses undeniable peril to the party he is poised to lead republican leaders , who have been reluctant to embrace his candidacy , are watching him with great trepidation , and on tuesday night they seemed to be grappling with the implications of mr trump s emergence as the new face of their party no candidate since the dawn of modern polling has entered the general election with the sort of toxic image mr trump has in the eyes of large groups of voters facing a race against the country s first female majorparty nominee , mr trump is burdened with disapproval ratings as high as 70 percent among women , who make up a majority of voters in presidential elections he is also an unpredictable voice on policy at trump tower on tuesday night , amid his litany of thankyous , mr trump demonstrated the degree to which his nomination represented an astonishing break from political precedent in denouncing mrs clinton s past support for the north american free trade agreement and saying it had caused carnage for american workers , he signaled he would run to her left on free trade and upend the decadeslong bipartisan consensus on the issue mr trump starts the general election campaign with a stillunfurling roll of incendiary proposals and provocations that are the stuff of dreams for opposition researchers he made his name in the last presidential campaign as the country s most prominent birther , fueling debunked conspiracy theories that president obama was not born in america he has used hostile and hardedged language about hispanics , suggesting that mexican migrants are rapists and murderers and he has not backed off his proposal to bar all foreign muslims from entering the united states , effectively creating a religious test for immigrants no one is more eager to talk about those positions than mrs clinton , who made clear on tuesday that she wanted to sharpen her focus on mr trump as soon as possible because the fight against him was likely to be bruising i'm really focused on moving into the general election , mrs clinton said during an interview on msnbc and i think that s where we have to be , because we 're going to have a tough campaign against a candidate who will literally say or do anything'' yet the indiana results were an embarrassing reminder of her vulnerabilities only slightly more than half of democrats voting tuesday called mrs clinton honest and trustworthy , according to early exit polls , a remarkably shaky assessment for the party s likely nominee after closing the gap with bluecollar white voters in parts of the northeast last week , mrs clinton lost them by 30 points in indiana she also again suffered with selfidentified independents casting ballots in the democratic contest 73 percent backed mr sanders mr sanders , speaking to reporters after winning indiana , had some tough words for mrs clinton after a week when he toned down criticisms of her and shifted his focus to their policy differences i understand that secretary clinton thinks that this campaign is over , mr sanders said i 've got some bad news for her tonight we won a great victory in indiana next week we are going to be in west virginia we think we have a real shot to win in that great state and then we 're going to kentucky , and we 're going to oregon and we think we have a pretty good chance to win there as well we feel great about tonight not only in winning here in indiana and accumulating some more delegates but also gaining the momentum we need to take us to the finish line , he said , adding the he realized he faced an uphill battle while mr sanders devoted three days to campaigning in indiana and spent more than 1 million on television advertisements , mrs clinton did not run any ads and spent only a day campaigning in the state , visiting the indianapolis area clinton advisers said they saw no point in spending a couple of million dollars on television advertising and campaign travel when mrs clinton was likely to lose the state anyway its democratic primary electorate includes a healthy share of independents and newly registered voters , demographics that have repeatedly favored mr sanders and the two democrats are expected to divide the state s 83 delegates given the close outcome tad devine , a senior adviser on the sanders campaign , said that the indiana results would not reshape the democratic race markedly , given mrs clinton s sizable delegate lead while the democratic race has turned relatively civil , the republican fight in indiana grew bitter in the final hours with mr cruz on edge tuesday morning about the future of his candidacy , mr trump baited him by suggesting with no evidence that mr cruz s father had joined lee harvey oswald in passing out profidel castro pamphlets in new orleans shortly before oswald assassinated president john f kennedy mr cruz , unburdening himself after a campaign in which mr trump also mocked , responded with a flourish , called mr trump a pathological liar and delved into his rival s personal life listen , donald trump is a serial philanderer , and he boasts about it , mr cruz said , directly raising mr trump s marital history for the first time i want everyone to think about your teenage kids the president of the united states talks about how great it is to commit adultery how proud he is  but the appeal did not work indiana republicans proved willing to embrace mr trump , the once unimaginable but now virtually certain nominee , regardless of the personal flaws and political shortcomings that would have once derailed wouldbe presidents

east rutherford , nj s smile in the aftermath of sunday s loss to the philadelphia eagles might have been the biggest tipoff of what was to come for his 12 years as the giants' coach and probably for the 34 years he had coached previously it took a lot to get coughlin to smile in public after a defeat but on sunday , a reporter brought up coughlin s 11 grandchildren , who were on the sidelines for what turned out to be his last game with the giants , and the 69yearold coughlin could not help himself suddenly appearing relieved , he burst into a wide grin coughlin stepped down as coach about 22 hours later after meeting with ownership monday afternoon , coughlin chose the dignified exit instead of being forced out after three consecutive losing seasons while the move was not surprising , it brings an end to a prosperous era in the franchise s history that included two victories and five playoff appearances coughlin smiled on his way out , but it does not mean the giants' losing ways and manifold problems will depart with him the team s roster is missing talent and depth not a good combination at all but a handful of positions some parts of the team are aging and injuryprone , and others are green with inexperience psychologically , a losing mentality has set in , which was repeatedly evident this season as the giants lost leads in the final 75 seconds of games an unfathomable six times the giants also had the nfl s worst defense , a sector of the team that was only tangentially under the purview of the offenseminded coughlin on defense , the giants did not have a single player whom opposing coaches fretted about as they prepared their offensive game plans although jerry reese , the giants' general manager , drafted the star receiver odell beckham jr two years ago , dozens of reese s draft selections in the last eight years have been busts , which has left the giants with gaping deficiencies at safety , linebacker and tight end and on the defensive line without a core of homegrown players , the giants have turned to free agency to buttress the roster , but their acquisitions have failed to get the team into the playoffs since the 2011 season the coowner john mara was unafraid to characterize this season as a winorelse situation after the giants went 610 in 2014 but a year later , the giants' record was no different that sealed coughlin s fate , and he was gracious as he departed , issuing a statement in which he said he was stepping down in the best interests of the team and his family it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as head coach of the new york football giants , coughlin said this is not a sad occasion for me coughlin continued , obviously , the past three years have not been what any of us expect , and as head coach , i accept the responsibility for those seasons interestingly , coughlin did not retire from coaching , as many suspected he might he will immediately become a candidate for several vacant nfl jobs and could be staring across the field at the giants from an opposing sideline in nine months one of the nfl s most successful coaches , especially in the modern era , coughlin coached in jacksonville before joining the giants in 2004 and has a career nfl record of 170150 , with a 127 mark in playoff games he was 10290 with the giants in the regular season and 83 as their coach in the postseason for giants fans , coughlin will be best remembered for his upset victories over the new england patriots in super bowls after the 2007 and 2011 seasons although not popular with fans or members of the media after his first three seasons , coughlin reworked his image and approach and grew to become the crafty face of underdog , unrecognized teams after the 2007 regular season , the giants won three consecutive road playoff games and then upset the previously unbeaten patriots in super bowl xlii , 1714 the giants were 3018 in their next three seasons but did not win a playoff game they sneaked into the playoffs with a 97 record at the end of the 2011 season and were once again pitted against the patriots in the super bowl the giants won in another upset , 2117 where the giants will turn for their next coach will be a quandary for management , which likes to hire experienced head coaches , especially ones with giants ties who have something to prove new orleans coach sean payton is a former giants assistant , but he is under contract and would fetch serious compensation there are young candidates who would most likely jump at the chance to take over the storied giants , and several of them are respected offensive coordinators with other nfl teams chicago s adam gase , new england s josh mcdaniels and carolina s mike shula none of those three , however , have direct giants ties or lengthy or successful head coaching experience there are accomplished college coaches who might draw interest , including david shaw of stanford and notre dame s brian kelly but a college coach trying to graduate to the nfl would probably not be the giants' style one of the giants' first , most significant decisions is going to be figuring out what to do with coughlin s offensive coordinator , ben mcadoo , and his defensive coordinator , steve spagnuolo , who is well liked by management but failed to win as the st louis rams' head coach several years ago mcadoo has no head coaching experience , but under his tutelage in the last two seasons , eli manning has flourished this season , manning threw 35 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions more impressive , the giants ranked sixth in the nfl in points this season and eighth in yards i feel very comfortable in the offense , manning said monday , as he also choked back tears talking about his last meeting with coughlin if mcadoo is not promoted , or a new coach brings in his own offensive coordinator , which is common , it will mean that manning will be working in his third offensive system in the last four years asked about the difficulty of that situation , manning responded obviously , it would not be ideal but i 'll handle it manning s expression betrayed his true emotions he turned 35 years old sunday and is not looking forward to starting all over in a new offense but that is just another one of the many dilemmas facing the giants' management in the first days of the postcoughlin era reese , mara and the coowner steve tisch will appear at a news conference tuesday morning , presumably to explain how the browbeaten giants plan to regain their place among the nfl s elite coughlin is going to be there , too he will no doubt be smiling it s not his problem any longer

teaching happens here most of its 70 students do not plan to be members of the clergy , and while the university offers classes called mindfulness , collaboration and dialogue , it has none on , say , the old testament , the gospels or the quran instead , the classes are intended to develop capacities for compassionate leadership , according to its  the idea behind the classes is that in a multicultural society such as ours , the right habits and tools matter more than specific knowledge , which is something that can be acquired elsewhere when we met around a conference table , the college s president , eileen aranda , explained the lack of explicitly religious coursework we have moved past the knowledge piece , said dr aranda , a former management consultant with an mba but no training in religion claremont lincoln is more interested in teaching dialogue skills , she said , than literacy in judaism , christianity or any particular tradition it s not enough to know the religions while claremont lincoln has been extreme in jettisoning the knowledge piece , it is not alone in sensing that divinity schools need to change to survive according to a released this week by the association of theological schools , 55 percent of its member schools have declining enrollments the students are aging , too by 2020 , there may be more 50 students than 20somethings in response , seminaries and divinity schools are in a period of unprecedented experimentation schools are merging or joining together , across religious lines , in interfaith consortiums or moving online last year , according to the study , more than 23 , 000 students took at least one distancelearning course at least 18 schools now offer an onlineonly option to master s of divinity students for generations , schools as different as the liberal and the conservative have had in common a residential model students live on or near campus , study together and worship together most institutions are trying to keep some physical presence , often by working in consortiums with nearby schools from other faith traditions such collaborations save money , provide students a wider variety of classes and allow them to gain experience in interfaith dialogue for example , hebrew college , a jewish graduate school and rabbinical seminary in newton , mass , sits adjacent to andover newton theological school , which is protestant , and is a member of the , a consortium of 10 schools the member schools , which represent traditions from jewish to catholic , from greek orthodox to roman catholic , share teaching , libraries and other resources there are similar consortiums and but andover newton , whose antecedent , andover theological seminary , was founded in 1807 as the country s first graduate school of any kind , is this year , the result of declining enrollments it may merge with another seminary rabbi daniel l lehmann , the president of hebrew college , said that the interfaith relations offered by a consortium were integral to his school s mission when i came to hebrew college , i felt so strongly about the desire to be part of an interreligious theological consortium that i requested we become members of boston theological institute , rabbi lehmann said they ultimately invited us to join but had to change their mission statement because it had been specifically christianfocused next fall , , in indianapolis , which is affiliated with the christian church \( disciples of christ \) denomination , is starting an option for its master s of divinity program that will be inperson but not fixed in one place while half the classes will be on campus , students will also meet for weeklong intensive classes in different cities , wherever the professor lives or decides to teach the class one course will happen in la because we have a few professors there , said doug pagitt , an evangelical pastor who is helping to design the program four months later , that same cohort will be in new york , then indianapolis , or dallas , because that s where a church or professor is located the classes will be held in local schools or churches that offer or rent space we are trying to solve three problems at once , mr pagitt said how do you have a national draw \? how do you have a national draw in a program that does n't suffer from the limitations of the online learning environment \? and how do you drive the price point down \? of course , there are limitations to some new models they tend to eliminate tenure and job security for the professors , who are hired on a perclass basis both dr aranda , at claremont lincoln , and mr pagitt said their teachers would be paid above typical adjunct rates for many students , meeting online or in short , intensive bursts may not promote the kind of longterm friendships that residential students forge a professor with whom one has spent only a week , if that , may be less likely to offer careerlong mentorship and for the schools that eliminate traditional classes in scripture or theology , it is hard to guarantee that students are well grounded in their own traditions most religious leaders believe that interfaith dialogue , with the best of intentions , can be vacuous if students are not sufficiently learned our faculty has said you cannot be a competent religious leader if you cannot engage effectively another faith tradition , said alice w hunt , president of chicago theological seminary , which offers an online master s of divinity but , she said , in order to engage another , you need to have a deep engagement with your own faith tradition if that s the case , skipping straight to the dialogue skills , as the claremont lincoln curriculum does , could be hazardous for some students at the same time , dr hunt said , the old model was clearly broken it s costing mainline seminaries 48 , 000 to educate one student , she said if we are charging 15 , 000 in tuition , we have to come up with 33 , 000 more so there is something wrong with that model and , dr hunt added , there are glorious possibilities with online education we are getting ready to graduate the first group of online mdiv students , she said we have someone in the congo who is a un peacekeeper and someone living in in the same class ! can you imagine the experience in that class because of what those people bring \?
how can things get worse for republicans \? jeb bush turned out to be a terrible candidate marco rubio turned out to be an annoying twit donald trump is a nightmare something had to be done , and so the solid , steady moderate elite decided the best strategy was to rally around ted cruz welcome to worse they were terrified of trump , whose short list of foreign policy advisers includes a 2009 college graduate with a r sum that boasts he once took part in a model united nations far better plan to nominate cruz , whose list includes a guy who wrote an opinion piece suggesting president obama is a muslim , and a woman who thinks senator joseph mccarthy s judgment about communists in the federal government was spot on they thought trump would be such an unpopular nominee that the party would face a historic disaster in november obviously , the way to improve chances was to support the most actively disliked republican politician in america our question for today is , why are n't these people rallying around \? the ohio governor is the other trump alternative , far and away the sanest member of the trio true , he s kind of boring , but that does n't seem all that terrible a quality when you 're comparing him with cruz , who is , at his best , excruciatingly irritating senator lindsey graham started the trend of people who loathe ted cruz endorsing him to be president of the united states he admitted that kasich would be a better candidate in november , but claimed that the governor would never get the nomination because he s seen as an insider mitt romney , who announced he 'd be voting for cruz in utah , made it clear that he likes kasich but he said cruz had a better chance of denying trump the nomination yes , romney wanted to make sure he could strike a blow against trump s bigotry and xenophobia so he threw his weight behind cruz , who called for police patrols in american muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized i do n't try to figure them out , said kasich in a phone interview everybody decides these things on the basis of i do n't know what the official republican world now contains people who took a dive and endorsed trump , the ones who 've endorsed cruz and pretended it was a profile in courage , and the ones still sitting on the fence they all look miserable would n't you think a few would just say , look , i know kasich is behind in delegates , but he behaves in the way i want our party to be it would be nice moment , would n't it \? but so far , the list of people who 've gone there is pretty much confined to one exgovernor this week trump and cruz had a fight about their wives an antitrump super pac circulated an old picture of melania trump from gq , posing more or less nude , with the message meet melania trump your next first lady or , you could support ted cruz on tuesday now , candidates do n't control political action committees , but the cruz campaign does have a history of dirty tricks , so you could imagine even a less lunatic person than trump getting angry then trump , in his inimitable way , threatened to spill the beans on heidi cruz leave the families alone ! what this country needs is a beanfree election or at least candidates who can talk about terrorism without being terrifying after the brussels bombing , cruz called for those police patrols , and bragged that he could say something so daring only because he was n't afraid of being politically incorrect trump hyperventilated about waterboarding meanwhile , kasich issued a statement about international cooperation in the war against terror you 'd think that would have moved somebody but no friend i wanted you to be the first to know that today i am endorsing ted cruz for president , jeb bush wrote in an email wednesday morning some political observers believe that he s trying to protect the political future of his son , george p bush , who is currently serving as texas land commissioner if that s the case , noncommitted republicans , you really should consider voting for john kasich just to make it clear that you are not interested in having any more members of the bush family in line for the presidency i did get a text from jeb at 5 30 in the morning , but no phone calls , kasich reported none of these new converts to the cruz camp seem to have any actual arguments about cruz being a good potential president bush , in his announcement , complained that washington is broken but made no attempt whatsoever to explain how things would be improved by the nomination of a senator whose sole achievement in office was an effort to shut down the government maybe they think if cruz is the spoiler at the convention , it 'll be easier to shove him away to make room for a brand new superhero \? \( looking at you , mitt \)

riyadh , saudi arabia troubled by low oil prices and unsettled by a hostile landscape in the middle east heightened by a growing rivalry with iran , is moving to chart an ambitious new direction for the kingdom in a series of sweeping royal decrees announced saturday , king salman replaced top ministers and restructured government bodies , the first concrete steps in a bold plan to reduce the country s heavy dependence on oil , diversify its economy and improve its citizens' quality of life the decrees , which included a restructuring of the oil ministry and the replacement of its longtime minister , ali alnaimi , set in motion a plan that was announced last month to great fanfare by the king s son mohammed bin salman , the deputy crown prince prince mohammed has emerged over the last year as a significant influence in saudi arabia , overseeing economic and oil policy and heading the defense ministry , despite being only about 30 the moves announced saturday amount to a significant restructuring of the government at a difficult time for the kingdom the regional order over which saudi arabia has long prevailed is in tatters , with wars raging in iraq , syria and yemen , and with its regional nemesis , iran , extending its influence those stresses come as low oil prices have shaken the saudi economy , causing the government to run huge budget deficits and leaving government contractors falling behind in paying salaries what you are seeing in saudi arabia is a genuine need for reform that is felt at the very top of the ruling establishment , said adeel malik , the globe fellow in the economies of muslim societies at oxford university you can clearly see that there is fire under the seats of the rulers the rise of prince mohammed has effectively overturned decades of cautious saudi policy traditionally overseen by senior princes , many of whom have found themselves sidelined by a man who is decades younger while some grumble privately , prince mohammed has forged ahead with a clear mandate from king salman , who also put him second in line to the throne , after crown prince mohammed bin nayef , the interior minister prince mohammed bin salman was the driving force behind the country s new development plan , saudi vision 2030 , which many saudis have lauded as a powerful statement of purpose from a royal family that has often failed to communicate its plans or do much to prepare for the future but analysts and economists have questioned the ability of saudi arabia s bloated bureaucracy and unproductive native work force to meet the plan s aggressive targets many of the changes announced saturday were aimed at restructuring the government so it would work toward the plan s goals these included the replacement of the country s longserving oil minister , mr naimi , who is 80 and had held the position since 1995 mr naimi s oversight of oil policy for the kingdom , the world s largest oil exporter , had made him a towering figure whose mere utterances were closely scrutinized by traders seeking to divine the country s thinking the decline in oil prices , which began in mid2014 , led mr naimi to champion the saudi strategy of maintaining production levels to preserve market share and undermine highercost producers like the united states while the approach has largely worked , it has also contributed to an oil glut that has kept prices low , analysts say mr naimi has long been essential to the royal family s policy of using the country s oil wealth to finance government social policy a tradition prince mohammed wants to move away from through widespread privatization although mr naimi had long expressed a wish to retire , the suddenness of his exit struck some foreign analysts as a sign that prince mohammed was flexing his muscles to essentially drop him in a cabinet reshuffle rather than celebrate his retirement was pretty rude , even by saudi standards , said david l goldwyn , who was a senior energy official in the state department during the first obama administration the way he left is a sign of mohammed bin salman making clear that he is directing the appointment of important positions mr naimi was named an adviser to the royal court and was replaced by a younger official , khalid alfalih , who had previously run the health ministry and served as the chairman of saudi aramco , the stateowned oil company some energy experts viewed the appointment of mr falih as a signal to both the saudi power structure and international oil markets that prince mohammed was pushing forward with plans to transform saudi aramco into an energy conglomerate that could invest in projects with less interference from the royal family in the announcement on saturday , the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources was renamed the ministry of energy , industry and natural resources , a semantic shift meant to indicate the country s commitment to diversifying away from oil most energy experts said they did not see mr naimi s departure as a sign that oil policy would soon change , especially with prices gradually rising and saudi leaders refusing to endorse production limits unless iran does as well the saudis sneeze and the oil market catches a cold , but i think it s going to turn out not to mean much , said michael lynch , the president of the consultancy strategic energy and economic research , who has been an adviser to opec by picking khalid alfalih , it does n't seem like this means a radical change other decrees announced on saturday changed the head of the central bank , renamed and combined ministries , and put new officials in charge of water , commerce , social affairs , health and transport all these measures were ultimately aimed at making government more efficient and more accountable , reducing red tape , said fahad nazer , a senior political analyst at jtg inc , a consulting firm based in vienna , va they are clearly meant to help in terms of implementing the vision going forward none of the decrees addressed the country s political structure , and missing from prince mohammed s vision were any moves toward allowing saudis a role in choosing their rulers none of the newly appointed officials were women other changes were in line with goals articulated in the new vision the ministry of hajj , an important body in a country that derives much of its international standing from its management of islam s holiest sites , was changed to the ministry of hajj and umra while the hajj pilgrimage happens once a year , the umra pilgrimage can be done year round , and prince mohammed has spoken of raising the number of umra visitors as a source of unexploited income the body s minister was also replaced many among saudi arabia s large population of young people more than twothirds of the country s 20 million citizens are under 30 speculated on social media , often with sarcasm , about the duties of the newly created general authority for entertainment , a surprising body in a hyperconservative country where public movie theaters are banned and many people flee abroad for vacations and weekends some twitter users responded by posting photos of members of the religious police under the hashtag in arabic oh lord ! one twitter user theater , opera , cinema and stadiums for women another they split the electricity ministry and the water ministries for fear of electrocution joke courtesy of the entertainment authority prince mohammed has spoken about the importance of providing saudis with more ways to enjoy life in their country , although it remains to be seen what new options will be provided under the new plan
a few weeks after senator joined a bipartisan push for an immigration overhaul in 2013 , he arrived alongside senator chuck schumer at the executive dining room of news corporation s manhattan headquarters for dinner their mission was to persuade , the owner of the media empire , and , the chairman and chief executive of its fox news division , to keep the network s onair personalities from savaging the legislation and give it a fighting chance at survival mr murdoch , an advocate of immigration reform , and mr ailes , his top lieutenant and the most powerful man in conservative television , agreed at the jan 17 , 2013 , meeting to give the senators some breathing room but the media executives , highly attuned to the intensifying anger in the republican grass roots , warned that the senators also needed to make their case to , the king of conservative talk radio , who held enormous sway with the party s largely antiimmigrant base so the senators supporting the legislation turned to mr rubio , the florida republican , to reach out to mr limbaugh the dinner at news corporation headquarters which has not been previously reported and the subsequent outreach to mr limbaugh illustrate the degree to which mr rubio served as the chief envoy to the conservative media for the group supporting the legislation the bill would have provided a pathway to american citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants along with measures to secure the borders and ensure that foreigners left the united states upon the expiration of their visas it is a history that mr rubio is not eager to highlight as he takes on , his rival for the republican presidential nomination , who has made his vow to crack down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign those discussions of just a few years ago now seem of a distant era , when , after the reelection of , momentum was building to overhaul the nation s immigration system the senators embarked on a tour of editorial boards and newsrooms , and mr rubio was even featured as the republican savior on the cover of time magazine for his efforts to change immigration laws he already was being mentioned as a 2016 presidential contender now mr trump has become the republican leader in national polls by picking fights with mr ailes and offending the latino voters whom mr rubio had hoped to bring into the republican fold and while mr rubio ultimately abandoned the bipartisan legislation in the face of growing grassroots backlash and the collapse of the conservative media truce , he , and to a certain degree fox news , are still paying for that dinner fox s ratings remain strong , but its standing among republican viewers , influenced by mr trump s offensive , has dropped to a threeyear low , and mr rubio s opponents , for whom mr schumer , a democrat from new york , has become the , continue to depict the florida republican as a duplicitous establishment insider if you look at the gang of eight , ' one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill , senator ted cruz said of mr rubio during thursday s republican debate and as mr rubio defended himself , mr trump s campaign manager , corey lewandowski , posted marco amnesty' rubio on twitter the socalled gang of eight was four democrats and four republicans , including mr rubio , who drafted an immigration bill in 2013 it passed the senate but was stymied by conservative opposition in the house details of the dinner , and a previous one in 2011 , were provided to the new york times by an attendee of one of the meetings and two people with knowledge of what was discussed at both gettogethers none of the attendees agreed to be identified for this article because the conversations were supposed to be confidential but on monday , mr limbaugh shed light on his interactions with the senators when he told a caller frustrated with his criticism of mr rubio that the immigration position the senator had advocated comes right out of the gang of eight bill mr limbaugh added , i 've had it explained to me by no less than senator schumer mr schumer declined to comment for this article but before mr obama s reelection and soon afterward , with conservative senators and media power brokers about the chance to pass comprehensive immigration legislation as early as march 9 , 2011 , mr schumer joined senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina and another eventual member of the gang of eight , at the palm restaurant in manhattan , where they made their case to mr murdoch , mr ailes and mr limbaugh in a private room the senators argued how damaging the word amnesty was to their efforts , and walked mr limbaugh through their vision for an immigration overhaul the senators were especially eager to try to neutralize conservative media , which proved lethal to a big push for immigration changes in 2007 a study by the pew research center s project for excellence in journalism showed that conservative news shows had devoted about a quarter of their time to immigration in late 2012 , after mitt romney , the republican nominee , lost the presidential election in part because of his dismal performance with latino voters , mr rubio joined the fight on one sunday alone in april 2013 , he made an appearance on seven talk shows to advocate the immigration overhaul , including on fox news sunday mr rubio also reached out to other conservative power brokers , including the radio hosts mark levin and laura ingraham , telling them that the legislation did not amount to amnesty the fox anchors sean hannity and bill o 'reilly became more supportive at the time , that mr rubio s advisers were monitoring to the minute how much time the hosts devoted to immigration , and that they are heartened that the volume is much diminished mr rubio publicly and privately worked to assuage the fears of mr limbaugh , who on air called him a thoroughbred conservative and assured one wary listener that is not out to hurt this country or change it the way the liberals are on jan 29 , 2013 , the same day mr obama highlighted immigration in las vegas , mr limbaugh had mr rubio on as a guest to talk about immigration and called him admirable and noteworthy during a warm conversation about the bipartisan immigration plan i know for you border security is the first and last if that does n't happen , none of the rest does , right \? mr limbaugh lobbed well , not just that , swung mr rubio that alone is not enough the conversation concluded with mr rubio saying thank you for the opportunity , rush i appreciate it you bet , mr limbaugh said
moscow a boeing 737800 from the united arab emirates with 62 people aboard crashed early saturday while trying to land at the airport in the southern russian city of rostovondon , russian officials said all 55 passengers and seven crew members on the flight from were killed , and a was published on the website of the rostov regional government vasily golubev , the governor of the rostov region , said strong winds appeared to have caused the crash , but an investigation was just beginning rostovondon is about 600 miles south of moscow both of the plane s flight data recorders were recovered , the russian investigative committee , a law enforcement agency , said in a statement on its website , the agency listed crew error , technical failure , adverse weather conditions and other factors as possible reasons for the crash the airliner was operated by the budget carrier flydubai , which confirmed that the plane had crashed on landing and that none of the passengers had survived fortyfour of the passengers were russian , eight were ukrainian , two were indian and one was a citizen of uzbekistan , the airline said we are doing everything that we can to help those who have been affected , the airline s chief executive , ghaith alghaith , said in a video posted on facebook the crash occurred at 3 42 am as the plane was making its second attempt to land , s emergency situations ministry said after missing its first approach , the plane entered a holding pattern for two hours as it waited for the weather to improve on the second landing attempt , a wing of the plane struck the ground , and the aircraft began to break apart and burn , the statement said based on the preliminary information made available by the russian authorities , aviation safety experts said a sudden change in wind speed or direction a phenomenon known as might have contributed to the crash if the wing did strike the ground , it would indicate a loss of stability at the very least , which could be the result of wind shear , said john j goglia , an aviation safety consultant and a former member of united states national transportation safety board while wind shear can occur at all stages of flight , it is most dangerous during takeoff and landing , when the plane is low and slow , mr goglia said the interfax news agency quoted mr golubev , the regional governor , as saying the plane had crashed short of the runway with all likelihood , the strongly gusting wind , approaching a hurricane level , was the cause of the air crash , interfax quoted mr golubev as saying gusts reached 43 miles per hour at the time of the crash , according to the flightradar24 website , which said there had also been light rain the rostovondon airport is scheduled to be closed next year , after a new one farther from the city center is completed the airport served just over two million passengers last year a wellknown russian pilot , andrei litvinov , said saturday on russian television that the airport lacked advanced navigation equipment that would make the landing procedure easier for pilots president vladimir v putin expressed his condolences to the families of the victims , according to a statement on the kremlin s website mr golubev declared sunday a day of mourning , interfax said flydubai s website said the plane could seat up to 189 people the airline said 33 of the passengers were women and four were children the seven crew members were from cyprus , spain , the seychelles , colombia , kyrgyzstan and , according to the emergency situations ministry s updated list the russian investigative committee said in a statement online that it had set up a team of at least 50 investigators to look into the crash flydubai has grown rapidly since it was founded by the dubai government in 2008 , becoming one of the largest lowcost carriers in the middle east its chairman , sheikh ahmed bin saeed almaktoum , also heads the airline , but the two operate as separate businesses before saturday , flydubai had never recorded a fatal accident its most serious safety threat occurred in january 2015 when one of its planes was while landing at baghdad international airport
sometimes in american politics it seems as if we are all talking past each other , that whatever one side says about an issue like , say , taxes zooms right past the other side the current fight over gun control is not one of those moments it is a howling storm of misrepresentation , sadly almost entirely from one side this week s developments fit the pattern on tuesday in the east room of the white house , president obama that he would be taking a series of executive actions all of them within his powers as president it was an important step , since he sometimes seems alone in washington in his willingness to take on the issue of guns but none of his actions are aimed at taking weapons away from lawabiding citizens , and none will have that effect in fact , there has been no bill in real contention in congress for many years that would reduce the number of guns currently in circulation , or disarm any lawabiding americans and yet , as happens every time , the response from the antiregulation crowd \( even before the white house in public about mr obama s plans \) was to deliberately misstate what mr obama was intending the president said he wanted to increase the number of government agents to process background checks and make the existing system more effective he also plans to modestly expand the number of dealers who need federal licenses under current law and said he would ask congress for more money to combat mental illness the republican machine s reaction took none of that into account from day 1 , house speaker paul ryan , the president has never respected the right to safe and legal gun ownership that our nation has valued since its founding mr ryan said that rather than focus on criminals and terrorists , he goes after the most lawabiding of citizens his words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty unlike mr ryan , senator ted cruz of texas , archright candidate for the republican presidential nomination , did not even wait for the president to talk before he started spitting out his usual talking points on monday this is a president who for seven years has abused his constitutional authority , he said , adding we do n't beat the bad guys by taking away our guns we beat the bad guys by using our guns there may be an interesting argument over whether having more civilians walking around with guns and empowered to use them enhances public safety our position on this page has been that it makes people less safe but propagandists like mr cruz are not interested in conversation mr obama is not proposing taking away our guns in truth , mr obama is not currently advocating renewal or expansion of the expired assault weapons ban , which is politically understandable but still unfortunate it s impossible to believe that mr cruz does not recognize what mr obama is doing , and not doing given the situation , it s hard to imagine a serious conversation about guns as long as politicians in thrall to the gun lobby choose to misrepresent what supporters of gun safety laws are actually saying those supporters , by the way , include the 90 percent of americans who favor universal background checks for gun buyers the hearnothing crowd did not budge when college students were slaughtered on campuses like virginia tech , when grade school children were massacred in connecticut , when people were shot to death in a movie theater in colorado and in so many other places , including every day on our streets and in our homes they were not even moved to have a serious conversation about gun safety after selfproclaimed islamist terrorists attacked lawabiding american citizens in california using weapons obtained in the free market of deathdealing instruments so highly prized by the national rifle association and those who do its bidding
washington the state department on monday released the last set of emails from the 30 , 000 messages on s private computer server , including an email about north korea that remains a between the department and one of the nation s spy agencies over the secrecy of information that passed through the server that email written on july 3 , 2009 , after a north korean ballistic missile test was one of four that prompted intensified scrutiny of the emails for classified information and a referral last year to the fbi for a review of the handling of classified information by mrs clinton , her aides and other state department officials while she was secretary of state it was released as part of a chain of five replies and forwards on monday with portions blocked out on the grounds that they contained information now classified secret , though not top secret , the higher classification that the spy agency , the national geospatialintelligence agency , had cited last summer the original assessment was not correct , and the document does not contain top secret information , a state department spokesman , john kirby , said he added that the department had agreed to classify some of it provisionally pending further review , an indication that the dispute over the contents had not yet been resolved a spokesman for mrs clinton s presidential campaign , brian fallon , said the ongoing disagreement about the north korean test means that the intelligence community s inspector general was wrong in his belief that this email was top secret' mrs clinton and her aides have said that the intelligence agencies are overzealously classifying information , and in this case the state department agreed the designation of secret nevertheless added to the list of emails that the department has released only after removing information that is now considered sensitive on national security grounds among the final 1 , 723 emails released on monday were 23 that the department upgraded to secret , bringing the total classified as such to 65 another 2 , 028 have had portions blocked out , or redacted , because the information is now confidential of the four emails that prompted the referral to the fbi , only one has now been classified as top secret it was among 22 emails that the state department at the demand of the cia said it would not disclose , even in part , because they contained some of the nation s most closely guarded secrets in addition to the email involving north korea s missile test , another was released last fall in full , while the third was released with portions blocked out as confidential , the lowest level of classification officials have declined to specify those in all , less than 10 percent of the emails that passed through mrs clinton s server contained confidential or secret information that was enough to prompt reviews by the inspectors general of the state department and the intelligence agencies , and by congress and the fbi , over the mishandling of classified information the focus of those reviews , officials have said , has been on the privy to her personal email address and on diplomats who sent messages that were forwarded by those aides , like huma abedin and jake sullivan , who served as a deputy chief of staff during mrs clinton s term none of the emails were marked as classified at the time they were sent and while the state department has said that the upgrades do not reflect any judgment of their sensitivity at the time , the designations nonetheless suggested that at least some of the information should not have been sent over an unsecured system like hers , officials have said mr kirby also announced that one more email between mrs clinton and president obama would not be released , adding to 18 that the state department said in january it would not release , citing longstanding precedent that the white house controls presidential communications another email was being withheld , mr kirby said , at the request of a law enforcement agency , presumably because it was related to a continuing investigation mr kirby declined to discuss either email , except to say that both were unclassified the end of the department s releases of the 30 , 068 emails , which came in 14 batches , including four in february , did not mean the end of the legal and political controversy over mrs clinton s use of the private server in the case of the email about north korea , the state department also disputed the initial effort to assert that it contained classified information the assertion came through the inspector general for the intelligence agencies , i charles mccullough iii the email in question was written by a senior watch officer in the department s operations center , shelby smithwilson , and sent to mrs clinton s executive staff although that portion was entirely redacted , one government official familiar with the contents said it described a conference call among senior officials , including mrs clinton , about the ballistic missile test that north korea conducted that day in violation of united nations security council resolutions the email chain was forwarded with additional comments and the unofficial translation of a statement by the japanese foreign ministry to mrs clinton s closest aides , including ms abedin , mr sullivan and cheryl d mills , her chief of staff in

even before two deeply unpleasant days in her madrid hotel room , lucie safarova , last year s , had had enough there had been a powerful bacterial infection , followed by a debilitating condition that was slow to be diagnosed and turned out to be reactive arthritis there had been weeks in a czech hospital bed , months without running , much less hitting a tennis ball when safarova made it back to the wta tour , where she had only recently become a main attraction , there were five consecutive openinground losses in singles , the first four in straight sets relief finally arrived in her home country , the czech republic , where she swept to the title in prague on april 30 and was showered in confetti on the court before boarding a flight for madrid very special and very emotional , she said in an interview last week but instead of basking in the afterglow and enjoying the madrid open , safarova ended up with food poisoning she suffered in her hotel for two days after her firstround victory over coco vandeweghe and was forced to withdraw safarova , however sweet natured and newly philosophical , had really had enough i'm like ok , well , this is the last thing , she said i was like , now i come back and you give me food poisoning i have to be super lucky the entire rest of the year you owe me safarova was laughing as she described her latest painful memory , and laughter has served her well in the last two years both in boom times with her impish and unconventional canadian coach , rob steckley , and during the unexpectedly big dips that have followed the trouble began in august at the tournament in new haven , conn , where she reached the final but tore an abdominal muscle , which contributed to her firstround defeat at the after a vacation with her boyfriend on the greek island of corfu , she returned to the czech republic and was soon hospitalized with a bacterial infection she returned to the tour in october in a push to reach her first wta tour finals she managed it , but the quest affected her nowfragile health while doctors in the czech republic tried to pinpoint the source of her acute joint pain and inflammation , she had to cancel a florida training camp with steckley and withdraw from the australian open she did not return to the tour until late february after recovering from a left wrist injury that also had developed i had a long career , she said and finally i'm figuring everything out , doing so well and being at my best , feeling like , yeah , i'm finally enjoying the moment , and then this comes , like , out of nowhere , and then you are just wondering , why \? reactive arthritis is set off by an infection , and though safarova now must monitor her immune system and tournament schedule in order to reduce the risk of a relapse , she said she was back to normal training and had recovered most of her endurance she is now on a glutenfree and lactosefree diet just to really detox my body from all the medicine i 've had to take in the last half year , she said and so far , i have to say that i 've felt really , really good on the court after changing it , so i might maintain it even if the idea was just to do it for a month or so i feel still energized it s just hard , especially in italy all the good pasta and mozzarella , just looking at it and crying in an interview earlier this year , steckley said they should have paid more attention to warning signs that safarova was getting worn down last year any of these types of symptoms have to be dealt with immediately , no matter where you are , he said if you 're being fatigued too quickly or not recovering properly , you ca n't just put it down to diet or dehydration it could be something that is forming , like it had been with lucie throughout the year she took advantage of her forced layoff by working on her new house in brno , spending time with her family and friends and reading robin sharma s selfhelp hit the monk who sold his ferrari but there is no escaping that at 29 , she has lost time and momentum in a sport in which disorder continues to reign behind topranked serena williams , a champion who has bounced back from plenty of adversity of her own that includes last year s , where williams fought through the flu and wildly fluctuating form to win the title , in a final that started out as oneway traffic and turned into something closer to the arc de triomphe roundabout at rush hour safarova , seemingly on her way to straightforward defeat , rallied with help from an edgy williams then , up two games to none , safarova took a 300 lead in the third game of the third set before williams clawed and cursed her way back in front to win , 63 , 67 \( 2 \) , 62 honestly , serena stepped up and played a couple really good games and just pressured me so much , safarova said maybe if i would be back there again , what i would do different is just take more risk even though i would maybe do mistakes , i would just take the risk because she was anyway so strong that just keeping the ball in play would n't be the solution safarova s ability to swing more freely on the big points and returns was a key to her surge in 2015 , along with her improved fitness and her lefthanded serve , which is a lot nastier than her personality she is one of those really genuine girls that she could have just had the worst loss in her career , and if you had something going on in your life that you needed to talk to her about , she would take the time to sit down , said bethanie matteksands , her regular doubles partner their pairing with the hashtag has been a major success , with grand slam titles last year at the australian open and the french open and another significant tour title in miami this year they intend to play at roland garros and at wimbledon steckley , a driving and creative force behind safarova s 2015 success and her eventual return to the tour this year , will miss the french open , citing his own health concerns and personal reasons he declined to elaborate on it s sad he wo n't be in paris , but i hope he will be back after that , safarova said steckley indicated that he intended to continue coaching safarova , but his absence from roland garros will make it harder for her to recapture the buoyant spirit of her selfieinfused run that included victories over maria sharapova , garbi e muguruza and ana ivanovic but i think they 're in touch almost every day , so it s not too faroff , said matteksands , who is also close to steckley he s just not going to be here in person , and we 'll miss him but he has his priorities in life , too , and i think we all understand it safarova , back at no 13 in the rankings with a daunting bundle of points to defend at roland garros , said her own priorities and perspective had shifted , too right now , honestly , everybody is asking me , do you feel pressure about going into the french open and everything \? ' she said and you know what \? i'm just really happy i can play
melbourne , australia roger federer wants names , and , frankly , so do all of us after the start of the australian open was dominated by discussion of matchfixing and betting patterns instead of matchwinning and baseline patterns if you were craig tiley , the tournament director of the australian open , this was rotten timing but it was hardly time wasted tennis could use this latest teaching moment there is no more serious , cynical matter in sports which seem besieged by the serious and the cynical at the moment than throwing a match and according to those who investigate such matters , there is none more difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt therein lies the big limitation of by the bbc and buzzfeed that claimed to have uncovered evidence that 16 players ranked in the top 50 over the last decade had repeatedly been flagged to the tennis integrity unit , tennis s internal watchdog , by betting authorities over suspicions that they had thrown matches that list , according to the report , includes a grand slam singles winner , and those players apparently play on , eight of them in this australian open but the report did not name names clearly for legal reasons i would love to hear names , federer said after advancing to the second round then at least it s concrete stuff , and you can actually debate about it was it the player \? was it the support team \? who was it \? was it before \? was it a doubles player , a singles player \? which slam \? it s so all over the place it s nonsense to answer something that is pure speculation the speculation is usually based on betting patterns , which can be damning but betting patterns are , at best , corroborating evidence when it comes to proving corruption if a tennis player throws a match or in this spotbetting era , a game or a set there generally has to be a direct link to a gambler or , to use industry parlance , a corrupter in order to generate a viable case looking at something and saying , that looks suspicious , ' and actually having evidence are two different things , and suspicious data does n't equate to the fact that a player has done something wrong , said mark young , a vice chairman and the chief legal officer of the atp tour betting patterns , which people tend to emphasize a great deal , are a source of a red flag to look into something , but they can often easily be explained by people closer to the sport and when they ca n't be explained , it does n't equal a corrupt match and if it does , it does n't equal the fact that one of the players themselves is involved what those patterns definitely should equal , however , is plenty of robust activity in the tennis integrity unit , which was formed in 2008 after a surge in suspicious betting activity in tennis the constructive question at this stage is whether the unit is functioning as effectively and ethically as it should at a time when gambling on tennis continues to grow and , most worryingly , to grow at the lowest levels of the professional game , where public interest and institutional oversight are low and the risks of corruption particularly high this is a very tough space for tennis , said richard ings , a former atp executive who was in charge of the tour s anticorruption efforts in the early 2000s you have shifting odds at a mexican challenger the player losing is south american the bookie is in london the bets are placed on a computer in rome from a betting account in austria and i was sitting in the office in florida look , suspicious betting patterns happen weekly some can be explained by injury or illness or lethargy others ca n't be fixing happens it s too easy , too lucrative and too tough to prove for it not to it happens at all levels the focus is , is the tiu resourced right with onsite systems \? i ca n't answer that the investigation by the bbc and buzzfeed makes the case that the tennis integrity unit needs work , lots of work that it has failed to pursue suspicious cases aggressively and that it lacks the resources to do a difficult job comprehensively tennis officials like young and the united states tennis association chief executive gordon a smith defend the unit s work and its approach young said , i know every one of these reports or betting alerts goes to the tiu , and i'm confident the tiu looks at every one of them but there are clearly legitimate concerns about resources according to young , the annual budget for the unit is 2 million it has six investigators whose job is to cover a truly global sport in which about 120 , 000 professional matches are played annually yes , the unit does get considerable assistance from the betting companies , who have a big financial interest in preserving the integrity of their system , and from the law enforcement authorities but six investigators and 2 million seems low , considering the importance of the issue and the need to monitor the vast and murky world of the lowestlevel futures circuit , and also considering that many of the biggest concerns continue to reside in eastern european nations , where police cooperation is at its lowest the sport has tried to be proactive of late , finally increasing prize money in its minor leagues but the incentive to cheat to survive remains strong what we 've learned is gamblers do n't care , young said betting on a challenger match is just as lucrative to them as betting on a grand slam match it would seem to be time to truly flood the zone put more boots on the ground in the futures , where live scoring has increased the volume of betting and spot betting it also seems smart to increase the educational outreach on the junior circuit for now , the integrity unit gives presentations to juniors at some of the grand slam events , including the australian open , but there needs to be more interaction with juniors at the national level , above all in countries where the integrity unit knows the corruption risks are the highest there is also the transparency issue , which is trickier than it first seems , because what might seem like innocuous information worth releasing publicly to outsiders could be news that insiders could use there is oversight all four of the game s governing bodies the international tennis federation , the wta tour , the atp and the grand slam tournaments have officers who monitor the integrity unit there are quarterly reports and internal accountability but the cone of silence is still too thick ideally , there would be a way to release more information on suspicious cases that are examined and then dismissed but at the very least , in this time of legitimate skepticism about the integrity of sports federations and officials , the integrity unit should regularly publish some general figures to give a better sense of the scope of its activities if we ca n't have names until players are penalized , at least give us grounds for more faith
