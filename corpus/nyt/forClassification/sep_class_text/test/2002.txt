washington soviet propagandists used to touch up photographs to remove the face of a kremlin official who had fallen from favor , making him a nonperson the same disinformation technique is now being used to wipe out the fact of a meeting in prague in april , 2001 five months before the sept 11 attacks on the us between mohamed atta , the leading qaeda hijacker , and ahmed alani , the iraqi consul in prague , who was saddam hussein s intelligence case officer there on meet the press yesterday , sergei ivanov , russia s foreign minister \( like his boss , a former kgb disinformation specialist \) said of this widely reported iraqiqaeda connection that is wrong information that denial of an observed connection between bin laden s suicide bomber and saddam s spymaster was preceded by a david ignatius column in the washington post last week deriding such reports by me and by james woolsey , former cia chief , in the wall street journal poohpoohing the notion of a meeting that supposedly took place , ignatius asserted there is no solid evidence of such a link on the contrary , he opined , hard intelligence to support the baghdadbin laden connection is somewhere between slim' and 'none' my colleague in columny , a respected commentator with a fine writing style , bases his conclusion on recent interviews with senior european officials \( he also wears another hat as executive editor of the international herald tribune and i am buttering him up in the hope he will not kill my column therein \) these unidentified europeans tell him that the cia now shares their skepticism about the attaal ani connection even the czechs have gradually backed away let us now depart from the line that ivanov and senior european officials and supposedly backingaway czechs are peddling to gullible commentators \( could n't help it you can cut that line in the trib \) on solid evidence the czech intelligence agency , bis , had the iraqi embassy spy in prague under constant visual and wiretap surveillance , especially after a threat to the radio free europe headquarters there three months ago , after the absolvesaddam campaign began to cast doubt on the report of the attaal ani meeting at the prague airport , interior minister stanislav gross issued a statement that bis guarantees the information , so we stick by that information no backing away on the contrary , strong reaffirmation on corroboration of the evidence that atta flew 7 , 000 miles , from virginia beach to prague and back to florida \( his third trip to prague in a year \) the fbi has carrental and other records that atta left for prague on april 8 , 2001 , and returned on april 11 the bis report of the meeting that saddam s case officer had with the suicide hijacker fell precisely within those dates czech intelligence , in identifying alani s contact as atta , had no knowledge of the fbi s evidence that independently corroborates atta s brief presence in prague on cia assessment of the evidence james risen reported in the new york times last month that while not enough evidence ties saddam specifically to sept 11 , senior american intelligence officials have concluded that the meeting between mr atta and the iraqi officer , ahmed khalil ibrahim samir alani , did take place congressional intelligence committees could confirm that with one secure phone call now let s walk back the cat , as the spooks say what s behind the campaign to cast doubt on the meeting \? it cannot be only posteriorcovering by junior cia analysts and nsa big ear monitors who should have known of a meeting about what was then believed to be the terrorist threat to americans at rfe in prague the smooth russian diplomat , european officials and arab potentates seeking to erase the evidence have one purpose to throw dust in our eyes about saddam s clandestine support of international terrorism they do n't want the us to have any reason to liberate the iraqi people they see great profit in doing oil business with saddam and collecting tens of billions in debts the name of their game is delay to demand evidence of nuclear development while unfettered inspections are forbidden , and to dismiss as a nonmeeting the hard evidence of a terrorist connection meanwhile , iraqi scientists race to build the weapons that would blackmail into impotence any power daring to unseat saddam
east rutherford , nj , june 12 shaquille o'neal smiled and basked in his own untouchable sphere , accepting highfives in the middle of his court the nba finals his sidekick , kobe bryant , slipped over to nets coach byron scott and hugged him when the final buzzer sounded on the season , the rest of the los angeles lakers followed their indomitable leaders onto the continental arena floor , rejoicing in quiet congratulation for winning a third consecutive world championship by seizing a 113107 victory tonight over the nets , the lakers became only the fifth team in nba history to win three consecutive championships and only the seventh team to sweep the finals four games to none that was a sweet victory for us , said lakers coach phil jackson , who tied red auerbach s record for the most titles as a head coach , nine these are men of action , that s what s wonderful while the lakers were spraying champagne in their locker room , the nets had the sour taste of frustration in theirs kenyon martin , the emotional leader of the team who scored a careerhigh 35 points , even suggested that some of his teammates did not show up tonight but in the end , all of the nets could not stop o'neal , who had 34 points , 10 rebounds and 4 assists o'neal , the lakers' center , was named the most valuable player of the finals for the third consecutive time only michael jordan had accomplished that on two separate occasions o'neal , a 71 foot , 350pounder , had also swept three records for a fourgame finals scoring 145 points and hitting 45 free throws in 68 attempts against the overmatched nets , who were making their first nba finals appearance , the lakers became the first team to win three championships in only 15 games , taking each title one game faster than the last this one is making our stamp as one of the great teams of all time , said bryant , who had 25 points , 8 assists and 6 rebounds but with 1 minute 24 seconds left , even martin gave way to tears , drying them in a towel and knowing that the nets' remarkable season was drawing to a close after the game , martin surprisingly criticized his teammates , and jason kidd agreed some guys do n't have it in them , martin said but in the end , the nets could not stop o'neal and could only watch as bryant squelched them in the final quarter tonight , as much as the nets tried , was no different from any of the first three games two guys do n't beat the lakers , said kidd , who had 13 points and 12 assists we thought we could win one game that would give us some confidence but the big thing is we had a great season nobody had picked us to be in this position , for us to get this far with the talent we had with the guys we had the nets realized they were undermanned against o'neal and bryant , as well as tradition the lakers won their 14th title , including five when they were the minneapolis lakers and the nets walked away not quite emptyhanded , but with a hollow feeling nonetheless they had held a 3point lead in the fourth quarter until bryant and o'neal and derek fisher wrested it from them , taking an 80 run all the way to the title since game 4 of the western conference finals against sacramento , when robert horry hit the gamewinning 3pointer at the buzzer , the lakers seemed to become a different team since coming back to win the final two games of that series , they seemed motivated to reach the one destination they had sought since the beginning of the season with 442 seconds left and the lakers holding a 109103 lead with bryant on the line , nets coach byron scott conceded defeat he put in his reserves and waited for the celebration on his home court for the lakers , they never stopped soaring it went by fast , said bryant it s an unbelievable feeling to have right now it says we are a great team , everybody stuck to the role , everybody stuck to the script , even when times were socalled hard , o'neal said the first one , it s a novelty and it feels good , bryant said of winning the title the first one will always be the best one the second one , adversity that we went through throughout the course of the year made that one special we proved that we belonged this one , it s kind of making us step up as one of the great teams the lakers were leading , 8480 , to begin the fourth quarter when kidd and martin brought the nets back with a 70 run that , coupled with the 4 points to end the third quarter , gave the nets an 8784 lead with 10 05 to play when martin hit the first of two free throws by bryant , who had shot just 3 of 11 , hit a 3pointer to tie the score brian shaw hit a jumper to give the lakers an 8987 lead and after martin answered with a jumper , devean george made a 3pointer to give the lakers a 9289 lead that would ignite a 134 run that spelled doom for the nets a play that symbolized the nets' futility in this series came with 5 42 to play when martin and o'neal wrestled for the ball the lakers won the jump ball and fisher hit a 22footer from the left corner for a 9793 lead while the rookie jason collins fought o'neal for position under the basket o'neal toppled collins to the court , and collins was whistled for the foul o'neal made the free throw to give the lakers a 9893 lead when bryant hit a jumper to give the lakers a 10093 lead with 5 minutes to play , the nets were finished i thought that we gave them too much respect in the first two games , scott said you ca n't show them that type of respect , you have to go after them martin felt that he was one of the only ones doing that look at the stat sheet , martin said keith van horn shot just 3 of 7 for 7 points and kerry kittles was just 4 of 10 with 11 points martin made 15 of his 28 field goal attempts to go with his 35 points , and lucious harris scored 22 points off the bench martin had scored 17 points to o'neal s 12 in the first quarter , setting the pace for a nets' 3427 lead he scored 13 points in the fourth quarter , but bryant scored 11 and o'neal scored 6 , including making four of five free throws in the final quarter when the lakers' will was just too much you can pick your poison , kidd said you 're going to watch shaq dunk the ball all night or you 're going to hope that their outside shooters do n't make them the lakers did , hitting 11 of 19 3pointers o'neal inside bryant outside the nets had no answers the lakers were crowned photos shaquille o'neal , who finished with 34 points , received the finals mvp trophy from commissioner david stern as coach phil jackson and kobe bryant looked on \(

uniondale , ny , july 6 in an arena football league game featuring three fewer interceptions than running plays , the new jersey gladiators handed the new york dragons their sixth consecutive loss , pounding them , 7650 , at nassau coliseum tonight new jersey quarterback jay mcdonagh threw six touchdown passes , five to mike horacek , and rushed for another score to lead the gladiators it was definitely a great win for us , said gladiators coach frank haege , whose team is 84 , good for first place in the eastern division hopefully , we can take some momentum from this game , close the season strong and get a good seed for the playoffs for those who have never seen the indoor game , it bears more of a resemblance to backyard games than to nfl play scoring is fast , defense is nonexistent and the plays often look as if the quarterback used his finger to draw them up on the center s chest before the snap this is a game in which quarterbacks and receivers are king the two teams combined for four rushes in the first half , one of which turned out to be among the game s biggest plays after being held to a field goal in their first possession , a mortal sin in this league , the dragons needed to score on their remaining firsthalf possessions to stay within striking distance of the gladiators but trailing , 1410 , on their first secondquarter drive , quarterback aaron garcia fumbled on firstandgoal from the 1 new jersey s jeremy wilkinson recovered in the end zone , and four plays later mcdonagh and horacek connected on their third touchdown to give the gladiators a 2110 lead it was just one of those things where we had the right play called and the fullback ran into the quarterback and we lost the ball , coach john gregory said of the fumble horacek , one of the team s offensive specialists \( in arena ball this is a position , not a description \) , finished with 10 catches for 157 yards and 5 touchdowns turnovers by quarterbacks have been a major reason for the dragons' 29 record while garcia was away , trying to catch on with the san francisco 49ers at spring minicamp , the dragons tried scott semptimpheter , matt nagy and the former giants quarterback danny kanell none were particularly effective semptimpheter was traded to detroit , and nagy and kanell combined for 13 interceptions in 11 games garcia , a former arena league offensive player of the year , was playing in his third game with the dragons since returning from his tryout but he has not been much better in addition to his goalline fumble , garcia buried his team in the third quarter with two interceptions , one of which was returned for a score by carl greenwood the teams combined for another 50 points in the fourth quarter , with the former jet glenn foley seeing action in the waning minutes for the dragons , but the gladiators were never threatened the loss eliminated the dragons from playoff contention coming into the season , i thought we would be competitive , but without aaron it s been tough , gregory said it has been a very tough season
investors in the troubled telecommunications sector stepped up their pace to the exits yesterday the hardest hit were qwest communications international and worldcom , two concerns with heavy debt loads and enough questions about their accounting to be the subjects of investigations by the securities and exchange commission but companies like verizon communications , sbc communications and bellsouth , which had fared well by comparison this year , also sagged under the selling pressure yesterday people are realizing that telecom is sick and getting sicker , said scott c cleland , chief executive of the precursor group , a market research firm in washington that specializes in telecommunications qwest s bad day began with a report in the wall street journal that state regulators were investigating the company s secret agreements with other phone companies in the 14 western states where it is the dominant local phone company according to complaints about qwest s activities , some of the agreements gave favored carriers better terms for the use of qwest s network and were intended to silence critics at rival companies as qwest pursued federal and state regulatory approval to enter the longdistance business in the region some of the agreements are said to have included price discounts or other terms that the company should have made available to all local rivals and should have been made public in regulatory filings , critics contend qwest said yesterday that none of the contracts in question violated any laws it has asked the federal communications commission for a ruling on the matter covering all of the states in its region the most publicized of the complaints , which has been pursued by the minnesota department of commerce , is the subject of a penalty hearing scheduled to begin today before that state s public utilities commission state officials have said qwest could be fined as much as 200 million wall street s biggest concern , though , is that the battles could delay qwest s hopes to begin offering longdistance service in much of its home region this fall such longdistance services are expected to quickly become a multibilliondollar business for qwest the company , which is based in denver , desperately needs the cash to start reducing its debt , but opposition is growing the complaints about qwest s handling of the contracts and relations with other carriers are being formally or informally investigated by regulators in all of the states in the region , said bob rowe , a public utilities commissioner in montana mr rowe is chairman of a committee set up by 13 of the states to coordinate operating tests qwest must pass under federal law before gaining the right to sell long distance in the region mr rowe said nothing in yesterday s report was new or was likely to delay the process but wall street did not see it that way shares of qwest fell 79 cents , or 137 percent , to 496 they are down nearly 65 percent this year worldcom received an even more thorough battering as fears grew that its debt ratings would soon be lowered below investment grade by the major ratings agencies the company s bond prices , many of which are already at prices indicating expectations of bankruptcy , fell at least 10 percent , traders said shares of worldcom fell 92 cents , or 28 percent , to 235 the tracking stock of the company s mci subsidiary lost 81 cents , or 19 percent , to 344 , despite worldcom s assurances that it intends to maintain the mci stock dividend through the end of the year verizon , which lost 205 , to 3915 , had the largest decline among the regional bell companies att and sprint , worldcom s two largest longdistance rivals , had more modest losses it s expectations that demand will remain weak , said john hodulik , an analyst at ubs warburg , who noted that every stock he follows fell yesterday

the hague , oct 2 a bosnian serb leader today became the first high official to plead guilty of crimes against humanity and to express remorse publicly for the war and bloodshed in the balkans the decision by the official , biljana plavsic , the former bosnian serb president , opens the door for her potentially crucial testimony against slobodan milosevic , the former president of yugoslavia , or other leaders involved in the 199295 bosnian war as part of the plea agreement , all other charges against mrs plavsic , who was not in court for her plea , will be dropped , including genocide immediately after her guilty plea , her lawyer at the war crimes tribunal in the hague said that no deal had been made involving her sentence or testimony but under court rules , mrs plavsic can be compelled to testify eugene o sullivan , cocounsel to mrs plavsic , said in a statement that by accepting responsibility and expressing her remorse fully and unconditionally , she hoped to offer some consolation to the victims of the bosnian war , muslim , croat and serb many thousands were killed or imprisoned and uncounted others were driven from their homes he added that she understood that she is subjecting herself to a possible sentence of life imprisonment the unexpected guilty plea compounded the day s exceptional events at the tribunal indeed , it seemed timed to take advantage of the unusually large presence in the hague of reporters and television crews from the former yugoslavia to watch the duel of two aging balkan leaders for earlier , in the same courtroom , mr milosevic , the jailed former serbian strongman , and stjepan mesic , the current croatian president , spent the morning sparring today it was mr milosevic s turn to crossexamine mr mesic , a day after mr mesic testified against mr milosevic , repeatedly accusing him of blocking all political solutions and provoking the wars that broke up yugoslavia some lawyers said they were impressed by the sight of the two leaders arguing in an international criminal court , if only because it had seemed unthinkable until recently for a long time , the tribunal created in 1993 to deal with the balkan conflicts of the 1990 s had only few and lowranking defendants on trial the croatian president , a sharp debater , seemed unperturbed by mr milosevic s relentless questioning he even addressed him scathingly as mr accused mr milosevic started off questioning mr mesic about his time in prison and about political killings in croatia , asking him if he had been involved in any of them mr mesic replied , i had as much to do with that as i had with lincoln s assassination several times , mr milosevic s questions backfired , allowing mr mesic to add further possibly detrimental information as the old adversaries traded accusations and broadsides , they often set off laughter in the public gallery , which was packed with observers from serbia and croatia observers can be seen but not heard in the court , which is shielded with thick bulletproof glass the presiding judge , richard may , often stepped in to bring mr milosevic , and sometimes both men , back to order at one point , after mr mesic told mr milosevic that he was talking nonsense , judge may said , we are not going to continue in this way then , as the two men quibbled about the inflammatory writings of a 19thcentury croatian politician , mr may wryly intervened the trial chamber is not assisted by the exchange of abuse , he said , particularly abuse of 100 years ago the judge also warned mr milosevic that he was not using his time to his advantage by repeatedly straying off the subject , making speeches and accusing mr mesic of crimes , rather than questioning his evidence mr milosevic , what you must understand is that attacking others is not a form of defense , judge may said it is of no relevance as for mrs plavsic , her guilty plea took most court watchers by surprise here you have a main player in the war facing the truth , florence hartmann , spokeswoman for the prosecutor , told reporters after the plea we hope others will accept their responsibility for the past events it s the first time a highlevel serb leader expresses remorse and reaches out to the victims sentencing hearings for mrs plavsic , a 72yearold former professor of biology , will take place in december she spoke today by video link from an undisclosed location in the balkans , where she is free on provisional release judges informed her today that she could remain at liberty for security reasons until the december hearings court officials said her guilty plea , apparently proposed by the prosecution , came after long negotiations by lawyers on both sides seven other defendants have pleaded guilty before the tribunal , but none of them are as highranking as mrs plavsic her case has been special from the beginning the only woman publicly accused by the tribunal of war crimes , she surrendered to the court in january 2001 at first , she pleaded not guilty to eight counts of war crimes , including genocide , related to her role as the vice president of the bosnian serbs during the war she was close to radovan karadzic , the bosnian leader , whom she succeeded after the war both dr karadzic and gen ratko mladic , the military leader , have been indicted twice for similar charges by the tribunal , but they remain at large when she surrendered , an official from the prosecutor s office described her as such a key figure during the bosnia war that there is much that she can tell us , even about milosevic prosecutors also hoped that she would provide valuable information about momcilo krajisnik , her codefendant and the righthand man to dr karadzic in the war among lawyers monitoring the court , some looked beyond her possible role as a future witness it s critically important for someone at such a high level to say they did wrong , said judith armatta , a lawyer and trial observer for the coalition for international justice , a tribunal support group based in washington there is the possibility of a snowball effect and it will help the truth process in the region ms hartmann , the prosecutor s spokeswoman , said she believed that expressing remorse is a big step in the process of reconciliation , adding , to deny what people went through is like a second death for victims photo

salang , afghanistan , jan 19 the first cars and trucks began passing through the salang tunnel this week , venturing into a twilight world of twisted metal , piles of rocks , exposed wire and icicles that hang like stalactites at the mouth of a cave this is perhaps the most strategic 17 miles in afghanistan , bisecting the hindu kush mountains at an altitude of 11 , 034 feet to connect the northern and southern parts of the country it had been closed since 1997 , after repeated bombing by the northern alliance left it in ruins now the salang tunnel is open , barely , and its deplorable condition attests to the hugeness of the rebuilding job that faces afghanistan on monday , at a conference in tokyo , afghanistan plans to make its first formal request for billions of dollars in aid to repair its public works and rehabilitate its institutions the united states , japan , saudi arabia and the european union countries have indicated that they will contribute , though the precise amounts are a wellkept secret a senior bush administration official said the best estimate of the cost of reconstruction by the united nations and the world bank was on the order of 17 billion in the first year , 10 billion over five years and 15 billion over the next decade as big as those numbers are , the amount may not be enough officials here say afghanistan s interim government will ask for nearly 2 billion to cover the first year of rebuilding to fix everything that has been broken will require much more up to 30 billion , afghan officials say there are very few parts of afghanistan that do n't need to be rebuilt , said omar samad , a spokesman for the government almost everything in the country is a shambles at the public works ministry , where workmen are replacing blownout windows , officials said 80 percent of the bridges and highways had been damaged or destroyed during the taliban era and the earlier years of fighting among rival mujahedeen forces in kabul nearly a third of the public buildings and 40 percent of the houses have been leveled western kabul , once the most affluent quarter of the city , was shelled relentlessly by mujahedeen in 1993 kabul s main water system was looted by the fighters , who sold off the pipes and fixtures in pakistan although the united nations and other aid groups helped to rebuild it , there is not enough power to run the pumps and generators as a result only 30 percent of the homes in kabul , a city of one million , have drinkable water the shortage of electricity causes regular blackouts throughout the city it also means that most people heat their homes with woodburning stoves , if at all with few working telephones , even senior government officials have trouble reaching each other the situation outside kabul is even bleaker in the shamali plain , the front line between the taliban and northern alliance , entire villages have been razed , driving more than 100 , 000 people into refugee camps in eastern afghanistan and in pakistan during the recent american bombing campaign , northern cities like mazarisharif , kunduz and taliqan suffered extensive bombing , as did jalalabad in the east and kandahar in the south in every afghan conflict the commanders used much of their firepower to cut off routes between the cities the salang tunnel is a case in point built with the help of the soviet union in 1964 , it has been a crucial commercial route for trucks and buses heading from kabul to the northern provinces after 1996 it became a flash point in the war between the taliban and the northern alliance in may 1997 the northern alliance blew up the north end of the tunnel to cut off taliban troops who were fleeing an offensive today , the debris has been cleared , but the hole remains , giving travelers a jagged view of sky before they emerge from the tunnel officials at the public works ministry estimate that it will cost 6 million to plug the hole and repair the other damage russia is providing some help it has sent 30 engineers and other specialists to inspect the tunnel but the afghan workers who spent the last two months dragging out iron girders and hunks of concrete have not been paid the government has not given us enough money to do our jobs , said fazel rahman , a project supervisor that is because the government is , for all intents and purposes , bankrupt the taliban looted the central bank before they fled kabul , leaving the country with less than 100 , 000 in reserves tax collection in this land of independent warlords is a pipe dream not one of the government s 235 , 000 employees , from senior civil servants to janitors , has been paid for six months the government says it needs 100 million to pay the back salaries , plus money for paychecks and operating expenses for the next six months you cannot have a functioning government if you do n't pay the salaries of your workers , mr samad , the government spokesman , said we need to have credibility in the eyes of the afghan people afghanistan s education system has also been damaged by years of neglect and the taliban s fundamentalist policies girls were barred from school , as were female teachers traditional high schools were converted into religious schools , known as madrasas the deputy education minister , moyen marastial , calls it the talibanization of the education system we keep hearing we are starting from zero , he said but we are starting from minus zero we have to clean up a lot of things before we can even think about rebuilding afghanistan plans to reopen its schools on march 22 but about half of the schoolhouses are destroyed , while another quarter are damaged almost none have desks , chairs , textbooks or supplies about 500 , 000 girls will enroll , putting an enormous strain on the depleted ranks of teachers mr marastial said the government had registered about 10 , 000 new teachers , mostly women who had been forced to give up their jobs by the taliban still , he figures the country is only halfway toward its goal of hiring 50 , 000 to 60 , 000 teachers , even though is no more able to pay teachers than government workers at the aishadurani school , a stately but dilapidated girls' school in kabul , teachers lined up by the hundreds the other day for free jugs of cooking oil the oil was donated by a businessman as a way to help the teachers until they were paid under the taliban the school was converted to offices for the kabul school district now it was functioning as relief center a school official tried to keep order as the teachers , most of them women in burkas , elbowed each other aside for the oil in the middle of the melee , the official , jamshed faizi , still managed to sound optimistic about the coming school year afghans are a very resilient people , he said they put up with a lot of difficulties and survive photos the devastation of afghanistan is evident in the salang tunnel , top , where light enters through a break created by bombs , and in the heavily damaged buildings of the kartai mamorain of kabul \( photographs by chang w lee the new york times \)
elsh , luxembourg , march 20 like many steel towns in pennsylvania or ohio , this one is still home to a hulking old mill in the grand tradition iron ore in at one end , giant smelters in the middle and finished products at the other side but there is at least one big difference too many old mills in the united states are still in business , and going bankrupt at an alarming rate the one here went out of business in 1997 and is a monument taking its place , right next door , is a fiveyearold minimill that melts scrap steel and produces almost as much as the old one at a fraction of the cost the work force here has shrunk from 5 , 000 in the 1970 s to 1 , 000 from melting and casting to rolling out new girders , the process is controlled by a skeleton crew of technicians the changes here help explain why european political leaders are so angry about president bush s decision to protect american steel makers by imposing high tariffs on imports from the european vantage point , steel companies here have put themselves through a grueling transformation while , for the most part , the big integrated american steel mills have not if you look at our competitors , the united states has always been the leader in consolidation , said guy doll , managing director of arcelor , the luxembourgbased company that owns the mills here but in steel , nothing has been done the steel dispute threatens to become the most serious trade feud in decades between the united states and europe the european commission plans to impose its own safeguard tariffs in early april , to prevent steel imports from surging beyond last year s level the european commission is also considering retaliatory tariffs against american products european officials may also step up demands for compensation in a separate trade dispute over american tax breaks , which have already been ruled illegal by the world trade organization europe is hardly a region of low wages and low costs but in an industry where size really counts , european steel companies have put themselves through so many mergers that the industry here is dominated by a handful of giants that are much bigger than any american rival thus , improbable as it may sound , the tiny duchy of luxembourg \( population 420 , 000 \) is home to the world s biggest steel producer arcelor , which came into being less than two months ago , is a result of a threeway merger among arbed , luxembourg s biggest steel producer usinor , france s biggest and aceralia , one of spain s biggest each of those companies , in turn , was created by numerous smaller mergers over the last 15 years the result is a behemoth that produces 45 million tons of steel a year , about three times the output of us steel arcelor is not alone thyssenkrupp is a result of a merger of germany s two largest steel companies corus , the britishdutch steel producer , was formed in the 1999 merger of british steel and royal hoogovens of the netherlands the results of all this have been dramatic in 1980 , europe s five largest steel companies accounted for 30 percent of steel production in the european union today , the top five account for more than 60 percent by contrast , the top five american companies account for about a third of the american market , and they are all much smaller than their biggest rivals in either europe or asia europe s steel employment , meanwhile , has shrunk radically , from nearly 800 , 000 workers in 1980 to fewer than 280 , 000 today there has been a massive restructuring in the past 25 years , said hanskarl starke , an analyst at the rhinewestphalia institute for economic research in germany that has not happened in the united states a cleanup of the industry there is long overdue to be sure , american steel companies have gone through wrenching changes of their own us steel today is far smaller than it was in 1980 , and far more focused on more profitable specialty products european steel executives also note that american minimill producers are extremely competitive the problems , they contend , are with the big integrated producers that begin with iron ore , smelt it to make steel and then produce finished products european executives also tend to agree with american steel executives on an important point the biggest hindrance to consolidation in the united states is the huge burden of paying pension and health benefits for retirees american steel companies lobbied unsuccessfully last year for the federal government to assume those liabilities , which would have allowed them to merge more freely because , with their costs lower , they would have been more desirable takeover candidates the european companies do not have that problem in most countries , pension and health care benefits are government responsibilities on top of that , the european commission carried out a sweeping plan in the 1970 s and 1980 s to help finance early retirement for companies that reduced their capacity we had government assistance on retirement and health benefits , i admit that , mr doll said american manufacturers have also been burdened by the high value of the dollar , which gained about 25 percent against the euro since early 1999 and remains near record levels that makes american steel more expensive and imports cheaper but if exchange rates and retiree benefits are outside the control of steel makers , their operational strategies are not european steel makers have adopted a noticeably different strategy , embracing the minimill concept far more aggressively than their american counterparts luxembourg became a steelproducing country nearly a century ago because it had ample supplies of iron ore today , no one even mines iron ore because all the luxembourg mills are minimills that melt down scrap though many of arcelor s mills are integrated producers , all three of its component companies have minimills for at least part of their output the physical changes here are startling the old mill still exists , though the giant blast furnaces have been dismantled and sold to companies in china the new minimill produces a similar range of products as before steel beams used in construction and steel piling often used in docks and harbors almost everything is automated there are few workers visible the giant chamber where the furnace is is normally empty of human beings the continuouscasting area , where six golden streams of molten steel flow into the molds , is monitored by one or two workers a handful of others work in a control room and monitor the process on computer screens perhaps more startling is the extent of crossborder mergers even before the threeway merger , arbed of luxembourg owned mills in germany and brazil several years ago , it bought 35 percent of spain s former stateowned steel company , aceralia though industries like banks , airlines and automobiles remain dominated by national champions in many european countries , the crossborder steel mergers have generated little anxiety none of that is to say that the european steel producers are flourishing over the last decade , europe has swung from being a net exporter to a net importer of steel central european countries have become tough new competitors , so much so that a consortium of western european companies has offered to buy four of poland s biggest steel mills despite those problems , industry analysts are upbeat steel prices have been heading back up from their lows , as the global economy shows sign of recovery photos much of the control room at the arbed plant in luxembourg is automated , above at left , a coil of steel from the netherlands is unloaded in camden , nj , for shipment to ford in ohio \( beno t pesle anzenberger

i read in yesterday s times that egypt s president , hosni mubarak , says he warned the us of a plot by al qaeda before 9 11 and that he has a new plan for a palestinian state i suppose that s all to the good , but frankly , none of it leaves me feeling reassured , for one simple reason we do n't need egypt to be our policeman , we need it to be our progressive what i mean is that we need egypt to play the role that it played in arab politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries the role that history assigned it and for which it has no replacement to lead the arabmuslim world into modernity with an ideological message that is rooted in arab and muslim tradition but is progressive , pluralistic and democratic that is the most important thing egypt can do for us , and that is precisely what it has not been doing for decades now let me be blunt egypt is the center of gravity of the arab world it has the biggest middle class , the besteducated population and the people with the most potential egypt should be the taiwan of the mediterranean but it is a country that has been stagnating , to a degree that smaller arab countries are now passing it by jordan was the first arab country to secure a freetrade agreement with america bahrain is the arab country doing the most innovative experiments with democracy qatar was the pioneer of free satellite television , with aljazeera and tunisia , despite its authoritarian regime , has led the way in economic liberalization and in forging closer ties with the eu all these innovations should have come from egypt , and had they , they would have had a modernizing effect on the entire arab world , particularly its other big stagnating countries iraq , syria and saudi arabia but they are not happening egypt , which in the last century produced such towering arab intellectuals as naguib mahfouz , taha hussein and tawfik alhakim , has produced no successors to them the intellectual air has gone stale in egypt from too many years of controlled press and authoritarian politics president mubarak says , we have all kinds of democracy really \? all kinds but genuine democracy , because a genuine democracy would n't be putting on trial an egyptian democracy expert , saad eddin ibrahim , for wanting the right to speak freely , press for social change and question official policy in the mid1990 s mr mubarak seemed to realize that egypt needed to reform and privatize its economy , to keep pace with a population that will double in 20 years but after a little reform produced a little boomlet , he backed off doing the really hard stuff since 2000 , egypt s economic growth has been anemic it has seemed unable to attract much foreign or domestic investment costa rica , with 4 million people , exports more than egypt , with 68 million and thailand , with the same population as egypt , exports 10 times as much yes , egypt has been threatened by al qaeda too but egypt s way of cracking down has been to either arrest or expel radical islamic leaders and then leave an ideological vacuum in their wake the reason a psychopath like osama bin laden with his arab , islamic but backwardlooking message could gain such currency is because no one in the arab world , particularly egypt , has articulated an arab , islamic , progressive , democratic alternative to counter him the bush team wants to spend money on tv or advertisements to broadcast our message in arabic to the arab world frankly , there is no modern , progressive message we could broadcast in arabic that would begin to compare in influence to one that would come from egypt but it s not coming look , hosni mubarak is not our enemy he is authentically proamerican and a bulwark against another arabisraeli war but if he really wants to help us , and we really want his help , we do n't need to talk to him about al qaeda or israel we need to talk to him about egypt if we 've learned one thing since 9 11 , it s that terrorism is not produced by the poverty of money it s produced by the poverty of dignity it is about young middleclass arabs and muslims feeling trapped in countries with too few good jobs and too few opportunities to realize their potential or shape their own future and blaming america for it we have to break that cycle , and no one could help us do it more effectively than the egyptians does president bush dare say that , or are we going to keep lying to ourselves and to them \?

tru confessions is not a war film , but you have to admire the camouflage techniques on display the movie , which has its premiere tonight on the disney channel , tells the story of an astoundingly irritating teenage girl named trudy , and it tells it in a vaguely irritating fashion but hidden among the dross are beautifully accurate glimpses of life in a family with a disabled child , made possible by a remarkable performance from a young actor named shia labeouf in the role of trudy s disabled twin brother , eddie trudy \( clara bryant \) is a high school freshman who is convinced that she is destined to be a television star \( are n't they all \? \) , and most of the film concerns her efforts to win a filmmaking contest sponsored by a local television station adolescents are supposed to be selfabsorbed that s their job but this one makes all others look like amateurs you spend most of the film wishing for a cameo from bernie mac , the sitcom headofhousehold who rants about wanting to smack his nieces and nephew till their heads split open you may also hope mr mac saves some of his displeasure for trudy s mother \( mare winningham \) , perhaps the most spineless mom on the planet this , of course , is deliberate paul hoen , the director , seems to be consciously trying to make the movie look and sound like one of the generic family comedies that populate the disney channel and other networks intended for the young why \? because this is a film whose main plot is different from its main point , which is to shed light on the hardships faced by a family with a developmentally disabled child eddie suffered oxygen deprivation at birth his mental development has peaked at the level of an 11yearold every now and then , tru confessions , based on a novel for children by janet tashjian , stops being about trudy just long enough to give a taste of what eddie s disability means for him and those around him the doses are necessarily small too much would send the target audience running for the remote control but often very powerful for instance , a brief exchange between eddie s mother and his type a father \( william francis mcguire \) perfectly captures the parents' struggle to find a balance between pushing a disabled child to achieve and accepting his limitations mom you scare him you intimidate him dad well , at least i do n't baby him mom i give him help when he needs help dad look , unless we start raising the bar , how can we expect him to jump any higher \? mom , with an aching resignation in her voice this may be it , bob dad , in denial no i will not accept that none of this would work if not for the performance by mr labeouf , a 15yearold actor who does a more convincing job of portraying someone with a developmental disability than various bigname adults have managed he captures not just the tics and facial expressions but also the emotions behind them a short , beautifully understated scene in which eddie becomes frustrated at his inability to get a kite in the air deserves some kind of prize in 30 seconds , mr labeouf expertly conveys the question that haunts parents of such a child how aware is he of his own condition \? an argument could be made that eddie should have been played by a disabled actor , but the choice of mr labeouf was no doubt just another bit of calculation he is already known to disney audiences for his role on the series even stevens is that bit of casting , as well as the general use of sugarcoating in the film , as manipulative as can be \? you bet is that a bad thing \? not at all it is , rather , a commendable step toward better understanding of the disabled tru confessions disney channel , tonight at 8 , eastern and pacific times 7 , central time jana sue memel , executive producer paul hoen , director written by stu krieger , based on a novel by janet tashjian a production of chanticleer films and trcf production ltd , in association with the disney channel with shia labeouf \( eddie walker \) , clara bryant \( trudy tru walker \) , mare winningham \( ginny walker \) , william francis mcguire \( bob walker \) , nicole dicker \( denise \) , kevin duhaney \( jake \) and yani gellman \( billy \) photo shia labeouf and clara bryant as siblings in tru confessions \( disney \)
tenet healthcare , reeling from concerns about special medicare reimbursements paid to its hospitals and a raid by federal agents of one of its facilities in california , outlined steps yesterday that it said it was taking to try to reassure investors in a conference call that lasted more than two hours yesterday afternoon , tenet s management promised to review dozens of cases by two doctors who are being investigated on accusations that they performed unnecessary surgeries they also vowed to make more information available about the medicare reimbursements in question i need to demonstrate to all of you that you can trust this company and that you can trust me , said jeffrey c barbakow , tenet s chairman and chief executive , who recalled the years the company spent rebuilding its credibility after a troubled history shares of tenet have plummeted the last week as the company has struggled to answer investor questions about why so many of its cases qualify for special treatment under medicare and news circulated about the raid of the redding medical center in california the federal authorities think two redding doctors performed numerous unnecessary procedures , including artery bypass surgery and heart valve replacement surgery tenet s shares , which traded as high as 5250 in early october , closed at 2650 yesterday the stock , which was hurt earlier in the week when reimbursement questions arose , has fallen significantly the last two days i think they are trying very , very hard to answer as many questions as possible , said sheryl skolnick , a managing director of fulcrum global partners , a research firm , who recommended selling shares of the stock because of news of the raid an affidavit filed by the fbi paints a disturbing portrait of two enormously popular physicians who played a critical role in the hospital s success despite repeated warnings over the years , hospital officials chose to ignore concerns raised by other doctors and a patient , according to the people interviewed by the federal authorities federal authorities say there is reason to believe that dr chae hyun moon , redding s director of cardiology , and dr fidel realyvasquez jr , redding s chairman of cardiac surgery , performed unnecessary surgery on patients since 1995 as many as a quarter to a half of the procedures may have been unnecessary , the affidavit contends tenet said it had no reason to believe the accusations against the doctors and hospital officials were true and emphasized that none of its other hospitals are involved in similar investigations tenet is also not currently the target of the federal investigation the company said it was cooperating with federal authorities and conducting its own investigation into the actions of its doctors and hospital executives the doctors , who have not been charged with any crimes , referred questions to their lawyers dr moon s lawyer had no comment , and dr realyvasquez s lawyer said on thursday that he thought his client would be able to convince federal authorities that he did only what was best for patients the doctors will continue to have admitting privileges , according to tenet , which described them yesterday as experienced physicians who are highly credentialed and highly respected within the community but company executives emphasized that the two doctors will be subject to review by independent cardiologists brought in to review the cases now under investigation the company said it might expand that review if warranted the independent cardiologists will also determine whether any procedures the two doctors continue to perform are necessary if any cases performed are deemed to have been unnecessary , the company will refund the money paid to it by medicare , officials said the company also has significant malpractice coverage in case of related claims , although it said it was aware of just five malpractice suits filed against the doctors while none of the accusations at redding have been proved , analysts raised concerns about the importance of cardiology to companies like tenet and whether the company or hospital officials encouraged the doctors to perform too many procedures in recent years , cardiology has become one of the most lucrative fields for hospitals , and redding is one of tenet s most successful hospitals dr moon and dr realyvasquez are among the state s top producers , according to the fbi affidavit , and redding expects to perform more than 1 , 000 openheart surgeries this year very few places nowadays are doing that kind of volume , said dr larry kaiser , the chairman of surgery at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine and health system in philadelphia , who said he was surprised at the kind of volume a small hospital like redding , in northern california away from a major urban center , would be able to generate redding began positioning itself as a leading heart center in 1987 , according to a cardiologist quoted in the affidavit , and spent millions of dollars on advertising dr moon spoke of being in a club of cardiologists that performed 10 , 000 heart catheterizations , according to this cardiologist another doctor quoted in the affidavit does not believe that the administrators were unaware of this situation but rather chose to look the other way because the two doctors produced tremendous revenue for the hospital while one of the cardiologists interviewed by the federal authorities said that the doctors were given bonuses based on how much revenue they generated for the hospital , tenet officials strongly denied the accusation in response to concerns that hospital officials knew about the accusations , tenet emphasized that the doctors were responsible for making medical decisions the company , which said it only learned of these concerns when it was informed of the fbi raid , said it was investigating the hospital s handling of the accusations but it is unclear exactly where the hospital or tenet s responsibilities lie a lot of hospitals do not police at that level , said dr mark hlatky , a cardiologist who teaches health policy at stanford , noting that most hospitals only pay attention to signs of quality problems like a rise in deaths or related illnesses responding to the questions of investors , tenet s management also promised to make events , like the raid , public much more quickly analysts had criticized the company for waiting a day to discuss the news clearly , we should have acted more quickly , and , for that , you have my sincere apology , mr barbakow said he promised investors that the company would also provide more detailed information about its medicare reimbursements , a subject that the company insisted was not tied to the raid by federal agents we are deeply concerned about these allegations , he said
atlanta , june 6 mike piazza was not subjected to the misery the mets let unfold late in their game today against the atlanta braves , ending a winless trip here piazza was getting two bags of intravenous fluid , replenishing what an afternoon of heat and humidity had sapped from him , forcing him out of the game the elements were n't all that plagued piazza he had trouble seeing , but he seemed more bewildered by the season unraveling around him it s just very empty , piazza said , grasping for words to describe the feeling after the mets lost the lead and the game , 32 , at turner field you 'd just like to believe at some point we 're going to come out of it there s a lot of baseball left as we proved , as easily as you can lose ground you can make it up the mets hit another milestone on their downward spiral , losing their fifth straight game to drop below 500 \( 2930 \) for the first time since they were 34 on april 9 the mets' record is a sobering reminder of last season , when they fell 10 games under 500 early and hovered there until their emotionally charged run in september that was not enough to catch the weakened braves , and atlanta looks more vulnerable this season the mets' slide has helped the braves regroup the victory gave atlanta a sweep of what became a threegame series the mets may be fortunate that the game tuesday was rained out atlanta has won 15 of its last 20 games , built a fourandahalfgame lead on the mets and shoved them into a thirdplace tie with the expos in the national league east the teams will meet again june 2427 at shea stadium after two weeks of interleague play we ca n't really worry about them until next time we play them , piazza said we have a lot of big games coming up we have to do everything in our power to try to just get on track , just keep trying to find some way to get back to playing winning baseball it s different if we 're getting blown out every game we 're not getting that break and we 're not able to get that out when we need it in new york , coowner fred wilpon , who monitored the mets by television and radio this week , said he was frustrated but not disgusted by his team s play i see the light at the end of tunnel and this is going to happen , he said in a telephone interview i see signs of it wilpon pointed to the mets' pitching , his expectation that the struggling al leiter would return to dominance , the recent resurgence of roberto alomar and edgardo alfonzo and piazza s bat in waiting he also endorsed manager bobby valentine , saying , there s no one better than bobby to push the right buttons valentine was testy before the game and did not offer reasons for benching mo vaughn and jeromy burnitz today none were needed both are mired in deep slumps facing the lefthander tom glavine provided the opportune time to rest them , but valentine would not commit to either vaughn or burnitz s rejoining the lineup friday against the indians in cleveland piazza said he hoped he could at least serve as the designated hitter in cleveland he said the mets' lack of victories and scoring led him to take batting practice this morning despite the muggy conditions by the early innings , piazza said , he was seeing spots , feeling nauseated and was cramping vance wilson replaced him in the sixth inning i do n't think i'm going to do anybody any good if i'm not seeing , piazza said after doubling home a run in the first , piazza made a throwing error in the bottom of the inning , allowing rafael furcal , who had stolen second base , to go to third furcal scored on a groundout to tie the score , 11 alomar s twoout single in the second gave the mets a 21 lead , and the mets played stellar defense right fielder joe mcewing robbed keith lockhart of a home run and shortstop rey ord ez made several plays jeff d'amico held that slim lead until he left a fastball over the plate that andruw jones clubbed into the 15th row of the leftfield stands in the sixth inning to tie the score d'amico allowed six hits , a walk and two runs in six innings david weathers relieved in the seventh , and lockhart led off with a grounder over first base that scooted into the corner and past mcewing for a triple weathers had an 02 count against pinchhitter matt franco , but threw a sinker that bounced in the dirt and to the backstop , easily scoring lockhart with the goahead run more frustration followed when jay payton flew out to the rightfield wall to end the top of the eighth , he grabbed his helmet with both hands and slammed it into the ground vaughn walked against john smoltz with two outs in the ninth , but alomar struck out on a checked swing alomar did not think he swung , nor did he think the previous pitch had been a strike it was smoltz s third save in the three games we ai n't dead , vaughn said we ai n't going to die we ai n't going to go away , i can guarantee you that inside pitch bob watson , baseball s vice president for discipline , said he planned to speak with manager bobby valentine on friday about his incident with umpire ed rapuano last saturday when valentine and mike piazza were ejected watson said he would not rule out suspensions for valentine and piazza rapuano has said he accidentally bumped valentine during the argument an announcement on any discipline could come friday photo joe mcewing , left , and rey ord ez

some fuzzy math in the first 30 days of december 2000 , according to nexis , only six articles in major news sources contained both the word deflation and the phrase united states none of those articles suggested that deflation in this country was a real possibility in the same period last year there were 292 hits this past month there were 566 will deflation be even more on our minds a year from now \? about five years ago economists realized that monsters from the 1930 s were once again walking the earth japan , the world s secondlargest economy , was trapped in a cycle of falling prices and rising unemployment but not many people in the us cared about the woes of a faraway country like bigtime corporate malfeasance , deflation did n't seem like something america had to worry about but like corporate malfeasance , deflation has turned out to be something that can happen here it s by no means a foregone conclusion federal reserve officials assure us that they can and will steer us away from a japanesestyle black hole but we 're close enough to such a black hole that it s already warping our economic space here s how it can happen first , for whatever reason , the economy becomes depressed the central bank responds by cutting interest rates but it turns out that even cutting rates all the way to zero is n't enough to restore more or less full employment at that point the economy crosses the black hole s event horizon the point of no return , beyond which deflation feeds on itself prices fall in the face of excess capacity businesses and individuals become reluctant to borrow , because falling prices raise the real burden of repayment with spending sluggish , the economy becomes increasingly depressed , and prices fall all the faster we know from japan s experience that the descent into such a black hole is a gradual process although most economists now date the beginning of japan s malaise to 1991 , the japanese economy actually grew , albeit slowly , until 1998 and it was n't until 1998 that japanese officials appreciated the severity of the problem so we should n't take too much comfort from our own sortof recovery in 2002 yes , the us economy grew , but too slowly to employ an expanding and increasingly productive labor force the output gap , the difference between what the economy could produce and what it actually produces , continued to widen and so the threat of deflation is worse now than it was a year ago in fact , by some measures deflation is already here prices paid by consumers are still rising , but those received by many businesses are n't the government s index of the prices received by nonfinancial corporations has been falling since the third quarter of 2001 as a result , we 've moved closer to the event horizon the fed funds rate is only 125 percent , yet nothing suggests that the economy is about to close the output gap the back of my envelope says that gdp would have to grow at least 45 percent over the next year to bring an end to deflationary pressure that s well outside the range of consensus forecasts and the pull of the black hole is increasing consider a fed funds rate of 3 percent was low enough to get the economy moving in the early 1990 s , so why is n't a rate of 125 percent low enough now \? in part because back then business prices were rising , while now they are falling , discouraging borrowing even at very low rates what if a year from now the fed funds rate is zero , but prices are falling even faster \? ok , let s take a deep breath nothing i 've said is news to fed officials a group that now includes my princeton colleague ben bernanke also , the black hole metaphor can be pushed too far as mr bernanke points out , the fed has other weapons in its arsenal besides low interest rates the policies he describes have n't been tested , but in theory they should work those policies would be more likely to succeed , of course , if the bush administration would stop playing politics with fiscal policy and oh , never mind anyway , the fed will do its best but two years ago deflation in america seemed a prospect literally not worth writing about will it be all over the newspapers a year from now \?
rockville , md , oct 17 stymied leaders of the manhunt for the suburban sniper had to discredit a crucial witness today as detectives revisited the scene of the latest killing in search of fresh evidence investigation leaders said at a news conference here that a lightcolored getaway van , while still being credibly sought in an earlier shooting , was not spotted on monday night at the ninth and latest killing , in falls church , va , as the police had originally reported it has not set back the investigation , said chief charles a moose of the montgomery county police , the head of the regional manhunt chief moose emphasized that detectives still had useful leads from other witnesses that he would not publicly discuss the police said on further investigation the discredited witness was found to be not credible with crucial information detectives had initially rated the information as very valuable but the source proved to be fabricating a tale , the police said , without offering details in a question session tinged with fresh frustration , officials complained about widespread news media photographs and television demonstrations of an ak74 rifle , the russian infantry weapon the police had said one witness reported seeing an ak74 on monday at that time , the police emphasized that the report was unconfirmed , because rifle identification by sight can be difficult that information , as well , is not reliable , chief j thomas manger of the fairfax county police said about the rifle as officials involved in the manhunt said it was one of more than 30 possible rifles that the sniper could be using others familiar with the scene in falls church , which was again intently searched for evidence , said the closest witness was perhaps 90 yards away when a 47yearold shopper was shot once in the head as she loaded packages into her car in an opensided garage investigators returned to the crime scene at the seven corners shopping center and , for the first time , went through an area directly north of the mall , across a busy commuter road , route 50 , that the sniper was initially reported to have used in escaping the new area included a schoolyard that has a clear view of the garage across the road it was the sort of open perch that investigators say the sniper chose in shooting earlier victims from distances of 100 yards or more the schoolyard , 150 yards from the crime scene , affords immediate access to a residential side road that leads to a number of major highways , another similarity to earlier attacks detectives and police cadets on their hands and knees searched for what would be threedayold clues earlier reports valued by investigators had described the sniper s killing the woman from inside the garage witnesses who are still considered credible offered sketchy details , mainly that the suspect appeared to be a man who wore what seemed to be a blue shirt and blue pants , according to a police official from that and other gleanings from witnesses , police artists have produced differing sketches , the official said , none clear enough to be made public with no firm sign of progress offered to the public and with the depressing disclosure that someone misled the police with false clues , the edginess of the washington metropolitan region grew the sniper has killed nine people and wounded two others since oct 2 the attacker has proven elusive , firing single shots at the victims and making quick escapes despite the hundreds of police officers who are hunting him in five counties and washington using aircraft , patrol car and foot in the face of two failed and highly public dragnets , leaders of the manhunt are planning for a larger highway force to be ready for a tighter effort at containment should the sniper be spotted again , said officials familiar with the investigation chief moose would not say what was settled at a meeting of regional law enforcement leaders on wednesday except that was an extremely productive session that involved none of the infighting critics might expect from the unusual multijurisdictional force we must have some capacity to give ourselves an advantage to be in front , as opposed to be constantly reacting , he said of the extensive search by local , state and federal agencies in the deepening sense of frustration and mystery , officials were once more asked about the possibility of a political terrorist as the sniper they were asked whether captured al qaeda fighters were being questioned chief moose declined to speculate he and other leaders of the manhunt have repeatedly played down that hypothesis , noting that there has been no message of the type that terrorists usually leave the sniper s lone reported message was a tarot death card with the note , dear policeman , i am god chief moose once more warned reporters to limit disclosures of what they find out independently , particularly from people presenting themselves as witnesses at crime scenes we get this noise and confusion out there that somehow causes people to have tunnel vision , the chief said , worried that potential credible witnesses will be discouraged there was no word on the identity of or possible charges against the discredited witness , as the police stayed focused on the manhunt the problem of wannabe witnesses who impulsively weave tales from earlier scraps of a running crime story is not new in highprofile investigations , the police noted we are continuing to work with other witnesses at the scene who are providing us with leads , chief manger said no weapon can be singled out as the sniper s , because there are so many highpowered assault and hunting rifles capable of firing the 223caliber ammunition found as evidence in the shootings , noted michael bouchard , the ranking agent in the manhunt from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms detectives' main concern in the wide broadcast of dramatic overly specific images like the ak74 is that it will give potential witnesses tunnel vision and cause them to decide against calling the police about a gunowning neighbor or acquaintance who might be a promising suspect folks , we need to spend our time following up on the credible things , mr bouchard emphasized in dismissing speculation about a copycat killer photos chiefs charles a moose of montgomery county police , left , and j thomas manger of fairfax county police yesterday at a news session the fairfax county , va , police returned to falls church yesterday to continue searching the scene of the shooting on monday

islamabad , pakistan , march 7 pakistani officials say the government is pursuing large numbers of taliban and al qaeda fighters who have crossed into the country from afghanistan in recent months and are now believed to be hiding in tribal villages or large cities at the same time , though pakistani troops encountered more fighters trying to slip into pakistan this week , the officials said that the border was mostly secure and that they did not believe that the forces now battling american troops in eastern afghanistan had reentered afghanistan from pakistan they said they believed that those forces were among the taliban and al qaeda fighters who had adopted a low profile after the fall of kabul but never left afghanistan , and had kept their military supplies there they did n't need to be supplied from the pakistani side of the border , which is effectively sealed , a senior pakistani military officer said the officials said they estimated that as many as 1 , 800 al qaeda members and more than 3 , 500 taliban fighters might have slipped into pakistan since november only about 600 have been detained by pakistani authorities , one senior pakistani intelligence officer said of those detained , about 280 have been handed over to the united states , but none are major leaders of either al qaeda or the taliban pakistani officials said the flow of taliban and al qaeda fighters into the country was at its peak in december and early january and had since declined considerably even so , on wednesday , pakistani army officials said , troops clashed with a small group of gunmen who were trying to carry missiles and rockets into pakistan from paktia province in eastern afghanistan , where american troops have been involved in heavy fighting one pakistani soldier was wounded in the fighting , the army officials said they said it took place near the kharlachi fort in the tribal kurram agency of the northwestern frontier province in pakistan , directly east of paktia province in afghanistan about 16 , 000 regular and paramilitary pakistani troops have been patrolling the afghan border since december , in an effort to cut off any exodus of al qaeda and taliban forces from afghanistan they have been assisted by american intelligence information from satellites and predator drone aircraft , pakistani officials said today still , pakistani officials acknowledge that they are having to contend with the potential threat posed by the more than 5 , 000 taliban and al qaeda fighters who may have crossed the border from afghanistan after the collapse of the taliban government late last year an outbreak of violence in the last week , linked to islamic militants , might have been carried out in part by fighters who had fled afghanistan , the officials said they said military and other forces were aggressively pursuing the fighters , both in the remote tribal areas on the border and in major cities like karachi and lahore al qaeda no longer has a stationary base , but it has not been eliminated , one senior pakistani official said it is now more like a series of offshore operations , with no base but interlinked communications american officials have intercepted internet traffic among al qaeda followers that they believe originated in pakistan senior pakistani officials said they were seeking assistance from american experts to help monitor the communications and pinpoint their source in interviews , the senior pakistani officials said they recognized that supporters of al qaeda in pakistan might now form the core of the communications network being used by the terror organization but the officials took issue with the idea that pakistan was the principal base of protaliban internet messages , noting that a large portion of them were being written in arabic rather than in urdu , pakistan s main national language the pakistani officials , from intelligence and law enforcement agencies , also said they had stepped up their surveillance of internet cafes in the hopes of interrupting their use by islamic militants , including suspected members of al qaeda at the same time , the pakistani officials said they were facing major difficulties in efforts to monitor the militants' activities the only arrests made so far in connection with email messages have been those of three suspects in the kidnapping and slaying of daniel pearl , a wall street journal correspondent in pakistan internet access in pakistan is now available in more than 500 cities and towns , including remote outposts along the afghan border the country is home to hundreds of virtually unregulated internet cafes , where people are able to log on to the internet without identification and for only a small fee the pakistani officials said they believed that a core group of computer experts from pakistan was at the heart of what american officials have said is a new internetbased communication system used by al qaeda they said the group was believed to have developed a system of using webbased email , using addresses that change constantly and are difficult to trace some recent internet postings that american and pakistani authorities believe have originated in pakistan contain scathing messages about american military operations in afghanistan they also contained renewed calls for a holy war against american forces and their backers one posting available in english and in urdu , www newjihad com , described huge numbers of crying american soldiers being ferried to medical facilities in afghanistan after they were wounded in battle other sites that are believed to be linked to pakistan , including www azzam com , have provided specific instructions to readers about how to maintain anonymity even while accessing the site , which has been shut down several times since the american military operations in afghanistan began in october postings on the site have blamed american intelligence and law enforcement agencies for the shutdown a third site , www alemarh com , which is available only in arabic , purports to be the official site of the islamic emirate of afghanistan , the name used by the taliban leaders since late october , nothing had been posted on the site until earlier this week , when a new message trumpeted the death of the american soldiers engaged in the fighting near gardez , afghanistan the site contains links in arabic to articles and contains pictures of guns and rocket launchers and banners that describe american military operations in afghanistan as part of an antimuslim crusade a counter on the web site reports 400 , 000 visits since the most recent posting , earlier this week
champlain , ny after a robbery at a local branch of the key bank near the canadian border in late january , united states border agents alerted their counterparts in canada in the kind of cooperation on border security that has increased since sept 11 , agents in both countries hunted the culprit , and they soon made an arrest the suspect , robert moisescu , was caught trying to cross into canada the police say he had 30 , 000 and the gun used in the robbery but that victory for border security was quickly undercut agents discovered that mr moisescu , a canadian with a criminal record , had entered the united states undetected sealing the 4 , 000mile canadian border from every terrorist , bank robber or other undesirable is regarded by experts as impossible but fears that terrorists may use canada as a way station before attacking the united states is prompting the two countries to share information and law enforcement resources in hopes of narrowing a wideopen portal the federal bureau of investigation is giving the royal canadian mounted police direct access to its fingerprint database the first time a foreign agency has had a direct link to the information both countries will send customs inspectors to each other s busiest seaports the countries are sharing visa information the border patrol has increased the number of joint enforcement and surveillance teams with its canadian counterparts and has stationed a liaison officer at the mounted police headquarters in ottawa unlike the concern on the southern border , where the united states has deployed agents and equipment to cope with mass illegal immigration , the worry on the northern border is that a few terrorists will sneak from canada into the united states you are not particularly worried about canadian terrorists , and we are not particularly worried about american terrorists , said george haynal , the former canadian deputy minister for the americas who was a representative in the uscanada partnership the border is a checkpoint in a world of global flows robert l harris , associate chief of the border patrol , said his agents were working with canadian officers to identify likely smuggling routes border patrol officials said americancanadian enforcement teams had made about a halfdozen smuggling arrests in the last few months under the new arrangement , the two sides operate independently but coordinate patrols and intelligence you cannot underestimate the value of intelligencesharing , mr harris said trying to stop everyone who goes between the countries is unrealistic , experts say , and with 420 billion a year in trade across the border , there is pressure not to make crossing the border an ordeal there never has been or will be an effective way of stopping people from coming across 4 , 000 miles of wilderness , said stephen flynn , an authority on trade and borders for the council on foreign relations on a hot summer day , there are more than six million boats on the great lakes , about four million from the us and two million from canada who can tell whether they are on the right side of the line \? except at official crossing points , the border is usually marked by small obelisks at some intersections , rusty signs tell drivers to report to the nearest customs office champlain , where mr moisescu was arrested , is one of many towns that touch the border walter harwell , the chief border agent in that area of upstate new york , recently stood on meridian avenue , a back road , and pointed to the spot where two agents tackled mr moisescu a few hundred yards away , a white metal barrier marks the border the border patrol has sensors along the border , but it is possible to cover only a small fraction of the space beside the road asked how mr moisescu might have entered the united states , mr harwell gestured toward trees near the unmanned checkpoint and said , he could have walked through the woods richard e cantwell , the clinton county district attorney , said the moisescu case illustrated the concern this was just a lowly bank robber , mr cantwell said it is not much of a stretch to imagine what someone else could do given the same circumstances although none of the sept 11 hijackers entered the united states from canada , the attacks raised questions about the border in washington and ottawa the budget proposed by president bush calls for more than 10 billion for border security next year , including tripling the number of agents assigned to the northern border canada , besides passing its first antiterrorism law , has promised 5 billion for border security over the next five years after the millennium bombing case , in which an algerian was stopped at the border in washington state with a trunkload of explosives , canada and the united states began strengthening their joint security plans since the attacks in september , canada has increased its ability to deport people suspected of membership in terrorist groups canadian experts also noted that while canada s relatively liberal refugee policies which allowed aliens to remain there for long periods after applying for asylum might have opened the door for dangerous immigrants , the larger number of people in the united states who overstayed visas created similar vulnerabilities we have 24 , 000 people who were supposed to be deported you have 300 , 000 , mr haynal said the two countries have agreed to review visa policies jointly and to share information about people on watch lists , to prevent terrorists from obtaining visas the critical issue for both countries is access to the continent and how the countries are dealing with controlling access , said michael d cronin , executive associate commissioner for programs at the immigration and naturalization service the concern in terms of security and it goes beyond the physical border is to look at the policies and practices of both countries and ensure that we are both satisfied photo tom ridge , left , director of domestic security , with deputy prime minister john manley of canada , right \( agence francepresse \)
colorado springs , nov 2 now comes the hard part it took only six years and 13 million for new york city to capture the united states olympic committee s nomination to serve as the host city for the 2012 summer games now the bloomberg administration , gov george e pataki and the city s bid committee , nyc2012 , must overcome daunting political and financial obstacles not only to make good on promises to build 904 million in olympic fields , courts and arenas but also to create an estimated 5 billion in new subways , housing and a stadium over the rail yards on the west side of manhattan all of that need not be in place by 2005 , when the international olympic committee will make the final decision on the location of the 2012 games but many of these projects will take years to complete , and new york must convince the international olympic committee , which chooses the site from a number of international candidates , that all the city s promises can be hammered into reality you 've got to show some progress , said richard t anderson , president of the new york building congress , a trade group supporting the city s bid one of the big issues is to demonstrate that new york can indeed pull off the big , unfinished pieces , which are the olympic village , the stadium and subway service although new york s bid mentions all three the olympic village complex of 4 , 400 apartments in queens a 15 billion extension of the no 7 subway line from times square to the far west side and a 15 billion olympic stadium over the west side rail yards none of them are included in the capital plan submitted as part of the official bid rather , daniel l doctoroff , who has been pursuing the olympics for new york off and on since 1994 and is now the city s deputy mayor for economic development , has said that those projects will be built by the city , the state and private developers whether or not the games come to new york well , maybe mayor michael r bloomberg and governor pataki have expressed strong public support , as have many top wall street and real estate figures in the city these are projects that we should be doing anyway for the longterm viability of the city , said bill rudin , who heads the rudin family real estate empire and is a major supporter of the new york bid but not everyone agrees that this is the best way to spend scarce public dollars when both the city and the state are facing multibilliondollar budget gaps i see some real strengths to the olympic proposal in developing housing and transportation , given that it s so hard to get those things built in new york city , said jonathan bowles , research director for the center for an urban future but i see some downsides there are questions about how we can pay for this and whether a stadium is a good investment for the city some city residents also resent mr doctoroff s description of their semiindustrial west side neighborhood as a wasteland and challenge his plans to rezone it for an 86 , 000seat stadium and a forest of office towers and highrise apartments it s a workingclass neighborhood and a service neighborhood , said simone sindin , chairwoman of manhattan community board 4 the fact that there are garages , carpentry shops or auto showrooms does not mean that they are expendable opposition to the stadium is not as fervent or widespread as it was when mayor rudolph w giuliani sought to install the yankees in a west side home but opponents could wage the kind of long legal battle that doomed the westway highway and development project in the 1980 s mr doctoroff , the founder of nyc2012 , contends that landing the games would essentially enforce a timetable for completing major projects that would not ordinarily be undertaken in new york s often fractious civic culture while the proposal calls for creating an equestrian center in staten island , an archery range in brooklyn and major alterations to what would be the water polo site in the bronx , much of the olympic transformation would take place on the far west side of manhattan the coming of the olympics would trigger cataclysmic change in an area that s essentially worthless , mr doctoroff has said much of the change would be paid for with taxes from development and rising real estate values on the west side , according to mr doctoroff taxfree bonds would be paid off through real estate taxes and the sale of development rights , a process known as tax increment financing , or tif in governmentspeak but tax increment financing has not been used in new york before and would require state legislation it is also predicated on the creation of 20 million square feet of office development the equivalent of 10 empire state buildings which may be a lofty assumption given the weak state of the market today the strapped metropolitan transportation authority is studying an extension of the no 7 subway line but the money for that and a metronorth and long island rail road

the lehman brothers holdings investment bank may be moving uptown , but the annual pay of its chief executive and other senior officers has headed south lehman , in the midst of moving into an office tower near times square that it bought last year from morgan stanley dean witter for 750 million , cut the cash and stock that it paid to its highestranking executives by more than 40 percent , according to the firm s proxy statement richard fuld jr , the chief executive , received 116 million in cash and stock last year , about half of the 23 million he took home the year before for a year in which lehman s profit fell 25 percent , mr fuld s bonus declined to 4 million from 875 million in 2000 mr fuld is unlikely to have cashflow problems he realized more than 93 million last year from exercising stock options , the proxy said he also received options on 450 , 000 shares , which the firm valued at 45 million the bonuses of the next four officers in the compensation rankings shrank 65 percent , to 28 million each from 805 million each received 350 , 000 options , valued at 35 million the reductions in pay , coming amid a prolonged slump in the american financial markets , were steeper than at some other investment banks , like the goldman sachs group , but less severe than those at merrill lynch merrill said this week that none of its senior officers received a cash bonus of more than 1 million for last year in its annual report , released this week , lehman said it had paid morgan stanley about 750 million for the building on seventh avenue lehman left its headquarters in lower manhattan after the sept 11 terrorist attack on the world trade center
david westin , the president of abc news , told his top executives yesterday morning that his bosses had blindsided him and failed to tell him that abc wanted to remove his most prestigious program , nightline , to make room for david letterman people at the division said he was ashen and spoke of the tremendous blow the move would be for abc news , with ramifications for the entire division the fate of mr letterman s show , which abc is trying to lure from cbs , remained unclear yesterday , partly because mr letterman left for a weeklong vacation still , that abc was even considering taking aim at nightline was seen as an ominous sign inside the news division , the latest of a number of slights and the most striking indication yet that the network s parent , the walt disney company , would not hesitate to cut back on news to improve its balance sheet that the division s top executive said he was kept in the dark until a phone call from a reporter at the new york times thursday night only underscored the message ted koppel , the anchor of nightline , returned to washington , where nightline is produced , from his home in florida but would not talk publicly disney executives were unflinching early yesterday they insisted that they would not let what they considered to be a sentimental attachment to an aging news program get in the way of righting the corporate ship investors have expressed impatience with disney s lagging share price as abc , which it acquired for 19 billion in 1996 , has lost more than 20 percent of its ratings from last year and fallen to third place abc executives think that mr letterman can help lift the network s fortunes , and they have little patience for the news division , which they have at times described as a beehive of sanctimony and overpriced star egos mr letterman , 54 , has made it clear that he will not go to abc if his arrival directly leads to the departure of mr koppel , 62 still , abc executives were making it clear that , regardless of the letterman outcome , they do not necessarily think nightline belongs at 11 35 pm the question swirling around abc news was whether network executives had risked irrevocably straining their relations with mr koppel and the news division for a bid that was a long shot anyway or if they even cared abc news has been faring poorly in the corporate infighting in recent months first , last fall , barbara walters lost , temporarily , her friday night 20 20 time slot to an entertainment show , once and again just last week , the network ignored the news division s complaints about the decision to allow the hollywood producer jerry bruckheimer and bertram van munster , whose credits include the fox network s reality series cops , to develop a patriotic documentary series about united states soldiers abroad for the entertainment division yesterday , people at the network said that abc s corporate office was sending word to the news division that should the bid for mr letterman fail , there was no other candidate in mind who would justify the removal of nightline that was cold comfort news executives were furious at being kept in the dark about the network s plans for late night they were especially angry , they said , about anonymous statements from network officials that nightline had lost ratings , relevance and money news executives said the program had made 131 million in profit last year network officials disputed that figure undoubtedly , letterman , with decent ratings , will make more money than koppel , said one person at the news division , who spoke on condition of anonymity but it does n't speak to the fact that they 've gone out and trashed this program and this guy who has not only done distinguished work but has also made a lot of money for the network last evening , abc released a statement of support for mr koppel from its president , alex wallau , who called nightline a consistent and solid ratings performer throughout its history and mr koppel one of the most respected journalists in america he added , we are hopeful that 'nightline' and ted will continue to make significant contributions to abc in the years ahead mr koppel and his producers , tom bettag and leroy sievers , were in their washington offices yesterday planning their response as of last night , there was none several news executives said it was unclear last night whether abc would be in breach of mr koppel s contract if it were to move nightline out of its 11 35 time slot for mr letterman emotions were raw yesterday in the world of network news , abc s division is known as a particularly fractious place , where various fiefs reign , led by the anchors peter jennings , ms walters , diane sawyer and mr koppel but it has been known to unite when its empire as a whole is threatened the anchor sam donaldson rallied around mr koppel and issued a furious protest some nightline producers shed tears mr donaldson exhorted listeners of his morning radio show to call the network in support of mr koppel if 'nightline' is discontinued it sends a message which i think would be interpreted as one that s very bad for our news department , he said in an interview it is a program that all of us can point to as why we can proudly say that we 're a serious news department serving the public
kabul , afghanistan , oct 8 the secretary of health and human services , tommy g thompson , arrived here today with a pledge that the united states would not abandon afghanistan now that the taliban are gone speaking to reporters at the heavily fortified american embassy , mr thompson said american support meant not only forcing out oppressive regimes but also helping meet the everyday needs of your people mr thompson also signed an agreement with the health ministry to help rebuild the country s medical services and improve delivery of health care , and he announced a volunteer program with the afghanamerican physicians association and the afghan medical association to allow afghanamerican doctors to provide health care and teach medical courses here none of these programs involve initial commitments of money beyond the 1 million that mr thompson s agency spent here in the past year the agency for international development has provided about 30 million for public health services in an indication of the difficulty of delivering assistance , american officials said , mr thompson s plans to provide as much as 500 , 000 worth of donated drugs and medical supplies seem to have fallen apart afghan health officials told the department that many of the items did not meet international standards , were inappropriate for afghanistan or had expiration dates of less than two years , which afghan officials said is not enough time for distribution
portland , ore , oct 4 in the quiet neighborhood here where three people accused of conspiring to wage war on the united states were arrested at dawn today , friends and relatives painted a mixed picture of the suspects , all of them american citizens the three jeffrey leon battle , 32 , his exwife , october martinique lewis , 25 , and patrice lumumba ford , 31 are wellknown in portland s increasingly skittish muslim community mr ford , a lifelong oregonian , served internships under two portland mayors , including vera katz , the incumbent the charges , that the three conspired to aid al qaeda and the taliban , have deepened a rift between portland muslims who say the government is harassing them and others who feel that islamic extremists have taken root here in oregon s biggest city some people scoffed at the accusation today by attorney general john ashcroft that the group is a suspected terrorist cell within our borders instead , they say these suspects are followers of a militant brand of islam , but have never conspired to help al qaeda mr ford went to pakistan , but he went there for humanitarian reasons , said james britt , a lawyer who is mr ford s brother he stood outside the small bungalow where mr ford lived with his wife , son and mother , while the police searched the area mr britt said his brother had a master s degree in chinese studies , is married to a chinese woman , and was a convert to islam who felt it a duty to render aid to other muslims this is religious persecution , mr britt said other muslims here said much the same thing , noting that the case against a portland cleric arrested last month , sheik mohammed abdirrahman kariye , has not held up the government originally said mr kariye was caught trying to leave the country with traces of tnt on his bags but they said other tests were inconclusive mr kariye , a popular religious leader at the islamic center of portland , is being held without bond on charges of social security fraud at the apartment where the two other suspects were arrested today , less than a mile from mr ford s residence , neighbors described the suspects as clannish and occasionally expressing hostility toward america they would n't let their kids play with other kids because they made some remarks about how 9 11 was a good thing , said jesse sechrist , who lives at the same modest apartment complex where mr battle lived with his wife , ms lewis another neighbor said the fbi had the apartment complex under surveillance for some time i saw one guy who was hanging around all the time , and the manager told me it was fbi , and the fbi were planning to move somebody in here , but that i should n't tell anyone that , said linda randall , a resident of the apartment complex the portland rizwan mosque is next door to the apartments , but none of the suspects were members , people who worked there said after the attacks of last year , ms randall said neighbors put flowers on the mosque s porch the authorities said they began to become suspicious of the portland group after a sheriff in rural skamania county , wash , which is just across the columbia river from portland , saw men in turbans shooting rifles at a gravel pit the fbi was alerted , and began a yearlong surveillance federal officials say the portland group traveled to pakistan , in an effort to get into afghanistan to aid the taliban and qaeda soldiers who were fighting americans but mr britt said they never intended to fight on behalf of terrorists , but only to help other muslims all three suspects are africanamerican , and mr britt said the arrests showed a bias by federal officials against blacks who convert to islam federal officials say they were simply doing good police work , which led them from a gravel pit , to pakistan and back to portland mr ford pleaded not guilty at his arraignment today he appeared in court wearing a fedex sweatshirt and sweatpants , and did not speak the other two will be formally arraigned next week photo a portland police officer at the apartment complex where two of the suspects were arrested yesterday \( associated press \)
there is more than two and a half miles of asphalt and a single digit in the addresses separating 565 park avenue from 1565 park avenue the first is an elegant coop apartment building at east 62nd street that sits opposite the colony club , surrounded by canopied neighbors the second is a brickfaced public housing tower that sits in a quiet corner of the james weldon johnson houses at east 112th street , surrounded by a spiky iron fence the former is home to a cross section of the city s wealthiest and most successful residents art dealers , otolaryngologists and corporate bankruptcy lawyers the latter houses a sampling of the city s working and nonworking poor nursing aides , fastfood restaurant employees and those who survive on their welfare checks where one has a liveried doorman , the other has a broken door buzzer in the first , the asking price for apartments starts at 15 million in the second , the poorest tenants pay as little as 137 a month a longtime resident of 565 park summed up her building s charms when you walk in the lobby , it smells like old money the lobby of 1565 park , on the other hand , just smells old a lot of people say , 'hmm , you live on park avenue \? ' said denise combs , a resident of 1565 i say 'not on that park avenue this is the lowincome park avenue' ms combs is 45 and works as a nursing aide she has lived in 1565 for nearly a decade with her 15yearold son and her 13yearold daughter on an annual salary of roughly 30 , 000 , she has also raised her sister s three children , who have all moved out of the house she had no choice her sister was beaten , raped and thrown off the roof of the nearby robert f wagner houses 18 years ago i'm just barely making it , she said but i do manage ms combs enjoys living on her particular stretch of park avenue the tenants in 1565 look out for one another , she said , and the building is fairly clean there are not too many drug dealers lurking about she is situated near convenient bus and subway lines that take her to her job in the bronx i love this building , she said this month as her pit bull , brandy , licked at her ankles it s a unitytype building we 're all good neighbors here three floors up from ms combs lives asuncion anglero ms anglero , 55 , is a professional baby sitter who resides there with her son , mark rodriguez , 19 , and her daughter , vanessa rodriguez , 14 mark is an honors student at the city university of new york who is on his way or so his mother hopes to medical school vanessa attends the isaac newton school on east 116th street , an intermediate school for students interested in math and science we 're a very familyoriented building , ms anglero said if someone s in need , we 're out there for them there have been incidents where someone was robbed and everyone came out she is perfectly aware that her park avenue is not the same park avenue that causes realtors to salivate and debutantes to dream everyone knows that beyond 96th street , the neighborhood turns different , higher class , she said yet she often finds herself 50 blocks south , she said , enjoying summertime walks along the fancier portions of the avenue or through central park if you 're a real new yorker , you know how to mingle , she explained you know how to get along with others over the last 20 years in new york state , the average inflationadjusted income of the poorest 20 percent of households fell 794 , or 59 percent , to 12 , 639 , according to a study released in april by the center on budget and policy priorities and the economic policy institute in the same period , average income among the richest 20 percent of households in new york rose 56 , 812 , or 541 percent , to 161 , 858 by the end of the 1990 s , the study found , the average income for the richest households in the state was nearly 13 times that of the poorest households twenty years ago , the difference was only eightfold unlike their counterparts uptown , none of the residents of 565 who talked about life there agreed to let their names appear in print there were nervous suggestions that the building s coop board might not approve one tenant , however , consented to sit for a 30minute interview inside his office at a prominent midtown law firm this man said he and his wife have lived in 565 for about six years , having moved there from one of long island s finer north shore suburbs i suppose we had a preference to live on park , said the lawyer , a tall and powerfullooking man who is the son of a retail store owner from astoria , queens but we never told each other that we had to live on park the lawyer described himself as a family man he has two grown sons who enjoys exercising \( he does n't run as much as he used to \) , reading novels \( most recently reversible errors , by scott turow \) and spending time at his country hideaway in a town he refused to identify he described his building as well maintained , well serviced and well stocked with businessmen , artistic types and a few wellknown people whom he also refused to name it s a very nice building , but i do n't think there s anything extra special about it , he said with a shrug , sitting behind his imposing wooden desk it s just a very nice place to live the lawyer is an intelligent man , and he is hardly blind to the status that adheres to living on a street like park avenue , an address he referred to as an identifying mark akin to attending the right university or attaining a prestigious corporate title does it add to my life in any realistic way \? he asked no but there is a cachet he also made a keen observation about city life by saying that any two points in new york city separated by two miles are likely to be vastly different in socioeconomic terms two city miles , he said , is perhaps the equivalent of 10 or 15 miles in other places at the country house , he explained , i have to travel five miles just to get a gallon of milk one of his neighbors agreed to answer several questions over the telephone as long as she was not identified by name this woman explained that she had moved into the building in 1978 with her husband , who manages their investments you can put me down for investments as well , i guess , she said she loves 565 i have a lovely view , she said with a sigh i overlook the colony club it s a very small building , very intime , she added you say good morning to your neighbors , and then good afternoon it took little effort for a reporter to gain access to 1565 park avenue , built between 1946 and 1948 by the architectural firm of mayer whittlesey , which five years later completed the rangel houses in washington heights the tenants volunteered the information that the elevator was frequently out of service and that the heat did not come on until 10 pm on certain nights it was somewhat more difficult to enter 565 park avenue , completed in 1914 by robert t lyons , who also built the gramercy park hotel the management company declined an invitation to set up interviews with the tenants , and the doorman reacted skeptically to questions in the past , he explained , he had nearly lost his job for speaking to the press photos a resident of the public housing tower at 1565 park , at 112th street , says her home is on the lowincome park avenue some of new york s most successful people call 565 park avenue home a resident says the lobby smells like old money \( photographs by librado romero the new york times \)
assembly speaker sheldon silver yesterday accused officials overseeing the rebuilding of lower manhattan of avoiding public accountability by failing to publicly discuss and vote on proposals to spend billions of dollars in federal aid promised after the sept 11 attack at a hearing in manhattan to assess efforts to rebuild the transportation , telecommunications and utilities infrastructure damaged in the attack , mr silver complained that the lack of accountability had caused the rebuilding effort to move too slowly and haphazardly as an example , mr silver , a manhattan democrat , noted that none of the three agencies overseeing proposed transportation projects in lower manhattan the port authority of new york and new jersey , the metropolitan transportation authority and the lower manhattan development corporation had asked their boards for approval of a list of 45 billion in projects nevertheless , the agencies have already asked the federal government to approve the projects , which include the construction of new transportation hubs at the world trade center site and the subway stations at fulton and nassau streets , the redesign of the south ferry subway terminal and the conversion of west street to a grand promenade officials from the three agencies testified that gov george e pataki , who appoints at least half the members of their respective boards , worked with the agencies to devise the lists of projects but the officials said that formal approvals were not required until final plans were in place and contracts ready to be awarded each of these agencies has their own approval procedures for these projects , said louis r tomson , the president of the development corporation and a former aide to mr pataki i think it s an important step for the governor to indicate to the federal government that he supports these projects but in terms of formal approval , i do n't believe there s a formal approval step at this point in the process in remarks to reporters during a break in the hearing , mr silver rejected that explanation the real question is , who is directing the rebuilding of lower manhattan , he said our approach should have been public discussion , public meetings and ultimately an ability to vote on these by various boards at the hearing , mr tomson also said that the timeline for the public release of the next round of designs for the trade center site was likely to be extended by about a month , to the end of january , to give the development corporation and its six teams of architects more time to integrate their ideas into three alternative site plans joseph seymour , the executive director of the port authority , said the authority had begun to design the central transportation hub that would link the path commuter trains and subway lines that pass near the trade center site he said the hub was likely to include underground pedestrian corridors stretching north and south of the site , in addition to the previously disclosed easttowest concourse intended to link the world financial center with the central hub and , farther east , to the fulton street transit center
last week i turned on cmt country music television just in time to see toby keith perform the controversial hit single from his new album , unleashed it took some talking before he was ready to play in the grand tradition of country music , he explained that he was a simple man and that this was a simple song and that he did n't much care what the media made of it the song , courtesy of the red , white and blue , is both a paean to america s military men and women , including mr keith s father , and a promise to kick the rear end of any enemy because it s the american way mr keith is a solid slab of a man , a former football player and oklahoma oilhand on cmt he wore a flatcrowned , purewhite cowboy hat and a long goatee that was half buffalo bill , half buffalo he struck out into the song , and the audience sang along with him the music was solemn , almost dirgelike imagine , if you can , a cross between the slow part of american pie and ballad of the green berets if anything , mr keith undersang the line about where the american boot goes , but the studio audience was having none of it it shouted and applauded and rang out the words the mood was one of nostalgic revenge it s tempting to say that on the subject of sept 11 , country music is struggling for its soul but then country music is always struggling for its soul the trouble this time is n't the usual one , the effort to keep the music downhome real when it really wants to go elvis the trouble is making sense of 9 11 the middle ground is held by alan jackson vocally speaking , mr jackson , who is 43 , has turned into the senior baritone statesman of country music his most recent album , drive , includes studio and live versions of where were you \( when the world stopped turning \) , a song about the attack on the world trade center and the importance of love i'm just a singer of simple songs , mr jackson sings , i'm not a real political man mr keith probably is n't a real political man either , but to much of his audience , courtesy of the red , white and blue is what passes for a political song if it s short on geopolitical sophistication , it s long on attitude , which is fitting for a man who s partial to bigdog metaphors the audience that sings along to courtesy of the red , white and blue will not be singing along to john walker s blues , a cut from steve earle s new album , jerusalem , which will be released in late september when it comes to understanding the other guy , most country singers do a pretty good job of speaking for the lonely drunk , the single mother , the brokenhearted ordinary working stiff mr earle , who is one of country music s greatest songwriters , has a wider empathic range he s made a habit of singing in the voices of people like a convict on death row or a marijuana grower in a song called copperhead road but in john walker s blues he adopts the persona of john walker lindh , the young american who served with the taliban in afghanistan the song has gotten conservative commentators up in arms , especially a lyric like now they 're draggin' me back with my head in a sack to the land of the infidel some people think mr earle is glorifying mr lindh by writing in his voice but what mr earle is really doing is trying to see what the world looks like from inside mr lindh s head , rather than just kicking it in in fact , the political power of jerusalem and it s a profoundly political album does n't stem mainly from the voice he creates in john walker s blues it stems from mr earle s conviction that america s civil liberties are under attack from within in a statement released on his web site mr earle says , freedoms , american freedoms , things voted into law as american freedoms , everything that came out of the 1960 s , are disappearing , and as any patriot can see , that has to be opposed a song called conspiracy theory puts it more tersely it s best that you believe that you do n't hear the footsteps that follow you around no matter where you go country music is n't alone in struggling with the meaning of sept 11 americans have adopted a number of popular songs in the months since , including such anthems of recovery as enya s only time and two songs by josh groban , who is , for all intents and purposes , the male celine dion these songs are a kind of emotional wallpaper when it addresses the subject directly at all , the strongest urge in popular music is a very familiar one to speak for the victims , whether it s neil young s song let s roll , based on the passengers who tried to retake flight 93 before it crashed in pennsylvania , or bruce springsteen s new album , the rising , which is haunted by absence but quick as the response seems , popular music is only beginning to come to terms with the events of last september one reason is the difficulty of handling topical material in song the most topical songs and the best ones think of bob dylan s early work are usually the angriest and the most specific that s why steve earle s jerusalem , the most challenging of all this post9 1l music , sounds so authentic even mr springsteen , the laureate of the little american , is left grappling with a pickupload of symbols and images that feel disconnected and strangely generic the music is caught where we 're all caught , somewhere between a desire for vengeance and a desire

for much of the 1990 s , ronald a galotti hacked a singular path through the new york media as a general in the cond nast publishing empire , mr galotti treated ad sales as an allout war and took on the prerogatives of the publishing life limousines , parties and celebrity with stylistic aggression but when he left cond nast publications in 1999 in a cloud of hype to start talk magazine with its editor , tina brown , he turned his oftfired guns on his old employer to win accounts , he took trashtalking to another level , including once sending copies of two cond nast magazines , the new yorker and vanity fair , in wastebaskets to a vice president at louis vuitton north america to suggest that a new era had dawned that era ended along with talk early this year , and steven t florio , president and chief executive at cond nast , asked mr galotti to return as publisher of gq all was forgiven there were people that told me what he did was the ultimate betrayal , and i said , so what \? ' mr florio recalled not everyone is as willing to let bygones remain that way although his peers at the executive level have enormous regard for his talent and charm , they are wary of the arrogance and tactics that go with it in a publishing age of wellmannered consumer marketers , mr galotti does what he must to close a sale and never mind the blood on the walls but the two people who matter most mr florio and s i newhouse jr , chairman of cond nast appreciate his ability to separate money from his clients the return of the prodigal may not sit well with some of the executives he rejoined , but mr galotti is not back hat in hand if his current assignment goes well , bigger opportunities are likely to again present themselves ron understands his stature in this organization , and he knows that other things will come along , mr florio said those who stayed behind and toiled while mr galotti was at talk have significant resentment what he did with talk was a betrayal , a senior company executive said he took an editor from this company , started another magazine and immediately began competing with us sitting in his ninthfloor office , mr galotti , a man who collected enemies and ad pages with equal facility , smiled beneficently as he pronounced himself officially humbled the former mr big , the role model for the terminal bachelor in hbo s sex and the city , is content to be mr not so big acknowledging some reverses , he said i'm lucky to have the job i have i know that there are a lot of people out there looking for work , and i am grateful to be at a company like this when you are young , arrogance is a tool there is little question that gq could use the help the men s lifestyle magazine , now 45 years old , is still the category leader in advertising , but it is under attack from a new generation of men s magazine like maxim , stuff and fhm the magazine s newsstand sales , the best indication of current consumer interest , have plunged , dropping more than 25 percent in the last two years newsstand sales of the rival esquire , although on a much smaller base , are up more than 11 percent in the first six months of the year in september , woman s wear daily reported that mr galotti thought art cooper , gq s editor in chief , was part of the problem mr galotti denied that he had anything but the utmost regard for mr cooper and the magazine he edits , but two cond nast executives said mr galotti has complained about the magazine s editorial leadership art and i have been colleagues and friends for 20 years , mr galotti said i have no idea where these stories start he played a significant role in my coming here , and i love his magazine mr cooper , who has been counted out more than once , said he was not worried about the future or mr galotti the newsstand sales have been terrible and i would be the first person to admit it , he said but we are making progress july , august and september were up 11 percent and i think the stuff about ron badmouthing me is crazy we are not just colleagues we are friends the ad picture was only marginally better the magazine was off 13 percent in ad pages during the very difficult 2001 year , and until april 2002 had dropped a further 17 percent mr galotti used a huge 45thanniversary issue in september , up 30 percent over the year before , to pull the magazine s sales back to even with 2001 through september but the new mr galotti , the suddenly humble one , refused to take credit this was and is a wellmanaged and wellpositioned magazine , mr galotti said this is not about fixing anything the success that we have had is about programs that were already well under way part of mr galotti s modesty in tone may derive from the fact that the previous publisher was thomas a florio , brother of steven florio and a personal friend but the renewed marketing muscle behind gq is hard to miss
to the editor re a chilling aerial suicide \( editorial , jan 8 \) general aviation , like other parts of american society , must operate with a new balance between security and freedom but none of the measures you propose would have made any difference in the case of the plane flown into a tampa office building by a 15yearold last weekend more noflight zones \? the student crossed highly controlled military and civilian airspace no pilot who was afraid of legal repercussions would have dared enter it without a clearance stricter requirements for flight plans \? this student stole the plane and did n't even have a clearance to take off background checks \? the student was well known and trusted every security system trusts certain people and is vulnerable if , without warning , they go bad for the public , this case demonstrates that small airplanes , compared with airliners , have limited potential as damaging weapons for people in general aviation , it demonstrates that if airplanes are turned into weapons by people willing to ignore all rules and lose their own lives , society s only defense is to shoot them down james fallows washington , jan 8 , 2002 the writer is national correspondent of the atlantic monthly
trenton , april 5 the last of the county republican conventions is over , and james w treffinger , the essex county executive , has held on as he predicted he would to his position as the candidate with the strongest party support to take on senator robert g torricelli in november that leaves the five other candidates for the republican nomination talking about how unimportant partyorganization support is in new jersey as they experiment with new themes , including immigration and national security , in their quests to break out of the pack as expected , mr treffinger easily won the endorsement of bergen county republican leaders at their convention on thursday night , giving him the favored position on the county s june 4 primary ballot the bergen vote was mr treffinger s 11th victory among the 17 counties that pick party favorites at conventions or by executive committee decision his strength within the party suggests how badly state republicans want to win their first statewide election victory since former gov christie whitman was narrowly reelected in 1997 but as the campaign director for a rival candidate , state senator diane allen , put it today , the party leaders also supported former representative bob franks for governor in last year s republican primary , yet republican voters handed the nomination to bret d schundler , the mayor of jersey city diane allen has been targeting her message toward primary voters and the party cadre , said brian donahue , ms allen s campaign manager the last primary election showed that the party bosses did not determine the outcome of the election , and the best use of our resources and energy is to focus our efforts on primary voters who will make up their minds on june 4 and not just a small group of backroom party workers robert ray , the former whitewater special prosecutor , who joined the race too late to be considered even in the bergen county convention , made the same point today county conventions are about persuading certain party officials to support you , mr ray said , but the point here is that as bret schundler showed , the only thing that matters is what the voters decide to do , and in new jersey , the voters have a habit of being particularly independentminded charlie smith , mr treffinger s campaign manager , maintained today that in a crowded field , not the twoman race mr schundler won , party organization had everything to do with winning yet david rebovich , a rider university political scientist , argued that the scattered nature of the race for the republican nomination , particularly with two strong south jersey candidates in ms allen and state senator john j matheussen , makes it more unpredictable than mr treffinger s lead in party support might suggest in some ways it s an enigmatic race , mr rebovich said today yes , we know bret schundler taught us last year that we ca n't always trust the power of the organization to win for you , but this year none of the candidates has really broken out from the pack yet three other candidates divided up the remaining six county endorsements senator matheussen beat senator allen in south jersey by winning cumberland , camden and gloucester counties , while ms allen was endorsed in burlington and cape may douglas forrester , a wealthy businessman and , like mr ray , a relative newcomer to state politics , upset mr treffinger s expectations by winning the middlesex county convention less wellfinanced candidates grumbled that mr forrester took middlesex on the strength of the beef stroganoff and shrimp scampi his caterer served to convention voters the sixth candidate is assemblyman guy gregg the candidates have been united in focusing most of their attacks on senator torricelli and the ethical issues surrounding the long federal investigation into his fundraising an inquiry that ended without any charges but mr forrester introduced the idea of tightening immigration controls and national security in his first radio commercial , and mr ray took up the theme in his announcement last month we did n't think anything like the trade center attack was possible in this country , mr ray said today , and i think we need to look at what s happening in the middle east and reflect seriously on the fact that something like that could happen here mr forrester said polling had shown national security to be a growing voter concern i 've tried to make sure that we do n't play into a xenophobic mindset , mr forrester said , but rather , to develop a balanced point of view to protect national security and legitimate immigrants , who are welcome photo diane allen , right , campaigning for senate in milburn , nj she aims her message at voters , not gop leaders \( dith pran the new york times \)
last september , in the hours and days after the terrorist attacks on the world trade center , long island police officers in the hundreds rushed to help out in new york city many of the officers who stayed on the island were reassigned to guard places deemed vulnerable to terrorists or otherwise went on high alert during that month , while the antiterror mobilization was at its peak , the number of reported crimes and arrests for major crimes dipped in both nassau and suffolk but the following month , as the terror threat began to ease and the police started to return to their normal duties , the number of arrests and reported crimes in both counties jumped those are the statistics , and no one is disputing them but there s plenty of disagreement over what they mean , and that argument has entered the debate between the nassau county police union and the new county executive , thomas r suozzi in a package of proposed tax increases and spending cuts intended to close a projected 428 million gap in the county budget , mr suozzi wants to wring 30 million in concessions from the union , in part by cutting some 300 officers from the 2 , 800member force all sides are using nassau s low crime rate the lowest among counties its size in the country to justify their positions on staffing and other issues mr suozzi has said the crime rate in nassau has remained low despite previous reductions in the force gary delaraba , the president of the nassau county police benevolent association , has said the crime rate shows that the size of nassau s police force produces good results siding with mr delaraba , some crime experts said the increase in arrests in october may have reflected a surge in activity by criminals who thought that the police were either distracted or too few in number to be able to do their duties that , especially in light of the potential for another terrorist attack , would argue against cuts in police staffing , they said after 9 11 , nassau and suffolk sent a significant number of officers to new york city , said harvey w kushner , the chairman of the criminal justice department at the c w post campus of long island university in brookville the bad guys probably knew that and took something of an advantage if so , he added , it would absolutely , 100 percent argue for a correlation between the size of the police force and the crime rate the implication is that if mr suozzi allows the nassau police force to shrink , crime in the county will rise but anthony cancellieri , nassau s deputy county executive , said , i do n't think you can connect any increase in arrests post9 11 to anything that happened on 9 11 told that professor kushner had suggested that wouldbe criminals might have been taking advantage of the situation , mr cancellieri said , obviously , a lot of them got caught according to the nassau county police department , its officers and other police forces in the county made 407 arrests on charges of murder , rape , robbery , burglary , aggravated assault or larceny in september 2001 that figure , down 17 percent from the month before , was the lowest for the 26 months in the reporting period , which was january 2000 to february 2002 in october 2001 , the nassau police made 540 arrests , up 133 , a 33 percent increase from the month before the suffolk county police department , which covers most of the county aside from the east end , made 398 majorcrime arrests in september , down 11 percent from the previous month in october , the number jumped to 513 , up 115 , a 29 percent increase in both counties , the increases were the biggest monthtomonth gains in the 26 months , both in absolute and percentage terms like arrests , reported criminal activity surged in october after dropping the month before reported crimes in suffolk , which dropped by 7 percent in september , rose by 12 percent the next month , to 2 , 996 that was the highest figure in the 26month period reported crimes in nassau , which dropped by 11 percent in september , rose by 15 percent the next month , to 1 , 654 the reports of crimes in nassau , unlike the arrest statistics , do not include its two cities and about 10 incorporated villages , out of 64 in the county , that have their own forces an augusttoseptember dropoff in total arrests and reported crimes in both counties in 2000 raises the possibility that seasonal factors played a part in the declines during the same period in 2001 but officer michael irise , a nassau police spokesman , said criminals went on a moratorium in september 2001 nora v demleitner , a law professor at hofstra university in hempstead , suggested that even wouldbe criminals might have been stunned after the attacks everybody was so shocked , she said petty crimes seemed so irrelevant at a time of national crisis professor demleitner said that a sharp , acrosstheboard increase in larceny statistics in october 2001 strongly suggested that conditions specific to the climate after sept 11 were the major factor driving the overall increases
tales from the boomboom room women vs wall street by susan antilla illustrated 342 pp princeton , nj bloomberg press 2695 one of the few consolations of being sexually harassed is commiserating with sympathetic confidantes afterward these accounts often unfold like a kind of reverse pornography , in which the audience steels itself for each new and gruesome act , ready to greet it with murmurs of outrage at least that s what it feels like to read tales from the boomboom room , susan antilla s chronicle of harassment and discrimination on wall street most readers already know that the financial industry is no bastion of decorum but even so , they should prepare for some heavy wincing let s go to the lowlight reel a broker dispatches a condom to women through a pneumatictube delivery system strippers show up to celebrate male brokers' birthdays a sales assistant hears that a male broker wants to rape her right now men talk about sucking a woman s nipples until they bled do n't swoon over a stock , instructs a supervisor it is like falling in love with a woman it falls and falls and all you 're left with is a yeast infection a female broker is sent a penisshaped calzone , complete with ricotta cheese leaking from a strategically placed part of the pastry and so on in addition to triplexrated sexual harassment , antilla s subjects also suffered cold , hard job discrimination many of their firms paid them lower base salaries than their male equivalents , blatantly yanked away clients and commissions , welcomed them back from maternity leave with pay cuts and demotions and refused to supply them with the study materials that helped male brokers earn their licenses as of 1994 , male sales assistants at smith barney were more than eight times as likely to make broker as their female counterparts the book s title , with its connotations of stock market heights , sounds allegorical but the boomboom room was a real place the basement rec room of a shearson brokerage office in garden city , ny , where some of these abuses took place antilla reports on a number of companies , but the boomboom room is her tailhook she spends the first half of the book enumerating the humiliations women suffered at the garden city branch , and the second half describing the illfated lawsuit in which they tried to gain redress antilla s book is no masterpiece of legal storytelling the first section is so shoddily narrated that one worries that boomboom room , clearly intended as a rallying cry , will end up being bad for the girls when antilla describes the various insults her subjects endure , she sounds as melodramatic and onesided as a plaintiff s lawyer and she pulls a few dirty courtroom tricks she calls pamela martens , the lead plaintiff and hero of the book , by her first name , but refers to nearly everyone else most notably , nicholas cuneo , martens s boss and the book s chief lout by their surnames antilla delivers a grandstanding rant about insidertrading scandals snotty commentary about the provenance of some stockbrokers \( drafted from the ranks of usedcar salesmen \) and snoozy interludes about the color of martens s car and what she fed her cat for breakfast antilla could have spent those pages on a sociology lesson instead the financial industry is a vast and multilayered kingdom , and she never considers how the atmosphere of , say , a bluechip investment bank might \( or might not \) differ from that of a tradingroom floor since the book only touches on a few workplaces , it s tough to know how typical the boomboom room was , or how conditions changed during the 20year span of her narrative when antilla mentions the clarence thomas confirmation hearings of 1991 , it s only to tell us about tasteless parodies of anita hill s testimony surely these hearings had some impact on the industry , and if they did n't , all the more reason to tell us so but once the lawsuit takes shape , boomboom room morphs into a darker and more nuanced book the opposite of the triumphalist matlock brockovich genre of popular legal narrative the litigants could barely litigate like most other wall street firms , shearson \( now part of smith barney \) required all professionals to agree never to sue it and to submit to an industrysponsored arbitration instead under this system , the complainant gets no day in court , few of the protections of legal precedent or due process , a diminished shot at a generous award , little explanation of the arbitrators' decision and almost no chance to appeal since arbitration treats each case individually , it s hard to muster evidence against a serial harasser the whole proceeding is kept secret which protects the victim s privacy but also nullifies the civic and deterrence value of her complaint this is why wall street s official record of sexual harassment is so suspiciously thin , antilla says the most egregious cases settle the fastest , because the company throws a lot of hush money at the victims who , after all they 've been through , ca n't really be blamed for assenting in fact , men are sometimes able to dispense with sexual harassment charges without their wives ever hearing a word about them enter a fortunate loophole by filing a classaction lawsuit , the smith barney women were able to sue in a regular court but this was a precarious move at any point , they could have lost their class status and been bumped back into arbitration hell which is partly why they soon scrapped their original demand of ending smith barney s mandatory arbitration regime and began negotiating a settlement to this day , no one but the firm and the lawyers knows how much cash the women got smith barney did agree to set up an internal forum to hear individual claims but none of the accused harassers named in the suit would ever be deposed , let alone held liable if a woman accepted one of smith barney s first \( and likely most generous \) offers , she would have to sign an agreement to keep the entire affair confidential the plaintiffs' lawyers , linda friedman and mary stowell , made out better , with 12 million in legal fees after this fee was proposed as part of the settlement , antilla reports , the two seemed to grow cozy with opposing counsel , and left certain plaintiffs feeling as if their lawyers were no longer being aggressive enough and were protecting the defense but not everyone folded pamela martens , the lead plaintiff , is the story s joan of arc , a purist you might even call her a crank who not only refused to settle but also became a scold to those who did martens is still trying to win her day in court if she fails , at least this book will have aired her grievances and earned her some public sympathy other women have clearly done worse drawing \( tom seltzer \)
phoenicia , ny the forecast for opening day was not encouraging it was supposed to warm up to 41 , winds of 40 to 50 miles an hour were predicted , and the chance of rain was 90 percent but you ca n't expect nice weather on april 1 , so that did n't discourage me a friend was going to show me some of his favorite spots on the esopus creek , one of the classic american trout streams with his help , i thought i might avoid the familiar opening day ritual of high water , leaky waders and elusive fish and i was encouraged when we stopped at morne imports , which sells fishing gear , and talked to marietta hofmeister too bad you were n't here before , she said a local fisherman had been by with a 24inch brown trout and a few small ones i asked her if she knew what he had been using probably worms , she said but when i talked to another fly fisherman , who had n't had any luck , and he said he was trying a woolly bugger , i knew we were in trouble in my experience the two cardinal rules of fishing are 1 \) never drink before you wade 2 \) when the fly of choice is a woolly bugger , use worms i did n't buy worms i stuck to flies , and inevitably i was eventually reduced to using a woolly bugger , a big , fuzzy fly that seems as if it ought to be a good choice when the water is high and muddy i have never had any luck with a woolly bugger we started out fishing where woodland valley creek runs into the esopus there is a long , deep slick there , and i tried drifting a stonefly nymph and a couple of different beadhead nymph patterns through it , with no luck we fished up woodland valley creek a bit i asked another angler there what he was using worms , he said , and egg sacs and spinners , with no luck he looked at my equipment and said i did n't even bring my fly rod i 've never caught anything on a fly on opening day of the halfdozen anglers i talked to , none had caught a fish or seen a fish caught i was the only one who had heard of a fish being caught a boy of about 12 was clear about the reason the water s too high a pair of fishermen who passed by in a fourwheeldrive vehicle as we were coming out of the creek asked if we had caught anything i shook my head and said , nothing , how about you \? they smiled ruefully and shook their heads fishing in the esopus , however , was just our opening gambit , an obligatory visit to mark the season s opening and commune with fellow anglers my friend had another place in mind where he thought we might actually catch something , a small stream with hungry brookies lurking in plunge pools and few other fishermen the esopus often runs high because of water released from the schoharie reservoir the smaller stream \( i had to swear not to print the name before he would take me \) was likely to have lower water , and brookies in small streams are usually much less particular than the browns and rainbows in heavily fished rivers it made sense , but beware the application of reason to fishing when we reached the stream he tied on a dry fly , an adams this seemed to be tempting fate to me , but i did n't say anything it was only drizzling at the time it had n't started snowing yet as we moved from pool to pool up the stream , i tried a variety of nymphs and streamers my fishing partner started using a royal wulff the wind picked up , the sky darkened and the leak in my waders became obvious there were no other anglers around , which meant we had no competition but no one to share the pain with i began to calculate how many toes i was willing to sacrifice for a trout when we reached a small waterfall with a deep , irresistibly fishy pool , two things happened it began to snow , and i tied on a woolly bugger that s when i knew i had hit bottom , figuratively just a few casts later , i hung the fly up on a tree branch and lost it i took that as a sign since my friend did not have a special snow flurry pattern in his dry fly box , we decided to call it a day we walked back to the car , and i changed socks within 20 minutes the feeling had returned to my toes i expect to keep them all on the other hand , i did n't catch anything perhaps if i had stayed longer , been more willing to sacrifice a body part to the cold , i might have caught a fish perhaps if i had done a better repair job on my waders , perhaps if i had bought worms never mind the season has begun spring will come fish will rise and i did n't want that woolly bugger anyway photo david sze photographing gladys ramon with a trout they caught and released yesterday on the esopus creek in ulster county , ny \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)

i had been perfectly happy in china when night fell , i wanted to cry but there was no way back , not when my mother had spent a whole year s salary , 800 , just to fly me here the cultural revolution had closed all schools when my parents were teenagers , and neither finished high school my dad was a government clerk , and my mom worked in a textile factory , bent over a sewing machine year after year in a thick soup of air filled with tiny cotton fibers but she had a great passion for her only child s education in 10th grade , i had discovered from a pirated book about american college admissions that i could apply just like any american teenager , taking the test of english as a foreign language and the gre , the graduate admissions test \( the sat was not given in china \) lulu , this is your chance , my mother told me lulu is what my family calls me so on the nights when i did n't sleep at my high school dormitory \( eight to a room \) , i stayed with my grandparents , whose oneroom apartment was bigger than my parents' , memorizing english words from vocabulary books i would sit with my back facing the color tv , on which my grandmother watched sentimental novellas with earphones on another side of the room , my grandfather sat in bed with earphones , holding a radio tuned to the bbc s chineselanguage programs even when i was very small , my mother had told me that i could do anything and be anyone , and that smart people went abroad to study i had n't known there were many countries i had thought there were only two china and the foreign country i remember wishing i had been born in the foreign country now , here i was the big picture my admission to yale on a full scholarship was part of the larger trend to diversify american campuses \( and i did score in the top fifth percentile on the gre \) as kingman brewster , the former president of yale , once wrote , an excessively homogeneous class will not learn anywhere near as much from each other as a class whose backgrounds and interests and values have something new to contribute to the common experience today , almost 8 percent of yale s students come from abroad , and that figure is likely to grow in 2000 , yale joined princeton , harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology in admitting international students regardless of their ability to pay for the class of 2005 , yale admitted nine freshmen directly from china , a record , and all with full financial aid in 1994 , i was the only one according to the institute of international education , close to 60 , 000 chinese students study in the united states the largest number from any country for the third year , thanks to its enormous population about 13 percent of the students are undergraduates , and the rest are pursuing advanced degrees students from china and india in particular excel in the sciences and technology

united airlines , burdened by debt and by tense relationships with its employees , who own more than half the company , said yesterday that it might file for bankruptcy protection by midnovember if it did not receive concessions from labor unions , suppliers and others within a month the unions appeared reluctant to give cuts and promised to oppose any move toward bankruptcy two of the unions have seats on the 12member board of ual , the parent company of united , and more than half the board has to vote in favor of seeking bankruptcy protection for the company to make such a move the announcement from united , the nation s secondlargest airline , was the latest in a series of upheavals that have racked the industry during one of its worst weeks us airways , the country s sixthlargest airline , filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday , and american airlines , the world s largest airline , said on tuesday that it was laying off 7 , 000 workers , reducing capacity and retiring dozens of jets what united does in its labor negotiations weighs heavily on the entire industry united has given its pilots and machinists generous contracts that other airline labor groups have demanded their employers match or surpass , propping up the high cost structure that is helping create the big industry losses , analysts say though the employees own 55 percent of ual , they have little corporate governance power beyond the two board seats until yesterday , united said it had no plans to file for bankruptcy protection , despite analysts' gloomy outlook on the company but executives are now clearly betting that the threat of bankruptcy will bring the unions back to the table united is seeking a 18 billion federal guarantee of private loans that will bolster its dwindling cash reserves , and it said yesterday that the government would give its backing only if it received deeper concessions from all stakeholders united has 27 billion in cash reserves that it is using up at a rate of nearly 1 million a day , and it will have to pay off 875 million in debt this fall the first 300 million is due on nov 17 the world has changed , john w creighton jr , united s chief executive , said yesterday in a written statement unless we lower our costs dramatically , filing for bankruptcy protection will be the only way we can ensure the company s future and the continued operation of our airline analysts say that united has some of the most complex problems in the industry and that bankruptcy protection may be the only real way to make the company profitable again united lost 341 million in the second quarter , more than any of its rivals , and 21 billion last year , an industry record experts say one of the airline s most immediate problems is that mr creighton , 69 , is a lame duck now , since he has said he intends to resign no overhaul can take place until a successor is found , they say in the meantime , management and the unions cannot seem to agree on exactly what ails the carrier management says united is dragged down by the most expensive labor contracts in the business the unions maintain that management has made several horrendous business moves , especially an illfated attempt to buy us airways that was blocked by the justice department last year now , they say , united is making another by threatening a bankruptcy filing , a move that would probably wipe out the value of ual stock the shares , which closed yesterday at 245 , down 29 cents , have already tumbled 92 percent since sept 10 we think the company should be concentrating more on a business plan that works than filing for bankruptcy , said robert roach jr , general vice president of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , united s biggest union and you ca n't attribute this to labor costs the machinists' union has already stepped up to the plate by deferring retroactive pay mr roach said that the machinists agreed earlier this year to let the company defer payment of 500 million owed to them the first 70 million is now due on dec 15 united also needs to find a successor for mr creighton before his union will negotiate seriously with management , he said there s a power vacuum at united , and no one under creighton can do anything , said darryl jenkins , director of the aviation institute at george washington university and it s not just labor they need to work on they need to restructure their airline to have more productivity chapter 11 may be the best possible option available for united airlines , he added some airline executives said united must tackle its labor contracts immediately because of the costly precedent they set for the rest of the industry such negotiations are complicated by the fact that the machinists and the pilots have one seat each on the board critics say this raises corporate governance problems because the union board members might be working more for the interests of their individual constituencies than for all the shareholders the inmates are running the asylum , and they have access to the pharmacy , said gordon m bethune , the chief executive of continental airlines
zoya s story an afghan woman s struggle for freedom by zoya with john follain and rita cristofari 239 pp new york william morrow 2495 my forbidden face growing up under the taliban a young woman s story by latifa with shekeba hachemi translated by linda coverdale 210 pp new york talk miramax books hyperion 2195 west of kabul , east of new york an afghan american story by tamim ansary 292 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 22 like many women who have reported on the taliban , i have tried on a burka it was in the afghan market in the pakistani city of peshawar , a city of refugees and of longsimmering conflicts that reflect the larger battles in afghanistan itself there were no religious police in peshawar to enforce the wearing of the burka as they were doing in afghanistan , but still it was a common sight the one i tried was the most everyday type a cheap , lightblue polyester affair with a vast pleated skirt that descended from a tightfitting cap , a small mesh panel in front of the eyes providing the only light and air i had wondered how women recognized each other how a lost child ever found its mother how friends and relatives could tell if they passed one another on the street for those few moments under the burka , i glimpsed a life in which both air and vision were so restricted that i was overwhelmed by claustrophobia it was suffocating , emotionally as well as physically i took it off after half a minute that instant when afghan women lifted their burkas produced some of the most potent images of the liberation of kabul last year it seemed unambiguous the taliban , with their extreme and cruel misogyny , were defeated afghan women were free but scarcely had the camera shutters clicked before ambiguities came crowding back today some afghan women feel freer than before , others do not some feel that their lives and their futures have been restored to them , others struggle to survive in a country that has slipped back into chaos and in peshawar there are more refugees today than before the war against terrorism began among them are thousands of women , survivors of dead fathers , husbands and sons , still struggling for existence against impossible odds the stories told in the three books under review zoya s story , my forbidden face and west of kabul , east of new york illustrate many of the questions that the west needs to answer if afghanistan is to emerge from this latest round of warfare in a better state than before a little reflection on the long battle over the bodies and souls of afghan women raises one question in particular was this a battle between secularism and islam or between tradition and modernity \? two of these books are written by young women who lived under the taliban both using pseudonyms here the third by an afghanamerican man who became famous overnight for an email message he sent to 20 friends in the wake of sept 11 that was rapidly copied and sent on until it reached , he estimates , hundreds of thousands of people these feel like familiar stories examples of a wellestablished genre , even the personal account that illustrates the wider political context it does not diminish their particularity to say that they are illustrative rather than revelatory , reinforcing what we feel we understand rather than shedding new light or bringing new understanding the taliban s treatment of women was well known before sept 11 , not least because of the efforts of the revolutionary association of the women of afghanistan , known as rawa , which figures large in zoya s story zoya s account , written with the assistance of two journalists , john follain and rita cristofari , illuminates the clandestine resistance , first to the mujahedeen and then to the taliban , that many intellectuals engaged in both her parents were active in clandestine politics her mother as a member of rawa and her father in an unnamed underground organization but it was only when her parents disappeared that zoya came to understand the risks they had run she was left with only a surrogate grandmother to take care of her , and with rawa s help , the two managed to escape from the taliban s afghanistan it s clear from all three accounts that the taliban were only the most recent oppressors of afghan women , whose suffering is in part the result of the conflict between modernity and tradition in which the west has , on occasion , been on the wrong side more recently , both women and girls have suffered the fate of being the most vulnerable members of a society destroyed by more than 20 years of war all three of these memoirs are written from exile , in which the vanished afghanistan of childhood takes on the cast of a lost idyll in west of kabul , east of new york , tamim ansary s account of growing up between his father s afghan world and his mother s america , the author conjures up a lost afghan world of extended families who lived in the private interior of the courtyard closed against the outside but linked to other clan families by ties of blood and belonging
there are no hard and fast rules governing how soon an accounting firm can destroy documents related to an audit , but the papers are generally maintained for years , accountants said yesterday after the disclosure that arthur andersen had destroyed enron documents only some audit papers are maintained , however , and accounting firms have long held that less important papers can be destroyed as soon as an audit is completed but lawyers and accountants agreed that all relevant documents must be preserved once an auditor learns of a government investigation related to the audit , even if it would have been permissible to dispose of them before that investigators reported on thursday that andersen auditors continued destroying enron papers as recently as november , after the securities and exchange commission had begun a formal investigation of the enron collapse one major firm , ernst young , decided to halt all routine document destruction while it reviews its policy larry parnell , a spokesman for ernst young , said the firm had been reviewing its practice for some time but did not decide until yesterday to stop following the policy of allowing audit work papers to be destroyed after six years it is not clear whether the documents destroyed by andersen constituted work papers , which must be preserved for at least some period of time andersen has not discussed the nature of the documents , and a congressional investigator said that many of the documents were email messages between auditors and enron executives documents that might or might not be viewed as vital to an audit andersen has also not disclosed the dates of the documents in question officials of pricewaterhousecoopers said yesterday that their practice had been to preserve documents for six years , or longer if the matter was a subject of litigation or investigation the other major accounting firms , kpmg and deloitte touche , declined to comment on their practices with respect to retention , we really do not have a definitive standard , said charles e landes , the director of audit standards for the american institute of certified public accountants , which cites the sixyear figure in a handbook for accountants but emphasizes that firms should consult their own lawyers the general standard for auditors , unchanged since 1982 , requires that the auditor should adopt reasonable procedures for safe custody of his working papers and should retain them for a period sufficient to meet the needs of his practice and to satisfy any pertinent legal requirements of records retention itzhak sharav , an accounting professor at columbia university , said that made clear that any destruction of recent audit papers by andersen would be a violation of the industry s ethical standards , particularly if it took place after the sec began its inquiry whatever the standard retention policy , there is a general agreement that no documents should be destroyed if an auditor is aware of an investigation any company records manager will tell you that is an absolute , said galina datskovsky , the chief executive of mdy advanced technologies , a recordsmanagement company any corporate counsel will tell you that that is an absolute standard michael j wagner , a partner in the law firm of baker mckenzie in chicago , agreed and noted that in a lawsuit or criminal case , juries can be instructed to assume that a destroyed document was damaging to the party that destroyed it papers that are not considered work papers , like early drafts of documents , have never been viewed as necessary to save , some accountants say but many are saved simply because no one takes the time to dispose of them it is not clear if many , or even all , of the documents destroyed by andersen fell into the category of papers that need not be saved david tabolt , a spokesman for andersen , declined to say what his firm s policy was but he said on thursday that it was being reviewed and that no documents would be destroyed until the review was completed if it turns out that andersen auditors destroyed actual work papers , many accounting experts would be shocked i would find it unbelievable that they would destroy their audit work papers , said peter knutson , a retired professor of accounting at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania the paperwork that is necessary should all be there , and none of that should be destroyed , he said the timing of the destruction of documents could be crucial according to congressional investigators , andersen auditors began destroying documents in september , before enron s stock collapsed and before the sec started its investigation if the papers involved were not deemed to be work papers , that destruction would probably not have violated andersen s rules or industry practice the sec s preliminary inquiry into enron s accounting was disclosed on oct 22 , and enron announced on oct 31 that the inquiry had become a formal investigation after that , lawyers said , no documents should have been destroyed , even though no subpoena had been served on andersen but congressional investigators said the destruction continued into november mr tabolt said that after andersen was served with a subpoena in november , it notified all its personnel to retain all documents but , he said , the firm was not sure that directive was followed photo when george w bush was governor of texas , he and kenneth l lay , the chairman of enron , had a correspondence that included birthday greetings to mr lay and a thank you note from him for a gift
the history is so hallowed , the highlights so riveting , that what occurred at madison square garden last night was hard to take the knicks and the chicago bulls , once league powers that engaged in six mostly memorable playoff series from 1989 to 1996 , ran around the court in futility before a bunch of empty seats sure , the shine has been off the bulls since michael jordan left them in 1998 , but when the knicks were still good , the game mattered now , there is little reason to pay attention the teams , two of the worst in the eastern conference , have won fewer than 50 games combined this season last night s game was close , with the bulls winning , 104101 , in overtime tyson chandler and eddy curry , the two 19yearold rookies chicago drafted out of high school , scored the bulls' final 4 points chandler , who had 16 points , 15 rebounds , 6 assists and 3 blocks , grabbed an offensive rebound and dunked to put chicago ahead for good , 102101 , with 1 minute 40 seconds left curry added 2 free throws with 123 seconds remaining , and kurt thomas s errant 3point attempt with a second left ended the game thomas was strong , however , registering 26 points , 17 rebounds and 3 blocks mark jackson had 19 points and 10 assists for the knicks , while latrell sprewell and allan houston combined for just 18 points the game was officially a sellout , but the crowd was about 14 , 000 and many fans left at the end of regulation the loss left the knicks \( 2949 \) tied with cleveland for the sixthworst record in the league but cleveland was 31 against the knicks this year , so the knicks win the tie breaker for draft lottery purposes chicago \( 2059 \) was 31 against the knicks this season and won both games at the garden for the first time since 19971998 while the clubs are in similar situations now , that may not be the case for long after four seasons at the bottom , the bulls are showing potential as soon as we have a complete summer together to get stronger , i think we 're going to be serious contenders for a championship , curry said curry and , especially , chandler look like budding stars he played his best game wednesday in an upset over detroit , posting 21 points , 12 rebounds and 3 blocked shots he is averaging 132 points , 92 rebounds and 18 blocks in his last six games curry had 13 points and 4 rebounds in 18 foulplagued minutes last night they both have tremendous upside , thomas said sky is the limit for them watching chandler operate last night , just a year removed from high school , made the thought of the knicks drafting a high school player more enticing the knicks are leaning against it , but scott layden , their president and general manager , is in the washington area to scout a high school allamerican game none of the current high school stars , including the top player , the 6foot10 amare stoudemire , is believed to be at the level of chandler or curry , though with a healthy marcus camby , a solid draft pick and an innovative move or two by layden , the knicks could be back in the playoff hunt next season but a few years of lottery participation are just as much of a possibility rebounds the former knick and current bull charles oakley sat out the game with a sore right shoulder oakley , who will be a free agent this summer , said he wanted to play one more year but acknowledged that this might have been his final game at the garden photo allan houston , taking a jumper , attracted two defenders and a few spectators in the garden last night \( barton silverman the new york times \)

this is a mission , general harris , 59 , said on monday , sitting in one of tweed s conference rooms and gesturing toward the clusters of education officials holding intense discussions in every corner the only time i would see this kind of activity in the military is when we would practice for war or when we were legitimately faced with conflict it s that kind of a press that s taking place here she was referring , of course , to mr klein s plans to improve the school system , an effort that many believe has better odds of succeeding than past chancellors' because mr klein is working hand in hand with mayor michael r bloomberg mr klein found general harris through friends in washington , including secretary of state colin powell s son michael , mr klein s chief of staff when he headed the justice department s antitrust division other cities , including seattle and washington , have hired former military officers to run their schools , and mr klein has said he wants to bring militarystyle discipline to the city s department of education general harris s role will be , in mr klein s words , to drive change through the system , a nonetooeasy task in a system with 1 , 200 schools , 80 , 000 teachers and a changeresistant culture at this early stage mr klein started work in august , general harris late last month it is unclear just what kind of change the chancellor is seeking and how general harris will ensure that schools embrace it for now , she , like her boss , describes her job in generalities , though she makes it clear that she will bring her training to bear on the schools the military is about getting the job done , general harris said it s about setting people on the path to the right destination and giving them the best approach to reach it you ca n't just have everybody going off in all kinds of ways and hope they come together does that mean that general harris intends to make the public schools a little more like parris island \? no , no , no , she said i can and will bring a military state of mind , but it wo n't be a person s traditional way of thinking about the military , she said military discipline is being accountable , it s being responsible , it s being timely , accurate , involved , all those things it s not some sergeant screaming over you as she talked , it was hard to picture general harris screaming over anyone she was relaxed and goodhumored , laughing often and never checking her watch or looking uncomfortable nor did she seem to care when mr klein s press secretary left the interview a few times to return phone calls in this regard she was different from other members of mr klein s team , who eye reporters wandering through tweed with all the warmth of picnickers who have discovered ants in the potato salad general harris was born in houston to a postal worker father and school librarian mother she was captain of the cheerleading team at kashmere gardens juniorsenior high school and majored in speech and drama at spelman college in atlanta she went on a uso tour to germany and france in her senior year of college , singing and dancing and dreaming of becoming an actress when that did not work out after graduation , she worked at a head start center in houston , but the pay was so meager that she joined the air force she applied to the aircraft maintenance officer school and was rejected , reapplied and was rejected again , then finally won admission on her third try in 1969 if people just keep pushing against closed doors they 'll eventually get them open , she said she rose through the military ranks as a maintenance supervisor at air force bases , taking time out in the mid1970 s to be a social aide in jimmy carter s white house she married maurice harris , an air force pilot , and had a daughter who is now a senior at the university of virginia general harris also has a 30yearold stepson she ended up as the director of maintenance and deputy chief of staff at air force headquarters in washington from 1994 to 1997 when she retired that year , she was the highestranking woman in the air force , already having become its first black female general general harris was the director of operations support for united space alliance , the company that nasa contracts with to launch and recover space shuttles , when she got a call from mr klein this summer she had never heard of him i did n't even know mayor bloomberg , she said she said that gen richard e hawley , head of the air force s air combat command during the clinton administration , tipped her off that mr klein would be calling he said he could n't tell me what it was about , but that it was big , she recalled mr klein did not have to do much persuading general harris almost died in 1995 from flash pulmonary edema , a buildup of fluid in the lungs caused by high blood pressure she narrowly survived , but two months later her husband of 15 years died of a heart attack after that i kept saying , 'god has something in mind for me , ' she said when joel called me , i could n't not come i thought , 'this has to be it' photo marcelite j harris , chief of staff to chancellor joel i klein , at the tweed courthouse she vows to bring a military state of mind to her job \( michael nagle for the new york times \)
you take a right at the martini sign and a step back in time when you walk into a bar car on the metronorth railroad the cars are a rolling throwback to the days when commuter trains were not standingroomonly and having a martini or two on the way home was de rigueur but there are only 10 bar cars left on the metronorth possibly the last , officials say , on any daily commuter train in the nation and they all run on the new haven line , making stops in affluent places like rye , ny , greenwich , darien and new canaan , conn but some of the passengers , so comfortable in so many ways , share a collective worry that someone is going to take their bar cars away there is no certainty that this will happen , but there is no certainty that it will not , either just to be safe , diehard patrons are taking action petitions to save the bar car have been circulated and signed over scotch on the rocks the battle is even being waged online patrons maintain a web site , barcarcom , to celebrate and preserve that fragile and mobile institution the bar car visitors can sign four separate petitions , the first one of which reads we , the undersigned , will not spend a cent in any retail or food outlet in grand central terminal if bar car service is reduced or suspended tom skinner , 50 , of westport , conn , started the site in 1997 to preserve the cars with the 20footlong bars and bring their community of riders online i was n't in a position to lead a political movement , he said , just to create a forum the people who visit the site i would n't call them radical , but they 're passionate mr skinner said that more than 1 , 000 people have signed the petitions online metronorth officials are aware that the bar cars , for decades a central feature of commuting in the region , have a constituency and that rumors are circulating there is scuttlebutt , said dan bruckner , a railroad spokesman there is always scuttlebutt people think we 're going to strip them out and put in seats at first glance , this seems unlikely the bar cars , mr bruckner added , are one of the only profitgenerating areas of the railroad in 2001 , metronorth made 755 , 000 on 45 million in sales of snacks and drinks in the cars and at the vendor carts on the platforms at grand central the bar cars provided 25 to 30 percent of those sales but seating is a major issue on the trains an average metronorth train car has about 110 seats , but a bar car has only 28 even counting customers who stand , bar cars hold a small fraction of what the traditional cars do as the population in suburban new york city continues to grow , complaints are increasing about overcrowded trains metronorth carries 120 , 000 commuters each way every weekday , and rushhour trains run at capacity a 13 billion capital improvement plan , which began in 2000 and will run through 2004 , will include sprucedup tracks and stations and additional cars , but no new bar cars in the next 20 years , the railroad hopes to spend an additional 25 billion to add 300 cars to its fleet , none of them bar cars , officials said the new haven line has a 3138 million annual budget , but a revenue shortfall of 849 million this year since most of the line runs through connecticut , the state s department of transportation makes up most of the difference , chipping in 539 million as a result , connecticut officials will have a major say in deciding the future of the bar cars , which were built in the 1970 s harry harris , chief of connecticut s bureau of public transportation , acknowledged that bar car service was likely to change , but would not say much more i get so many faxes and emails about the bar cars , mr harris said many want them improved and expanded and are willing to fight tooth and nail for it many others want them eliminated and curtailed i do not know which group is larger but , he said , i am trying to strike a happy medium he added , i am trying to find a way to create more seating while maintaining the camaraderie and esprit de corps of the bar car to that end , he first considered the amtrak model of including many more tables and chairs but mr harris concluded that that idea was a dud an informal survey , done by my son , found that the bar car riders did not like that idea they wanted to be able to stand and walk and talk though mr harris is short on specifics , he said , i do know that we do n't need a 20foot bar one rider on the new haven line , michael bonbrisco , 45 , of greenwich , said , i would be lost without the bar car but not all metronorth customers want to mix drinks with transit john blackmar of armonk , ny , takes the harlem line , which has no bar car , and that suits him just fine when people buy a beer in grand central and drink it on the train , mr blackmar said , they always spill it and everyone else gets sticky feet i guess a bar car might solve that problem , but i 'd just rather they spend their money fixing their bathrooms so they do n't smell on one recent evening , brian grodin , who was in the bar car on the 7 10 train for port chester , took a look around at the brokers , lawyers and advertising executives who were sipping cocktails from plastic cups and said he took a certain joy in their nightly ritual it is quiet in all the rest of the cars , he said , too quiet if you talk in the other cars , people look at you like you 're crazy here it smells a little bit like a bar , but everyone can talk all they want mr grodin , who works in finance at cowan company in manhattan , also said that he had a steadfast barcar rule no drinking on the train before thursday never mind that he was saying that while sipping a beer on a wednesday evening the troubled stock market , he explained with a laugh , had driven him to make an exception without spilling a drop , mr grodin braced himself against the lurch of the train and went to join a circle of three men he did not know they could soon be heard dissolving into a bout of laughter photos making the most of their ride home , brian grodin and michael nethercott aboard the bar car of the new haven line on the metronorth railroad the

the securities and exchange commission is expanding its investigation of the xerox corporation s accounting practices to include the company s former auditors , kpmg , as well as several people affiliated with xerox and kpmg , according to a person close to the investigation if the commission does sue kpmg it will be only the second time in several decades that it has brought fraud allegations against a major accounting firm xerox said last week that in anticipation of an imminent civil suit over the accounting issues , it had reached a tentative settlement with the sec and would restate its revenue and profit from 1997 to 2000 it agreed to pay a 10 million fine , the largest ever levied by the commission in an accounting fraud case according to the person close to the sec investigation , the agency sent wells calls , which essentially tell people or companies to muster a case why they should not be sued , to michael conway , a kpmg partner who was a lead auditor on the xerox account , and three other kpmg partners five former xerox executives including the former chairman , paul a allaire , and the former chief financial officer , barry d romeril , both of whom retired dec 31 and the former chief executive , g richard thoman , who was ousted in may 2000 have also been asked by the sec to submit arguments why they should not be charged none of the three former executives returned calls seeking comment , and an sec spokesman declined to discuss the matter but george ledwith , a spokesman for kpmg , confirmed that his firm had been talking with the sec staff about the possibility of a proceeding against kpmg , and denied any wrongdoing by the firm the sec has traditionally been reluctant to name accounting firms in enforcement actions but last year it did sue arthur andersen for its audits of waste management at the time , the sec said it was willing to bring such cases against a firm , in addition to individual partners , if it had evidence of involvement of senior management or if the case showed systemic problems mr ledwith said kpmg cannot fathom the basis for any such proceeding against it by the sec we did the right thing with regard to xerox , he said we raised the right questions , took difficult and tough positions with the client we fulfilled our responsibilities a major issue in the sec case against xerox is expected to be its use of an accounting method for recording revenue and profit from multiyear copier leases the sec says that the method that was used violated generally accepted accounting principles , and xerox has agreed to restate its profits from 1997 through 2000 kpmg , however , has made it clear that it still believes that the method is acceptable , although it forced xerox to modify its financial statements after concluding that the method was improperly applied the auditing firm refused to certify immediately the 2000 financial statements , and did so months later only after they were revised xerox has since replaced kpmg with pricewaterhousecoopers in the course of the audit of the 2000 financial statements , we learned new information that raised concerns about the company s tone at the top , about management s motivations in preparing financial statements to obtain certain earnings rather than trying to get it right , mr ledwith said yesterday securities lawyers say the sec s inclusion of former xerox and current kpmg executives , which was reported yesterday in the wall street journal , is very much an outgrowth of the highly publicized cases involving enron , global crossing , tyco and other companies the sec was caught napping on enron , and now its goal has to be deterrence , said gregory j wallance , a partner specializing in financial services litigation at the new york firm of kaye scholer it is now determined to send a message to bluechip companies that they cannot mislead investors the way enron did , and that individuals will be held accountable if they do others say the regulators want to send an even stronger signal to accountants and accounting firms , many of which , they say , have been lulled by the promise of rich auditing assignments and , often , consulting fees into letting clients play fast and loose with numbers the incentives are huge for accountants to let clients do what they want , said stephen p younger , a partner at patterson , belknap , webb tyler in new york and the chairman of the state bar association s securities litigation committee so the sec is saying , 'we 've had enough if books are cooked , the accounting firms have to pay , too' he added , i would n't think the sec would be saying it has enough to bring charges unless it believed that kpmg knew the accounting was improper long before it suggested to xerox that it restate nor do all the former xerox executives garner much sympathy from analysts and investors maybe it s unfair to some of them but it s not unfair to romeril , said james w lundy , a former xerox executive who is now a research director at gartner , a research firm romeril had to know what was going on what all this means for xerox and its share price is unclear the shares closed at 994 yesterday , down just 34 cents the story that affects the stock got told last week , when xerox said it would restate its numbers , said jack l kelly , an analyst with goldman , sachs other analysts say that the restatement causes discomfort about xerox s future numbers going forward , we have to use different assumptions about what qualifies as equipment sales or revenues from financing or services , said benjamin a reitzes , an analyst with ubs warburg and that raises a lot of uncertainty photo paul a allaire , a former chairman of xerox , faces an sec inquiry \(

israel s cable television commission yesterday granted the country s cable providers permission to remove cnn international from their services while none of the three israeli cable companies matav , golden channels and tevel have done so , they have dangled that possibility in months of tough contract negotiations with cnn , a subsidiary of aol time warner the companies say the prices they have traditionally paid cnn , which neither side would disclose , are untenable now that they are facing financial difficulty they recently began to offer their customers cnn s main competitor in the united states , fox news channel , a unit of the news corporation , instead the cable negotiations have taken place against a backdrop of loud complaints about cnn s coverage of the conflict between israel and the palestinians government officials and activists have accused cnn of showing a bias toward the palestinian side \( palestinians have in turn complained that cnn shows a bias in favor of israel \) complaints from israel hit a low note in june , when cnn s founder and former chief , ted turner , was quoted as likening both sides of the conflict to terrorists cnn responded by dispatching top executives to the region to meet with government officials they also met with israeli reporters to restate the network s commitment to balanced coverage an israeli government official said yesterday that the commission s decision had nothing to do with cnn s coverage rather , he said , the government was giving the companies the freedom needed in their commercial dispute with cnn if it is a pure business decision , we should not interfere , the official said cnn s contracts with the companies last through october the network , based in atlanta , said it was confident that it could reach an agreement by then in a statement , cnn said , frankly , it is very hard to imagine that the israeli cable operators , let alone their customers , will be willing to remove such a valuable source of information during this critical time in israel s history a cnn international executive said the network had shown a willingness to cut its prices but reuters quoted ram belinkov , the acting chief executive of golden channels , as saying we gave them a proposal of the maximum we are able to pay if they meet it , we will not take them off but so far it looks like they do n't want to meet it
a single tornado is an event of such terrifying power that anyone who has seen one never forgets the sight or the sound on sunday at least 88 tornadoes touched down along an enormous swath between louisiana and pennsylvania , some of them churning the ground for miles at a time individually , those tornadoes did not belong to the most powerful class of storms but collectively they dismantled the country they covered , leaving behind a trail of suffering , darkness and utter disarray they also left behind the bodies of at least 33 people every time a tornado alights it teaches a brutal lesson in the vagaries of chance everyone knows the stories a house tossed across the road while virtually none of its contents are disturbed , one car demolished while the car parked right next to it remains untouched towns that were destroyed on sunday , like mossy grove , tenn , might have escaped entirely had the tornado taken even a slightly different path but that is how it always is , and sunday s outbreak was a reminder of a basic puzzle while it s possible to predict when tornadoes will occur and the national weather service had predicted that possibility by late saturday night it s impossible to say exactly where they will set down or how they will move once they do that s especially true given the rare confluence of enormous air masses that caused sunday s storm every twister was local , but the meteorological circumstances that brought about the tornadoes were national in scale what remains now for many people across the midsection of the country is trying to gather the contents of their lives tornadoes have a way of leaving behind the perfect metaphor for the suffering they cause to see all your possessions scattered across the landscape and to realize that there is no longer any place to put even the possessions that have n't been irreparably damaged , no place for the victims to call home any longer , that is a measure of the emotional force these terrible storms wield
you cannot be serious by john mcenroe with james kaplan illustrated 342 pp new york g p putnam s sons 2595 while visiting his future fatherinlaw , the actor ryan o'neal , for one of the first times , john mcenroe found himself challenged to a game of racquetball they were supposed to be having dinner , and mcenroe , who had played the sport only a few times before , was wearing bluejeans and had no athletic gear to change into this was not an invitation , however , that could be safely turned down , and soon enough they were on the court o'neal was a good player , and a fitness fanatic on top of it , but mcenroe knew enough about handling a racket to give him a game the problem was that o'neal kept positioning himself directly in front of mcenroe on every shot , leaving mcenroe with a choice either he could smash the ball into o'neal s back , which would mean they 'd play the point over but would risk a confrontation , or he 'd have to lob it over him , leaving o'neal with easy putaways this bit of gamesmanship drove mcenroe nuts , and he lost the match he relates the anecdote here , it seems , merely to show the eccentricities of the bizarre hollywood family he was thrust into when he married o'neal s daughter , tatum but what the former tennis star is not quite able to see , even all these years later , is that right there on the racquetball court mcenroe himself had been mcenroe 'd by resorting to a questionable and disconcerting tactic , o'neal had successfully gotten inside his opponent s head and planted some troubling thoughts there can you do what it takes to win \? do you really want it as bad as i want it \? as athletes' memoirs go , you cannot be serious , written with james kaplan , is a pretty appealing book the prose is readable and engaging , if inartfully colloquial at times and although mcenroe dishes dirt here and there , he mostly tries to be serious , setting out to understand his own behavior and the strange arc of his career this is unexpected and admirable , and though moments of genuine insight come rarely , he does make a good show of giving it his best shot if mcenroe can be said to have made one gift to the culture , it is this he made it cool to be a poor sport it s funny , though when you read over what he actually did back in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s , the indiscretions that earned him the nickname superbrat , it s surprising to see how tame most of it was \( even correcting for the hometeam treatment here \) mcenroe s greatest hothead follies were at wimbledon , where , let s see , he failed to show up at ceremonial functions that champions are expected to attend , screamed at officials when they made calls he did n't agree with , and ready for this \? threw and occasionally kicked his racket yes , the old kicktheracket trick unattractive , but hardly a rare sight at tennis clubs around the world what distinguished mcenroe was less what he did than what he seemed capable of doing when he lost his temper the anger was so black , so intense and so hard to fathom where did it come from \? this was a kid of relative privilege , the product of an unbroken home in queens and a fine manhattan private school though his parents , particularly his father , certainly leaned on their son to succeed , they were not monsters they did not exile young john to some tennis gulag or , like andre agassi s notoriously overbearing father , make him hit 5 , 000 balls a day in fact , mcenroe says he spent his formative years barely thinking or caring about tennis he preferred the camaraderie of team sports like soccer and basketball , but his physical gifts quick feet , incredible handeye coordination made him better suited to tennis , and so he somewhat reluctantly pursued it when he made the wimbledon semifinals in 1977 at the age of 18 , he was probably as close to a natural as there has been in modern sports but from the moment he arrived on the pro circuit , the game itself was edging away from him the players were getting bigger and stronger , they were better conditioned , and new technologically advanced rackets favored power over finesse a 5foot11 guy with skinny arms was not going to last long in this world unless he had something else going for him , and what mcenroe had was his ferocious personality , the ability to dictate the tone and dynamic of every match he played he could wear you down by his early 20 s , mcenroe had worn everybody down and become the best player on the tour his top rival , bjorn borg , retired prematurely , grouchy jimmy connors was fading , and mcenroe routinely whipped the new powergame phenom , ivan lendl until the finals of the french open in 1984 , that is up two sets to none over lendl , mcenroe became distracted by noise coming from a cameraman s headset , blew his cool and went into a legendary choke , dropping three sets in rapidfire succession even now , almost 20 years later , he ca n't explain what happened , and it still gnaws at him in part , he blames the crowd , which , as crowds will do , cheered for the underdog and booed the favorite by this point in his career , he should have been able to block it out , but he could n't when people boo , mcenroe writes , i have a hard time not taking it personally it s one of my biggest problems i feel isolated out there in the first place , but if anyone s against me , i find it incredibly difficult the crowd can be for me 99 percent , but if there are a couple of hecklers , i get bent out of shape
new haven argentines are the object of much mock derision from other latin americans , who laugh at their air of superiority , their pretension , their arrogance jokes abound why do argentines run outdoors when there s lightning \? because they think that god is taking their picture nothing could be more humiliating to an argentine than having to emigrate to , of all places , spain but alas , since the collapse of the argentinian economy , argentines have been flocking there , in hopes of starting anew it is a huge historical irony that would have brought a sardonic smile to the face of that greatest of all argentine ironists , jorge luis borges , who once wrote argentine history can unequivocally be defined as a desire to move away from spain most americans misunderstand the relation we latin americans have to spain , thinking it is like theirs to england in the united states , english things have an aura of sophistication and superiority but through much of latin america , spaniards are viewed less charitably to speak with a spanish accent is considered a real handicap as borges once said spaniards speak louder , with the aplomb of those who know no doubt these are class prejudices , of course , because many of the spaniards who emigrated to latin america in the early 20th century were poor many did not even speak spanish well because they came from galicia or the basque country \( like some of my ancestors , who ended up in cuba \) in argentina , the spaniards and the italians \( who emigrated there in even larger numbers \) were mostly dialectspeaking peasants who did not want their roots known even today most argentines want to be french or english , not italian or spanish , please and latin american only because of unavoidable propinquity the role reversal we are now seeing is so neat it exceeds the crassest fiction around the turn of the 20th century , when the majority of spanish immigrants arrived in buenos aires , argentina s economic boom promised a stable future , while spain , after a humiliating defeat in the spanishamerican war , wallowed in political and financial crisis spain was left out of the circle of european powers whose empires had been built in the 19th century its own , built in the 16th , had collapsed one after another , latin american countries had become independent and forged new alliances with european countries and the united states argentina was prosperous and cultured , with a capital that rivaled european cities and one of the richest literatures in the new world a pilgrimage to buenos aires was de rigueur for spanish writers and intellectuals , like the philosopher jos ortega y gasset and the poet federico garc a lorca spain had none of this , as it turned inward during the franco years that followed the civil war but now spain has emerged as a leading industrial country , enjoying political stability and prosperity it is sophisticated and european , with money to buy back part of its former empire , as it is doing in cuba spain is the secondlargest investor in argentina , following the united states \( my argentine friends have complained to me that their country is turning into another cuba an outrage , after they gave us a rebel with a cause , che guevara an argentine \) spanish investors are now trembling about the magnitude of their potential losses and spaniards at home are having to get used to the new argentine immigration the argentines now returning to spain are very different from their grandparents , many of whom were poor spanish emigrants they are \( or were \) middleclass and educated , and they expect whitecollar work anything below that will certainly bruise their argentine pride but need may force them to be less discerning spaniards , for their part , are going to have to accept these new immigrants in spite of their reputation , as , well , argentines drawing \( lauren redniss \)
san francisco , sept 14 on the roof of an office building near the sprawling presidio park , four satellite dishes scanned the heavens this week for television programming that most americans never knew existed they pulled down transmissions from iraqi state tv , complete with denouncements of the united states and the threats of war by president bush they tapped into syria satellite tv , including a broadcast that likened americans to the terrorists of sept 11 they also found a program on jordan tv that suggested the attack on the pentagon last year was an elaborate plot of western intelligence officials it was not exactly the daily fare of middle east coverage found on cnn , fox news or the big three networks but that was the whole idea we feel we are telling a counternarrative to what americans are bombarded with , said david michaelis , director of current affairs for worldlink tv , a nonprofit satellite channel based here that rebroadcasts news programs , with english voiceover , from the muslim world for satellite tv subscribers in the united states there are no coded messages from the middle east , mr michaelis said it is very much in your face these broadcasters are constantly questioning the supremacy of the united states mr michaelis , a journalist from jerusalem , and his colleague , jamal dajani , a palestinianamerican producer born in the same city , have been scrutinizing the broadcasts of middle east countries since last november they use the material to produce a daily news program for worldlink called mosaic except for the english translations , the programming is left in its original form , with no introductions or analyses from the san francisco staff mr dajani said the handsoff approach was central to mosaic s purpose of providing americans with a different and unfiltered window to the middle east since sept 11 , we have had the story of the victim and the accused , mr dajani said every american is making the link to the middle east , so it is very relevant to see what they are saying there we are looking at the attitudes of roughly 280 million people in 22 countries during this past week , the mosaic program was expanded from its normal halfhour slot to one hour to keep up with the intense news coverage of the sept 11 anniversary and president bush s speech to the united nations still , the images broadcast on mosaic were nothing like those seen on most american channels little attention was given to the formal remembrances at ground zero instead , the programming focused on the fallout considered largely negative of the sept 11 attacks for muslims , including those living in the united states al manar tv in beirut reported about discrimination against arab americans a segment from iraqi state tv criticized american media coverage of the 9 11 commemorations , suggesting that it was intended to create fear and panic though much of the programming would be considered antiamerican , mr dajani and mr michaelis said their representative sample of what is being shown in the middle east invariably included other viewpoints on wednesday and thursday mosaic presented a report from the palestine broadcast company that opened with the words no to terrorism it went on to show interviews with palestinian children who said they felt the pain of americans on sept 11 because of their own encounters with terrorism at home kim spencer , president of link media inc , which operates worldlink tv , said the intention of the programming was not to be antagonistic toward american viewers , but rather to present the middle east as the people living there see it every day on television so far , the satellite station has agreements with 13 broadcasters to use their programming , and there are negotiations under way with 3 others except for an occasional requirement that was easy to meet irib tv in iran made its shows available on the condition that worldlink tv did not broadcast pornography the material comes with no strings attached , mr spencer said in this mix of programming , you see support for americans in middle eastern countries as well , he said we all felt the same way as americans and people about what went on last year we are interested in the root cause and trying to better understand what got us here none of worldlink s programming , including mosaic , is supported by advertising , so mr spencer and his colleagues need not worry about offending commercial sponsors the station is financed by viewers' contributions and grants from a variety of foundations mosaic has been supported by the john s and james l knight foundation and the william and flora hewlett foundation the satellite station is available as public service programming in about 18 million households that receive directv and echostar dish network arrangements are now under way to make a weekly version of mosaic available to public television stations across the country our goal is to get these programs seen , mr spencer said

wanted executive with extensive finance background to take new post with high risks and high rewards at battered but still leading worldwide agency company ownership of high boots and equipment for mucking out stables desirable that s a fitting job description for the new post of chief operating officer at the interpublic group of companies in new york interpublic , the world s secondbiggest agency company , made the surprising announcement wednesday that it would create the post for a new executive , who may be in the job as soon as jan 1 the executive would serve as second in command to john j dooner jr , the chairman and chief executive , and work with sean f orr , the executive vice president and chief financial officer interpublic , which lists among its clients cocacola , general motors , nestl and unilever , has not had a chief operating officer since january 2001 , when mr dooner , then also president , was promoted to succeed his longtime mentor , philip h geier jr , and the post was eliminated this time , though , the job is virtually certain to be filled from outside , with the hiring of an executive from an agency not owned by interpublic the madison avenue rumor mill is already churning out names of potential candidates , but none that could be confirmed yesterday as definitely under consideration the search is to be led by brian j brooks , who begins at interpublic on monday as executive vice president and chief human resources officer , also a new post mr brooks had most recently been chief human resources officer at the wpp group in disclosing the decision to hire a chief operating officer , which had been discussed for a couple of months by mr dooner and members of the board , interpublic gave no reason for creating the post but it could be deduced by anyone who has followed the recent financial bombs tossed by the company , including revenue shortfalls , losses and liabilities at divisions specializing in tasks like sports marketing two increases in charges expected from accounting improprieties and two decreases in expected earnings very succinctly big company , plenty of things to do , look forward to the help , mr dooner said yesterday in a telephone interview it s prudent and right to continue to strengthen the company , he added , and this help will be worthwhile mr dooner said he believed that having a no 2 executive would let me spend time giving more attention and focus to the professional product and clients mr dooner s background as the only top executive of a large agency company with agency experience has helped interpublic agencies land several large assignments even as it struggles to correct its problems at the same time , analysts have complained that mr dooner has no financial credentials , unlike two of his principal competitors , sir martin sorrell at wpp and john d wren at the omnicom group yesterday , a day after interpublic said it would increase the amount of its restatement of earnings over the last five years to 1813 million compared with previous estimates first of 685 million and then of 120 million standard poor s reiterated that it would keep interpublic on its credit watch with negative implications shares of interpublic , which owns agencies like campbellewald , draft worldwide , mccannerickson and mullen , closed yesterday on the new york stock exchange at 1339 , up 81 cents , or 64 percent , after falling in afterhours trading wednesday to as low as 1088 the shares have fallen 547 percent this year essentially , creating the job is a way to placate wall street , but it s also a smart move if it lets john focus more on business and clients , said amy hoover , vice president at talent zoo in atlanta , an executive recruitment company bringing in someone who could keep the i s dotted and t s crossed on the financial side would mean a lot to the organization and investors , she added lauren rich fine , the advertising analyst for merrill lynch , offered a different perspective i'm not sure why you need a chief operating officer for a holding company if you have the right management for the agencies , ms fine said on the other hand , maybe hiring a coo is a way to say it s just not that easy for mr dooner to deal with both the company s internal difficulties and external problems stemming from an uncertain economic outlook , ms fine said it s good to have someone else helping when it s tough to say what is and is n't working , she added only one other giant agency company , the publicis groupe in paris , has a chief operating officer the post there was created just recently as publicis acquired the bcom3 group and named roger haupt , who had been chairman and chief executive at bcom3 , as president and chief operating officer the creation of the post was perceived as a signal by maurice l vy , chairman and chief executive at publicis , to encourage senior bcom3 managers to remain after the acquisition at wpp , based in london , sir martin is chairman and chief executive , without a designated second in command at omnicom , based in new york , the top two posts are divided between bruce crawford , the chairman , and mr wren , the chief executive \( omnicom received a warren buffett seal of approval yesterday when the geico corporation division of his company , berkshire hathaway , reported new stakes in omnicom and two nonadvertising companies \) interpublic ought to break the mold , said catherine st jean , chief operating officer at judy wald partners in new york , an executive search firm specializing in filling creative posts it should hire someone from outside the industry , not only from outside interpublic , because they need balance and really , really fresh blood , she said ipg has always been an old boys' network , ms st jean said , using the stock ticker symbol to refer to interpublic , and there has been too much inbreeding , too much buddybuddy behavior , which leads to too much trust one day you wake up , she added , and the quicksand is not at your ankles it s in your ears wherever executives come from and however the executive suites are organized , no one has come up with a vision for these times , said susan friedman , president at susan friedman ltd in new york , a leading executive recruiter for agencies the business has changed so completely , she added , but there s no overall big plan about how to pull everything together to make this all work well that said , ms friedman described the hiring of a chief operating officer at interpublic as a good idea if it helped mr dooner concentrate on advertising , which he s terrific at and is what he should be doing one incentive for someone to agree to the daunting challenge of joining interpublic in such a highly visible post at so tumultuous a moment in its corporate history is what else \? money the salary for the new no 2 job is expected to range between mr orr s and mr dooner s mr orr s salary last year was 600 , 000 , according to interpublic , and mr dooner s was 125 million
a group representing lawyers who are assigned to handle cases for the poor argued yesterday that low payments for those lawyers' services effectively denies adequate legal representation to the indigent during opening statements in its lawsuit against the city and state , the new york county lawyers' association argued that the hourly rates paid to the lawyers 25 for outofcourt work and 40 for work in court are among the lowest in the country frank s moseley , representing the lawyers' association , told justice lucindo suarez of state supreme court in manhattan that the woefully inadequate compensation rate violates the constitutional rights of indigent children and adults on a daily basis by depriving them of qualified lawyers , who are not willing to work for the current rate the state s lawyer , carolyn cairns olson , said the rates did not violate indigents' right to representation jonathan pines , a lawyer for the city , said that the rate of pay for the lawyers who aid the poor , known as assigned counsel , is an obligation that really should not be borne exclusively by the city of new york the state sets the pay rate for lawyers for the indigent , but the city pays the bills more than a year ago , gov george e pataki promised such lawyers a raise , but his administration backed off that promise late last year , citing budget constraints in may , justice suarez issued a preliminary injunction that more than doubled the hourly rate paid to the assigned counsel he declared that the lawyers should get 90 an hour for work in and out of court , saying that the current rate , which has been in effect for the last 16 years , obstructed the judiciary s ability to function the city immediately appealed the decision in a series of articles last year , the new york times found that representation given to the poor in new york city routinely fell short of the minimum standards recommended by legal experts , in part because of a shortage of qualified private lawyers willing to work for the current rates three witnesses two former judges and the director of the law guardian program , which provides legal representation for children in some cases testified in the nonjury trial yesterday that the lack of lawyers to represent the poor caused serious disruption to the most basic of legal proceedings philip c siegal , a lawyer in private practice who served as a family court judge in brooklyn for 10 years , said progressively throughout my term , there were n't enough lawyers there sometimes there were none he said he remembered , in acts of lastminute desperation , sending clerks or court officers into the courthouse halls looking for any lawyer who would agree to take a case sometimes a lawyer would for an enhanced fee \( judges have the discretion , on a casebycase basis , to raise the rates if they feel that doing so is justified by the amount of work required \)
washington , feb 16 free the kirov ballet after bowing to soviet diktats on artistic policy , the famed russian company from st petersburg is now at the mercy of the ballet masters of the world this past week , as part of its first season in a new 10year commitment to the kennedy center for the performing arts here , the kirov presented its much talked about production of jewels , the threeact plotless work that george balanchine created for the new york city ballet in 1967 alas , the kirov has heeded its balanchinetrained coaches either too well or not enough certainly the performance it presented on thursday night at the kennedy center opera house was , with few exceptions , a study in carefulness to the point of petrification it did not help that the kirov s original principals in diamonds , the last section , were not present very likely , uliana lopatkina and igor zelensky would have made a difference the kirov also had the misfortune to play in the same theater where edward villella s miami city ballet has made jewels its signature piece and a big hit anticipating the dynamism of the miami production , which was part of the balanchine festival at the kennedy center last year , the audience seemed nonplused by the emphasis on cautious dancing there was none of the grand sweep natural to the kirov the city ballet alumni who staged the production have done an admirable job the trick now is to allow the kirov to be itself and yet understand what city ballet knows in its bones that balanchine speaks the kirov language in a new way in emeralds , the first section , balanchine uses the conventions of romantic ballet in suggesting an image of a hero parted from his ideal by a corps of nymphs yet he is abstracting that image and extending it the kirov , incidentally , omits the section that balanchine added to emeralds in 1976 , an extra duet and a septet that ends with three men each sinking poetically to one knee there is also a tilted apron at the rear of the stage , which the city ballet does not use the kirov management says that the balanchine trust , which supervises such stagings , insisted on this slope when it brought in peter harvey , the 1967 designer , to recreate the jewellike d cor that embodies the gems in the ballet s subtitles emeralds , rubies and diamonds more curiously , the kirov dances diamonds against a blue , not a white , backdrop balanchine replaced that d cor with less overwhelming sets by robin wagner jewels needs space for dancing , and the kennedy stage , with the raked addition , made for some cramped quarters there was also less space for the sleeping beauty , which new york saw in 1999 and which was presented in washington for the first time through this weekend the kirov is scheduled to present jewels \( july 1820 \) when it appears at lincoln center festival 2002 that it will have to pull its socks up in this production is obvious technique is not to be taken for granted sofia gumerova , who seemed so well suited to balanchine in 1999 , did not hold the arabesques or give full shape to her pli s in a wellknown exit during rubies perhaps the company had an off night or perhaps with new casting , a delicate production has eroded more likely , the question is of mindset , of adjusting to balanchine s 20thcentury view of a classical dance idiom that a company like the kirov identifies with 19thcentury works yet the kirov once led the way in modernizing ballet technique through the teachings of its own agrippina vaganova if the dancers in jewels plunged into movement the way natalya sologub , a marvelous new aurora , did in sleeping beauty today , it would find the freedom to dance jewels as it should in its own distinctive way without betraying balanchine s 20thcentury perspective on a 400yearold dance vocabulary in jewels the dancers held back balanchine s ballet has some relationship to the attributes of the gems in the subtitles , but essentially he has responded to three kinds of composers faur s seagreen flow needs a mystery that veronika part and denis firsov have yet to capture in a poetic walking duet viktor baranov is an eager partner to zhanna ayupova , who was exquisite as always but more subdued than sparkling in violette verdy s original role diana vishneva was at her dazzling best , taking naturally to the stretches and quirks of the pinup role in the stravinsky rubies section vyacheslav samodurov , now a guest with his old company , was her energetic partner , somewhat overemphatic but true to mr villella s spirit in the role both had to contend with the kennedy center orchestra conducted by the kirov s boris gruzin , which was often at odds with the dancers in diamonds , balanchine pays tribute to tchaikovsky and the kirov ballet , his alma mater his model here is more lev ivanov than marius petipa , although both choreographed swan lake as the ballerina and her cavalier , daria pavlenko and danila korsuntsev failed to take the risks that city ballet pours into this section but like the corps , they understood this homage to their own tradition photo diana vishneva and vyacheslav samodurov perform the rubies section of

even charming is too weighty a word to describe the wispy appeal of amour , the twinkling trinket of a musical from the french pop composer michel legrand , which opened last night at the music box theater certainly none of the vigorous language usually trotted out for songfilled broadway diversions romp , frolic and \( heaven forbid \) blast applies to a gallic slice of whimsy that seems shaped less to stimulate than to soothe staged with artful gentleness by james lapine , amour is a bedtime story for grownups weighing in at a slender 90 minutes , it is especially suited to grownups who like to see lights out before 11 under the less broadwayfriendly title of le passemuraille \( the passerthroughwalls \) , amour became a sleeper hit in paris , where it was celebrated by critics for being so , well , so very french it is easy to see how the show would have enchanted a people whose sartorial and intellectual wardrobes tend to be made up of neatly coordinated classics after all le passemuraille is a 1941 short story \( by marcel aym \) that has assumed urban legend status its plot , in which a timid clerk becomes a robin hoodlike folk hero , suggests a declawed variation on the french worship of picturesque criminals like lacenaire and its sungthrough score was written by no less pervasive a cultural force than mr legrand , who composed the songs for the adored confectionery movie musicals the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort the creators of amour , which has been adapted into english by jeremy sams \( best known here as a director \) , have clearly done their best to retain the show s ineffable and willfully musty french flavor but americans for whom french means crimes passionels and sinfully rich desserts may be disappointed by the production s exceedingly mild taste at the show s center is dusoleil \( malcolm gets \) , an insignificant fellow who , in a couplet typical of mr sams s dr seusslike translation of didier van cauwelaert s libretto , says of himself , i do n't deserve your attention i'm hardly worthy of mention one fatal night this socially invisible man discovers that he can walk through walls this allows him to terrorize his nasty new boss \( bill nolte \) give bread , money and jewels to the deserving bourgeoisie and win over the beauteous isabelle \( melissa errico \) , the prisoner of an unhappy marriage to an evil , javertesque prosecutor \( lewis cleale \) all this takes place against an eyeteasing , monochromatic cityscape of montmartre the set , by scott pask , also pays homage to the clouddotted blue skies and trompel'oeil perspectives of magritte the surrealist motif is nicely carried out in dona granata s costumes and the characteristically firstrate lighting by jules fisher and peggy eisenhauer there is nary a trace , however , of the subliminal menace and disorientation of magritte s paintings despite its conferring of a supernatural talent upon its hero , amour has as its stock in trade a reassuring predictability , not unsettling surprises the music brings to mind less the swirling cinematic rhapsodies for which mr legrand is best known in the united states \( like the windmills of your mind from the thomas crown affair \) than elevatormusic settings of the fairytale fantasies of offenbach there is a hypnotic , tinkling air to the melodies that matches the one foot in front of the other rhymes of the lyrics , which occasionally make room for commonplace obscenities and naughty references to \( oohlala \) specific sex acts the supporting cast of characters is an assemblage of stock figures so predictable that had an american devised them he would have been accused of rank stereotyping the prostitute \( nora mae lyng \) , the beretwearing painter \( norm lewis \) , the perky newsboy \( christopher fitzgerald \) , the passionate bespectacled virgin \( sarah litzsinger \) and the alcoholic doctor \( john cunningham \) these alltoofamiliar types interact in shenanigans that mix traces of the formal style of jacques tati with the more mawkish sentimentality of charlie chaplin combined with the metronomic persistence of the rhymed libretto and the lowboil bubbliness of the music , this sensibility can start to feel claustrophobically fey mercifully , however , the ensemble members are all excellent , of clear and characterful voice , and mr lapine and his surehanded choreographer , jane comfort , have steered them from the dangers of overselling cuteness and ms errico s chinadoll prettiness and shimmering soprano has not been put to such tasty use since her appearance in the encores production of one touch of venus as befits a man who can walk through walls , it is mr gets s dusoleil who goes furthest in breaking through the show s prevailing air of existing in two dimensions like an animated cartoon recently seen holding his own with the great barbara cook in her mostly sondheim concerts , he here manages to bring flickers of engaging wildness to dusoleil s mild persona his performance conjures , as it should , the idea of an bereveryman but mr gets injects this archetype with deftly shaded idiosyncrasies that never disrupt the show s carefully sustained tone you feel that should this fellow really be confined inside a wall or , more to the point , a french postcard something vitally and originally human would be lost the same cannot really be said of amour as a whole amour music by michel legrand french libretto by didier van cauwelaert adapted from le passemuraille by marcel aym english adaptation by jeremy sams

setting out potential lines of attack to use against president bush in the 2004 election , a parade of prospective democratic presidential candidates yesterday assailed mr bush s handling of the economy , accusing him of squandering a thriving economy left for him by president bill clinton to pursue policies that benefited wealthy americans one potential candidate , senator john kerry of massachusetts , also explicitly attacked mr bush s handling of the war in afghanistan , saying that his policies had allowed members of al qaeda to escape the democratic presidential contenders for 2004 along with senator hillary rodham clinton of new york , who drew a more enthusiastic reception than any of the others with a hardhitting 45minute keynote speech appeared at a meeting in new york of the democratic leadership council , an influential group of moderate democrats whose founders include mr clinton the prospective candidates mocked efforts by mr bush and republican leaders to blame mr clinton for the corporate abuses that have recently emerged , denounced mr bush s successful push for tax cuts as fiscally irresponsible and invoked the clinton era as a far more prosperous and settled time for the nation than today the breadth and intensity of the attacks suggested that the political climate had changed in the months since the attack on the world trade center , and a growing sense among democrats that mr bush was , notwithstanding his high favorability rating , viewed as vulnerable for a number of his policies in the months since dec 2 , the day enron declared bankruptcy , the president has shown little or none of the moral clarity and strength of purpose he demonstrated in the aftermath of sept 11 , said senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut in fact , when it comes to the economy and the current crisis in confidence , the president and his republican friends in congress have responded with timidity instead of toughness , with obsolete ideas and outdated ideologies and with special favors for special interests the one democrat notably missing was al gore , a founder of the council mr gore said he was unable to attend because of a scheduling conflict today , for the second day in a row , mr gore was criticized by leaders of the group , including al from , its executive director , for framing his presidential campaign in 2000 as a fight against special interests mr from and other democrats said that appeal ran counter to the group s effort over the past 15 years to erase the image of their party as antibusiness for the most part , the thrust of the remarks by the potential candidates and other leaders of the council focused on what democrats viewed as mr bush s most vulnerable points his handling of the economy and corporate abuses senator tom daschle of south dakota , the majority leader , dismissed assurances from the administration that the economy and the stock market were under control clearly everything is not under control , he said the economy is in trouble and there is no economic leadership coming from the white house today mr kerry said in the span of a year this administration has literally taken a budget that was in surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see and they have done so with an irresponsible and an unfairly structured tax cut the event offered most though not all of the potential democratic candidates for 2004 \( and for 2008 , if one accepts the view of many democrats following mrs clinton s career these days \) an opportunity to display their political skills to an influential audience , while testing out themes that they might want to use in the campaign ahead mr kerry challenged the idea that democrats were the party of domestic policy , as he offered a long attack on mr bush s foreign policy , including his decisions in the war in afghanistan he said mr bush , when given the opportunity to destroy al qaeda in the mountains tora bora , should not have turned the task over to afghan warlords , thus allowing many members of the terrorist network to escape ari fleischer , the white house press secretary , brushed off the attacks and noted that the very policy that democrats were attacking here , mr bush s tax cut , had enjoyed significant democratic support when it passed congress the closer it gets to the election , the more the democrats will be tugged to the left and the more divisive they 'll become , mr fleischer said for all the presence here of potential democratic candidates for president , it was a senator , though not an ordinary one , whose speech drew the best response of the day mrs clinton , to cheers and applause , said that mr bush was engaged in the blame game , and to much laughter belittled white house efforts to discredit the nation s economic performance in the 1990 s some have called that record a binge , she said young people able to afford college , and they call that a binge \? millions climbing out of welfare and into new jobs and that s some kind of a binge \? i'm reminded of what abraham lincoln said when his commanders complained about ulysses s grant s binges find out , he said , what kind of whiskey grant drinks , because i want to send a barrel to each of my generals , she said photo senator evan bayh , right , the democratic leadership council chairman , greeting tom daschle , the senate majority leader , in new york \( associated press \)
miami , march 25 after having his death sentence overturned , a british multimillionaire was once again before a jury today with his life at stake the multimillionaire , krishna maharaj , heard a member of the british parliament , a former professional wrestler and others testify by satellite on his behalf mr maharaj was convicted in 1987 and sentenced to death for the slayings the previous year of two jamaican businessmen in a case that prompted british death penalty opponents to speak out against executions in the united states mr maharaj s case became a cause c l bre in britain , where there is no death penalty mr maharaj , a trinidadborn british national who imported food from the west indies to britain and owned a stable of thoroughbred horses , has been on death row since he was convicted of the 1986 shooting death of two jamaican business rivals florida courts have upheld his murder conviction but overturned his death sentence four years ago largely because of irregularities involving his trial judge the hearing that was held today began last thursday before judge jerard bagley of miamidade circuit court as a jury tries to determine whether mr maharaj should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison in an effort to save his life , defense witnesses took the stand today and argued that mr maharaj was a respected british citizen whose life should be spared he is a remarkable person , said peter bottomley , a member of britain s house of commons he became acquainted with mr maharaj during prison visits and through written correspondence after he was already on death row mr bottomley testified by satellite from a lawyer s office in london it is not possible to spend as much time with him as i have and not personally assess him i respect him , and i'm pleased to be associated with him , said mr bottomley adding to the spectacle of the hearing , a former professional wrestler in england also testified by satellite that mr maharaj , who is in his early 60 s , was a wellregarded businessman and philanthropist i met him at a charity event , said the former wrestler , mick mcmanus he was a very generous man he had a very good business and helped every opportunity he got prosecutors have argued that the evidence against mr maharaj was overwhelming that he shot and killed two former business associates , derrick and duane moo young , in the penthouse of a miami hotel more than a decade ago mr maharaj s lawyers maintain that their client was having lunch in fort lauderdale at the time of the crime and was not guilty of the murders for which he was convicted because the hearing now under way is solely to determine the sentence , the defense team is limited on what it can ask witnesses and argue on mr maharaj s behalf judge bagley , who overturned mr maharaj s death sentence in october 1997 but not the trial verdict , admonished witnesses not to address mr maharaj s guilt or innocence , but to testify only to his character we are not here to litigate the case , judge bagley said the defendant has been found guilty this is only to determine sentencing none of you can offer any opinion on guilt or innocence nor can you offer any of your own opinions on the death penalty one witness , a horse trainer from britain , described mr maharaj as successful and fair in his business dealings he was a good man and wellrespected in the business because of the way he treated people , said the trainer , clive brittian the question now is whether mr maharaj s image as described by his fellow british citizens or the evidence that initially convinced the jury that he was a coldblooded killer will prevail after closing arguments , expected tomorrow , the 12member jury will decide if mr maharaj should die or spend the rest of his life in prison photo krishna maharaj , who has been on florida s death row since 1986 \( associated press \)
architecture tells a story , renzo piano says this is a classical idea but the genre of storytelling was literary before it was visual , oral before it was literary the story was always spatial , however in its antique origins , the story was about the land with the greeks , architecture narrates the history of the sacred site it occupies with the romans , the building becomes the sacred site it is autobiographical , selfreflexive , postmodern it narrates itself renzo piano s new design for additions to the morgan library is two stories , recounted simultaneously one is about burial , the other about excavation or , put together , death and reincarnation , a sequence as fundamental to paganism as it is to christianity the morgan library s collection of rare books and illuminated manuscripts is unsurpassed in the united states metaphorically , at least , it is a sacred site , certainly for those who believe in the transcendent value of words piano s design excavates the cultural history of narrative even as it inters the morgan s collection the library s spiritual heart within the ground piano s design completes the consolidation of the morgan s murray hill campus , situated on the western half of the block between 36th and 37th streets along madison avenue it will replace three structures completed between 1962 and 1991 roughly half the 75 million project is to be underground this will allow the design s visible portions to be lower than the rooflines of the library s existing buildings beneath grade , piano proposes to cut into the bedrock of manhattan schist on which the library sits into this cavity he will insert a fourstory subterranean vault , containing stacks these lead off from an atrium lined with metal stairs a 250seat auditorium , site of the spoken word , is also located here the space is piranesian , borgesian , even pythian if the stacks could speak , the tone would be that of oracular utterance here are all the answers to all but one of the riddles ever asked the arrangement reverses dominique perrault s design for the biblioth que nationale in paris , whose damp riverbank location mitigated against underground storage there , books are conspicuously housed in a quartet of bookshaped towers piano s vault , though invisible , nonetheless exerts symbolic presence all unread books are buried treasure knowledge is to be found not only in data from the world but also in the connections between images and ideas that occur in the mind , with and without our conscious awareness access is democratic and selfselecting the inner compulsion to learn is the opposite of an elitist proposition the design above ground is infill architecture a set of three new pavilions , facing into a glassroofed courtyard , that will be inserted between three of the existing buildings the jp morgan house , the original library building and its subsequent annex since these structures differ in style , materials and relationship to the street , their context is one of contrast , scale and sequence it is a context of time as well as space , in other words , one of adding to rather than fitting in with piano s design responds straightforwardly to this context it adheres to the scale of the existing structures but departs from them in form , materials and proportions the palette is glass and painted steel , the color as yet undecided the forms are stark but not brutal for example , the steel panels of the main facades sit flat on the ground toc ! piano , interjects , as his arms describe how the panels set down but the panels are recessed within frames and grooved at the edges , to evoke the image of moldings stair towers are faced with glass , and the airy spring of the metal stairs again reveals piano as architecture s great poet of circulation the courtyard , however , is the focal point of the design s circulation system it replaces the inelegant garden court designed by voorsanger and mills and completed in 1990 but the architects of that addition were constrained by its relatively unambitious scope with an overall plan that radiates from the center of the site to the three streets bordering it , the new courtyard will be integrated more organically into the new complex the courtyard s glass roof is a refined version of the 19thcentury engineering projects that inspired many architects in the early years of the 20th it is the heart of the story as well as the morgan campus morgan , of course , was an industrialist as well as a financier he and his fellow tycoons made fortunes in steel , railroads , shipping and oil piano s design transforms the steel and glass industrial vernacular into a classical idiom more properly , it reveals the formal affinities that modern architects saw between the architecture of antiquity and industrial engineering like the old pennsylvania station , the design achieves its most eloquent effects in the interplay between revealing and concealing its steel age structure la storia in italian , history and a story are the same word
minutes after the south tower collapsed at the world trade center , police helicopters hovered near the remaining tower to check its condition about 15 floors down from the top , it looks like it s glowing red , the pilot of one helicopter , aviation 14 , radioed at 10 07 am it s inevitable seconds later , another pilot reported i do n't think this has too much longer to go i would evacuate all people within the area of that second building those clear warnings , captured on police radio tapes , were transmitted 21 minutes before the building fell , and officials say they were relayed to police officers , most of whom managed to escape yet most firefighters never heard those warnings , or earlier orders to get out their radio system failed frequently that morning even if the radio network had been reliable , it was not linked to the police system and the police and fire commanders guiding the rescue efforts did not talk to one another during the crisis cut off from critical information , at least 121 firefighters , most in striking distance of safety , died when the north tower fell , an analysis by the new york times has found faced with devastating attacks , the city s emergency personnel formed an indelible canvas of sacrifice , man by man and woman by woman they helped rescue thousands they saved lives they risked their own from the first moments to the last , however , their efforts were plagued by failures of communication , command and control now , after months of grief , both the fire and police departments are approaching the end of delicate internal reviews of their responses to the attack those reviews have concluded that major changes are needed in how the agencies go about their work and prepare for the next disaster , senior officials say a sixmonth examination by the times found that the rescuers' ability to save themselves and others was hobbled by technical difficulties , a history of tribal feuding and management lapses that have been part of the emergency response culture in new york city and other regions for years when the firefighters needed to communicate , their radio system failed , just as it had in those same buildings eight years earlier , during the response to the 1993 bombing at the trade center no other agency lost communications on sept 11 as broadly , or to such devastating effect , as the fire department throughout the crisis , the two largest emergency departments , police and fire , barely spoke to coordinate strategy or to share intelligence about building conditions during those final minutes , most firefighters inside the north tower did not know the other building had crumbled , and how urgent it was for them to get out instead , dozens of firefighters were catching their breath on the 19th floor of the tower , witnesses say others were awaiting orders in the lobby still others were evacuating the disabled and the frightened to this day , the fire department cannot say just how many firefighters were sent into the towers , and where they died it lost track of them , in part because some companies did not check in with chiefs individual firefighters jumped on overcrowded trucks , against policy others , ordered off the fire trucks , grabbed rides in cars the city s intricate network of safety coverage showed signs of unraveling that morning because of the headlong rush to lower manhattan police officers left their posts , senior police officials said a chief with the emergency medical service said they had no ambulances for more than 400 calls the region s bridges , tunnels , and ports were drained of protection , said the chief of the port authority police although mayor rudolph w giuliani created the office of emergency management in 1996 and spent nearly 25 million to coordinate emergency response , trade center officials said the agency had not conducted an emergency exercise there that included the fire department , the police and the port authority s emergency staff the fire department began its first selfexamination in december , when nearly 50 senior fire officials took part in a twoday planning exercise with the united states naval war college the college evaluators concluded as a function of command and control , it was evident that the fire department has no formal system to evaluate problems or develop plans for multiple complex events it was equally evident that the fire department has conducted very little formal planning at the operational level thomas von essen , the city s fire commissioner from 1996 through 2001 , and a former president of the main fire union , said he agreed with that analysis , which was undertaken to explore the ability to respond to major disasters the fire commissioner has limited authority to hold senior chiefs accountable , mr von essen said , because nearly all enjoy civil service protection the pain is still there and it 'll be there forever , mr von essen said but you have to start thinking about the reality of the world that we live in today and that demands better leadership , more accountable leadership , a bettertrained leadership , a more disciplined leadership that then filters down to a bettertrained and more disciplined set of troops
after the series of embarrassing revelations about conflicts of interest among stock analysts , critics say the time has arrived for wall street to do something it is loath to do consider making some radical changes in the way it conducts its business the critics of major investment banks are calling for a clean break between those who underwrite new stocks and those who advise investors about buying them moving securities firms out of the stockpicking business was unthinkable just a few months ago though it still sounds like heresy to many , some current and former executives of big banks are discussing the idea as a solution in the extreme case to wall street s thorniest problem none of the changes proposed by the firms to insulate analysts from the influences of their banking colleagues is more than a cosmetic improvement , the critics say at the very least , they say , the banks must take steps toward treating analysts as professionals whose first obligation is to help investors make objective decisions citigroup , which has been urgently trying to end investigations into favors the firm s analysts and bankers may have done for corporate clients , has proposed putting its analysts into a separate division of the company but that structural shift alone would not remove the inherent conflict of interest between the corporations that hire citigroup to sell their stock and bonds , and the individual investors the firm advises to buy them as long as the investment bankers would have to cover the costs of the analysts' research and of their bosses' bonuses , they would wield the power because that power imbalance is intractable , peter j solomon says , the big banks should , and probably will , leave the rating of most stocks to somebody else an incremental approach will not work , said mr solomon , a former vice chairman of lehman brothers who runs an independent advisory firm incrementalism is what got these firms into trouble , he said , referring to the gradual adoption of analysts as support staff for investment bankers between the securities and exchange commission , state attorneys general and the stock exchanges , regulators are creating so many rules to govern the conduct of analysts that bank executives fear their employees will inevitably violate them , mr solomon said that risk , coupled with the huge costs of keeping a full complement of highly paid analysts to produce research with few buyers , is likely to move citigroup s chairman , sanford i weill , and other bank executives toward an overhaul of their research operations , he said sandy weill is the guy who taught me in the mid80 s that research is a loss leader , mr solomon said he said mr weill advised that research has no value except , of course , to get banking fees a citigroup spokeswoman , leah johnson , declined to comment investment banks could save billions of dollars annually by ceding much of the burden of putting buy or sell ratings on stocks to an independent company similar to moody s investors service or standard poor s those two companies are among several whose ratings of corporate bonds are considered authoritative but they charge corporations for their ratings , and it is unlikely that thousands of public companies would start paying to have their stocks rated morningstar , the chicago company that rates mutual funds and has begun publishing stock research , might be a better model the big securities firms would probably have to subsidize such a venture , at least for awhile , and they would supplement its research with economic and market analysis of their own , mr solomon said big banking companies like citigroup should take the lead on such a move , he said , because stock research is less integral to their overall business than to smaller firms like merrill lynch that are more dependent on individual investors merrill officials adamantly refused to consider spinning off the firm s research department when they were negotiating a 100 million settlement with eliot spitzer , the attorney general of new york state , in the spring in april , mr spitzer released dozens of email messages written by henry blodget and other merrill analysts that included bleak assessments of companies they were recommending to investors to end mr spitzer s investigation , merrill agreed to make several changes to how it managed and paid its analysts but like its main competitors , merrill still expects its analysts to help the firm decide which companies to underwrite and to help sell their stock research directors at other big investment banks insist that they must employ analysts to vet prospective clients because without the support of the analysts , their stock offerings would be doomed firms like merrill , morgan stanley and goldman , sachs would never agree to any drastic change on their own , said jack rivkin , director of research at neuberger berman , a large money management company none of the major firms can afford to separate their expertise from the capitalraising process unless the other big firms do it as well , said mr rivkin , who is a former research director at smith barney in addition , he said , firms that cater to individual investors need material to serve as the basis for their investment recommendations i'm not an apologist for what has happened here , mr rivkin said he attributed much of the disintegration of research standards to a failure of management research has to operate as the conscience of the organization , he said they have individual investors making decisions based on what they say with all of the excesses of the 90 s , that discipline went by the wayside reviving respect for honest , independent research is the best way out of the mess wall street has created , said gary vineberg , an independent analyst who is highly critical of how research has been coopted at the big banks still , mr vineberg does not favor a full spinoff most investors are not accustomed to paying cash for investment ideas , and brokerage firms could not justify their high commissions or costs without proprietary recommendations , he said if merrill does n't have research , it becomes schwab with much higher prices , said mr vineberg , who worked at merrill for several years even schwab has spent a lot of money to provide its own stock ratings to customers , though it uses a set of quantitative measures and has no banking business to create conflicts before we talk about breaking research away from everything else , we should try a setup where research actually has independence , mr vineberg said wall street needs to develop professional standards for analysts like the legal profession has , like the medical profession has , where people are indoctrinated with a sense of responsibility , he said i have n't seen any real attempt to do that to get there , he said , would require a clean sweep of senior management of the firms even then , he said , it would involve such a stark change in the mindset of investment bankers and their bosses that it might prove impractical it s about a cultural change , mr vineberg said

oakland , calif if jon gruden accepted all of the bad vibes and criticism that have followed his team during its free fall a sparkling 82 season that has turned into losses in four of its last six games , including three straight defeats then his raiders might as well disappear even before their playoff game against the jets tomorrow there is an unmistakable feeling that the sky is falling on raider nation squabbles minor and major have occurred between gruden and his quarterback , rich gannon , and between gannon and some of his teammates , notably receiver tim brown the rumors that gruden was thinking about leaving for notre dame or florida have been a distraction defensive tackle darrell russell has been suspended for violating the league s substanceabuse policy kicker sebastian janikowski missed last week s regularseason finale here against the jets because of a mysterious foot ailment running back charlie garner is questionable for tomorrow s rematch because of a foot injury cornerback charles woodson has been hampered all season long because of a toe injury the offense lately keeps misfiring in crucial moments , the defense has been suspect against the run and special teams have floundered on and on it goes and the ugly residue keeps falling squarely into gruden s lap we won the afc west division championship for the second straight year and we are the only team that repeated as divisional champs from last season , gruden said of his 106 club i'm not going to lose sight of that we 've played well enough to win in the last three weeks , but we 've been hurt by big plays the players have to play better the coaches have to coach better it was very easy for all of us when the going was good early in the season now that we 've had our share of adversity , it s the playoffs and we 've got a good team that is going to compete hard for 60 minutes there are only 12 teams left playing in this league after sunday , there will be only 8 we want to be one of them can the raiders rise from their funk \? not without gruden tugging the right strings after two 88 seasons and a 124 record last season that ended a game shy of the super bowl , this is a defining moment in gruden s career against the jets , he will be playing part psychiatrist and part football coach with that permanent scowl on the sideline and gruff intensity to match it , gruden in the last three seasons made his mark as a young \( 38 \) , dynamic and popular coach now comes the test of pulling his team out of a malaise and boosting its confidence it is easy to see with him that the recent losing has worn on him and he can easily see how it has worn on his players now for gruden comes the essence of coaching getting his players to relax and let their abilities shine it is apparent when you talk with some of the raiders that they are hitting that curve with gruden where the speeches sound the same , where the mantra does not have that fresh , resounding ring how does he fix that \? i'm a real shallow guy , and i think in a situation like this you just line up and play , gruden said and all of the great athletes i 've been around do n't worry about how we could have done this or that we are going to get another shot , starting with the jets i do n't see a lot of long faces over that it has been well documented about some of the spats that have gone on with this team , but we have emotional players and i like that i have n't put up the noyelling sign yet and that is for good reason in none of the raiders' last five losses have they been beaten by more than a touchdown in fact , two of the losses were by 3 points and one was by 2 points what has happened to the raiders happens to several teams when they lose a string of close games doubt creeps in the locker room becomes antsy players begin to press some begin looking outside for answers instead of inside first gruden plans to attack the jets with his aggressiveness look for the raiders to come out swinging from the first whistle tomorrow gruden s goal is to play the game fast and then faster do not be surprised if the raiders whose longest completion this season was for 49 yards throw more deep balls do not be surprised if they employ more daring blitz schemes to get to vinny testaverde also , do not be surprised if none of it works and the raiders implode gruden is a smart guy with dennis green free from minnesota and with green s longterm , warm relationship with the raiders' managing general partner , al davis , a topic of conversation here , gruden knows that he needs to build on his strong coaching start to cement his place here or keep his marketability alive he has one more season left on his contract his focus , however , is the jets and winning this game the raiders need it he needs it the great beauty in this sport , gruden said , is in the end you get what you deserve photo coach jon gruden , who has not always seen eye to eye with rich gannon , must rally the raiders \( associated press \)
the laughter stops , at least for a moment , with the first embrace it s been more than five years since amanda and elyot have been cheek to cheek , and the occasion is honored with a silence that roars like the ocean lest you doubt this is serious stuff , check out the expression on her face , seen over his shoulder it s a look of rapture , resignation and abject terror as he will say later , none too happily , we 're in love all right the play is private lives , and the subject although you may have forgotten this is sex or as amanda describes it , our chemical what d'you call 'ems since amanda is played by the ravishing lindsay duncan and she is speaking to the equally ravishing alan rickman , no further definition is required in howard davies s scintillating new revival of no l coward s bestknown work , which opened last night at the richard rodgers theater , the erotic bloom is restored to one of the funniest comedies of the 20th century although long dismissed as a stylish arrangement of smart surfaces , the implicit carnality in private lives stirred shivers among the censors of the lord chamberlain s office when it was presented for vetting in 1930 an immoral play was the verdict of one lord cromer , who took especial offense at the amorous business of act ii , which he felt went very far and required caution in the staging mr rickman and ms duncan , it should be noted , make you fully appreciate the old boy s alarm but reviewers , that jaded breed , raised nary an eyebrow when the play first opened in the west end and on broadway , starring coward and gertrude lawrence what critical objections there were centered on the play s perceived superficiality coward , wrote brooks atkinson in the new york times , has nothing to say , and manages to say it with competent agility for three acts the playwright himself dismissed it as the lightest of light comedies and most revivals often laughmilking showcases for aging glamour girls \( tallullah bankhead , elizabeth taylor , joan collins \) seemed to confirm that opinion but from the earliest performances of private lives , others sensed a graver , more solid center beneath the froth no less an admirer than t e lawrence , who as lawrence of arabia knew a thing or two about conflicted passions , pronounced it a work with bones and muscles generously add flesh and blood to that description and you have mr davies s recipe for his vibrant interpretation of the play , which has only deepened since i saw it in london several months ago the production , rest assured , does n't scant on the expected cosmopolitan pleasures of private lives , which portrays the combustible reunion of the longdivorced amanda and elyot when they run into each other on their respective honeymoons with victor \( adam godley \) and sybil \( emma fielding \) tim hatley s exquisitely mannered sets , combining deco geometry and sybaritic luxury , should instantly dispel any worries that this is one of those dreary deconstructions that drain the joy from a familiar frolic ditto jenny beavan s costumes , which as worn with disarming ease by ms duncan and mr rickman suggest that black tie and slouchy pajamas are interchangeable as evening wear nor do any of the five ensemble members deftly balanced out by alex belcourt as a casually contemptuous french maid shortchange theatergoers who expect a full ticket s worth of rib tickling the epigrams crackle or scathe , as called for the comic pauses are as precise as greenwich mean time , and when knockabout farce is demanded , the performers deliver it like a team of acrobatic clowns outfitted by savile row nonetheless i was entirely sympathetic when at intermission i heard a woman ask her companion , is it all right for me to cry at no l coward \? because this production finds the pathos in the idea of a couple who both love and despise each other with such finely matched ferocity \( so do the novels of thomas hardy , but they 're less fun \) apart they are n't fully alive together they create the sort of damage that would make them an insurance underwriter s nightmare what makes this private lives pulse so convincingly is that you never doubt that amanda and elyot are , for better and worse , kindred souls they are first glimpsed apart on adjacent balconies of a hotel in the south of france with their respective younger new spouses elyot has just married sybil , a sweet , stubborn little matron in the making amanda is now partnered with the tweedy , gangly and virile victor despite some cooing and cuddling , the conversation does n't flow easily for either set of honeymooners the sardonic playfulness that is the first language of both amanda and elyot might as well be albanian to victor and sibyl nor can the younger newlyweds begin to appreciate amanda and elyot s shared conviction that flippancy is a necessity because life is far too serious to be taken seriously never mind that when amanda and elyot become aware of each other s presence they are n't at all pleased to see each other the very rhythms of the evening alter
washington in pro football , an adept offensive lineman tricks his opponent in what is called a misdirection play he blocks his man toward the center as the defender pushes back hard , the misdirecting lineman gives way , seemingly overcome by the countercharge as his running back scoots through the hole near the center left by the defender a misdirection play is under way in the cia s allout attempt to discredit an account of a suspicious meeting in prague a year ago mohamed atta , destined to be the leading sept 11 suicide hijacker , was reported last fall by czech intelligence to have met at least once with saddam hussein s espionage chief in the iraqi embassy ahmed alani , a spymaster whom the czechs were keeping under tight surveillance if the report proves accurate , a connection would exist between al qaeda s murder of 3 , 000 americans and iraq s saddam that would clearly be a casus belli , calling for our immediate military response , separate from the need to stop a demonstrated mass killer from acquiring nuclear and germ weapons accordingly , high cia and justice officials worried about exposure of the agency s inability to conduct covert operations desperately want atta s saddam connection to be disbelieved they are telling favored journalists shoot this troublesome story down in march , a washington post columnist obliged with hard intelligence to support the baghdadbin laden connection is somewhere between slim' and 'none' in april , newsweek headlined a spy story tying saddam to 911 is looking very flimsy , and its michael isikoff wrote the much touted 'prague connection' appears to be an intriguing , but embarrassing , mistake everybody jumped aboard the cia bandwagon the washington post s walter pincus followed up with a senior administration official s finding that eliminates a oncesuggested link between the terrorist attacks and the government of president saddam hussein time magazine this week labels the czech report about atta discredited the ciajustice misdirection is masterly even white house staff members have bought the tenetchertoff line about serious doubts the new york times reported all too accurately that a senior bush administration official appeared to close the matter , saying fbi and cia analysts had firmly concluded that no meeting had occurred notice how this parade of poohpoohing never has an official s name attached to it rarely do you see such skillful manipulation by anonymous sources whose policy agenda is never revealed to readers i carry around a clipping of atta s movements reported in the times of oct 26 , 2001 , attributed to federal law enforcement officials on april 2 he was in virginia beach he flew to the czech republic on april 8 by april 11 , mr atta was back in florida , renting a car unreported \( except on www edwardjayepstein com , the web site of my unfazed angletonian friend \) is this week s response to the hidden policydriven doubters by the czech interior minister , stanislav gross i believe the counterintelligence services more than journalists did his agents have new information that would cast doubt on the atta meeting they reported with saddam s paymaster and controller of agents in prague \? he checked with jeri ruzek , his intelligence chief the answer was they did not therefore , i consider the matter closed whom do you believe a responsible official on the scene speaking on the record , with no ax to grind , or us spooks who may be covering up a missed signal from prague about sept 11 and are also fearful of revealing their weakness in iraq \? hardliners can play this background game , too a senior bush administration official not in the protectsaddam cabal tells me you cannot say the czech report about a meeting in 2001 between atta and the iraqi is discredited or disproven in any way the czechs stand by it and we 're still in the process of pursuing it and sorting out the timing and venue there s no doubt atta was in prague in 2000 , and a subsequent meeting is at least plausible someday , after baghdad interrogations and tellall memoirs , we 'll learn the truth about any saddam connection with al qaeda in the meantime , why wo n't responsible officials take public stands \? in the cia s misdirection play , which way is the running back headed \?
it would undoubtedly be going too far to say that rachmaninoff was obsessed with death certainly in that regard he could n't hold a candle to mahler but rachmaninoff was apparently fascinated by the dies irae , the ancient funereal plainchant that many composers have quoted , though none as frequently as he the third of the four concerts that vladimir ashkenazy conducted as part of lincoln center s rachmaninoff revisited festival , on tuesday evening at avery fisher hall , brought together three works that differ greatly in most ways but share the use of the dies irae , either as a grand proclamation or as part of an orchestral transformation of the three , the work in which rachmaninoff used the chant in its most appropriate setting was the isle of the dead \( op 29 \) , the dark 1909 tone poem inspired by arnold b cklin s painting of a cemetery still something of an obscurity , this work has been turning up on programs more frequently in recent years , and it grows more alluring with each hearing mr ashkenazy , leading the philharmonia orchestra of london , gave a thoughtful , wellpaced reading and put the work s hazy coloration to effective use in giving this landscape dimension and detail without dispelling its sense of mystery rachmaninoff used the dies irae more famously as well as more boldly and more frequently in his rhapsody on a theme of paganini \( op 43 \) , where it happens to fit perfectly as a countermelody to the paganini caprice that is the work s raw material there is more to the piece than the paganini and chant quotations rachmaninoff was at his most inventive in these 24 variations for piano and orchestra , which are partners in an expansive dialogue that touches on or alludes to a vast array of compositional styles stephen hough played the piano line assertively but with a winning gracefulness , qualities that made the ruminative and explosive passages equally persuasive after the intermission , mr ashkenazy turned to symphony no 3 \( op 44 \) here the dies irae quotation is a footnote , something rachmaninoff seems to have included in passing , almost as a way of seeing whether listeners were paying attention paying attention is a lot to ask in this sprawling compilation of grand emotional gestures , composed in 1936 when the time for such pieces had long past yes , it has its lovely moments , mostly at the beginnings and ends of movements and it gives the orchestra a workout , which the philharmonia was not consistently equal to in the context of lincoln center s festival , one wanted to reconsider this work and to come away from the performance with a new fondness for it but it was no more compelling this time than it has been in the past and one has to assume that the hefty amount of applause between each movement was offered in the forlorn hope that the work would end
if you saw the gorgeous back flips , the incredible diving plays and the creative onebounce throws off the astroturf , you should know that you saw the best fielding shortstop in the history of baseball if you saw ozzie smith do any of these eyebulging things once , twice , a hundred times , you were rewarded , because he was the closest thing to defensive perfection millions of witnesses surely believe they know smith s story intimately he dazzled us for 19 years , winning 13 gold glove awards for the san diego padres and the st louis cardinals and playing so acrobatically that he forced fans to watch him do something as mundane as bending to collect grounders actually , there was hardly any forcing everyone wanted to watch him forget the 98mileanhour fastballs and the 450foot homers instead , fans often wondered , what is ozzie going to do next \? that illustrates smith s magnetism for a defensive player to consistently steal the attention in baseball is as rare as a player stealing home but smith did that for almost two decades oz was the wizard youngsters watched long before harry potter invaded our bookstores and movie screens for as much as we watched smith , he revealed yesterday that we did not see the reasons he was on a dais at a midtown hotel wearing a baseball hall of fame jersey and cap while so many of us saw smith when his glove was gold , none of us saw him as a child when he wrapped a paper bag over his hand to catch a rubber ball tell that to your children the next time they want a more stylish mitt picture a thinnerthanapoolcue boy with a passion for sports living in the watts section of los angeles in the 1960 s he had five brothers and sisters , but none were interested in sports so he had to improvise and entertain himself unwittingly , he also became his own first coach by devising ways to test himself , improving his handeye coordination , his arm strength and his speed smith would lie on the floor of his room , close his eyes , flip a baseball in the air and try to catch it he would do it over and over , unknowingly teaching himself to develop a feel for the ball the countless plays in which smith jabbed his glove or his bare hand to one side and seemingly had the ball on a string \? they started when a boy closed his eyes , concentrated and trusted himself i did some things when i was young that helped enhance my skills that i did n't know at the time were going to enhance my skills , smith said like trying to outrun a ball smith said he was a silly kid who would throw the ball over one side of the slanted roof on his house , then run around to the other side and try to catch it before it landed it was an impossible exercise , an exercise in futility that most 12yearolds nowadays would try a few times before switching to a skateboard or a video game smith kept at it for some reason , i thought i was fast enough to do it , smith said i never did but it was that type of determination that i think helped me develop as a major league player smith said he always had a ball with him , tossing it against a wall , working on his backhand catches and pushing himself to extend his range obviously , he did not suddenly wake up as a slickfielding shortstop he said he broke a few windows and got into trouble while he became one smith was not drafted out of high school he received an academic scholarship to california polytechnic university and made the team as a walkon the padres chose smith in the fourth round of the 1977 draft and signed him for 5 , 000 interestingly , smith said his greatest achievement was more about persistence than defense he played the last 11 years of his career with a torn right rotator cuff , which he overcame by strengthening the muscles around the tear and revising his throwing motion smith , 47 , who hit 28 homers in his career , said playfully that he would belt 25 in one year today he wistfully added , i wish i was still playing , and more than one head nodded the evolution of osborne earl into the ozzie we watched perform plays that seemed to be superhuman started with an energetic boy amusing himself catch the ball with your eyes closed try to beat the ball over the roof throw the ball at anything that will bounce it back do all of these things , keep working and , someday , everyone will want to watch you photo ozzie smith would n't do a flip yesterday , but he said lightly that he would hit 25 homers a year if he were still playing \( g paul burnett the new york times \)

when don black died , when his long tennis life was over , his wife and children were left with no specific directive on what to do with his ashes without much debate or fanfare , the family gathered to spread the remains around its lush compound in subsaharan splendor even a visitor from the united states to harare , zimbabwe , in february 2000 for john mcenroe s debut in a oneyear run as the americans' davis cup captain would have known that s what don black wanted asked that day if he feared for his property or for his safety as the troubled government of president robert mugabe began advocating seizing land from descendants of the british colonialists to place it back in black hands , don black made a sweeping gesture toward the perfectly manicured grass courts and the avocado pear trees swaying in the breeze and the 22 magnificent acres on which he reared three tennis pros i 'll die here , whatever happens , he said , with no way of knowing he was , at 72 , months from his permanent resting place it was october 2000 when byron , wayne and cara the black family touring professionals got the call from their mother , veila , with news of the secret their father had been keeping the cancer , she told them , needed surgery and now the operation had gone wrong byron black , the oldest and most accomplished , tenniswise , was in china cara , the youngest , was in germany i was in london , wayne , 29 , said from mason , ohio , where he and his countryman kevin ullyet were playing doubles this week in the cincinnati masters series tournament i rushed right home but the doctor said there was a problem with his arteries , that not enough blood was circulating to allow for the surgery it was too late none of us got to see him it was impossible to know why don black had not confided in his children , but knowing him , they guessed he convinced himself it was no big deal the father of a friend of mine had been taking tennis lessons from my dad for 10 years , wayne black said my friend told me that the day he was going into the hospital , my dad got up and beat that guy , 60 , 60 don black made the third round of wimbledon one year but wound up a teacher , like his english mother , and a farmer , like his scottish father , who settled in zimbabwe in 1913 , when it was the british colony of rhodesia the father retired with a pension at 40 to grow his vegetables and school his kids in tennis , a man at peace his age , he had said , spared him the fight against mugabeled rebels for years after , the country stabilized , and the whites who remained less than 1 percent in a population of 12 million lived as they had , far more luxuriously than the overwhelming majority of blacks land redistribution was inevitable , supported by influential governments and even by the commercial farmers union representing many of the 4 , 500 white farmers but mugabe , roundly accused of using the issue recklessly to help save himself politically , in may unilaterally set a deadline for 3 , 000 of the white farmers to vacate their land without compensation , or face fines and two years in jail that deadline was now , though a court ruling wednesday , which said a farm could not be taken without notification of the mortgage holder , could be a lifeline the farmers are mostly wealthy , so they 'll be all right , wayne black said but if they ca n't farm , people will starve he was last home in april and experienced the long lines , the soaring prices , some farmers and workers under siege i just talked to my cousin , who is one of the most successful farmers in the country , he said some are leaving he said he wo n't he just built a huge house so has byron black , married with children and planning to retire after one last davis cup competition , the kind his father lived for , at the raucous harare sports center next fall the black family has been enormously popular in zimbabwe , and the family compound , still home to wayne and cara and where veila remains , is no commercial farm yet the injustices of the past are inescapable , and the country s future could be even more tumultuous and bleak all i know , wayne black said , is that it would break my heart to leave that warm afternoon back in 2000 , don black considered the potential repercussions of staying put and asked how could i ever leave this \? fate had a plan for him , cruel but also , in a way , kind for whatever awaits zimbabwe s white farmers , no one can take don black from the rich soil he loved photo wayne black \( associated press \)
slidell , la i ca n't vouch for the old chestnut about atheists in foxholes but i do know that there are no pessimists in the search for the ivorybilled woodpecker when your feet are always wet , optimism is a necessary alternative to dry socks this insight occurred to me when i was following peter mcbride scouting out some wet woods in the pearl river wildlife management area here it was after the third or fourth time i removed my boots to pour a full load of bayou water onto the ground mr mcbride , a habitat biologist with a strong , if not irresistible , attraction to swamp water , never even bothered to take his off to drain them he 'd just tilt his foot up and let the water rush out to get on with the search at first , i thought this was taking stoicism a bit far but then i got the point you do n't want to keep raising and then dousing expectations for dry feet besides , taking your boots off slows you down as to the propriety of mixing theology and ornithology , all i can say is that we were looking for a creature that has been called the lord god bird , apparently because when people saw it they would be so impressed they would utter an involuntary , lord god ! furthermore , belief in the bird s continued existence demands a degree of faith there has n't been a confirmed sighting of the ivory bill for more than half a century , and it has been commonly assumed to be extinct reports of sightings keep trickling in , mostly to dr james van remsen , curator of birds at the museum of natural science at louisiana state university in baton rouge there are constant reports of sightings , but few seem even remotely believable usually when a photograph or videotape is available , the bird turns out to be the similar but smaller and fairly common pileated woodpecker there are exceptions , however dr remsen occasionally gets a report that inspires hope the most recent one , and the most credible in years , came in 1999 when david kulivan , a student at the university , reported seeing a pair of ivory bills in the nearby pearl river wildlife management area dr remsen and other experts found his report credible , even if it did occur on april 1 the sighting led to some initial searches and a moratorium on cutting down trees in the pearl , dr remsen said then zeiss sports optics , which makes , among other things , binoculars for birders , approached dr remsen about organizing a search after considerable planning and recruiting , with dr remsen overseeing most of it , six people moved into a bunkhouse at the pearl river wildlife management area on jan 17 they began 30 days \( 30 goodweather days \) of combing the woods for the ivory bill the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries is collaborating in the effort , and in a companion search , the cornell lab of ornithology has placed a dozen recording devices in the search area all the sounds the cornell lab devices pick up will be sorted by computer software , to eliminate patches of silence and other sounds that are clearly not the call of the ivory bill then human beings will analyze the record to listen for the call of the ivory bill , a nasal , single syllable kent kent , sometimes compared to the sound of a toy trumpet dr john w fitzpatrick , head of the cornell lab , said , my prediction is that no visual encounter will have confirmed the ivory bill by the end of this period if so , combing the sound record would be the final effort i'm quite convinced that this search is going to be the definitive one for this area , dr fitzpatrick said for the search , dr remsen recruited people from different specialties , two worldclass birders , alan wormington and richard l knight mr mcbride , a habitat biologist who did his master s thesis on south american magellanic woodpeckers martjan lammertink , a doctoral student studying woodpeckers in indonesia , who has also searched in cuba for ivorybilled woodpeckers alison r styring , a doctoral student working on woodpeckers at the university and david luneau , a computer scientist and birder from arkansas who has previously searched in the pearl for ivory bills i met the team in the evening at the end of day 12 of their search , at the bunkhouse where they were drying their socks and planning the next day they seemed a bit weary , more from doing one media interview after another than from the search itself , but still optimistic the ivory bill was \( a discovery would be necessary to reclaim the present tense \) north america s largest woodpecker , about 20 inches long with a wingspan of 30 inches it had stunning black and white coloration with red on the male s cockade and a long , powerful bill the last person to study the birds , and the source of most information about them , was james tanner in the 1940 s he observed ivory bills in a part of northeastern louisiana known as the singer tract like other bottomland habitat , the land was logged the ivory bill was brought low by the loss of forest land , by the conflict between its own appetites and the appetites of humanity the ivory bill fed , as far as is known , by hammering the bark off large , recently dead trees and eating the grubs it exposed it did not drill , nor did it dig very deep it skimmed the cream of a larval crop bred in decaying trees and left the deeper work for lesser birds
julia lommatzsch johnson chuckles when she hears what bridal magazines and wedding web sites consider to be weddingday disasters misplaced wedding bands , whiny flower girls , ripped tuxedos , guests who never show and wedding experts' advice to pack a nuptial emergency kit of pins , thread , tape , pantyhose , comb and toothbrush brings out an equally bemused response puhlease , she said you call those disasters \? ms johnson and her husband , scott , of stamford have every right to sniff at what they consider bushleague marriage mishaps that s because their wedding reception has reached the stature of suburban legend among their relatives and friends on their wedding day , oct 19 , 1996 , what local newspaper headlines called a killer storm actually a northeaster knocked out power at their reception , sent trees crashing across the only road that lead to the reception , turned the parking lot into a mud pit and disabled the toilets so badly that guests , in the driving rain , had to walk up a muddy hill to use the public restrooms at a park trees were blowing sideways we could hear the rain pelting the windows , mr johnson said i think we were in denial' who can blame them last year , couples in the united states spent 70 billion to insure that their special day would be a perfectly executed nuptial confection of fragrant flowers and white lace , with bulging photo albums and videotapes of images that evoke memories of floating on air for a day and june is still the top month for weddings but for some couples , the months , and even years of saving and planning have been rewarded with photos and memories of darkened wedding halls , billowing clouds of smoke , incinerated presents and tears in some cases , denial may not be such a bad thing when the most important , most planned , and most anticipated day of an adult s life turns into an outofbody experience last year , a waterbury man on the way to his wedding stopped off in stratford to rob a bank he has since been sentenced to six years in prison and his optimistic fianc e told the man s public defender she intended to wait for him also last year , a westport man disrupted a wedding reception he was attending in town when he punched several guests and fled in his car , engaging police in a brief chase the guy who got hit , hit the other guy back , said the bride , susan cooper of norwalk they were then tackled by a bunch of other guys then , the guy who started the fight started swinging an umbrella at everybody ms cooper said the disgruntled guest was a date of a girlfriend from work i'm not sure to this day what the fight was about , she said we just laugh about it now and i have a picture of me in a police car usually , it s the weather that behaves unpredictably , not the guests for the johnsons , their wedding started off with torrential rains , but not a hint of anything more their 11 30 am church service went off without a problem until immediately after the ceremony when the lights blinked off , then on and then off again twenty people in unison said , 'oh , no ! ' said ms johnson mr johnson said , at that point , all havoc broke loose the couple had n't provided directions to the reception because the elizabethanstyle mansion at the stamford nature center was only oneeighth of a mile from the church but no one had counted on trees and power lines dropping like toothpicks across the road it was a bad sign when ms johnson s mother , father and brother got lost everybody kind of created a caravan of cars from the church to drive around on the back roads to get to the nature center , mr johnson said but those back roads go on forever the mansion was without electricity when the couple finally arrived , but the caterer had rushed out to buy candles and blanketed the hall in candlelight he told us everything was going to be ok , mr johnson said the food was on sternos he had found someone who still had electricity , so he bought bottled water and made coffee and brought it back the musician could n't use the electric piano , so the couple maneuvered their first dance as husband and wife to an a cappella version of their wedding song , i will be here the icing on the cake \? ms johnson said that just as she and her husband stepped onto the threshold on the way out when the reception was over , the lights came back on but they are philosophical you know , mr johnson said , it was all very magical and everybody remembers our wedding they say it s good luck if it rains on your wedding and we 've been extremely blessed because it poured snow was the problem for nancy bencivengo of orange on her wedding day , she woke up to a telephone call from her florist he wanted to know if i still wanted my wedding flowers , mrs bencivengo said i said , 'of course i want the flowers i'm getting married today' he said , 'are you sure \? it s terrible outside' i looked out the window and saw a whiteout of snow on the day she married nick bencivengo , march 13 , 1993 , between two and three feet of snow fell in connecticut , and headlines called it the great blizzard of '93

los angeles it was a rivalry like few others , one of the best in sports , nearly sibling it was macy s and gimbels , chanel and est e lauder , hershey and nestl , except with bats in their hands at first they came from brotherly boroughs , connected by subterranean trains and a vehement detestation of one another their sevendecadelong trolley and subway series was historic , intense and dripping with animosity , encompassing nearly everyone from the players to the fans to the local postmen and probably the dogs that chased them , too it was the brooklyn bums and the new york giants then , after the 1957 season , the franchises moved to los angeles and san francisco , respectively , still internecine members of the national league , though now 450 miles apart they have continued their competition every year since then , and this week found themselves in a wrangle for the sole wildcard entry into the playoffs a fourgame series in midseptember and the teams separated by just one game , having split the first two close games what rivalry \? it s a figment of somebody s imagination , said don newcombe , who pitched magnificently for the dodgers in brooklyn in the late 40 s and early and mid50 s , and is now director of community relations for the los angeles dodgers the rivalry as we once knew it does n't exist anymore maybe to the media maybe to some fans but to the players \? absolutely not it s like any other series against any other opponent to them newcombe , 76 , stood on the field the other day , watching the dodgers , still in their oldtime blue and white home uniforms , take batting practice as the giants , in their traditional orange , black and gray traveling uniforms , warmed up along the firstbase line newcombe , hair a bit thinner and grayer than when he was firing fastballs as a national league allstar , still has that strong , protruding jaw that indicates , dig in at your own risk , pal the players today are too young , and do n't care what happened in new york and brooklyn years ago , newcombe said just the names of the players in those days could get you juiced up we had jackie and campy and furillo and erskine and reese , they had dark and willie and maglie and jansen and monte irvin he continued what do people know about the west coast rivalry between these two teams \? that marichal tried to hit roseboro over the head with a bat , or a playoff game in 1962 nothing much else inevitably , the mother of all baseball games postseason ones , anyway was mentioned the third and deciding game of the 1951 threegame playoff series , giants vs dodgers , at the polo grounds you have to go back to august when we had a 13 1 2game lead over the giants , and we were coasting , newcombe recalled then we started playing scoreboard watch instead of tending to business on the field , and the giants reeled off 16 straight wins we won 9 of 16 at one point , but they caught us at the end of the season to force a playoff series i pitched eight and a third innings of the third game i had pitched two shutouts and had six innings of shutout relief coming down the stretch i had struck out two batters in the eighth inning when dark led off the ninth with a single mueller singled irvin popped out and then lockman doubled , scoring a run it was 42 and our manager , charlie dressen , came out to the mound pee wee , our shortstop and captain , said , 'get somebody fresh' that was ok i 'd given everything i had they brought in ralph branca , who had looked good in the bullpen and ralph was a pretty good pitcher but he was going to face bobby thomson , who wore branca out thomson proceeded to hit a high branca fastball into the leftfield stands for a home run to win the game and the national league pennant tears flowed in brooklyn jubilation reigned at coogan s bluff some fans have still not gotten over it none of that history means anything to me , said jeff kent , the giants' allstar second baseman i 've always been kind of detached from the history of the game i 've never really been a fan i love baseball , but i'm just interested in playing the game shawon dunston , the giants' veteran utility player , grew up in brooklyn but i was born in 1964 , and my memory of a local rivalry was the yankees and the mets , said dunston the only thing i remember about the dodgers is that there s an ebbets field apartment projects where the field used to stand so this rivalry does n't mean any more to me than if we 're playing any other good team none of the players discuss 'rivalry' between these two teams anymore four hundred and fifty miles apart is a long way away jesse orosco , a dodgers relief pitcher and a former met , said all teams present rivalries to me , regardless how good or bad they are every one has the potential to hurt you look what colorado did to us last week you want to play aggressive against everyone , and the giants fit into that category the dodgers righthander hideo nomo said , no , everyone s the same and none of the players ask newcombe about it one memory i have of that '51 season is that i spent my world series check in august , he said i asked buzzie bavasi , a dodger vice president , to loan me money to buy a brandnew , twotone , blue cadillac sedan i borrowed 5 , 500 from him , knowing that even the loser s share of the world series check was some 6 , 000 , and would give him the money from that check which never came it took me three years to pay buzzie back the money photo roy campanella , left , and don newcombe were two of the mainstays of the brooklyn dodgers \( associated press \)
rome , jan 13 in only seven months in office , prime minister silvio berlusconi has already lived through any number of international embarrassments but even his opponents say that so far he seems practically impervious to political damage that perception could change quickly , of course just this weekend , a former italian president , francesco cossiga , said mr berlusconi should step down if he was implicated in the corruption trial of one of his lawyers , who stands accused of bribery on behalf of one of mr berlusconi s companies yet , in a nation with a history of notoriously unstable governments , mr berlusconi seems surprisingly durable he not only survived his remarks on the superiority of western civilization to islamic culture , but also convinced many people here that he had never made them he easily weathered almost nonstop criticism from abroad and repeated accusations about policymaking that appeared to put his interests , financial and legal , ahead of italy s nonetheless , he has an overwhelming majority in parliament and no credible political opposition , and his approval ratings remain high and stable he s not going to fall soon , the centerleft s prime ministerbeforelast , massimo d'alema , said in an interview all last week , officials across europe tried to put him on the defensive for pushing out his experienced foreign minister and taking the job himself the minister , renato ruggiero , resigned after clashes over the government s european policy , and neighboring nations took turns questioning italy s commitment to their common future in italy , however , mr berlusconi quickly managed to cast his decision as a show of strength , despite the public s overwhelming support for a strong europe this characterization was especially daring considering that just days before the resignation , a poll ranked mr ruggiero as the country s most popular official for now , the crisis is outside italy , with our european partners , said stefano folli , a political columnist for corriere della sera of milan inside the country , he said , the government is still strong , the left is still weak , and none of this has changed that one anxiety across the continent , where most countries are governed by the centerleft , is the expectation of a growing role for gianfranco fini , the leader of the postfascist party mr fini is mr berlusconi s deputy and is considered a serious contender for the foreign minister s job should mr berlusconi relinquish it european officials seem even more concerned about the antiimmigrant stance of the government s other partner , umberto bossi , leader of the onceseparatist northern league , who is the reform minister some european officials said the situation was not unlike the one when j rg haider and his antiimmigration party were taken into austria s government in 2000 in that case , the europeans imposed sanctions , though they proved shortlived austria did not veer into neonazism , and the european union found itself in the position of punishing the democratic choice of austrian voters the europeans may be leery about repeating that episode , especially with a country as large and influential as italy mr berlusconi s government has clashed repeatedly with the rest of europe on several fronts italy backed out of a multinational effort to develop the airbus military transport plane it tried to block the creation of a european arrest warrant intended to thwart terrorists it also held up a proposal to open a european food agency in helsinki , saying it should be in parma instead the finns do n't even know what prosciutto is , the prime minister said continued disputes could result in unofficial sanctions italy will see how cold it can be in europe if the others turn their backs on rome , a european official told reuters the italian public is aware of mr berlusconi s reputed shortcomings in fact , the newspaper la repubblica recently suggested , it is hard to find anyone who admits to having voted for him italians did vote for him , though , believing they could count on him , as the country s most successful businessman , to cut taxes and reform labor laws that now make it difficult for even small companies to dismiss employees also , so many italian leaders have been implicated in corruption trials that his legal problems hardly seemed to disqualify him according to the opposition leader , francesco rutelli , many people said 'he can make me be like him richer and yes , perhaps he s corrupt with his taxes , but i want to do the same' the left , meanwhile , is weighed down by the reputation of having had the chance to modernize italy and failing mr rutelli , who lost to mr berlusconi in last spring s elections , said italians had pinned such high hopes on the current prime minister that any attempt to cut his tenure short would almost certainly backfire , as happened when mr berlusconi first governed in 1994 he then used television stations he owned , mr rutelli said , to play play the victim and say we would not let him , the new man , change the country our job is to never give the impression we are not allowing him to govern , he said in the meantime , he said , the left has to rebuild from scratch we just have to make sure we 're ready when he does collapse , mr rutelli said photo prime minister silvio berlusconi , left , and val ry giscard d'estaing , the former french president , in rome \( reuters \)

trenton as an old beau of mine was fond of saying , there are two types of people those who divide people into groups and those who do n't for the former , there are beguiling subsets for categorizing coffee drinkers and tea drinkers , meat eaters and vegetarians , sushi eaters and shudderers at the thought there are also two types of pizza eaters those who like their pizzas with a thick , bready base to sop up the sauce and the grease and do n't mind folding it to protect themselves from those juices then there are those who want a fine , crisp crust from the edge to the point , where judiciously appointed toppings can be borne from platter to mouth with structural integrity intact for you who like your pizzas fat , i'm still looking but you who want the crackerlike crunch of a crust against the hot and soft sweet tomato against a meltedtoalmostcrusty mozzarella , with crust bubbles tinged to deepest brown , even black , and gary amico , the chief pizza man , catching your eye and asking you , izzitok \? , then de lorenzo s tomato pies is where you 'll want to stand in line and eventually eat de lorenzo s is so nofrills that pizza is the only thing you can order , except for birch beer , coke and a couple of other sugary drinks it s a bringyourownbeer place , a bringyourownmilk place there are no menus , but you can bring a piece of paper and a pencil to make your own plates are plastic and dessertsize , napkins are paper and forks and knives are cafeteria quality the tables hold little vials of salt , pepper and hot pepper flakes and none of that shaker cheese and there s one other thing the place lacks a bathroom oh , and it takes no cards and no checks cash only and another thing the airconditioning is wickedly efficient , and when the wait after ordering can stretch close to an hour \( two pizza ovens , 54 seats and another 25 percent of the business is takeout \) , the combination of the chill and hunger is enough to challenge nearly any parent s ability to entertain but once you know the setup and remember to pack snacks and sweaters , you can relax since 1948 , de lorenzo s has occupied the same spot below chick and sophie de lorenzo s apartment in a block of row houses on hudson street , deep in trenton s chambersburg neighborhood years ago , the ownership expanded from the de lorenzo couple to their daughter , eileen amico and her husband , gary , but many things about the restaurant remain original the line starts at the bench outside the restaurant s door , extends along the edge of a brick planter that holds a few bright red geraniums , past the steps of a de lorenzo brother s camera shop on the corner and sometimes turns the corner onto the less prosperous swan street waiters take no names , but as tables empty , the diners closest to the door go in , and wouldbe customers haul themselves and their coolers up , then sit down one spot closer inside , if you 're lucky , you 'll land a warm spot opposite the piemaking center , which offers traditional edible theater dough stretching and pie slicing mr amico s elegant pie assembly reflects his 35 years in the same corner walls are decorated with photographs of the famous and notsofamous , those who have eaten de lorenzo s tomato pies and those who write on their photographs that they want to maybe they have n't had a chance because they wanted takeout and the phone was busy there s a rumor that the restaurant takes the phone off the hook confirmed we take the phone off a lot of nights , mr amico said this is n't a volume kind of thing , and there comes a point , we ca n't handle it , he said it s not right for the customers it s a momandpop thing that got out of hand if you want to fit in as if you know the mom and pop , here s the unwritten menu pizzas come in small \( 8 slices \) and large \( 10 slices \) toppings include pepperoni , sausage , clams , anchovies , onions , garlic , mushrooms , black olives , hot peppers , sweet peppers , roasted red peppers and broccoli you can order a white pizza , which means no housemade tomato sauce you can order a nomozzarell' pizza you can order a pie medium or welldone a large cheese and tomato pie will feed two adults and two hungry children a small clam pie is an adequate appetizer for four adults the real secret , though , is to order more than one pie , and take the waiter s advice stagger the pies , so you can eat your slices hot and crisp the tables are too small for two pizzas , anyway i have yet to try a bad combination , but some are more appealing than others mr amico s current favorite is tomatoes , anchovies , garlic and olive oil the clam pie , which was very good with a backdrop of plain cheese and tomato sparked with fresh parsley , dried oregano and garlic , might be excellent with the garlic and without tomato the canned whole baby clams were tender and succulent , slightly briny and sweet the pepperoni and mushroom is a classic , but that pepperoni would be welcome on any pizza the same goes for the trentonmade sweet pork sausage , browned in hazelnutsize mounds remarkably free of gristle i also liked the caramelized onions and the roasted red peppers , though the generously sized pieces of both tended to emphasize their slipperiness there s another de lorenzo s tomato pies on hamilton , owned by another brother of mr de lorenzo it s a bigger restaurant , with more ovens , and , i hope , a few more comforts but before we try it , we 'll pack sweaters and snacks and make a bathroom stop , just in case de lorenzo s

bras lia , aug 5 amid signs that the bush administration is easing its resistance to bailing out crisisridden latin american economies , treasury secretary paul h o'neill assured brazil s president today of washington s support in its negotiations with the international monetary fund meeting here , mr o'neill and president fernando henrique cardoso held what the american described as cordial and very useful talks about how to help brazil cope with its worst financial crisis since the sharp devaluation of its currency , the real , in 1999 with some investors increasingly nervous that elections in october could end in victory for a leftwing candidate , the real has plummeted to record lows in recent weeks , settling in new york late today at 3315 cents , up from 3244 cents on friday this has aggravated a credit squeeze on international markets that is pushing brazilian companies so hard that many analysts predict a series of corporate defaults last week , as the crisis worsened , brazil dispatched negotiators to washington to lobby for imf support i repeated president bush s strong support for brazil , mr o'neill said today after his meeting with mr cardoso we support the discussions the brazilian authorities are now having with the imf as the largest economy in latin america , brazil s success is important to the economic success of the entire hemisphere , he added brazil has the right economic policies in place to maintain stability just a week ago , mr o'neill was less than enthusiastic about coming to brazil s aid he helped add to a sense of market panic by suggesting that there could be no fresh aid to sorely pressed latin american economies unless there were guarantees that the money would not be diverted to swiss bank accounts , presumably of corrupt officials those offthecuff remarks infuriated brazilian business executives and set off a diplomatic spat the brazilian foreign ministry summoned the united states ambassador , donna j hrinak , to explain the remarks , and the weekly business magazine isto dinheiro put the treasury secretary on its cover with the headline , o'neill , brazil does n't want you here an article inside described him as a loose cannon who on several occasions has offended and damaged the country in speeches here today , mr o'neill praised economic changes that mr cardoso introduced over the last eight years these have brought stability and large amounts of foreign investment more recently , though , economic growth has been disappointing brazilian officials who met with mr o'neill when he arrived in rio de janeiro on sunday night were upbeat about the visit , but none risked predicting the outcome of the talks with the imf and the currency s value failed to rally in any notable way many analysts are skeptical that the imf will provide any fresh funds without a pledge from all the election candidates to continue a tight fiscal policy and to try to keep inflation low but the two leading candidates , luiz in cio lula da silva of the workers party and ciro gomes of the labor front , have refused to make any such pledge , saying that until after the elections , the economy is the government s responsibility mr o'neill will leave brazil on tuesday for visits to the two other crisis economies in the region , uruguay and argentina washington has agreed to provide 15 billion in interim financing to uruguay to keep its banks afloat until additional imf loans can be arranged , but it has yet to help argentina , which at the beginning of the year defaulted on most payments on its 141 billion debt the hastily assembled aid package for uruguay has been seen by some analysts as an easing of the bush administration s philosophical opposition to bailing out emerging economies in trouble , unless like turkey , they are deemed to be of strategic importance in american efforts against terrorism it s not a lot of money , but it is highly symbolic in terms of a change in attitude , douglas smith , a new yorkbased independent consultant and former treasury official , said of the interim loan to uruguay this administration came to office vocally opposing such handouts photo treasury secretary paul h o'neill in bras lia yesterday on his way to discussions with president fernando enrique cardoso \( agence francepresse \)
deep in the shade of paradise by john dufresne illustrated 364 pp new york w w norton company 2595 we meet some exceedingly engaging characters in john dufresne s third novel in fact , deep in the shade of paradise is full of engaging characters and \( to use a play on words i judge dufresne would find tolerable \) full of marrying characters as well , for the novel is actually a clutch of stories about finding love and then somehow turning it into marriage or vice versa dufresne s characters are so engaging that i enjoyed not only their ample pleasures but their many vicissitudes , not to mention their endless palaver i even hated for the book to end and that says plenty about dufresne s flair for storytelling but after a while i began looking around in hopes of finding the shape of the novel that holds all these interesting \( and sometimes wise \) stories and lo , i found none however , midway through , i did find this thoughtful excuse but that s what a novel is a machine you build to show how everything is connected a character is speaking here \( dufresne is not above bantering with his characters \) , but aside from the exculpatory relevance of what he says , the comment reveals a curious reluctance on the author s part to sever himself from any of the people he has invented madame bovary , c'est moi , flaubert famously said but dufresne seems to want to say it about every blessed character who shuffles or limps or wheels or even walks onto his stage in short , deep in the shade of paradise contains a good deal of fauxna f posturing about authorial identities , the storytelling itself , the characters speaking for themselves and so on if , like me , you often enjoy this sort of postmodern nattering , then his book will do what it says a novel should do what dufresne presents by way of connections is a bright fresco of the comings and goings in a gaudy little louisiana bayou settlement called shiverdefreeze the name makes us think of chevauxdefrise barbaric barricades of impromptu siegecraft , sharpened stakes and saplings made into a hedge , breasthigh to impale horse or man and , sure enough , the book is fortified with a prologue and an epilogue and a lengthy appendix , as well as quotations , real and imaginary , and a whole choir of notes somehow , i managed to get through the fence and enjoy myself mightily with dufresne s interlocked stories the interlocked part is the essence of it , since dufresne is fascinated by coincidence maybe a novel is a machine you build to make everything connect with everything else a true novel , then , would be infinite , and could n't end until everybody had married everybody else , been everybody else s child , everybody else s mother another way of presenting it might draw on the ancient buddhist notion of samsara , the infinitely changing world moderns , though , might think first of jorge luis borges and the quest for the infinite certainly dufresne was thinking of borges when he came up with a character named boudou fontana , a boy who remembers everything for me , boudou is the character who holds the most interest , and his ability to remember everything is put to poignant use as he gradually begins to spend time with royce , an old man losing his memories and his wits or are they the same \? royce gives his recollections to boudou to keep for him and to speak again this curious dance of memory and forgetting provides the freshest , loveliest music in the book but after dufresne gets us interested in boudou s abilities , he sidelines the kid into an observer of mere adult antics i detect a sequel in the making the dust jacket informs us that the novel reinvents 'a midsummer night s dream' in the lush bayous of louisiana well , yes and no do n't expect cajun versions of titania and oberon and the forgeries of jealousy there s plenty of flopping in and out of love , plenty of moonshine and mechanicals , even a sleepy version of the playwithinaplay but the intricate weave of social stratification , the epistemological high jinks found in shakespeare are n't on offer where shakespeare s play is all about the flimsy evidence of the senses and the fallible human appetite , dufresne s novel sticks to the chances and mischances of who do i sleep with tonight \? and every night do n't expect faulkner either deep in the shade of paradise is to faulkner as anna russell sings is to wagner a romp of tuneful , playful narrative against the shadow of vast fate in the novel , we are told a lot about the curse on the fontana family , and dufresne s narrative is fecund with bizarre fatalities \( some of which are pretty scary \) and ripleyesque misadventures yet he can never resist a joke jollity keeps creeping in we hear of fate , but what we get is pratfall , albeit lethal , in this vitally inattentive clan what dufresne gives us in deep in the shade of paradise is a world of grotesques and exaggerations , a comicopera vision of cajun country but it is comic , and it is a world and although it has nothing to say about race and class , it has a lot to say about religion and its counterparts dufresne is gifted when it comes to descriptions of natural things , states of feeling , shimmers of remembrance he is in love with most of his characters , and it s hard to find a bad one there s no outright evil here , but there s a lot of pain dufresne is good at shuffling the cards that show his characters' fears and desires , then dealing them fates they can handle at the start of the book , he quotes that haunting question asked by coleridge if a man could pass through paradise in a dream , and have a flower presented to him as a pledge that his soul had really been there , and if he found that flower in his hand when he awoke aye , and what then \? the paradise here is the big house where various guests are gathered for the marriage of grisham loudermilk and ariane thevenot both of them have lastminute flings with people they \( and we \) like better than their intended mates then each comes back to that intended mate , and all seems well memory must be that flower coleridge spoke of we come out of a book as we come out of a dream readers will remember this rumbustious , ambitious novel and the host of characters who pass through it and remember some amazingly delicate moments of truth and farewell

istanbul , oct 30 turkey looks set to give a victory in this sunday s parliamentary elections to an untested party with islamic roots , a prospect that scares many in this moderate muslim nation but that others see as a crucial test of how well democracy here and a greater emphasis on islam can coexist polls give the party , justice and development , as much as 30 percent of the vote a lead it hopes to translate into a singleparty government in a nation that has zealously defended its secularism since its founding as a republic in 1923 it is a measure of progress , in turkey s long and fitful drive to full democracy , that there seems no chance that the military will step in as it has done whenever it felt the state was threatened the party s leader , recep tayyip erdogan , is too popular , his message has been moderate and turkey is eager to burnish its democratic credentials in the hope of joining the european union but turkey s socalled establishment the politicians , soldiers and judges who see themselves as the guardians of the state s sanctified secularism has worked hard to prevent the party from winning last month , the election board banned mr erdogan from running , though he still campaigns as the party s popular face last week , the chief prosecutor filed a suit to outlaw the party itself with the election days away , mr erdogan , 48 , the former mayor of istanbul , is in any case drawing huge crowds but he and his party do not promise to islamicize turkey they have , to the contrary , vigorously played down the party s islamic roots instead , the party s appeal lies in its determination to end corruption , to revive the economy and to listen to the plight of ordinary turks they said they were going to keep down tayyip erdogan , he told 25 , 000 or more supporters , some with the beards and head scarves of pious muslims but many others with shaved faces and uncovered heads , at a rally in istanbul on sunday look at this crowd a complicated dynamic is thus driving this election at a time when much of the world is jittery about the role of islam in politics and terror , and turkey s place as a strategic bridge between west and east is especially vital , voters seem willing to gamble around the edges of secularism out of anger at the nation s current politicians in fact , disgust with the country s politics is such that none of the parties in the ruling coalition led by prime minister bulent ecevit are polling above or near 10 percent the threshold for winning seats in parliament there are certain basic qualities about turkey that we have to change politics are dirty , said sebahat tolu , 31 , a single woman and fashion stylist , who attended mr erdogan s rally in trousers with an uncovered head she said she worries about mr erdogan s islamic point of view but she liked the job he did as istanbul mayor in the 1990 s , expanding electricity , water , and cleaning up the streets , and so is willing to take a risk as long as he maintains a balance , as long as he does n't step over the line , he is the leader , she said if justice and development does win the election , the biggest unknown is what role mr erdogan would play in any new government under present law , he cannot hold public office because of a past conviction for inciting religious hatred he has left open the possibility of amending the constitution to allow himself to be a minister of some stripe it means his intention is to lead the government from behind the scenes and to appoint a weak prime minister , said ilter turkmen , a former foreign minister what we need is a strong prime minister , a modern prime minister but even a behindthescenes role for mr erdogan makes some here nervous many refuse to dismiss his past elected mayor of istanbul in 1994 , he banned alcohol in municipal restaurants , opposed entry into the european union and supported withdrawing from nato you cannot be secular and a muslim at the same time , he said in a speech in 1995 the world s 15 billion muslims are waiting for the turkish people to rise up we will rise up in 1997 , he recited a poem that landed him in jail for four months , ending his tenure as mayor that was the charge that the elections board used to ban him from these elections , though there is no doubt he remains the head of his party there is still a lot of worry that they are not sincere in their willingness to play by the rules and uphold the secular state , said kemal dervis , a former world bank vice president and former economy minister , now a candidate with the republican people s party , which is running second in the polls mr dervis said he worries about how well the party would guide turkey into the european union others have raised concerns about how solid an ally mr erdogan s party would be to the united states , a longtime friend , in the event of an attack on iraq , a fellow muslim nation throughout the campaign , mr erdogan and other party leaders have projected a moderate , prowestern , proeuropean union stance , even while promising observant muslims greater freedom of expression , itself a contentious issue in turkey yet they say their government would be defined not by religion but for being competent , honest and a beacon to democracy in other muslim nations
tabernacle think of a kingdom within a state , with 11 million acres of oaks and pitch pines , vegetable farms , cranberry bogs and housing developments perched atop a water aquifer of unparalleled purity , and you have a partial picture of new jersey s pinelands but these days there is confusion in the kingdom , which occupies onefifth of the state the blame can largely be laid at the feet of the 15member panel that oversees the ecological treasure , and it includes a psychologist , a nuclear engineer , a former gym teacher , hay and cranberry farmers , professional planners , a retired utilities executive and a botanist together , the pinelands commission oversees a land management plan so ambitious and so detailed that it is looked to as a blueprint for largescale conservation efforts nationwide to jerrold l jacobs , the current chairman of the commission , he and his colleagues have more than held up their end of of this fragile trust we have protected the core of the pinelands , said mr jacobs that , by and large , was the plan perhaps , but there is confusion nonetheless by next week , the terms of mr jacobs and six other commissioners will have expired , dropping a gauntlet in front of governor mcgreevey , who overwhelmed by concerns over a yawning budget deficit is months overdue in making new appointments in truth , environmental groups have been edgy about concrete and cars encroaching on this broad swath ever since christie whitman was sworn into her first term as governor they have been more than eager to pounce on the commission for a perceived softening in the protection of rare species and for failing to divert development from some interior areas nor has the tumult bypassed the commission staff , which provides expertise for hundreds of decisions each year on construction across seven of the state s southern and central counties the staff s widely respected executive director , terrence d moore , who had held the position for two decades , resigned unexpectedly two years ago during a controversy in which the commission eased zoning rules now , william f harrison , a longserving assistant staff director , faces disciplinary action for insubordination both mr harrison and the commissioners declined to comment , but mr moore said the volume of pinelands building applications and the time required to review them often threatened to overwhelm the 60member staff if it continues , it makes it hard for the staff to focus on some of the larger issues , said mr moore , a planner now working for the national park service in philadelphia staff turmoil and uncertainty about the complexion of the commission have led environmentalists to lobby the mcgreevey administration for nominees who display a proven interest in conservation , just as builders and developers are clamoring for their own representation adding urgency this year , the pinelands commission is conducting a review of the master plan that could result in changes to address the searing growth in areas like egg harbor township , near atlantic city , that are supposed to be shielded from development run amok there have been terrible precedents and a lot of red flags , said carleton montgomery , executive director of the pinelands preservation alliance , an organization in pemberton , on the pinelands' northern fringe , that has emerged as the region s primary watchdog we 've told the governor that he s got to make the commission much greener mr montgomery s concerns are shared by michele byers , executive director of the new jersey conservation foundation , which promotes land trusts and policies for open space ms byers said that while the pinelands' plan remained largely intact , she had watched the direction of its administration shift it s harder and harder to get a consensus , said ms byers in the early years , there was never a question on getting eight votes to make the right decision to conserve the resource now , without appointments , the commission is not able to move ahead a suburban wilderness and yet the pinelands are far from being ecologically pristine the region is a quilt of public and mostly private land that includes fort dix , mcguire air force base , a stretch of the garden state parkway , tomato and berry farms and a climbing human population of more than 600 , 000 living in 56 towns and villages its borders sit within a tempting commute to trenton and philadelphia to the west , and atlantic city to the east the pinelands plan , a political offspring of former gov brendan byrne s administration that dates from the 1970 s , tries to direct the flow of development away from the region s forested core and toward parcels designated for more intensive growth the state pinelands protection act of 1979 set goals of preserving farms and undeveloped lands , discouraging piecemeal and scattered development and conserving animal and plant species on the sandy soils of the kirkwoodcohansey aquifer , estimated to hold 177 trillion gallons of water this is a preservation statute , not a development statute , declared candace mckee ashmun , a bernards township planner and business consultant who has served on the commission since its creation
there was reason to be apprehensive three of the biggest mainstream jazz instrumentalists on the verve label , all sometimes involved in heavily overproduced recordings , started a touring and recording project to honor \( or exploit \) the 75th anniversary of the births of miles davis and john coltrane but herbie hancock , michael brecker and roy hargrove acted carefully it was clear by their directions in music concert at carnegie hall on friday night , part of the jvc jazz festival , that they had worked hard to create ideas , and then worked hard to forget them the show was prepared intelligent arrangements , betterthandecent repertory choices \( from davis s and coltrane s albums as well as the players' own imitative homages \) , charismatic set pieces but it was also drenched in dissonance , with a lot of collective improvisation in the rhythm section it was n't dull or safe or nostalgic first , let s appreciate the musicians' having taken stock of the room carnegie hall continues to be a problem as the most important place for these jvc festival concerts it is terribly unsuited to percussive music this band had a mentholated sound , sensitive to acoustic challenges the drummer , willie jones , used such cushioned finesse that even his abrupt fills in the evening s more freely structured music did n't produce the usual painful clatter the bassist , george mraz , worked on thick , resonant notes all night and mr brecker played a piece that admitted the room s advantages a solo tenorsaxophone version of coltrane s naima it was a whirligig advertisement , a splendid demonstration of saxophone skills and a musically coherent work that broke the melody into chunks and explicated each one , mostly through rampant chordbased runs , but also through melodic variation the meat of the set most of it from the group s recent directions in music album for verve , and better than the album was the kind of jazz that introduced herbie hancock s piano to the world in davis s sorcerer and some original pieces that sounded as if they came from the mid60 s , when mr hancock worked with him , the fulcrum was always shifting keys were indeterminate , melodic cycles were oddly short or endlessly expandable in general you did n't know where you were remember again that the three frontline musicians did n't need to work this hard for their paychecks so much less would have sold tickets the evening needed a miles davis ballad for mr hargrove to demonstrate his beautiful fluegelhorn sound , and they did n't choose an obvious one it was my ship , slowed down and rearranged for floating the only nod to the allpowerful kind of blue album was a tasteful bass solo by mr mraz that unobnoxiously evoked so what there was no material from a love supreme , none of the live davis band repertory from the 1960 s that has been omnipresent in mainstream jazz performances ever since in the last 20 years jazz listeners have been put through many homages so lifeless that they 're finally cynical here they got an excellent one instead photo herbie hancock at the piano and michael brecker on tenor saxophone in a tribute to miles davis and john coltrane at carnegie hall \( richard termine for the new york times \)

asahel outpost , west bank , june 30 the outposts , as they are called here , are often no more than a mobile home or two , sometimes not even occupied asahel s population is three a trio of young israelis on a desert hilltop with four dogs , a generator , a water tank , a television and a stuffed deer head , but not too much else we do n't want to bother anyone , tuvia smotrich , 25 , who helped build this outpost and has lived here for nine months , said today we do n't want anyone to bother us but today , israel s defense minister , benjamin beneliezer , said he would close down many of these outposts , built without official permission as remote markers for the expansion of existing israeli settlements further into the west bank , and 11 were reported closed by the end of the day at the same time , violent confrontations in the west bank continued the israeli army said it killed a top bomb maker for the military wing of the islamic group hamas in a raid today on a house in the west bank city of nablus the report said the man , muhanad altaher , was responsible for bombing attacks that killed more than 100 israelis and wounded hundreds of others , including a bus bombing in jerusalem on june 18 that killed 20 people , including the bomber israeli forces today dismantled at least one settler outpost near the haggai settlement , south of the west bank city of hebron settlers blocked reporters from traveling down a gravel road but confirmed that soldiers had taken down the outpost , where they said only two israeli families lived a second outpost , near a small settlement called maale hever , also near hebron , was reported removed this morning later reports said 11 had been closed , though asahel was not among them the main settler organization has vowed to fight the closing of the outposts it s not the right answer to the situation , said yaniv miles , 23 , one of nine israelis at an outpost called avigail , south of hebron , which along with asahel , is among the outposts considered likely to be removed he said the message to palestinians would be you make problems , we 'll give you what you want at a rally of his labor party last night , mr beneliezer announced his intention to issue an order this morning to evacuate 10 of the lonely outpost settlements , where providing security has become an increasing burden for the army there are really no new settlements , but there are outposts that i inherited , he told the labor party rally he said he expected 10 settlements to be closed down by noon today , adding , and afterward i intend to take away more outposts peace now , a leftist organization that has kept close track of settlement building , in part with photographs from the air , disagrees with mr beneliezer s contention about settlement outposts it released a report today saying that 44 outposts had been thrown up by settlers during mr beneliezer s term as defense minister the settlers' organization , the yesha council , denounced the defense minister s decision as encouragement for terrorism much of what was going on today with the outposts was political theater mr beneliezer , who is chairman of the labor party and a potential challenger for prime minister , is trying to prove to his traditionally more dovish members that he is not a clone of the hawkish likud party incumbent , prime minister ariel sharon the settlers , for their part , have thrown up a number of outposts with only a few families or , sometimes none as bargaining chips , to be sacrificed to keep their more substantial holdings nevertheless , the issue is serious and has the potential for more violence about 100 , 000 settlers were in the west bank and gaza strip when the oslo peace accords were signed in 1993 nearly 200 , 000 are in settlements today construction began today on a security fence on jerusalem s outskirts , part of the fence and other physical barriers that israel is constructing throughout the west bank to separate palestinians from israelis mr beneliezer said the jerusalem fence was meant to prevent any possibility of penetration through bethlehem , beit jala and beit sahur , referring to nearby palestinian towns in washington today , president bush s senior foreign policy advisers commented on mr bush s call for yasir arafat to be removed as the palestinian leader they suggested that even if he were reelected the palestinians' leader , it would not improve his low standing with the bush administration and that his reelection would jeopardize the chances for peace secretary of state colin l powell appeared on three morning talk shows that s their choice to make , secretary powell said on the cbs news program face the nation , but if mr arafat remains in power , then it s unlikely we 'll have any more success and it will not improve the situation secretary powell also challenged a report in the new york times today of speculation that mr bush or vice president dick cheney may have wanted to delay further diplomacy in the middle east until after this november s congressional elections never once in any of those discussions , and i was in every one of those discussions , was there the slightest reference to the congressional election coming up in the united states , secretary powell said on face the nation tensions remained high in the west bank , where many palestinians remain under curfews in the alamari refugee camp in ramallah , soldiers ordered all males ages 15 to 55 to report for questioning the army said that when it stopped two palestinian ambulances , it found and arrested 27 men , some of them palestinian police officers , trying to get back to the gaza strip a bomb exploded by the railroad tracks early this morning at lod , just south of tel aviv although

two of the senior enron executives who were sharply criticized in a report by a special committee of the board are expected to leave the company members of the senior staff at enron have been told that richard a causey , the chief accounting officer , and richard b buy , the chief risk officer , are expected to leave the company and are currently negotiating the terms of their departures the situation is in flux , according to people close to the board while the report examined the role of other executives who remain at enron , including jeffrey mcmahon , enron s new president , and james v derrick jr , the general counsel , it focused on the responsibilities of mr causey and mr buy in providing accounting and riskmanagement controls at enron an enron spokesman and a lawyer for mr causey and mr buy did not return phone calls seeking comment none of the four executives had a direct role in the arrangement outlined in the report that used the partnerships to inflate profits and enrich some employees but none of the executives alerted the board to troubling signs that these partnerships posed problems , according to the report mr causey , mr buy and mr derrick were all broadly responsible for overseeing what the company told investors about the partnerships , and they all played a part in the general oversight of enron s finances mr derrick s lawyer , j clifford gunter , said mr derrick could not comment on the report but the two executives with explicit duties to oversee the partnerships , reviewing transactions between the partnerships and the company , were mr causey and mr buy while the report says they did not ignore their duties , they interpreted their roles very narrowly and did not give the transactions the degree of review the board believed was occurring as the most senior accounting officer , mr causey was ultimately responsible for enron s financial reporting , according to the report he presided over and participated in a series of accounting judgments that , based on the accounting advice we have received , went well beyond the aggressive , said the report mr causey also had a significant role in the decisions surrounding what enron would make public , according to the report although the report depicted him as relying on the advice of the company s outside accountant , arthur andersen , he was described as the final arbiter of unresolved differences among the various contributors to the financial reporting process the report concluded that enron s disclosures , involving the compensation of the former chief financial officer involved in the partnerships and a variety of transactions between the partnerships and the company , were fundamentally inadequate because of mr causey s specific responsibility with reviewing enron s transactions with the ljm partnerships , he should have been in a position to provide advice concerning the disclosures , according to the report the evidence we have seen suggests he did not the report criticized mr buy for neglecting his role in reviewing and approving all of the transactions between the partnerships and enron mr buy never followed a procedure to identify all the transactions and did not , in the report s words , affirmatively carry out his responsibility for carefully reviewing the economic terms of all of the transactions the wall street journal reported yesterday that both mr causey and mr buy were being placed on leave the board s report provides less detail on the role of mr derrick , enron s general counsel , who oversaw the dozens of inhouse lawyers involved the report does , however , suggest that mr derrick and enron s inhouse legal staff played some role in determining what enron told the public , in conjunction with the company s outside accountants and lawyers mr derrick was also at the center of enron s investigation of the concerns raised by sherron s watkins , an enron executive , last august , according to the report in consultation with kenneth l lay , enron s chairman , he selected vinson elkins , despite potential conflicts , as the law firm to conduct the preliminary inquiry and severely limited its range the scope and process of the investigation appear to have been structured with less skepticism than was needed to see through these particularly complex transactions , the report said even mr mcmahon , who was named enron s president last month as part of the team now leading enron s restructuring , appears to be among the many executives who failed to speak up , according to the report while mr mcmahon raised doubts about the partnerships as early as march 2000 , according to the report , he appears never to have voiced them to mr lay or the board all four executives were named in a lawsuit concerning possible insider trading because of their sales of enron stock in recent years according to the lawsuit , mr causey sold 133 million in stock , mr derrick sold 127 million , mr buy sold 43 million and mr mcmahon sold 27 million mr derrick never exercised a single option that was not about to expire , according to his lawyer in the end , the report highlights what appear to be a series of failures of the various checks in place that led to 1 billion in false profits and the crisis in confidence that culminated in enron s filing for bankruptcy last fall at any point , concerns raised by the legal , accounting or riskmanagement executives involved might have prevented the company s collapse , according to robert mittelstaedt jr , a professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania it takes a whole series of mistakes to go so very badly , he said
i hate to see that evening sun go down collected stories by william gay 303 pp new york the free press 24 a while back , i spent an evening strolling along beale street with a friend , a classically trained musician of daunting discernment who is given to dismissing my own crude musical opinions by adopting a faraway look and an olympian pout as we walked past the loud , smoky blues joints , i did n't expect the music to prompt any admiring comments , but as we neared yet another proppedopen saloon door he raised his hand and came to a halt that drummer , he said hear that drummer \? he stood there , ear cocked toward the band , wearing an expression of surprised satisfaction when the song ended , i asked if the drummer had done something highly complex or innovative not really , my friend said it s just that what he did do , he did perfectly that appreciative summation would apply nicely to the fiction of william gay not a fancy writer , or given to hectic stylistic innovations , he s a straightforward , even traditional , explorer of the human heart , and there s none better at work today gay is richly gifted a seemingly effortless storyteller , a writer of prose that s fiercely wrought , pungent in detail , yet poetic in the most welcome sense consider , for example , this passage from the title story of his first collection , i hate to see that evening sun go down , in which an old man has escaped from a nursing home and returned to his farm , only to find that his son has already ceded him to death and taken on renters he was suddenly and against his will assailed by memory it came to him that he was a repository of knowledge that was being lost , knowledge that no one even wanted anymore the way the earth looked and smelled rolling off the gleaming point of a turning plow , the smell of the mule and the feel of the sweathardened harness and the way the thunderheads rolled up in the summer and lay over the hills like malignant tumors and thunder booming along the timberline and clouds unfolding in a fierce and violent coupling and seeding in the furrows a curious gift of ice that lay gleaming in the black loam like pearls gay was born in 1943 and has long lived in rural tennessee , employed at various bluecollar trades he seems to have no deep affiliation with any institution of higher learning instead , his career has come about in the manner of authors of old , finding his own means to keep himself afloat while learning to write his first novel , the long home , was published in 1999 and revealed an already high level of artistic maturity he followed that novel with another , equally adroit , called provinces of night that he has managed , in so brief a span , to produce two fine novels , and now an accomplished volume of short stories , suggests that he s worked long and hard on his craft when the stories in this collection are read front to back , it s not their range that impresses so much as it is their depth of feeling they can be gothic , funny , violent , romantic and stark , yet they 're always compassionate gay s protagonists tend to have a number of things in common most are male , working class \( if they work \) , at ease with liquor and the vices that serve as an accompaniment to drink , familiar with the baffling ways of romance but slow to become wise to them several stories feature characters who find that by making one slight misjudgment and following it with another , they quickly slide from a merely befuddled existence into something truly wretched as a man called karas says in crossroads blues well , i did n't set out to act like a fool it sort of happened to me a little at a time these stories are set in or near the tennessee countryside , amid a roughhewn population several take their shape from elements of crime in fact , there is violence and violent death throughout the collection it usually comes about almost casually , reflexively , but behind it there s often a sort of old testament rationale , skewed and no longer accepted by society but remembered and resorted to under stress young girls take potshots at their boyfriends , fathers snuff out young men who keep company with their daughters , men and women alike reach full boil and suddenly let rip in the most unsettling story , the paperhanger , a murder occurs in a flash , merely because of a toddler s haughty expression he remembered the look on the child s face spite had crossed it like a flicker of heat lightning she stuck her tongue out at him his hand snaked out like a serpent and closed on her throat and snapped her neck before he could call it back gay has clearly been formed by the southern literary tradition , but his stories feature characters who would be recognizable in most other parts of the world some are old men who once farmed but are powerless in the face of changing ways and lost without that attachment to the land others are a generation removed from working a plow or reading the sky for signs of the weather and now must make their way in a shifting culture not based on any familiar social order many are people who have intense emotions they ca n't quite acknowledge , let alone gain access to they make hasty choices that are appropriate to a world they 're not living in anymore and disastrous in this one they 're like the man called finis beasley , in the story sugarbaby , who shoots a dog because he s bothered by its incessant yipping and is bewildered when his entire existence unravels from this single act for the first time he realized that sometimes in life you go through doors that only open one way you can stand before them and think about whether you want to go through them or not but when you do and the door closes behind you there is no way to go back author s query for a book on arnold rothstein , the new york city gambler who reputedly fixed the 1919 world series , i would like to hear from anyone who might have personal papers , diaries or oral histories related to rothstein s life and his involvement in the mobster underworld in new york and the midwest of the 1920 s stephen handelman 102 west 85th street 8f new

the new head of a regulatory body usually takes over an operation that is up and running the appointee can decide what issues to pursue in setting an agenda for the agency for william h webster , named on friday to head the new public company accounting oversight board , the reverse is true he and his four colleagues will have to decide the most basic matters , ranging from where the board will meet to how it will function they must also hire a staff that will no doubt be sizable but the issues on their agenda are set by law , and some of them are highly charged in the current atmosphere as it begins , the board must decide the extent to which it is willing to simply continue with rules on the conduct of audits that already exist it will deal with the question of whether to further restrict consulting activities by auditing firms it also needs to set up a mechanism to review the quality of audits and to discipline auditors the law calls for the board s staff to review actual audits in determining whether an accounting firm has met its professional responsibilities all those decisions will be made in an atmosphere tinged with politics and suspicion many in the accounting profession were insulted by the very decision to create the board , and fear that it will be unreasonably tough but many of those who pushed for a tough law fear that the board will be too willing to listen to the accounting industry s leaders those tensions were reflected in the bitter division of members of the securities and exchange commission in appointing mr webster to reformers , it is clear that auditors have failed far too often to live up to their mandate of protecting investors by being independent reviewers of corporate accounts highly publicized cases where auditors gave in to clients have damaged confidence but the leaders of the auditing profession think that few changes are needed , and that the board should defer to the existing industry practices and standards for the board , the decisions on discipline may in the end be the most important but it will be a challenge for mr webster and his colleagues to show the public that they are doing anything assuming they are that is because the law , seeking to protect the reputations of accountants who might be wrongly accused , and of accounting firms , mandates extensive secrecy if the board concludes that the quality control systems of an auditing firm are deficient , it must keep that finding secret for a year , and then can release it only if it finds that the firm has failed to make corrections if it does make corrections , the board s opinion is to be kept secret forever , and investors will presumably never learn that audits they relied upon were issued by a firm with such problems similarly , while the board is able to impose penalties on individual auditors or audit firms , it must keep secret its hearings and its decisions until the sec has considered any appeal some regulators think that the board should look for a way to publicize its actions , perhaps with names deleted or though periodic reports , in an effort to get around the secrecy rules it will be interesting to see what steps , if any , the board takes in that regard but before that happens , the board will need to decide where its primary meeting place will be the board will be based in washington , but there has been consideration given to having most of its operations in new york , where the financial markets are located and the major accounting firms are based then there is the question of how the board will function the law allows it either to let each member take on specific responsibilities , like auditing standards , or to operate more like a committee , with the entire board making decisions an important early decision will be the board s adoption of auditing standards while accounting standards setting the rules for when profits can be recognized , for instance are set by another group , the financial accounting standards board auditing standards determine what steps auditors must take to ensure that financial reports conform to the accounting rules it can , if it wishes , adopt the existing standards set by the auditing standards board of the american institute of certified public accountants given the perception that those standards have been weak and that the accounting institute bitterly fought many provisions of the new law this would be interpreted by some as a backing away from reform but to set new standards will require promptly establishing a quality staff and making quick decisions in several areas , the board is authorized , if it wishes , to largely rely on the accounting institute or it can establish its own advisory bodies if it does the latter , the appointments to those bodies could be an important sign of where the board is heading then there is the issue of new restrictions on consulting by auditing firms the legislation bars auditors from performing a number of services for their auditing clients , but also gives the board the power to add to that list how it approaches this will be closely watched the new board includes willis d gradison jr , a former congressman kayla j gillan , a former lawyer for the california public employees' retirement system daniel l goelzer , a former sec general counsel who is also a certified public accountant and charles d niemeier , the chief accountant of the sec s division of enforcement , in addition to mr webster , who was a securities lawyer many years ago before becoming a federal judge , head of the fbi and director of central intelligence contrary to what some had expected , none of the members served on the public oversight board , which can be viewed as a predecessor body that board tried to oversee the auditing profession but could not mount its own inspections of the accounting firms instead , it had to rely on peer reviews by other firms and when it tried to expand the scope of its actions , it clashed with the accounting institute over financing few think that the public oversight board did a good job , but the lack of memory of its struggles could be a handicap for the new agency in the end , much of what happens may be determined by what scandals , if any , erupt as decisions are being made , and perhaps by the course of the stock market it was the enron scandal that got congress talking , and it was the worldcom scandal that broke what appeared to be a congressional deadlock and led to passage of a law much tougher than the accounting industry expected or wanted new scandals while major decisions are being made could step up the pressure for change , while a rising stock market and a lack of scandals could strengthen the hands of those who

washington we 're the white hats , but we 're planning a black propaganda campaign against the axis and even the allies people at the defense department and elsewhere are cringing at the news that the pentagon s shadowy new office of strategic influence is plotting to plant deliberately false stories in the foreign press , with both feral and friendly nations covert disinformation activities have always been the province of the cia but brig gen simon worden , the head of the osi , envisions a mission of psychological operations , or psyops , that goes from the blackest of black programs to the whitest of white , as a senior pentagon official told the times william cohen , defense secretary under president bill clinton , said on cnn that we are talking about deceiving the media and the public in general in foreign countries , and that would be a mistake our government should n't need to lie to justify its increasingly broad and intricate war against terrorism holy gulf of tonkin ! besides , there s enough real bad stuff about the bad guys they 're evildoers , after all we do n't need to make up stuff to pin on them but let s look on the sunny side at least the bush administration is trying to disseminate information , even if it s fictional usually it s trying to suppress information , even if it s consequential the bushes and anyone they allow into the club like to govern and conduct their wars behind closed doors dick cheney is making an effort to get out , popping up at the council on foreign relations and on jay leno last night but he remains so hushhush on what we really want to know , he s the man who was n't there karen hughes and karl rove keep a childproof cap on even the most anodyne information that s exasperating in normal times but it s a whole lot more troubling when we 're hatching so many schemes around the globe and when americans may be asked to kill and to die in the service of these objectives the pentagon owes us accurate civilian casualty counts as it targets all the extratall men in the mountains of afghanistan , and the justice department needs to let us know who is being rounded up and detained and why if the bush inner circle had a higher regard for journalism , and for the role of truth in public affairs , it would understand how repellent it is for the american government to hide the truth , delay the facts or peddle phony stories to news organizations overseas it should immediately nix the pentagon scams about disinformation and while it s at it , it should curb all the other ways the white house disses information , like karinformation oodles of aggrandized anecdotes about the president , bathed in ms hughes s rosy , alliterative glow , tightly controlled and parceled out to a select few journalists who can be trusted not to challenge the official version karlinformation news from the white house politically gamed to within an inch of its life mr rove s inclinations became clear when he called top journalists around town the day after 9 11 to explain that the president had not returned to washington immediately because of a threat to air force one that turned out to have as much merit as his stubborn insistence that the administration s ethics have n't been slicked by big oil viceinformation information s sorry sibling , as in none at all mr cheney justifies this vacuum of accountability by spurious qualms about privacy in the west wing it is not executive privilege that is in danger of deteriorating , but rather the right of the public to be privy to executive decisions fleischinformation a dense thicket of seemingly informative prose that , on close inspection , does not have a single verdant shrub in it calling ari fleischer a great evasive bore , michael kinsley wrote fleischer speaks a sort of imperial court english , in which any question , no matter how specific , is parried with general assurances that the emperor is keenly aware and deeply concerned and firmly resolved and infallibly right and the people are fully supportive and further information should be sought elsewhere our cause is just so why not just tell the truth \?
if medaglia d'oro had captured the breeders' cup classic 15 days ago as the 52 favorite , derrick davis might have walked away with a lot of money and not drawn much scrutiny the 4 million classic is north america s richest horse race , and any number of bettors would have pocketed a modest amount if medaglia d'oro had finished first on that cold , gray afternoon at arlington park outside chicago a much smaller group the holders of 18 winning picksix tickets each worth 141 , 666 would have made a fortune no one would have made more than mr davis , 29 , of baltimore , the owner of a computer service business he would have had 6 of the 18 winning picksix tickets , a startling achievement in itself , but one that might still have allowed him to get lost in the small crowd that had managed to pick the winners of six straight breeders' cup races but medaglia d'oro did not win that oct 26 race instead , the 441 long shot volponi did , the steam from his nostrils cutting into the air as he stormed across the finish line in the last of the day s championship races and because of volponi , there were only six winning picksix tickets , all of them held by mr davis , worth 428 , 392 each instead of receiving accolades for his handicapping prowess , mr davis found himself under suspicion for a score too good to be true , one that now has him and two other former drexel university students in the cross hairs of a widening investigation that includes the federal bureau of investigation in new york and baltimore and the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york at the heart of the investigation is whether one of the three men , chris harn , a computer specialist , manipulated mr davis s bets after they were made so that he was guaranteed to win at stake is the credibility of the racing industry and the integrity of the computer systems that now process more than 145 billion a year in wagers in this country mr harn was a senior programmer for autotote , one of three companies in the united states that handle the bets made at racetracks and offtrack betting parlors and from the living rooms of people who possess telephone betting accounts it is a growing system that allows horseplayers in california to bet comfortably on races in florida , and for people in the bronx to put down money on a race in kentucky but it is also a system , computer security experts say , that has obvious holes in it that can be exploited and conceivably turned into milliondollar frauds , particularly ones involving the ultimate score for horseplayers the pick six , a wildly lucrative format that did not exist in the united states until 1980 investigators say they are examining whether mr harn dipped into the autotote computers on breeders' cup day and changed mr davis s bets after the first four races had been run because of the large amount of computer information , the bets are not transferred until after the fifth race , providing an opportunity for tampering mr davis had bet every horse in the last two races of the pick six , so he could not lose if he had the first four races right his total winnings on the day were more than 3 million mr harn is also suspected of tampering , in the same fashion , with pickfour and picksix bets made earlier in october by glen dasilva , a third man under investigation mr dasilva s bets yielded more than 100 , 000 in winnings like mr davis , he placed his bets via touchtone telephone at an offtrack betting hub in catskill , ny , where there was no recording devices to keep an audio record of the original bets none of the three have been charged with any crime , and all three say they are innocent mr harn has been fired by his company , however , which has termed him a rogue software engineer and has implied he had tampered with the breeders' cup bets a law enforcement official said yesterday that the investigation was nearing its conclusion , and that criminal charges might be brought as early as this week the official also said that the investigation had not largely expanded beyond the three men the breeders' cup payoff for mr davis s six winning tickets remains frozen and the suspicions have left many bettors leery we have to move past this problem to where our patrons do n't lose sleep over integrity issues , said chris scherf , executive vice president for the thoroughbred racing associations , which represents the majority of the nation s racetracks the best way for that to occur is for everybody in the industry to have a healthy dose of paranoia right now the technology college whiz kids can make the grade in a sport long associated with dreamers and schemers , the three men who became friends at drexel have become the buzz of the nation s backstretch drexel , a campus of low brick buildings on the western edge of downtown philadelphia , likes to bill itself as the first wireless university in the united states it gained national attention in 1983 by requiring all incoming students to have a computer one of its more prominent graduates , paul baran , invented the technology known as packet switching and is credited with being one of the creators of the internet we attract students who have a real technological interest and superior technical skills , said philip terranova , vice president for university relations
even though the new york city marathon has long been a fixture on the sporting calendar , few runners remember the excitement that gripped us veteran road racers in the weeks before the first citywide marathon for me , the memories remain clear i have only to look back at my old running diaries my notes before the first fiveborough marathon in 1976 bring back the feelings of the marathon fever that gripped my friends in the small but growing marathon community most new yorkers had no idea there would be a marathon that fall but a few of us knew , and we cared a lot george spitz , an iconoclastic city auditor and runner , had come up with the idea of closing the streets and staging a 262mile race through all five boroughs at first , fred lebow , the president of the new york road runners club , thought this was a crazy scheme and he was n't alone but with george s persistence , fred soon embraced the idea and began turning it into a reality early in 1976 , fred approached me and the magazine i was then publishing , new times , to see if we would like to become a marathon sponsor i agreed to put up 5 , 000 and publish a program for the runners and the news media as the marathon drew closer , i ran regularly with two friends , the ballet dancer jacques d'amboise and leonard harris , a writer and entertainment critic neither had run a marathon before that made me , with three marathons under my belt , a veritable expert we took our training seriously when jacques traveled to paris with the new york city ballet , he stuck to his running program , and sent me postcards that described his progress ran 10 miles in the bois du boulogne at midnight following the performance beautiful ! my own training caused me to lose so much weight that i had to have my suits taken in in midseptember , fred arranged a news conference to announce plans for the marathon frank shorter , the olympic gold and silver medalist in the marathon , was the invited guest before the news conference , frank and i ran around central park to tavern on the green , where the news conference was being held mayor abraham d beame and the manhattan borough president , percy sutton , the driving political force behind the marathon , staged a mock race with frank the next day s news coverage was modest , but we were delighted to see anything in print in my role as a coach to jacques and leonard , i emphasized the importance of long runs on the friday afternoon before the sunday marathon , jacques phoned me with an obviously elated tone of voice it turned out he had just finished a 20miler i did n't have the heart to tell him he was n't supposed to do a long run two days before the marathon and i made a mental note next time , tell friends about tapering that evening frank arrived at my house , and we watched a presidential debate between gerald ford and jimmy carter i could n't understand why frank was shivering , even while he was indoors and wearing a parka , but then i did n't know anyone else with 2 percent body fat on saturday frank and i did a sixmile run on staten island before driving over the marathon course the final tuneup run should always be an easy one , but in chasing after frank , i had to push myself almost to the limit another mental note easy for one person may not be easy for another i feared that i may have left my race on the old staten island boardwalk marathon morning , oct 24 , we were up early to head to the start area my journal describes the scene at the verrazanonarrows bridge it was like a thrilling felliniesque spectacle the day was cloudy and cool , ideal for running as 2 , 000 of us waited for the start , helicopters hovered overhead with all the noise , i never heard the starter s gun , but began running when everyone else did at the 21mile point , i learned from a spectator that bill rodgers had won the race , with frank finishing second the course that first year made a brief entry into the bronx on the willis avenue bridge , with a uturn around a telephone pole when bill made the turn , he had a sizable lead over frank , and as they passed each other going in opposite directions , frank said , great race , bill at that moment the torch was passed from one man who had been the world s best marathoner to another who would assume that distinction bill would win three more new york city titles , as well as many other marathons around the world when i reached the finish line next to tavern on the green , frank was waiting for me we headed out to central park west to find a taxi got any money \? i asked frank no neither do i final note to self always put a 10 bill in your running shorts we managed to hitch a ride back to my house , which proved to be only half the battle it turned out that in my marathoning excitement , i had also forgotten my keys , so we went to the home of an elderly neighbor she brewed us hot coffee and listened with amazement as we told her of this wonderful new event that had just come to our town that evening , after my family returned home with our keys , we entertained about 100 people at a party at my house jacques and leonard had finished with good results , and everyone agreed that fred and the new york road runners club had staged a sensational race of course , none of us remotely imagined what the race would become the new york city marathon has a magic that has become more palpable over the years even more impressive , its spell has spread around the globe scores of major cities now have their own marathons , on stellar courses marathoning has become one of the few true world sports , and it all started in 1976 in new york photo george hirsch in the new york city marathon in 1976 , when the course ran along the east river the course shifted to first avenue in '77
she was 10 minutes away from being a champion , the trainer randy schulhofer said he was referring to exogenous , his prize racehorse , as she headed into the breeders' cup last october at belmont park a victory would have sealed her reputation as the best 3yearold filly of last year s racing season she never made it to the gate javier castellano is the young jockey who was on her back that day she was so excited before that race , he said in the paddock , i could tell already she s nervous she s sweating a lot , and moving her head around quickly , like she s always looking for something he wanted to calm her down , but there was little he could do when i was in the tunnel , castellano said , referring to the passageway that connects the paddock to the racetrack , i know something is n't right she s trying to stop we 're all saying , 'come on , move , move , move ! ' i want to keep her going , because she looks like she wants to do something , like she wants to flip the moment exogenous reached the track , she halted , reared up backwards and to the left just like she always wheeled , schulhofer said he was in the stands and did not see her fall , but when he saw castellano standing on the ground he cried , what has she done now \? castellano said everybody was screaming , and bam , she hit her head on the ground it was terrible there has been much speculation about what set exogenous off that day certainly , breeders' cup 2001 at belmont was as anticipated by racing cognoscenti and casual bettors as saturday s belmont stakes will be , and there will be the same distractions for the horses the flashing matrix of the tote board , the large video screen that was directly ahead of the thoroughbreds and the throng of members of the news media and fans yelling as they approach the track maybe it was none of those things that spooked exogenous , maybe it was a combination of them , as they were being experienced by a talented , emotional athlete add to those conditions the extra hoopla that will be present this saturday on the biggest day of 2002 in new york racing about 80 , 000 fullthroated fans , all feeding the escalating excitement of a possible triple crown winner any trainer whose horse has an excitable disposition will have to take all this into consideration three weeks before her accident , exogenous had won the beldame , also run at belmont , where she vanquished a very good field it was the culmination of a season in which she appeared to run better with each start nancy brennan , a veterinarian who first worked with exogenous when she was a 2yearold , said the filly was just reaching her potential she would go into a race like the beldame , and come out stronger than she went in , brennan said my father used to tell me that when a 3yearold is doing that , you 're just managing them they 're doing what they were bred to do but exogenous had an achilles' heel , a tendency to be spooky she was hyperreactive to visual stimuli and would often quickly spin around when she got distracted i watched her pretty closely because of the possibility that her personality would become a problem on the track , brennan said she was very alert she did n't want to miss anything dr sue mcdonnell , an equine behaviorist at the university of pennsylvania , said a lot of young horses , 2 or 3yearolds , get spooky when there is an abrupt change in their surroundings , like going from darkness into light they might walk from concrete onto asphalt , and it s as if they 've climbed into a pit , and that confuses them i think that the walk from the stables , through the paddock , and out to the track is something that trainers really worry about , especially with a highstrung horse incidents happen in 1989 , for instance , on the day before his triple crown bid at belmont , sunday silence was spooked by a television crew on the way from the paddock to the track and kicked his trainer in the head in 1999 , the accomplished filly three ring reared while being saddled for a race at belmont she fractured her skull when she flipped and had to be euthanized in 1998 , the trainer shug mcgaughey would not even enter the volatile coronado s quest in the kentucky derby he has the talent for the derby , mcgaughey said , but not the temperament the prerace procession that horses go through is entirely for the betting public and though it appears that many horses enjoy strutting around , for others it is a trying experience when asked about this , schulhofer said , if i could , i 'd take them straight from the barn to the gate mcdonnell said any reasonable , sensible person is going to say that this was just a freak accident , entirely unpredictable , and that her behavior was probably well within the range whereby the jockey felt she 'd be able to go on and do fine but , this question of what we can do when a horse is really in trouble is something that those of us in the horse performance industry should come to grips with i think there s a lot of room for improvement on just this issue how and when do you turn back \? when asked what kind of organized research has been done on spooking or on other issues like problems in the starting gate , perhaps the single biggest behavioral problem that trainers face , mcdonnell said , none after her accident , exogenous was taken to her barn , where she was treated by a team of veterinarians , including brennan but the trauma to her brain was too much her condition deteriorated , and she was finally euthanized five days later she was a funny , funny horse , said schulhofer , who officially took over operations in january from his father , the hall of fame trainer scotty schulhofer anyone who worked around her knew she had her peculiarities but she had never hurt herself before when i ran down to help her at the track , and saw her eyes , i knew in my heart she was gone most of the people involved in the racing industry exhibit an almost tender fealty to the horses in their care , and one would hope that horses like exogenous might , in the future , become the beneficiaries of treatments that will deal with their problems with greater sensitivity schulhofer recently leaned against a railing that fronts his barn and pointed to a building across the way that s where they first brought her in the ambulance , he said she was out on the lawn there , and she struggled so much to stand up , that she tore up all that grass exogenous will not receive the eulogy or the memorial that people would bestow on a champion , like the one that will no doubt be extended to seattle slew , who died recently but maybe she has left a poignant reminder of the fight that she fought , and the almostgreat horse that she was , by tearing up this patch of the earth a scar that is still visible photo the jockey javier castellano , left , comforted exogenous last october at belmont park \( associated press \)
denpasar , indonesia , oct 15 stacks of plywood coffins fill a parking lot behind sanglah hospital here on the island of bali all are empty the bodies that should fill them , 140 of them , lie frozen inside refrigerated trucks that could be their resting place for weeks or months to come nobody knows who they are , just as nobody is ever likely to know precisely how many people died in a terrorist attack that destroyed two nighclubs on saturday it is not that they have been abandoned scores of family members continue to arrive , mostly from australia , hoping , if not for a miracle , at least for confirmation of a death the confusion and disappointment the relatives experience echo the hardships of families who hoped for some confirmation of the fates of their relatives after the attack on the world trade center at the hospital the arriving families are given photographs to examine but officials here say only 30 of the incinerated bodies still have features that could possibly be recognized even those are so distorted and indistict that one woman has been claimed , with desperate certainty , by four separate families in the last few days , 40 families have been lucky enough to find sufficient proof of identity to claim a relative s body and return home with a coffin in one case the proof was a pair of unusual tattoos in another it was a hotel room key found in the pocket of a victim most other families face a long period of waiting as specialists examine fingerprints , dental records and samples of dna most of these bodies are n't going to be identified any time soon , said lee downey , an american volunteer who heads a crisis center at the hospital that has become a clearinghouse for information about the dead and missing in the end , many people may find that their relatives are part of the largest category of all , the missing that is a number that can only be guessed at , but the crisis center , collating reports from various consulates , puts it at 250 in contrast to the bodies that lie unidentified in the freezer trucks , a number of these missing people are well documented they left their passports and valuables behind in hotel rooms and never returned among them may be victims whose remains will never be found people whose bodies were destroyed by the flames or who , in the words of the australian foreign minister , alexander downer , were simply blown to pieces by the blast for that reason the confirmed death toll , now officially set at 181 , may not rise much further , although it is almost certain that many more people died in addition , an estimated 300 people were injured in the attack , many of them burned so severely that their survival remains in doubt there will never really be a complete count , said lyndall sachs , a spokeswoman for the australian foreign ministry many families who have gathered here may eventually take home with them nothing more concrete than the designation of missing , presumed dead from the first hours after the bombing , the hospital has been overwhelmed by the huge numbers of dead and injured there is no hospital in the world that could deal with this 180 bodies coming in at the same time , mr downey said of the crisis center in a poor country , where the hospital is disorganized and badly equipped in the best of times , he said , the process has been complete chaos from the start no one is in charge in a small office behind the chugging refrigeration trucks , called the identification commission center , there are no computers , only scattered papers on tabletops highranking police officers wander in and out , but none stop to take a seat at a desk one result of the disorganization at the hospital has been a jumble of confused and contradictory information there are people walking around now who were confirmed dead two days ago , said piers gillespie , an australian who runs a special information center set up by the indonesian government with as many as 12 , 000 australians in bali on any given day , the australian government has been besieged with requests for information as in new york after the destruction of the world trade center , photographs of some missing people have appeared on hospital walls with messages like have you seen this boy \? starved for information , many people have turned to internet bulletin boards where they share information and updates on their own stories devastating news for us , wrote one person in australia the two boys still missing were reported to their families by the australian consulate to be alive and on a plane heading to australia since then they have been contacted to say , sorry , we made a mistake it was n't them' photo visitors put on protective gear to enter the morgue at denpasar hospital to view bodies of bombing victims \( reuters \)
seoul , south korea , aug 3 the two schoolgirls were on their way to a birthday party on the morning of june 13 , walking along a rural road about 20 miles north of here , when an armored vehicle operated by two american army sergeants crushed them to death beneath its tracks seven weeks later , the girls have assumed an almost mythic place among antiamerican protesters , who have seized on the incident as the focal point of a renewed campaign against the presence of 37 , 000 american troops in south korea we want the dead girls to come alive in a world without americans , a protester screamed at a typical rally here on wednesday night in front of the city hall as the campaign gains intensity , on an issue that reflects the deepest korean sensitivities about american troops in their country half a century after the korean war , both american and korean officials appear uncertain how best to respond in the first days after the incident , the united states command said the sergeants were not at fault , partly because of obstructions that blocked the view of the road it was not until three weeks later , as demands mounted to turn the soldiers over to korean authorities , that the command formally charged them with negligent homicide the united states command , however , has not responded to a request by the justice ministry to surrender the soldiers , instead insisting on a trial by an american military court a waiver for the surrender of the soldiers to the korean authorities would be permitted under the status of forces agreement between the countries , but american military officials' refusal to grant a waiver has upset even some koreans who otherwise support the american military presence here we 're well aware of the need for us troops on the korean peninsula , said an aide to president kim dae jung , but many koreans say the status of forces agreement is unfair for koreans meanwhile , senior american officials , including top military commanders and the ambassador , have scrambled to extend their apologies for the incident american soldiers have staged candlelight vigils , collected donations for the girls' families and set up a fund to build a monument memorializing the girls none of these gestures , however , have quelled reports on korean television stations that have gained widespread credence that the sergeants on the vehicle showed no real concern about the accident and had a fistfight with korean soldiers attached to the united states army who were upset by their attitude these reports are absolutely false , said the statement from the united states command in fact , an army spokesman said , the convoy in which the vehicle was moving on a training exercise , halted while soldiers frantically called for help but the protesters promise to keep up the fight until the united states agrees to all their demands , including a personal apology from president bush and surrender of both the driver of the armored vehicle and the vehicle commander president kim , beyond issuing condolences after the deaths of the girls , has maintained a silence that reflects his political quandary ahead of national elections in december criticism of the demonstrations risks alienating some parts of his constituency on the other hand , supporting them could complicate south korea s all important security alliance with the united states
the justice department has begun an investigation of the management of the sunbeam corporation during the period the company was run by albert j dunlap , sunbeam said over the weekend as it proposed a reorganization that would wipe out the investment of its shareholders and leave its bondholders with almost nothing sunbeam said the investigation was being directed by the united states attorney s office in manhattan , and added that it had no reason to believe it was a target of the inquiry , although it had received no assurances instead , it said that the investigation focused on events that occurred during the tenure of mr dunlap , who was chief executive , and russell a kersh , who was chief financial officer both men were fired by the company in 1998 the disclosure raises the possibility that the legal problems are not over for mr dunlap , 65 , and mr kersh , 48 , who last week settled with the securities and exchange commission by agreeing to pay fines of 500 , 000 and 200 , 000 , respectively , and accepted injunctions banning them from serving as officers or directors of public companies in the settlement , the two men neither admitted nor denied the sec s accusations that they presided over accounting practices that allowed sunbeam to overstate its profits in 1997 and early 1998 the 1997 overstatement led the company s board to double mr dunlap s base salary to 2 million , but the board fired him after questions arose about the accounting the sec had earlier settled with sunbeam , by issuing a ceaseanddesist order without any other penalties lawyers for the two men , as well as justice department officials , declined to comment last week on whether an investigation was under way none of them could be reached for comment yesterday the sunbeam reorganization plan , filed in bankruptcy court in new york on friday , calculates that the company is worth a fraction of the money that it owes , and if approved the plan would leave the company owned entirely by its banks , save for a small equity stake granted to management and warrants to be given to bondholders that could have some value if the value of the company rises in the years ahead under the plan , existing shares would be canceled and stock owners would receive no compensation those shares , which traded as high as 53 in 1998 , when investors thought mr dunlap had turned the company around , closed on friday at 85 cents jerry w levin , who was brought in as sunbeam s chief executive after mr dunlap was ousted in 1998 , and who decided to file for bankruptcy protection early last year , said in a statement that the reorganization plan has the solid support of our secured lenders who will become the principal stockholders of the reorganized sunbeam mr levin added that sunbeam will emerge as a stronger , more competitive company with a new capital structure and substantially less debt the plan will be considered by the bankruptcy court at a hearing on nov 4 , after a hearing on the company s disclosure statements scheduled for oct 4 mr dunlap s reputation was high when he was hired by sunbeam in 1996 , and it advanced even further after his autobiography , mean business , became a best seller in the book , he embraced the nickname chainsaw al and said that firing thousands of workers was necessary to turn around scott paper , which was sold to kimberlyclark in a deal that brought 100 million to mr dunlap he was widely credited with turning around scott since then , his reputation has declined , with sunbeam blaming him and mr kersh for inaccurate accounting and with the sec asserting that scott paper s profits were also inflated under mr dunlap because certain liabilities were misrepresented in addition , mr dunlap failed to tell employers about his earlier work , in the 1970 s , as president of a private company called nitec paper that company also went bankrupt , with the owners accusing mr dunlap of overseeing what they called an accounting fraud mr dunlap denied those accusations , and left nitec off his subsequent employment histories under the sunbeam reorganization plan , the institutions that will end up owning the company are morgan stanley senior funding , with a 40 percent stake , and bank of america and wachovia bank , with 30 percent each the assumed value of that stock totals 400 million , and the institutions will also be given 100 million in fiveyear notes , which will have no required payments before maturity but will accrue interest at 5 percent the payout provides a 32 percent recovery for the banks , which lent the money in the spring of 1998 , when mr dunlap appeared to have turned around sunbeam and was using the money to help finance a series of acquisitions under the plan , general unsecured claims will be paid at the rate of 6 cents on the dollar that would cost the company 1 million in the spring of 1998 , sunbeam also borrowed 700 million from bondholders , a debt that has grown with accrued interest to 864 million under the reorganization plan , bondholders will receive warrants entitling them to buy a total of one percent of sunbeam , at a price assuming an equity value of the company of 550 million , or 375 percent above the value estimated when the company emerges from chapter 11 the company estimates the value of the warrants at about 30 cents for every 100 owed sunbeam also disclosed that it lost 1742 million in 2001 even without paying interest on much of its debt it said revenues declined to 2004 billion from 2076 billion in 2000 , when its loss , including interest payments , came to 14 billion the company said that its 2001 performance had failed to match its goals , and blamed the aftermath of sept 11 for part of the disappointment , which it said had hurt demand for its products that were related to travel , like luggage and hotel supplies in addition , it said that it had been unable to find a buyer for its professional hair clipper business , which it had hoped would bring in 125 million , and instead had to invest more money in that business the company reported that mr levin received a salary of 1375 million in 2001 and bonuses of 1295 million , including a 500 , 000 retention bonus under the reorganization plan , he will receive 2 million worth of restricted stock , and will invest 3 million of his money in additional stock , to be sold to him at a discount from the assumed value of the stock he and other executives are also to be granted stock options under the company s previous reorganization plan ,

and so , finally , we escape august , a month of deprivation all over the garden state tens of thousands of us spent an inconvenient chunk of it without electricity , thanks to that nasty storm early on all of us spent it without water , or at least our lawns did , or at least they should have it was , in short , the kind of month that can make us think about what we 're glad we have once , years ago , my mother posed a question at a family gathering name something that you 're grateful for not personal stuff like family or career , but a thing , an invention , a fact of life mom s own nomination was indoor plumbing , an innovation that , not so long ago , radically changed the way people live yet today is taken for granted my choice , i think , was the honeybee , without which we humans would have to pollinate every flower and apple blossom by hand it s easy to think of others airconditioning and electricity would no doubt top the list of anyone in the long branch area , where folks are still trying to shake off those long , hot days a few weeks ago when they had none others might choose cars or telephones or television , though frankly there are times when i could do without all of them these , though , are unimaginative , not particularly jerseyesque answers to my mother s question a panel of resident experts \( ie people who were n't on vacation when i sent them an email message \) was asked to apply new jersey brain cells to the matter , to come up with some things that we garden staters take for granted but ought to be grateful for one panelist was caren lissner , a writertype who lives in hoboken i'm thankful that it s easy to remember which town princeton university is located in , she said an excellent point who among us can say where the dreadfully named college of new jersey is \? hint it used to be called trenton state answer it s in ewing geesh , no wonder we 're not a destination state for the collegebound anyway , also on the lissner list she s thankful that some traffic reports use the word interchange instead of exit when talking about the new jersey turnpike it makes her feel more sophisticated while driving and she s thankful that three delis within five blocks of her house serve fresh wet mozzarella apparently she was responding to my query shortly before dinner and then there s prescott tolk , a comedian who lives in weehawken \( and will be mc at rascals in ocean township on wednesday through sept 9 \) i'm thankful for hbo , for transforming new jersey s public image from a pollutioninfested wasteland to a crimeinfested wasteland , he said also on the tolk list video poker , because when things are n't going well , it s acceptable to kick the dealer that combination crime and money brings me to one of my own entries for the thingstobegratefulfor compendium venal politicians new jersey may not have invented them , but we seem to churn out more of them than anyone else , and i say good for us politics is , at heart , a dull , sluggish line of work , full of billdrafting and negotiating and drab constituent service yet because we 're a democracy , we 're supposed to pay attention to it imagine how numbing that would be if we did n't have senators with a fondness for expensive gifts , mayors with hands in cookie jars , council candidates with untraceable income graft and corruption make democracy bearable along these lines , i 'd also like to give hearty thanks for gravity i do n't mean gravity as in seriousness i mean gravity as in the force that makes things fall downward rather than float upward for one thing , without gravity we 'd all have to be tethered to the earth like the hindenburg but for another thing , without gravity we would n't have one of the nuttier news stories of the summer see , for months about 100 , 000 had been missing from the municipal offices in manalapan investigators were nosing around , suspecting an inside job , and suddenly , two weeks ago , most of the missing checks materialized behind a cabinet a strong burst of gravity must have sucked them down there , yessir , though at last report investigators remained skeptical they suspect the thief got cold feet and slipped the loot into the hiding place so , as summer ends , let s hope the politicians stay corrupt , the electricity stays on , the indoor plumbing continues to have water in it and the gravity stays strong enough to keep the princeton campus from floating over to hopewell who could ask for anything more \? drawing \( nancy doniger \)
the nets no longer have the urgency to rebuild or restock their roster , so they can afford to be choosy with the no 24 pick in tonight s nba draft that choice , however , will most likely come down to the frantic five minutes allotted each team swept up in the murky 11th hour , rod thorn , the nets' president , spoke more in percentages than specifics yesterday he still believes there is a 5050 chance the nets will keep their pick , depending on the maneuvers of teams above them we 've got a list of 7 to 10 guys that we have a major interest in , thorn said during a conference call we 're very hopeful that at least one of those players will get to us but that s not guaranteed if a player does not get to us that we 're interested in , then we may very well trade the pick because what i do n't want to do , if possible , is take the player we feel is not a reasonably sure thing to make our team thorn said that it was unlikely that if the nets were to make a trade , they would do so involving a current player on the roster , but they could receive a player in exchange i 'd say i'm 85 to 95 percent sure it would be picks for picks or pick for pick , thorn said there s a 15 percent chance it would be a player for a pick last night , the nets were discussing their draft wish list where guards and forwards were split evenly , thorn said he expected that the nets' decision to choose a player or trade will go down to the final ticks of the clock i think it will , right now , i do n't know what i'm going to do , thorn said the nets finished their season on june 12 , so they only could arrange three days of workouts with 18 players but thorn said players on the list were not necessarily ones the nets had worked out two eastern conference officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that they believed the names on the nets' draft board could include shooting guard casey jacobsen of stanford , point guards frank williams of illinois and fred jones of oregon , as well as the foreign guards jiri welsch of the czech republic and mladen sekularac of yugoslavia the nets worked out maryland guard juan dixon yesterday and thorn praised him firmly as a good shooter with experience also invited to the workouts were ryan humphrey of notre dame , virginia s roger mason jr , rasual butler of la salle and the brooklyn native lenny cooke of central flint high school in michigan but it is likely none of these players would ever play for the nets there have been six different teams that have contacted us , all trying to move up , thorn acknowledged he added that there is very little chance the nets would move up in the draft themselves the nets are not the only team wary of spending money on a firstround pick that might not play firstround picks must be given a minimum of a threeyear guarantee , at a salary of 850 , 000 next season brandon armstrong was the no 23 pick last season , and the shooting guard played sparingly and was left off the playoff roster the nets already have 12 guaranteed contracts on the roster including the rookie brian scalabrine , a secondround pick from last season whose option the nets recently picked up for next year thorn , though , said he will petition the league to have jamie feick s contract removed from the salary cap since he does not expect him to play again feick had achilles' surgery before the season and the rehabilitation has not been going well , according to thorn with the nets' salaries reaching close to 53 million , already hitting the projected luxury tax range , paying for a marginal player would be a concern the nets still could draft a foreign player and let him mature in europe for a year or two and not have to pay for his salary until he came to the team to play or the nets could trade their firstround pick for a firstround pick next year thorn did acknowledge yesterday that teams have called recently to inquire about trades involving a player or players in the starting rotation , and while he would not specify , several league officials have suggested that keith van horn is once again on the trading blocks it is very unlikely that anything will happen before the draft or during the draft along any of those lines , thorn said
every so often a report comes out of a remote part of the world that is so shocking it makes us sit bolt upright and start thinking hard about global warming now it is news from the bolivian andes , where glaciers more than three miles above sea level are retreating with alarming speed , creating the threat of potentially disastrous water shortages according to a story last week by the times s juan forero , the glacier on chacaltaya mountain , which claims the world s highest ski slope , has been shriveling so fast that scientists predict its disappearance in 10 years chacaltaya mountain is hardly alone shrinking glaciers are a worldwide phenomenon great slices of snow and ice are disappearing in places from the austrian alps to glacier national park in montana , where the number of glaciers has declined from 150 a century ago to 35 today in 30 years , there may be none in the park at all the tropical glaciers of the andes seem to be retreating more quickly than any others some scientists have warned of a calamity in the making because countries like bolivia and peru depend on glaciers and the rain and snow that fall in the mountains for drinking water , for irrigating fields and for generating electricity there appear to be two reasons for the crisis one is a series of unseasonably dry years attributed to el ni o , the name given to the weather pattern generated by warm pacific currents off the south american coast el ni o has occurred with abnormal frequency in the last 20 years the other is climate change in bolivia , the average temperature has risen by 1 degree celsius in the last century , mirroring changes in some other parts of the world that may not seem like much , but it is enough to cause environmental havoc this unsettling news could have a bright side if it persuaded the bush administration to pay more attention to the global warming issue a report early last month from 18 leading scientists , published in the journal science , called for a concentrated national effort equal to the apollo moon landing project to develop energy sources other than fossil fuels most scientists now believe that the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has contributed heavily to the warming trend but just two weeks later , the bush administration called for further research into the causes of global warming given the degree of consensus on the issue , the research project looks like just one more excuse for inaction from a president who shocked the world early in his tenure by reneging on a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide , the main global warming gas , and by renouncing the kyoto agreement on global climate change but in view of the sobering news from places like the andes , it is hard to imagine that mr bush can sustain his casual attitude much longer
those of us who denounced the bush executive order last year setting up military tribunals for noncitizens and who were then besmeared by attorney general john ashcroft for aiding terrorists now feel somewhat reassured by defense secretary don rumsfeld s refinement of the hasty order the pentagon rules that will be made public today give suspected terrorists the rights \( 1 \) to the presumption of innocence \( 2 \) to choose counsel and to see the prosecution s evidence \( 3 \) to trial in public a great human right though classified information will be kept secret and \( 4 \) to remain silent with no adverse inference to be drawn the prosecution will be required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , the standard for trials of us citizens military judges , who can convict on only a twothirds majority , must be unanimous in any decision to impose the death penalty the president s initial order , which imperiously claimed a final decision by me on the outcome of these trials , has been modified \( nobody dares say reversed \) by the pentagon rule stating that a verdict of not guilty shall not be changed that s all to the good so is the element of speed in the tribunal idea if need for information about a terror attack is urgent , a quick charge and plea bargain could generate confessions that is the motive behind the notion of these tribunals not so much to do justice as to get lifesaving preventive intelligence here s what s less to the good no jury there is none in a courtmartial either , but at least the uniform code of military justice allows the accused a say in the composition of the panel of judges a buck private , for example , can demand that an enlisted man be included , which introduces a peer in judgment in doing justice , nothing beats a jury of one s peers hearsay is accepted as evidence the rules of evidence are loosened to that with probative value to a reasonable person because probative means tending to prove , that means onceremoved testimony and documents found in caves that have been through several hands would be admissible not our usual standard , but understandable here is what is no good at all no civilian review an appeal procedure is only to a panel of judges appointed to or by the military , which means no truly independent review the noncitizen tried by the us outside the us would have no appeal to our federal courts indefinite detention not a word is said in the pentagon rules about that contentious issue at all it is not in the american system of justice to hold a suspect in jail for long without trial no participation by congress in the making of what is undoubtedly law bush believes it would dilute the presidential war power to submit this alternative judicial system to the usual lawmakers in the house and senate but ours is a government of laws , not of executive fiats the uniform code of military justice and the court of appeals for the armed forces are creations of congress and do not weaken the executive branch besides , the war on terror is supposed to be a unified effort why go it contemptuously alone in setting up an extraordinary military judiciary \? thus , the pentagon effort partly sets right a deeply flawed executive order this is not the first time this year that bush has stepped back from the brink of hubris last month he coolly compromised his illadvised executive privilege confrontation with chairman dan burton s house committee investigating the fbi s threedecade coddling of criminal informants in boston in his correction of the other ashcroft blunder on tribunals , rumsfeld directed the pentagon counsel william haynes ii to draw on the wisdom of outsiders , including william webster , lloyd cutler , william coleman , newt minow , bernard meltzer , ruth wedgwood and griffin bell \( i'm told that haynes was careful to see them individually so as not to trigger the federal advisory committee act this shows what the administration learned from the vice president s energy advisory panel mistake \) federal prosecutors recently decided not to use terrorist tribunals in trying the 20th hijacker or the shoe bomber let s hope that means last year s notion of circumventing the civil courts , even as refined today , will quietly be shelved
denpasar , indonesia , nov 13 in an unusual effort to convince a skeptical indonesian public that the government had actually arrested a prime suspect in the bali terrorist attack , the national police chief interviewed the suspect today in front of scores of reporters , photographers and television cameras here the police chief , gen da'i bachtiar , sat across a small desk from amrozi , 40 , the islamic radical who was taken into custody last week , and held what seemed like a friendly chat with him for about an hour the public interview between the chief and the suspect did not appear to yield much new information , but that seemed to be beside the point the purpose of the interview appeared to be twofold to convince the indonesian public of the suspect s guilt and to build the credibility of indonesian law enforcement , which the public holds in low repute after the interview , general bachtiar told the news media about mr amrozi s life , the suspect s admiration for radical islam and the plans and execution of the attack that killed more than 180 people , most of them western tourists , in a bali nightclub one month ago mr amrozi is a member of a group the indonesian police say they believe includes up to 10 indonesians who organized the bali bombing he is the only suspected who has been arrested according to general bachtiar , mr amrozi told him that the local commander of the bali attack was a very clever indonesian known as imam samudra who also uses three other names fatih , fath and humada mr amrozi described the commander as younger than himself and fluent in english , arabic and indonesian , the general said mr amrozi , a car mechanic , told the general that he was designated as the buyer of explosives and a van in which the explosives would be placed for the deadly attack he was given , he said , a mixture of currencies worth about 4 , 000 including american dollars and indonesian rupiah by one of his coconspirators , called idriss according to the general s account , mr amrozi said he drove the mitsubishi van with the explosives to bali and arrived on oct 6 , six days before the blast on arrival he met four of the group imam samudra , idriss , and two men , both called umar in an example of how segmented the responsibilities of the cell were , mr amrozi described his activities in the following days as being less than he expected , and almost minimal he was moved to three different locations in the next few days , he said when he asked imam samudra about the whereabouts of the mitsubishi van he had driven to bali , he was told , that is none of your business , the general recounted at one point , mr amrozi said he saw two nokia cellphones wired for the remote detonation of the explosives when he asked about the phones , he was told , that is none of your business , mr amrozi told the general but mr amrozi said he was asked to complete one job , which in the end proved to be part of his undoing in the days before the blast , accompanied by two of his coconspirators , he went to a denpasar motorcycle dealer and bought a red yamaha that would be used as a getaway vehicle on the night of oct 12 the police later traced ownership of the motorcycle to mr amrozi

auckland , new zealand , friday , nov 29 team dennis conner had nearly caught up it was trailing its american rival oneworld by just 21 seconds around the final mark today , down three races to none in a fourofsevenrace series a perfect spinnaker hoist and team dennis conner s stars stripes would be in position to attack and , perhaps , to save itself but as the big white kite went up , it streamed to leeward of stars stripes and brushed the inflatable orange race buoy a cry went up from the afterguard no ! as the umpire raised his penalty flag dennis conner was out of the race and the america s cup challenger series it was one of those series where nothing seemed to go your way , ken read , the helmsman , said it s a shame the quarterfinal loss was conner s worst showing in his nine america s cup appearances in two previous campaigns as a challenger , he had not failed to reach the semifinals but this time , he seemed doomed almost from the start his boat usa77 sank off long beach , calif , in july after losing its rudder , depriving team conner of practice time having your boat on the bottom of the ocean is not a good way to do twoboat testing , conner said after today s race conner was also outspent by his competitors' backers the seattle syndicate oneworld , for example , is backed by the microsoft cofounder paul allen and the cellphone entrepreneur craig mccaw oneworld has double conner s budget oneworld sensed conner s weakness it chose his team at its opponent in the quarterfinal repechage , offending some of stars stripes' crew members but the wisdom of the call was borne out on the water conner s team led around only one mark for the entire series the first windward mark of the first race it spent the rest of the regatta staring squarely at oneworld s stern oneworld seemed to have a slight speed advantage upwind but conner s team was also outsailed , especially in the starting box , where the lack of practice time clearly showed with the 23yearold australian james spithill at the helm and the america s cup veteran peter gilmour calling tactics , oneworld won all four starts , often leaving stars stripes looking confused the italian team prada beat victory challenge of sweden by 1 minute 37 seconds in today s other race , winning that series , 40 prada and oneworld will race in the fourofseven semifinal series , beginning dec 9 the winner of that race will race in the semifinal repechage , facing the loser of the series between alinghi of switzerland and oraclebmw of san francisco team conner s poor showing in auckland will have interesting ramifications at home it could strain conner s relationship with his sponsor , the new york yacht club the last time the club backed conner was in 1983 , when he lost the america s cup to australia after years of tense relations and public recriminations , conner and the club patched things up some members have raised the possibility that the disappointing results this year could dampen the club s enthusiasm for supporting a syndicate for the next cup in 2006 in the meantime , team conner and prada will go before the cup arbitration panel on dec 7 and 8 to make the case that oneworld should be thrown out of the competition for stealing design secrets of other teams most cup watchers think the bid is a long shot , but if the panel disqualifies oneworld , team conner could be reinstated if not , at least one team member says he thinks conner will try again for the cup next time dennis has this in his blood , said tom whidden , conner s tactician and close friend asked if he plans to stay on for the next america s cup , conner said , we have n't finished this one yet photo dennis conner \( reuters \)
so , where s the rational exuberance \? the economy posted an impressive 58 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter , its best performance in two years the recession is over , and the economy will likely grow at a healthy if less spectacular clip the rest of the year even so , wall street remains in a funk , as wary investors find reasons to worry they fret about the contrary trends in business and consumer spending that have made a clear reading on the economy so elusive , the trade deficit , debt of all kinds , lackluster profits and possible oil shocks yesterday s jobless numbers are further cause for concern the federal reserve board and most economists predicted that unemployment would continue to rise during a tepid recovery , but news that the rate has inched up to 6 percent the highest level in eight years could shake investor confidence and consumer optimism it could also pose problems for president bush , who well remembers his father being attacked by bill clinton in 1992 for presiding over a jobless recovery few people expect the economy to sustain the vigorous pace it set in the first quarter the bulk of that frothy growth can be attributed to a replenishing of business inventories , a onetime affair unless acrosstheboard economic activity picks up alas , capital spending by businesses was down for the fourth straight quarter consumers , who account for twothirds of economic activity , heroically continued to spend freely throughout the slowdown , but there are questions as to how long this can continue zerointerest financing can talk you into buying only so many cars it is often said , however , that rebounds are built on a foundation of worry and there are reasons to believe that despite all the negatives , the economy , remarkably resilient in the aftermath of the nasdaq meltdown and the shock of sept 11 , is back on track , though it may proceed at a cautious pace improving global prospects should provide a boost warnings about a sudden falloff in consumer spending overlook the significant increase in real wages in recent years and the power of low inflation to boost confidence america s currentaccount deficit continues to grow , but there appear to be no credible threats to the nation s status as a magnet for foreign capital the leastheralded bullish indicator , one that explains much of what is right about this economy , is the continued robust growth of the nation s productivity rate , the basic measure of its output per worker this is what has alan greenspan convinced that he need not rush to reverse the 11 interestrate cuts of last year , that the economy has more room to grow , and people to earn more , without inflation the surprisingly steady growth in productivity is the one constant linking the exuberant late 1990 s to the more anxious present it suggests that despite the bursting of the nasdaq financial bubble , there was something real to all that hype about the new economy , and that perhaps all that investment in new information technologies is still paying off none of this is to suggest that policy makers in washington can assume that happy days are here again congress could hurt the economy if it fails to curb the administration s deficitinducing tax cuts , fails to pass freetrade legislation and fails to strengthen the integrity of financial markets in the aftermath of the enron scandal with meaningful corporate governance reforms
atlantic city , aug 17 with both the heavyweight division and his career in serious need of resuscitating , david tua found a quick fix tonight a very quick fix tua required all of 30 seconds to put michael moorer on his back before 4 , 741 dramastarved fans at trump taj mahal tua improved his record to 413 with 36 knockouts and further distanced himself from a loss to lennox lewis in 2000 the tua camp is hoping for a match against the world boxing association champion , john ruiz , lewis or perhaps a top challenger like wladimir klitschko even if none of those prospective bouts emerge , the 29yearold tua can at least feel heartened that he won a bout in the time it took fans to settle into the 200 ringside seats tua is regarded as the division s best onepunch knockout artist tonight he used combinations he sent the 34yearold moorer \( 4331 \) toward the ropes with two vicious hooks he then thrust a right hand that crashed into moorer s jaw and made him sag a left hook grazed moorer s head , and then tua finished him off with an overhand right it was 30 seconds of viciousness in the lives of two fighters who regard themselves as friends they met in a houston gym in 1992 tua told his friend after the bout that he loved him and that s the way it goes the knockout was there , so i took advantage of it , tua said moorer is six fights into a comeback after a threeyear retirement he said he would go back to the gym i got hit with some looping punches that i could n't do anything about , he said tua kept his professional streak of never having been knocked down or cut intact but against moorer he proved that he could show true promise the way he did when he knocked out ruiz in 19 seconds to jump into the heavyweight scene there s a few options out there i think , said tua s manager , kevin barry this knockout has opened a few eyes tua received 500 , 000 for the fight and is hoping to climb toward the 4 million he earned for going the distance against lewis in the featured supermiddleweight bout , sam hill was expected to provide a stiff test for the upandcoming jermain taylor instead , hill was fodder working against the occasional chorus of boos , taylor ran his record to 110 with a unanimous 10round decision taylor did n't lose a round on any of the three judges' cards and he landed 274 blows to hill s 40 the most offense hill , a st louis policeman , could provide was incessant trashtalking , taylor said he should have at least came to fight , he said i lost all respect for him right there in the ring that s not boxing taylor , 24 , from little rock , ark , won a bronze medal at the 2000 olympics his bronze medal from the 1998 goodwill games lies with his late grandmother , who was murdered by taylor s uncle , who then killed himself trauma has taught him patience as he climbs through the ranks , taylor said but tonight s boring victory might have changed that i'm getting antsy , taylor said on a night billed as everything on the line for the maincard heavyweights , the italian heavyweight champion paolo vidoz went from hopeful to woeful vidoz , a flatfooted brawler who captured a bronze medal at the 2000 olympics , lost an eightround decision to the journeyman zuri lawrence of wappingers fall , ny lawrence \( 1873 \) was supposed to help speed vidoz s stateside career rise , but lawrence stayed more active throughout the fight vidoz \( 111 \) , from gorizia , is best known for his mother s begging him to give up boxing on italian television after he lost his olympic semifinal to the eventual gold medalist , audley harrison jose navarro of los angeles \( 120 \) was impressive in a juniorbantamweight 10rounder he dropped javier cintron of puerto rico \( 107 \) in the first round with a right hook and emerged a winner by technical knockout at 2 05 in the second round in his professional debut , the junior middleweight sechew powell of brooklyn staggered aundalen sloan of milwaukee \( 341 \) with a stiff right hand in the first round , leading to a technical knockout in the second round i had a few jitters , said powell , a 2000 golden gloves champion then the bell rang and it all went away it was all about being patient and going in behind the jab
scottsdale , ariz , jan 25 duffy waldorf did enough to take the lead ty tryon did enough to make himself proud when today s secondround play was suspended because of darkness , waldorf was the clubhouse leader at 12 under par his second straight 65 gave him a 130 total , one stroke better than vijay singh and rory sabbatini tryon was six over par through 15 holes , with virtually no chance to make the projected evenpar cut when secondround play resumes saturday morning tryon , however , insisted he would remember this week fondly after his awful openinground 77 , which included five bogeys over his first seven holes , tryon , 17 , showed his resiliency , playing his last six holes today at two under par , including consecutive birdies at no 13 and no 14 tryon also soaked up the atmosphere , inspired by the fans who cheered him late this afternoon , while looking forward to his next event , the genuity classic , in miami \( feb 28 to march 3 \) tryon , the youngest player to earn his pga tour card , also showed his sense of humor when reminded that he was one of 25 players who would complete their second rounds saturday morning i made it to the weekend , tryon said , smiling i knew i 'd make it to the weekend somehow i learned a lot this week there was so much buildup coming into this tournament i had a great time i learned how to deal with all the pressure , and what happens when you do n't deal with it the right way i could 've given up i was seven over through my first nine holes , which is n't very good in professional golf but nine holes is n't going to ruin my whole year i just have to keep my head up and keep going waldorf , meanwhile , will try to keep it going this weekend a fourtime winner on the tour , waldorf is coming off a subpar 2001 , when he finished 120th on the money list and managed just one top10 finish knowing that his chipping and putting slipped last year , waldorf spent the offseason working on his short game , and it paid off quickly i 've been trying to be a little more aggressive around the greens , said waldorf , who made a 25foot chipin for birdie during a round that included seven birdies , an eagle and three bogeys my short game has been better this year that has really been the difference after missing the cut at the sony open in hawaii , waldorf bounced back with a tie for 31st last week at the bob hope chrysler classic building on that momentum , waldorf has been solid off the tee this week , enabling him to capitalize on the three par5 s at the tpc of scottsdale through two rounds , waldorf had made five birdies in the six par5 s the only exception was no 15 today , where he made eagle that s a good exception , waldorf said known for his colorful shirts and the unorthodox markings he puts on his golf balls , waldorf wore a relatively subdued outfit today , including a lightblue hat that read the duffy in a sign of the economic times , waldorf does not yet have an endorsement contract for the front of his hat waldorf has gotten some offers but none that he has found acceptable i'm not going to give it away , it s business , waldorf said instead of taking a low offer , you 'd rather just wait for a better deal to come along either a better deal will come , or times will change and there will be more deals available if waldorf wins this weekend , it will only help his business leverage and if he continues to putt as well as he did today , he will not fall out of contention waldorf made three putts from 25 feet or more for birdie , keeping the momentum in his round headed in a positive direction i have n't putted that well for quite some time , waldorf said i feel good on the greens it s interesting i was almost better off putting long ones for birdie than short ones for par so , while the tournament was far from decided , waldorf liked his position heading into the weekend , after missing the cut at phoenix last year i kind of found my game early last week and it carried through for a good tournament , waldorf said i'm playing well chip shots mike sposa made a hole in one at the par3 no 16 , using a 7iron from 170 yards the huge crowd surrounding no 16 went wild as the ball disappeared into the cup steve flesch , who began the second round with a onestroke lead , shot a 72 and fell to six under kirk triplett \( sprained ankle \) withdrew after an openinground 69 and shooting 36 on the front nine friday photo duffy waldorf was the clubhouse leader after the second round was suspended because of darkness \( jeff gross getty images \)

suppose you were a contestant on let s make a deal , the old television show the host , monty hall , presents three doors one hides a luxury car the others conceal scrawny goats you must choose the odds of winning the car are , of course , one out of three , so without much thought , you pick any door but then monty mischievously opens one of the other doors , revealing a goat are the odds better if you switch your choice to the other closed door or if you stay with your original selection \? it seems that it does n't matter after all , there are two doors left , so the chance of your being right is now one out of two but actually , if you switch doors , you are twice as likely to win this bizarre result led to such controversy even a mistaken objection by the great mathematician paul erdos that it became a frontpage article by john tierney in the new york times in 1991 here s the explanation of course a goat was always behind one of the two unchosen doors monty s act does n't reveal any new information so the initial odds of one out of three remain unchanged but now for the weird twist there must be a car behind one of the two closed doors if the car is n't behind one door , it s behind the other so if one out of every three times the car is behind the door you 've chosen , the other two times it will be behind the other door this means that the odds of finding the car behind that other door are two out of three as the audience might have correctly screamed switch !

paris cooing over her infant son , a mother tells him , you 're such a cutie , you can live here forever ! so why would darling tanguy , when we next see him 28 years later , be in a hurry to flee the happy nest , with its wraparound view of the paris skyline \? why move out when you have a thesis to finish , your girlfriends are welcome at the breakfast table and maman still does the laundry \? this cozy predicament is the basis for tanguy , the latest comedy from the french director tienne chatiliez \( tatie danielle , 1990 \) the movie has been a hit in france since it opened there in november , fueling a debate among the french about the growing number of young adults living at home longer it will have its united states premiere on march 13 as part of the rendezvous with french cinema festival , running from march 8 to 17 at the walter reade theater at lincoln center mr chatiliez , 49 , has made a fistful of winning comedies about the absurdity of family life but perhaps none have captured the public imagination more than tanguy , his first film in six years when a cover story on young adults who do n't leave home appeared recently in the french newsweekly le nouvel observateur , these latebloomers were called the tanguy generation the article said that in france , 627 percent of those 20 to 24 years old live at home , a figure that dropped by twothirds for those 25 to 29 and it said that young men and women in the latin european countries eurotanguys , it called them had even higher stayathome rates the fact that 30yearolds are delaying marriage , career , rentpaying and other facts of adult life is not a cultural phenomenon unique to europe but in france , perpetual students and other peter pans unready to brave the cruel world have the force of french law to back them up the napoleonicera french civil code states broadly that parents are obligated to feed , support and raise their offspring , leaving it up to the court , if need be , to settle disputes about when those parental responsibilities end mr chatiliez said his movie was inspired by the twisted logic in the true story of a 31yearold in italy who took his mother to court when she changed the locks on him she was ordered to take him back in and there are hundreds of similar cases every year in europe but while tanguy might be the role model for the stayathome generation , mr chatiliez pointed out that the movie , which he wrote with laurent chouchan , was not meant as a sociological study tanguy is not an everychild but a culture unto himself mr chatiliez refers to him as an extraterrestrial i did n't really have the desire to make a portrait of a generation who live at their parents' houses , because what happens to tanguy is not true for the whole generation , mr chatiliez said on a recent afternoon in his production office on the outskirts of paris those who normally live at their parents' house do so for more sordid reasons , because they do n't have any money he has plenty of money , and he has a real attachment to his parents tanguy \( eric berger \) is no loser he s a charming ladies man and an asia scholar who gets along well with his liberal , cultivated , welltodo parents apart from leaving his dishes on the table and his dirty laundry on the floor , he dresses tidily in vnecks or dress shirts and ties and wears harry potter glasses he earns his own money as a teaching assistant at the university he holds family meetings to brief his parents , paul and edith guetz \( andr dussollier and sabine az ma \) , on the postponement of his neverending thesis , reciting chinese proverbs to close his arguments and he never forgets to tell them he loves them before leaving the house , whether or not he is borrowing their car a lot of parents would dream of having him for a child , because he has a lot of great qualities , mr chatiliez said he has just one problem he wo n't leave the house and they feel they have failed in some way , because it s the parents' job to educate their children to fly with their own wings even the perfect child can get on parents' nerves after a while , and three suddenly becomes a crowd one day when edith , a happy wife and mother with her own career , has the epiphany that if proust s mother had n't died first , he would have lived with her until the end possessed by stressrelated hiccups and plagued by guilt , edith enlists her husband in a delightfully wicked campaign to cut tanguy loose when their schemes involving rotting fish , trick floorboards and sleep deprivation are met with blithe indifference , tanguy s parents become more desperate and absurd they turn his space into a baby room , relegate tall tanguy to a child s bed , shrink his clothes and revoke his privileges their adoration transformed into loathing it s a horrible story , it s 'les mis rables , ' mr chatiliez said it s a drama , but it s not treated like a drama i prefer to tell stories with a sense of humor , because otherwise it s too dark i think people smile at this because they are forced to admit feelings that all parents have at least 10 minutes a day toward their children , the beings they prefer most in the world his parents are terrible with him but i think if you can stay in your chair watching the film , it s because they do love him for his first major screen role as tanguy , the 33yearold mr berger who has been acting onstage and in movies for the last decade has been nominated for most promising actor at this year s c sar awards , the french equivalent of the oscars \( mr dussollier was nominated for a bestactor c sar \) but on a recent afternoon at a cafe in the marais , mr berger said that the role was quite a stretch i did n't understand a thing about this guy , he said , wearing tanguyesque glasses but looking a bit more disheveled with unkempt hair and in jeans i do n't know anybody like tanguy , he said in his case , he said , he and a brother were raised by a single mother who moved them often in search of better work he abandoned his universitylevel history studies after two years to act and left home at 21 but since the movie came out , i understand there are a lot of them , he said he now gets stopped on the street by reallife tanguys wanting to share their experiences with him the role represents something we did n't talk about much before and now we have a name for it it s funny i 've read in the newspaper parents saying things like , 'yes , our son is a bit of a tanguy' much of the humor in tanguy comes from his unruffled detachment in the face of his parents' growing hysteria but he s a smart boy eventually he takes the hint , leaves a note for his parents and sees them next in court tanguy eventually flies off in search of another nest no hard feelings but just when the guetzes are set to embark on that second honeymoon , they are met with another reminder that at least in france parents are parents for life the french civil code also stipulates that children of a certain age have the obligation to feed their aging parents just when tanguy leaves home , his grandmother in perfect makeup and pearls comes knocking and grandma knows her rights photo eric berger in the title role of tanguy , flanked by sabine az ma as his mother and andr dussollier as his father \( film society of lincoln center \)

not many people get to make history , but anyone can have fun rewriting it the history being rewritten now at columbia university , in a series of concerts , is that of mary i of england , long remembered by some as a catholic hiccup in the inevitable arrival of anglicanism and good sense no , says george steel , the organizer of these programs and no , agrees alexander blachly , who on saturday led his group pomerium in a superb concert of english sacred polyphony at st paul s chapel on the columbia campus for them , mary was a popular heroine and patron of the arts she let english folk return to the religion they loved , and she encouraged composers to get back to their great flamboyant tradition there are just two things wrong with this picture one is that thomas tallis , the preeminent composer of the period , had a long life and almost none of his music can be dated with certainty to the five years of mary s reign the other is that tallis s single work undoubtedly written for mary , his splendiferous puer natus est mass , suggests not so much a reawakened english medievalism as a grand swerve into the continental renaissance no matter what was important here was the magnificence of the music and of the singing if tallis did indeed write from 1553 to 1558 , all the pieces of his that were presented on this occasion , he was a master of quite diverse styles simultaneously , ranging from the majestic chordal movement of the puer natus est mass , of which the gloria and agnus dei were sung , to the labyrinth of the antiphon gaude gloriosa dei mater this work made of what mr blachly , speaking beforehand , aptly called ribbons of melody proved far more varied in texture , and only predictable in its harmonic direction at rare points of cadence different again were the other two tallis items the hymn salvator mundi , keeping its beautiful plainsong melody prominent on top , and the responsory loquebantur variis linguis , where voices in imitation seemed to represent the apostles at pentecost speaking in tongues works by tallis s contemporary christopher tye offered some severely strange harmonies \( kyrie orbis factor \) and radiant chords followed by teasing rhythmic details \( sanctus of the euge bone mass \) also represented were two composers of the next generation , robert white and robert parsons , both of them as ready as tallis to join in with what was happening across the english channel everything sounded marvelous under the chapel s dome sonorous with reverberation , but not to the detriment of contrapuntal clarity it helped of course that the voices were so well focused , with sopranos of pure luster and long phrasing , and a strong group of men heard alone in a vigorous performance of white s regina coeli photo alexander blachly leads the group pomerium in a program of catholic liturgical music from the tudor period in st paul s chapel at columbia \( hiroyuki ito for the new york times \)
the nation s largest health care workers union warned yesterday that the government s plan to vaccinate against smallpox for the first time in 30 years needed strong protections to avoid jeopardizing the health of hospital patients , health workers and the public the vaccination program moved a step closer to reality yesterday as the deadline passed for states and large cities to file their full plans to immunize health workers against smallpox , a disease that was eradicated in 1980 but the plans must wait until president bush announces whether he will limit vaccinations to about 500 , 000 health care workers or offer them to all americans no vaccination can occur until mr bush s decision because the government owns all stocks of smallpox vaccine since last summer , health officials have repeatedly said that the president s decision is imminent now , health officials say , the decision could come by midweek many health officials , administrators and doctors said that if vaccinations resumed , it would be after new year s day , to avoid problems at a busy time for hospital emergency rooms many hospitals are short of nurses and would find it difficult to find replacements for workers out sick because of sore arms , fevers and other reactions to vaccination we are trying to be as flexible as we can and still stay on a timetable , said jerome m hauer , who directs the office of public health preparedness in the department of health and human services in issuing a strong warning , andrew l stern , president of the service employees international union , said that president bush and congress have not done enough to protect and care for health care workers , their families , and patients who could be harmed by the vaccine the union said that the government needed to educate the public and health care workers to ensure that patients with aids and other conditions are not given the vaccine and are not exposed to people who have been vaccinated workers should also not be subject to repercussions at their jobs if they refuse vaccinations the union also contended that workers who volunteer to take the vaccine should not lose income if they have to stay home because of reactions mr hauer said that none of the issues were new to the bush administration and that some have been addressed , some are being addressed and some are not issues the federal government should get involved in mr hauer also said he and union officials fully discussed the issues in a very productive meeting last wednesday the union said serious gaps remain the centers for disease control and prevention , the federal agency in atlanta that is responsible for preventing and monitoring diseases like smallpox and overseeing the states' plans for vaccinations , said it had received full plans from about two dozen states and cities by yesterday afternoon and expected many more last night in the next few days , the centers' smallpox experts will review the plans to determine whether they need revision before any vaccine is released , said thomas w skinner , a spokesman for the centers the cdc will be reviewing a number of issues how many health workers the states and cities plan to vaccinate how many clinics are ready to vaccinate how many public health and medical response teams have been identified and how many hospitals in each state will be able to care for smallpox patients if any cases occur the recommendation for vaccinating up to half a million health workers came in october from an advisory panel to the cdc the panel chose not to recommend offering the vaccine to the estimated 10 million paramedics , firefighters , police officers and other workers who might also be among the first to respond to a biological attack earlier , the nation s top public health officials said they favored offering smallpox vaccine to the public , even in the absence of a bioterrorism attack , but only after the nation s 10 million health care workers were immunized and a new vaccine that is now in preparation is licensed for general use , which is not likely until 2004 smallpox vaccine , which is made from a live virus related to the one that causes smallpox , is considered the most dangerous immunization for humans before the united states stopped routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972 , lifethreatening complications occurred at a rate of 15 per million among those who received their first smallpox vaccination , and the number included about one to two deaths those at risk for such complications include people whose immune system have been weakened by cancer , aids or other diseases , the advisory committee said it also cited two common skin conditions , eczema and atopic dermatitis these conditions could disqualify as many as 50 million americans from vaccination vaccination can also cause problems like soreness and swelling at the inoculation site in recent trials of the vaccine on healthy young volunteers , about 40 percent to 50 percent had substantial local reactions , 30 percent felt impaired in their daily activities , and about 5 percent took time off from work or studies dr william schaffner , the chairman of preventive medicine at vanderbilt university , who also works for the tennessee health department , said experts expect that health workers would take more sick time than the research volunteers health officials are concerned about a possible timetable of vaccinating health workers in a month after a goahead is given several realworld considerations like the holiday schedule suggest revising the timetable , dr schaffner said he also said that most hospitals and many local health departments have not started planning for vaccinations compressing the vaccination program into one month will create a near simultaneous outbreak of absenteeism in all the emergency rooms in the country , he said the health care workers union also contended that the twopronged needles that the government bought for the vaccinations did not sufficiently protect against accidental needle sticks that could transmit the viruses that cause aids and hepatitis the union suggested another brand of needle but mr hauer said that that brand was too big to fit in a vial of smallpox vaccine he also said that health officials judged the risk of needlestick transmissions to be small
london , feb 5 there is no more coveted invitation in the realm than one from the monarch , but the opening of queen elizabeth ii s yearlong national party celebrating her halfcentury on the throne is not getting a rush response from her subjects they 're holding their breath at buckingham palace , said ben pimlott , author of the queen elizabeth ii and the monarchy is the 2002 golden jubilee going to be another triumph or a flop \? the silver jubilee in 1977 was deemed a success , with colossal crowds at scheduled events and 12 , 000 neighborhood street parties succeeding in revalidating the monarchy s hold on the nation the silver jubilees of victoria and george v were imperial pageants to which reverentially loyal britons flocked but this year the omens are not good , starting with the very first event last week , a flyover in the queen s honor at a royal air force base in east anglia in a rude encounter with the realities of modernday britain , she got stuck in traffic and arrived five minutes after the formation of tornado fighterbombers had streaked by earlier , the original organizer tapped by the palace resigned , calling the planning shambolic , after word had emerged that only 300 street party applications had been received , and government ministers expressed fear of a rerun of its botched millennium celebrations its centerpiece , the overhyped and underattended 12 billion millennium dome , still sits by the thames , vacant , unused and obvious such notions got a stiff upper lip response at a nonattributable background briefing at buckingham palace last week where the chief courtiers mounted an elegant exercise in damage control , assuring reporters gathered in the royal cinema room that there was nothing to worry about i 'll take a bet , the head organizer said if we can get together when this is all over , i know you 'll be amazed at the reaction this country will have had to this splendid lady , the queen but what of the inactivity thus far \? if you have a wedding in july , he said , ladies do n't go out and buy their hats in january the british public has become less deferential to the monarchy and less appreciative of the royal family since the last jubilee , but the court is having none of it through history families have had problems , but they tend to be forgotten , the briefer said i do n't know if this is being modest or immodest , but let me say that ceremony is a thing we 're not too bad at in this country few people would quarrel with that , particularly the millions of foreign visitors who are drawn to this gray land by its colorful pageantry it is no disrespect to the monarch to say they really put on a good show , said rodney barker , a political scientist at the london school of economics and the author of a new book about the rituals of rulers with that in mind , the organizers have laid on an itinerary of events for the queen , 75 , that would tax an american presidential candidate in a threemonth tour of the country , most of it via the royal train , she will visit every corner of the united kingdom , from congested central london to the hilly sheep pastures of wales to the conflicted cities of northern ireland to the mistenshrouded islands of scotland she has also scheduled commonwealth journeys to australia , canada , jamaica and new zealand with an eye to the changing face of britain s population , she will go to inner city areas and attend ethnic festivals there will be concerts for mass audiences and there will be stately occasions at churches , castles , banqueting halls and in parliament , with exclusive guest lists of the great and the good european royalty , many of whom she is related to , will honor her at windsor castle in june at 10 downing street in april she will be the guest of tony blair , who was born 15 months into her reign , along with the four other surviving prime ministers of the 10 who have served during her reign james callaghan , edward heath , margaret thatcher and john major she became queen on the death of her father , george vi , on feb 6 , 1952 , but public celebrations will be concentrated on the first weekend in june , when the nation will take a fourday public holiday planners hope to create a carnival atmosphere in the vast green spaces around buckingham palace with two openair concerts , one rock , the other classical , both relayed on large television screens to crowds in public places across the country on june 4 a grand procession of carriages , bands and troops in full dress will bear the queen through the streets of the capital to a thanksgiving service at st paul s cathedral the year is being heavily promoted as a lift to tourism in the aftermath of a huge falloff in visitors to britain over the last year , first because of the footandmouth epidemic that closed off large parts of the countryside and then the terror attacks in the united states on sept 11 , which kept people from flying while divorces , affairs , showy expenditures , dimwitted comments and exploitation of the windsor connection for private gain have tarnished the reputations of her children and their spouses , the queen has remained a dignified if grim presence through it all even those critics of the royal family and the monarchy say that the queen is a conscientious person doing a decent job , mr barker said he cautioned against making too much of the current indifference yes , it s not like 1977 , and the monarchy seems to have dropped somewhat below the horizon of public attention , he said but the thing about public attitudes in this country is that on the whole we are tolerably tolerant of our institutions like the monarchy , and it s sometimes a damn good thing that we are photos queen elizabeth ii ascended the throne 50 years ago today and five days later stood outside westminster hall with her grandmother , queen mary , center , and mother , queen elizabeth , right , as her father s coffin arrived to lie in state in rainy norfolk yesterday , the queen came smiling through \( associated press \) \( reuters \)
baghdad , iraq , dec 14 for a glimpse into saddam hussein s cast of mind as he weighs the threat of another war with the united states , there are few more revealing places to look than the mother of all battles mosque , a vast , newly constructed edifice of gleaming white limestone and blue mosaic that the iraqi leader oversaw from blueprint to completion on baghdad s western outskirts first , the minarets the outer four , each 140 feet high , were built to resemble the barrels of kalashnikov rifles , pointing skyward the inner four , each 120 feet high , look like the scud missiles that iraq fired at israel in 1991 during the mother of all battles , known to americans as the persian gulf war at their peak , these inner minarets are decorated with red , white and black iraqi flags there is more inside a special sanctum , treated by the mosque s custodian with the reverence due a holy of holies , there are 650 pages of the koran written , it is said , in mr hussein s blood as the official legend has it , mr president donated 28 liters of his blood about 50 pints over two years , and a famous calligrapher , abas albaghdadi , mixed it with ink and preservatives to produce the handsome writing now laid out page by page in glasswalled display cases a reflecting pool that encircles the mosque is shaped like the map of the arab world at the far end , a blue mosaic plinth sits like an island in the clear water the plinth is a reproduction of mr hussein s thumbprint , and atop is a stylized reproduction , in gold , of his arabic initials in this , as in all else , no expense has been spared officials put the cost of the mosque , in a country where many families live in abject poverty on 10 or 15 a month , at 75 million mosquebuilding on a scale , iraqi officials say , that no arab leader has undertaken since the days of the great abbasid caliphs who ruled the arab world from baghdad until the middle of the 13th century has become mr hussein s grand obsession he has set out to make baghdad the undisputed center of islamic architecture , as it was under the abbasids , and the only thing that has stopped him from building even bigger , the officials say , is a concern not to outstrip the islamic holy places in mecca , in saudi arabia a few miles from the mother of all battles mosque , two others are rising that will dwarf it one five times the size , with many similar features in celebration of mr hussein , is to be known as the mosque of saddam the great it is visible in skeleton form on the bulldozed plain that used to be baghdad s airport , and is due to be completed in 2015 a mile or two beyond , in a gigantic cluster of domes that seem borrowed from the design book for las vegas , is the alrahman mosque , meaning the most merciful , heading for completion in 2004 part of the message the iraqi leader is sending with his mosquebuilding is that he , saddam hussein , is the natural leader of an arab world yearning for past glories under the banner of islam that fluttered atop the arab armies that conquered much of the ancient world after the death of the prophet muhammad in 632 but the lesson encoded in the mother of all battles mosque , or umm almahare , as it is called in arabic , seems to be much narrower , and aimed like its kalashnikovandscud minarets at a more selected audience the united states with united nations weapons inspectors now heading out every morning with powers to search the secret laboratories and weaponsmaking plants that were at the heart of mr hussein s ambitions to turn iraq into the arab superpower , the iraqi leader has had to do something that he says outright , in almost every speech , he abhors having had to do bow down before the power of the outside world , led by the united states on several occasions recently , the iraqi leader has spoken of his concern that iraqis meaning himself , as the country s absolute ruler not be seen to be weaklings and cowards but along with this , there has been another message , and it is the one written in stone and marble at the mother of all battles mosque that iraqis are natural warriors , that they search ceaselessly for what mr hussein called last week the great meanings inside themselves , and that they are like coiled springs waiting for the moment of anger and revolt when they can avenge the wrongs done them by their enemies in short , that they are ready for war , as mr hussein said at a cabinet meeting this week , when he told his generals that your heads will remain high with honor , god willing , and your enemy will be defeated to americans , and to many arabs , it might seem chimerical that mr hussein could present himself as a man who has brought iraq glory in war iraq s eightyear war with iran in the 1980 s ended in a battlefield stalemate , no ground gained , with at least 500 , 000 iraqis , and as many iranians , dead the persian gulf war , which was triggered by mr hussein s 1990 invasion of kuwait , ended after six weeks of american bombing and less than 72 hours of land warfare , and the abiding image , for americans , of iraqi soldiers scrambling out of desert bunkers with their hands raised in surrender to american troops

whitefish , mont , may 11 using rubber bullets , flying beanbags and finnish bear dogs , tim manley , a montana wildlife conflict specialist , teaches grizzlies to associate the outskirts of this resort town with unpleasantness and pain when mr manley s class goes well , his hulking pupils always wildly hungry , sometimes wildly dangerous steer clear of the palatial houses springing up here in the mountain valleys of northwest montana , where the human population has grown in the past decade by about 30 percent and where at least half the grizzlies in the lower 48 states live this week , mr manley s class did not go well a car killed a grizzly cub on east lakeshore drive , not far from the multimilliondollar ranches of drew bledsoe , the buffalo bills quarterback , and mary hart , a host of entertainment tonight another cub was found about three miles away by an internet consultant driving to work the 4monthold bear was taken to mr manley s basement , where it mewled , shivered and suckled truculently from a baby bottle dna testing shows that the likely mother is 6yearold easy , whose rap sheet is long but nonviolent the 250pound female craves dog food and loves freshly mown lawns and scrounging around greater whitefish easy and the cubs are players in a new kind of turf war in the rocky mountain west , one that pits the soaring population of humans against a recovering population of grizzlies similar battles between people and resurgent predators are taking place in many parts of the country , but nowhere else are the risks so great if startled or injured , grizzlies will sometimes attack and kill humans since the traditional human method for winning wars with grizzlies shooting them all is no longer on the table , wildlife experts have had to improvise a plan b here in northwest montana , that plan is adult education for the grizzlies , as well as for the people who cross their paths it is hardly foolproof yet many grizzly experts agree that teaching the bears to associate human settlements with unrelenting hard times is probably the best approach for longterm coexistence there are not a lot of other options , said john waller , a research biologist who for 15 years has worked for the united states fish and wildlife service back before tim manley started experimenting with this stuff , there were just two options kill the bear or move them far away but we have learned you cannot move bears far enough away hunger will always draw them back to where they know there is food then you often have to kill the bear thanks to more than a quarter century of protection under the endangered species act , the population of grizzly bears in the united states outside alaska has stabilized at an estimated 800 to 1 , 200 the densest concentration is just east of whitefish in glacier national park , home to an estimated 300 to 400 grizzlies , some of which range outside the park grizzlies in the park in the last century have killed about 10 people last fall in western montana , a grizzly killed a hunter who was field dressing an elk compared to the black bear that is common in eastern parts of the united states , grizzlies are much more likely to be defensive of their young and aggressive when surprised not everyone in montana is delighted with the grizzly comeback some people attribute the decline in logging and mining to federal and state laws that close off logging roads to protect grizzly habitat one local militia , which calls itself project 56 , opposes road closures , the new world order and grizzly bears there is , however , considerable mainstream support in montana for the resurgent bears ranchers , who spent the better part of a century trying to exterminate them , have been donating cow carcasses to feed grizzlies for nearly a decade , game wardens have hauled rotten beef deep into the woods to teach bears where they should expect food after years of running over bears with its trains , the burlington northern and santa fe railroad now vacuums up spilled grain off freight tracks in northern montana since the vacuuming began four years ago , there has been a sharp decrease in the number of grizzlies killed by trains mr manley , who works for the montana department of department of fish , wildlife and parks , began shepherding bears away from outlying areas of whitefish in 1993 since then , he has caught 67 grizzlies , outfitted many of them with radiotracking collars and tried to teach them one simple lesson avoid people flathead county , which includes whitefish , is home to 74 , 471 people , an increase of 26 percent in the past decade if bears view us as aggressive dominant bears , they will stay away from places that we hang out , said mr manley , 43 , a wildlife biologist who often works seven days a week , 18 hours a day during the maytonovember season when grizzlies are active he works with the wind rivers bear institute , a utahbased nonprofit organization that originated the use of finnishbred karelian bear dogs as yelping teaching assistants in averse conditioning for grizzlies
jackson , miss , feb 20 the bush administration justice department is using its authority under the voting rights act to block a redistricting plan for congressional seats in mississippi that was drawn by a black state judge and is supported by blacks and democrats here the department questions whether a lowercourt state judge should have the authority to draft a congressional district map for the entire state because of the department s action , the plan likely to be imposed on the state is one written by a panel of white republicanappointed federal judges and is favorable to republican candidates bitter redistricting battles involving bareknuckle politics are being waged all over the country as states revise their congressional district maps to take account of population changes reported in the 2000 census the outcome of these battles could determine which party controls the house of representatives after the november election nowhere is the fight more byzantine than in mississippi experts on the voting rights act from both parties said in interviews today that they could not recall another instance when the justice department had blocked a redistricting plan that was clearly favorable to blacks the act , one of the landmark civil rights laws of the 1960 s , was intended to prevent discrimination against minority voters dan nelson , a spokesman for the department , said the move was not motivated by partisan considerations the question , mr nelson said , is not just whether this plan is fair to minority voters but whether the process is fair in this case and in future rounds of redistricting the main issue , he said , was whether it was proper for a state judge elected in one district to write a redistricting plan for the entire state , a procedure the mississippi supreme court has upheld some day , he said , a white judge might draw a map that was disadvantageous to blacks the fight over redistricting involves several odd twists the republican congressman who stands to benefit if the state judge s plan is blocked , representative charles w pickering jr , is the son of the federal judge whose nomination by president bush to the federal court of appeals is being thwarted by democrats in the senate the panel whose redistricting map is likely to be imposed is comprised of two federal trial judges who are colleagues of judge pickering and one who sits on the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , which he wants to join the governor here is a democrat , and both houses of the legislature are controlled by democrats , a situation that should have guaranteed an unfavorable outcome for the republicans but the democratic party is so riven by internal rivalries and sectional disputes that the politicians were paralyzed normally in legal disputes , republicans advocate states' rights and democrats strive to get matters into federal court but in this case the roles are reversed democrats on the house judiciary committee , led by representative john conyers jr of michigan , the senior member of the congressional black caucus , wrote to president bush last week to complain that the justice department action turns the voting rights act on its head representative pickering , on the other hand , said justice was being done because the federal court map has compact districts the democrats , he said , want to gerrymander the state in a way that has never been done before mr pickering said his father s confirmation as an appeals judge had become caught up in the redistricting fight the democratic strategy , he said , was to demonize the pickering name and to hold his father s confirmation hostage for a redistricting outcome favorable to democrats judge pickering seems to enjoy strong support from blacks in laurel , miss , his hometown , but that backing does not extend to the state s black political leaders in washington , democratic senators have criticized his stands on civil rights matters on and off the bench mississippi now has five seats in the house of representatives , two held by white democrats , two by white republicans and one by a black democrat the state lost a seat as a result of the 2000 census , a reflection of the slow population growth here in the 1990 s the legislature spent last year trying to draw a new fourdistrict map , but no agreement could be reached the only consensus was that the state s most junior congressmen , mr pickering and ronnie shows \( rhymes with cows \) , a white democrat who enjoys strong support from blacks , would be pitted against each other in a new district with the legislature stymied , democrats took the matter to the state chancery court , a trial court that handles civil cases on dec 21 , judge patricia wise approved a map that would have mr pickering and mr shows compete in a district in which 375 percent of the votingage population would be black the racial composition of districts is crucial in mississippi because nearly all blacks vote democratic and a large percentage of whites vote republican

new delhi , jan 2 india s defense minister , george fernandes , said today that the steps pakistan had taken so far to crack down on islamic militant groups fighting india in kashmir were illusory and had done nothing to reduce the level of terrorist violence mr fernandes , who is overseeing a vast military mobilization along india s border with pakistan , said flatly that he did not believe that pakistan s military intelligence agency had been ordered to end its support of groups fighting what they call a holy war against india , as senior pakistani officials said on tuesday the arrests of dozens of members of the two groups that india blames for the dec 13 suicide attack on its parliament were intended not to disable the militants , but to mislead the united states , mr fernandes said washington has been pressing pakistan to begin a crack down in the hope of averting a war that would greatly complicate its own fight against terrorists in nearby afghanistan with the british prime minister expected to visit the region in the next few days , mr fernandes said india would wait to see whether various diplomatic efforts had succeeded in getting pakistan to take effective action against the groups if they should fail , then we are left with only the option that the united states exercised to deal with terrorism , he said in an interview asked if he meant the military option , he said , that s right mr ferndandes is one of a handful of senior national security advisers to india s prime minister , atal behari vajpayee , and one of the more hawkish his pessimistic assessment of pakistan s progress in satisfying india s demands contrasted with the cautious welcome of the recent steps from other senior indian officials some of these officials have even suggested that this latest flaring of tensions could have a more positive outcome than such clashes in the past the remarks clearly seemed intended to send a tough message to pakistan s military ruler , president pervez musharraf , two days before south asian heads of state begin a regional conference in katmandu , nepal india is expected to use the setting to intensify the diplomatic pressure on pakistan to act against groups that both the united states and britain have listed as terrorist outfits the indian government has left open the possibility that its minister of external affairs , jaswant singh , would meet pakistan s foreign minister , abdul sattar , on the sidelines of the conference but today , on the first day of meetings for foreign ministers , the two men shook hands and exchanged brief pleasantries , but had no substantive discussions speaking today in lucknow , mr vajpayee also kept the heat on pakistan he angrily condemned what he called pakistan s sponsorhip of terrorism in kashmir a land both countries claim and have fought over for 54 years even as pakistan has joined the international coalition backing american action in afghanistan you ca n't fight terrorism in afghanistan and spread it in kashmir , mr vajpayee said this ca n't go on as he has repeatedly , mr vajpayee scoffed at pakistan s demands for evidence that implicates the two groups accused of attacking parliament jaishemuhammad , the army of muhammad , and lashkaretaiba , the army of the pure the five bodies of the suicide squad members and the bullet holes in the walls of parliament house were proof enough , he said but pakistan today reiterated its demand for evidence if it is to act on a new list of 20 terrorist and criminal suspects who india has demanded be handed over for trial india maintains that those men have been given sanctuary in pakistan mr fernandes pointed to two incidents of violence on tuesday as evidence of the continuing mayhem being unleashed by the two groups india accuses , and others the massacre of a hindu family of five , including two small children , in a remote village in kashmir and the murder of two army officers and the wounding of four more at a firing range in the indian state of himachal pradesh by gunmen wielding ak47 s no group claimed responsibility for either attack , but mr fernandes said that it s the usual terrorist crowd we pick up dozens of wireless intercepts between them and their pakistanbased headquarters about the tasks that they undertake , he said insofar as their roots and master , there s no doubt it s pakistan today , suspected militants threw grenades at a police convoy near the main gate of the legislative assembly in the indian state , jammu and kashmir , killing 2 people and injuring 16 again , no one claimed responsibility in a more positive vein , mr fernandes said pakistan was listening on certain issues because of international diplomatic pressure and india s military buildup but he was categorical that there had been no change on the ground , where he said the accused groups continue to commit acts of terrorism none at all , he said in recent days , president bush and other world leaders have praised general musharraf for moving against the militant groups , but mr fernandes said india would make its own assessment of pakistan s intentions if we are pushed , he said , we 'll have to take on the war against terrorism all by ourselves he refused to describe the precise dimensions of india s military buildup , though he said it mirrored pakistan s own he called assertions by pakistani intelligence officials that india has a million men along the border rubbish when asked if hundreds of thousands of men had moved there , he declined to discuss specifics but mr fernandes , once an ardent antinuclear leader , said india would not be deterred from acting militarily by pakistan s possession of a nuclear arsenal i ca n't believe they would ever use it for the simple reason that they would be inviting a second strike , he said that could be devastating given pakistan s size india does have contingency plans for various military actions against pakistan if diplomacy fails , he said , but added , there will be options , but once you speak about them , then they do n't remain options the british prime minister , tony blair , in a diplomatic swing that recalled his travels on behalf of the antiterrorism coalition this fall , was to arrive sometime in the next few days on a mission that was expected to take him to both india and pakistan as well as to bangladesh his purpose in new delhi and islamabad is to urge the two nuclear powers to pull back from the brink while in dhaka , bangladesh , he is expected to ask for bangladesh s participation in the britishled peacekeeping force in afghanistan , officials said but the british foreign secretary , jack straw , sought to play down the peacemaker aspect of the mission , saying that the trip had long been planned and that the british leader had no magic formula there is no blair peace plan that the prime minister could or should take out of his pocket , mr straw told the bbc opposition politicians urged mr blair to bear in mind britain s past in the area britain , as the former colonial power , cannot be seen to be prescribing a solution , said menzies campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal democrats mr blair s visit follows his rounds of shuttle diplomacy before the military campaign in afghanistan during which he traveled to 15 countries in asia and europe , making the case for the americanled coalition british officials said mr blair had been in close contact with the bush administration and would be reporting his findings to washington during his journey home photos

she was an eager new employee her company was the leader in its field , with a stated mission she could take pride in to lower health care costs by helping hospitals buy supplies more cheaply but in a matter of months , cynthia fitzgerald was out of work fired , she says , after complaining about her company s business practices , including pressure to steer millions of dollars in business to a former official of the buying group s predecessor i do n't look good in orange or in stripes , ms fitzgerald said she told her supervisor after objecting to the way another contract was handled before long , the company , novation , arranged to have her escorted off the property by guards ms fitzgerald s accusations , which are disputed by novation , are among the most serious to be leveled at this private company , which negotiates medical supply contracts worth 20 billion annually for a third of the nation s hospitals novation and another big buying group for hospitals , premier inc , have been accused in recent congressional hearings of selfdealing and conflicts of interest that may have compromised their ability to find the best products at the lowest prices ms fitzgerald , 44 , made her comments recently under oath in a sealed deposition obtained by the new york times it is part of a lawsuit that a small medical device maker , retractable technologies , filed in a texas federal court , accusing novation and premier of effectively locking it out of the hospital market the two groups , which negotiate contracts for about twothirds of the nation s hospitals , deny the accusations and are contesting them in court novation officials declined to be interviewed for this story but in a statement , the group said it could not comment on ms fitzgerald s accusations because they had been made in a sealed deposition we can , however , state that any decision to end ms fitzgerald s employment was based on her work performance only , the statement added ms fitzgerald , who once found inspiration in reciting the speeches of martin luther king to churchgoers , worked at novation for just half a year long enough , and at a level high enough , she says , to witness contracting processes that made her uncomfortable some of the methods were not above board , she testified there were undue pressures that were placed on contracting officers to award contracts not necessarily based on price or quality , said ms fitzgerald , who was herself a contracting officer ms fitzgerald specifically complained that novation for years had given special treatment to heritage bag , a garbage bag company in texas represented by the former official of the buying group s predecessor , john m doyle mr doyle is the founder and former president of vha supply , a buying group that in 1998 merged with a smaller group to form novation i had been informed i would be fired if i did n't award it properly , she said in her deposition ms fitzgerald said she tried to find out why a seemingly mundane garbage bag contract was sacrosanct the only explanation that i ever received was that the contract belonged to heritage bag , it was going to belong to heritage bag , and that the last person who tried to remove that contract from heritage bag was in jeopardy of losing their job , she testified novation s hospitals have been spending about 11 million a year on heritage bag s products , the buying group said in its statement after ms fitzgerald asked why heritage s bags called can liners seemed to be getting favored treatment , her managers suddenly began questioning her competence and fired her , she said mr doyle said favoritism played no role in heritage getting contracts from novation we give them as high a quality liner as there is in the industry , and the most competitive pricing in the industry , mr doyle said heritage bag declined to answer questions about ms fitzgerald s accusations the times , in examining ms fitzgerald s charges , found that mr doyle resigned from the buying group in 1986 amid complaints that he had sexually harassed two female employees and discriminated against a third if john doyle were the last man on this planet to have a job , i would starve before i 'd go to work for this man again , said deborah long , who sued mr doyle and his employer in federal court she said mr doyle abruptly demoted her during a staff meeting after she refused to let him into her hotel room at a convention her lawsuit has since been settled mr doyle declined to be interviewed about the three women s charges soon after mr doyle began representing heritage bag as a manufacturer s representative , the company got its first contract with his former employer heritage has held that contract uninterrupted ever since for more than 13 years mr doyle said he received a commission every time a novation hospital bought heritage s garbage bags , but he declined to reveal the amount so how good is novation s contract \? for one thing , novation recommends heritage bags to its hospitals as a good buy even so , individual hospitals , consultants and smaller buying groups surveyed by the times reported that if hospitals shop around they can get better deals on many of those same heritage bags or on comparable bags made by other companies
when the band first sauntered onto the music scene in 1968 , the group s impact could not have been more profound playing haunting songs that explored ageold themes of guilt and redemption , of individual will and the responsibilities of community , the band drew on the deepest currents of blues , r b , country , gospel and the essential force of rock 'n' roll pioneers like little richard , chuck berry and bo diddley music from big pink , the band s stillgripping debut album , helped end a baroque period of psychedelic excess eric clapton was just one of many musicians on whom the band s influence was decisive mr clapton was a member of cream when music from big pink came out , and the egofree ensemble eloquence of the band s music made him feel ashamed of his own group s grandiosity he remembered hearing the album and thinking , this is what i want to play now , at what seems to be the end of a similar period of extravagance in pop music , the band s honest , unadorned music is back with a bit of fuzzy math , the 25th anniversary of the last waltz , the original band s final performance in an allstar concert in 1976 , is being celebrated with a fanfare that rivals both the lavishness of the original event and the hoopla surrounding the release two years later of the acclaimed movie and soundtrack album that documented it the film , the last waltz , which was directed by martin scorsese , has begun a 10city theatrical run a dvd version , set for release on may 7 , offers performances from the concert not seen in the original and commentary by musicians and critics and the album is now a remixed 54track boxed set on rhino records due for release on april 16 the artists performing with band are legends in their own right among them are mr clapton , bob dylan , neil young , joni mitchell , muddy waters and van morrison , every one of whom , like the band itself , is in the rock and roll hall of fame the scorsese film is regarded as one of the greatest music documentaries scorsese has caught the exciting spirit of the concert in a brilliant rhapsody of images , the newsweek critic jack kroll wrote in 1978 but the concert and soundtrack drew mixed reviews greil marcus declared the concert overblown but allowed that the band had escaped the pretensions that surrounded them in a rolling stone review , jim miller dismissed the soundtrack as a coffee table album destined merely to quench a momentary craving for nostalgia , only to be stuffed away on a shelf , unlistened to and forgotten but this seems to be precisely what has not happened as an elegy the marking of the end of an era , as mr scorsese has said the last waltz now seems premature virtually all of the performers at the concert were only in their early or mid30 s , including the members of the band the guitarist and main songwriter robbie robertson the keyboardists richard manuel and garth hudson the bassist rick danko and the drummer levon helm mr young \( who has an album coming out this week \) , ms mitchell and mr dylan , to mention just a few , remain vital and engaged and while the group s surviving members mr manuel died in 1986 , mr danko in 1999 have not made much of an impact as solo artists , its music has not been forgotten it s still regarded as essential to understanding one of rock 'n' roll s most creative periods whatever its flaws , the last waltz returns at a moment in which it can be received far more generously than it was in the mid70 s however selfserving the last waltz might have seemed back then , no one familiar with the meretricious spectacle that the music industry has become in the last two decades can seriously criticize the film and album for glitziness and at a time when audiences both young and old are discovering music with a connection to something more meaningful than a record company s bottom line , as shown in the success of the soundtrack album o brother , where art thou , the artists in the last waltz represent a rare integrity in 1976 it was difficult to understand what the last waltz really meant at the time , the band intended to stop touring but to continue recording did such a decision really require a largescale farewell concert \? the road had become a goddamn impossible way of life , mr robertson declares in the film drugs , alcohol and sheer fatigue had exacted a toll still , he insists that the band will never break up and it did n't immediately it released an album of new material in 1977 , a slipshod collection called islands but practically speaking , the group as it existed was done for everybody drifted from the nest and never came back , mr robertson said last month in an interview in a midtown hotel i slowly realized that i did n't know how to retrace my footsteps after a while , we just stopped talking about it eventually , though , the other members not only talked about regrouping but did so , minus mr robertson on march 3 , 1986 , they were on tour and had played two sets at the cheek to cheek lounge in winter park , fla , when , after the show , mr manuel hanged himself in his room next door at the quality inn
following are excerpts from senator robert g torricelli s speech yesterday at the new jersey state house , as recorded by the new york times the complete text is online at nytimescom metro i gave four years to establishing a democratic majority in the united states senate but in a strange irony of life , control of the democratic majority in the united states senate is now at issue and i am a part of that issue it will not only be decided in new jersey , but it most certainly will in part be decided in new jersey i could not stand the pain if any failing on my part would do damage to the things and the people that i have fought for all of my life there are times in life when you rise above self when we all recognize that there are none of us who are so important in our own eyes , have significance in ourselves , that we have a right to stand in the way of the things that we value last night i met with a group of people who are leaders of the democratic party , but also my friends , to talk about the reelection campaign and changes of strategy and advertising and when the meeting was over i asked two people who are very dear to me jim mcgreevey , who has been my friend these very many years which some of you have made light of our friendship because of a 12day disagreement in the midst of 12 years of dear and committed friendship and jon corzine , who could easily today be among the dearest friends i have in the world and one of the people i admire the most the three of us sat in the governor s study last night and i told them that i was concerned i could no longer assure that the united states senate seat from new jersey would remain not only democratic but representing the things that we value jon corzine dismissed me out of hand jim mcgreevey listened patiently but concluded otherwise we talked for hours this morning i called governor mcgreevey and told him i was convinced that this seat could be in jeopardy i had said the same to senator daschle when he was in new jersey only days ago i called him this morning and he told me he disagreed we spoke several times more i told him i was convinced president clinton called several times today from great britain we recalled all the fights that we were in together , all the times i went to the white house and told him in the darkest days that what i admired about him is that you never give up you never compromise , you never stop , you never give up the phone connection was n't the best , but i could hear his voice crack i admire that man so much simply because i'm making the decision today , do not think that i fight any less hard or i can be any less combative doug forrester does not belong in the united states senate my voice is not so important that it cannot be substituted if i cannot be heard , then someone else must be heard i have asked attorneys to file with the supreme court of the united states motions to have my name removed from the general election ballot for the united states senate it is the most painful thing that i have ever done in my life i am a human being and while i have not done the things that i have been accused of doing , i most certainly have made mistakes there 'll be those who 've concluded that those mistakes bring justice to this moment because there s a price to be paid when did we become such an unforgiving people \? how did we become a society when a person can build credibility your entire life to have it questioned by someone whose word is of no value at all \? i'm not in a debate with my opponent he s never addressed an issue i'm in a debate with a faceless foe that i cannot find , minds i cannot change it s time for me to reclaim my life i 've done my duty for my country in a foolish moment in my life , when i was no more than 5 or 6 , my mother entered my room one day and i was writing out my will she said , robert , why are you doing this \? and whoever are you leaving your things to \? i left the only things i ever owned , i wrote on it i wrote on it , to the united states marine corps , because that s where my father had served , and to my country to the people of new jersey , you gave me the only life i ever wanted this is all i ever wanted to do i gave you 20 years of my life i am grateful beyond words to have been able to have served my country that i love so deeply

tourmaline by joanna scott 279 pp new york little , brown company 2395 the world is full of stories about smalltime emperors i'm talking about fathers , and i do n't mean reliable , houseslippered fathers either , but charming , dreaming , scheming ones , who always fail and selfdestruct on an epic scale and are therefore unforgettable the popularity of this subject matter is easy to understand many of us have had fathers like that some of us may be in danger of becoming just that kind of father ourselves if so , the prodigious joanna scott has given us a cautionary tale in tourmaline , her new novel in 1956 , murray murdoch , the magnificently underemployed father in the spotlight here , brings his wife , claire , and their four young sons for an extended visit to the island of elba elba , of course , is the famous rock where napoleon spent his first period of exile and like napoleon , murray has grand ambitions when the earth s ancient fire cooled and shrank toward the core , scott writes in the impressive , impressionistic opening pages of the novel , it left behind a hard , uneven shelf of land that was extraordinarily rich with minerals with hematite , magnetite , pyrite , quartz , agate and tourmaline murray is keen to dig up some of these gems to that end , he immediately rents a villa he hires servants because the fastest way to gain respect on the island was to become an employer it is n't long before he happens upon a local girl picking clover beside a pool just the fact of her presence was a temptation , and yet everything about her warned murray away this girl , adriana nardi , later arrives as an unexpected dinner guest at the murdochs' villa murray s infatuation grows when his interest becomes physical , adriana rebuffs him , and the next day she mysteriously disappears the novel is essentially an inquiry into this disappearance and the suspicions and consequences that follow from it the person telling the majority of this story is murray s youngest son , oliver now an adult indulging in nostalgia , he returns to elba to reconstruct what happened to his father and his family nearly 50 years earlier this retrospective , firstperson point of view necessitates certain procedural niceties most of what i know about my mother s experiences in italy i know from her directly , oliver writes on the other hand , what i know about my father s experiences i 've had to piece together from a variety of sources and thanks to my grandmother , who hoarded everything , i have the letters my father wrote to her from elba after citing his sources , however , it is n't long before oliver offers information that claire could n't have known and that murray would never have confided all at once he felt sorry for her , we read about murray he understood why she was there come into the living room , adriana , come and sit beside murray on the sofa let him hold you , signorina , just this once , and feel you in his arms , the softness of your skin , the surprising strength of your limbs oliver s narration is broken every few chapters by commentary from claire sometimes she appears to be speaking but i'm wandering what was i saying \? other times claire s musings are too polished for speech in those first weeks in italy i saw the country through the eyes of hawthorne s miriam and imagined bearing her burden of secret knowledge , every sight tinged with the memory of a secret crime in her five previous novels , scott has shown no sign of a tin ear in addressing the particulars of taxidermy in the manikin or fin de si cle vienna in arrogance , she displayed an intellect far too scrupulous for the liberties taken here to be inadvertent so what is going on \? why does oliver know things he should n't \? why do claire s monologues sound written \? the answer is bound up with the theme of the novel itself , and with murray s search for gems compare minerals to rocks it s not their luster , their rarity , their hardness that makes them desirable , murray says at one point it s their chemical composition they are what they are , unlike most everything else in the world i thought tourmaline would prove my worth what s tourmaline \? tourmaline is a mix of boric oxide , silica , water , iron the chemical composition of tourmaline is longer than the alphabet what s tourmaline \? everything and nothing tourmaline is what a man looks for when he does n't know what he s looking for the philosopher s stone oliver is seeking is just as paradoxical a gem he wants to find the truth about his father , but this truth is not of a simple , durable composition what are the limitations of sympathy \? oliver writes in the torrent of interrogatives that stirringly end the second section of the book how much can we really understand about someone else \? and claire asks him , what do you know , and what are you making up as you go along \? francis cape , an elderly englishman who befriends murray , has been working for years on a history of napoleon s time on elba murray and his sons digging for minerals , francis cape searching for facts about napoleon , oliver , years later , seeking the truth about his father and claire racking her memory these are the desperate energies scott sets loose here , energies at once creative and suspect , fruitful by means of their elemental fraudulence which is , after all , a good description not only of the writing process but of the main ingredients of this story gossip , marital distrust , village superstition , persuasion and pipe dreams

on page 4 of the june issue of esquire magazine , there is an advertisement for a new calvin klein men s fragrance bearing the uniquely contrived name truth the man in the ad looks as if he might think a 401 \( k \) is something swallowed late at night on a dance floor with a margarita his nose is long and straight , his lips are pneumatic and his chest is so glistening and unmarred it calls to mind a hockey rink that has just been smoothed over by a zamboni the model , whoever he may be , is one of the few to be found in esquire , whose fashion pages have been given over to images of men who do not pose in front of a tripod for a living in this issue , for example , a threebutton armani suit is modeled by lyor cohen , the chief executive of the island def jam music group such pairings are conceived by esquire s fashion creative director , stefano tonchi , who arrived in 1998 with a mandate to phase out anonymous male bodies altogether i have n't looked at a model card in four years , mr tonchi said if the esquire guy sees someone like george clooney in a good suit , he s going to say , 'i can do that , ' mr tonchi explained if he sees the same suit on matthew avedon , he is not going to be interested mr avedon , a model whom the fashion industry became infatuated with two years ago , is reedish and curlyhaired in the manner of someone who might restring his guitar on a bench in washington square the cultural viability of the male model was born in the late 1970 s and early 80 s , and it is safe to assert that it has diminished to the point of near evaporation for a fall ad campaign , tommy hilfiger will feature an athlete for the first time , the mogul skier jeremy bloom for a few years now , donna karan campaigns have forgone male models for actors like jeremy irons this season , the gap is using men like dennis hopper and orlando bloom to resurrect itself companies are looking to people with some level of accomplishment , said donny deutsch , chief executive of the deutsch advertising agency , which has mr hilfiger as a client they want someone who is going to be more than a pretty face not a single model appears in the barneys new york spring men s catalog , where the professionally goodlooking have been replaced by a restaurateur , an executive at hickeyfreeman and a number of barneys employees the fall catalog will have a firefighter and a heart surgeon populating the cast of real people a new magazine called sepp , which will make its debut next week in boutiques like colette in paris , combines soccer and fashion , using images of players like ariel ortega of argentina in response to the shifting mood , modeling agencies are making a more concerted effort to attract men whose gifts do not begin and end with genetic makeup this week , elite , which recently signed maxim belotserkovsky , a principal dancer with the american ballet theater , will enter a final round of discussions with executives at madison square garden to explore fashion opportunities for various members of the knicks and rangers , said nathalie bernier , the director of the elite men s division for someone like latrell sprewell , ms bernier speculated , something like sean john could be right two weeks ago , img models signed tim henman , the british tennis star mr henman , 28 , is 6foot1 and has the appearance of someone who could find regular work on one life to live six months ago , the agency added the american tennis player james blake to its roster of male models although modeling agencies complain that athletes and other celebrities often have to turn down work because they do not have the time , there are obvious advantages to promoting the wellknown the pay scale is such that a celebrity might receive up to 200 , 000 for an important advertising campaign , while a male model is likely to make less than a tenth of that you do one booking with one of these people , ms bernier said , referring to the category of the famous , and you think 'ok , i can relax for a while' it s hard to make money with models in the time of a recession for women who support themselves walking down runways , vulnerability to changing economic realities is never quite as pronounced despite four decades of feminist influence , women are still easily seduced by images of preternatural female beauty but if women fantasize about what it would be like to possess nothing more than ethereal good looks , the daydreams of men generally follow different plotlines male models do n't communicate to the customer at all , explained simon doonan , the creative director of barneys people think they are funny and goofy the basic premise is absurd men are supposed to embody power and decisionmaking , and what could embody passivity more than modeling \? it is bruce weber on whom critics have pinned blame for objectifying the male form and prompting in men the kind of physical insecurities that for so long afflicted women twenty years ago , mr weber s early photographs for versace and calvin klein made minor celebrities of models like jeff aquilon his hulky men , jumping in and out of swimming pools , suggested for some the hyperbolic masculinity of fascist propaganda at a moment when large numbers of women were entering the labor force , mr weber s lens seemed intent on reminding the world that men still ruled the hemispheres women could become partners at law firms and work one desk away from the hathaway shirt man , but men could still benchpress the chrysler building in the mid1990 s , though , as a seinfeldian nihilism coursed through popular culture , fashion grew reliant on images of men who appeared to be capable of virtually nothing the trend went from guys in their 30 s to skinny boys in grungy suits , said david soloff , who booked male models at click for eight years mr soloff , who recently founded the model agency , specializing in recognizable personalities , noted that male models of the 80 s used to look like intelligent human beings the skinny young kids , he said , none of them have an identity and the fashion industry has produced far too many of them the market is flooded , said chris forberg , a director of the men s division at img there s not enough work to go around elayne hearns , director of the men s division at next , put the number of men working regularly as models in new york at about 30 as for the trend toward celebrity , semicelebrity and a semblance of the real , ms hearns said simply , it hurts a lot of clients are going in that direction , and it s not as if it s going the other way , she added it s not as if there is a great demand for models to star in movies photos in the barneys catalog an actor , a barneys executive , a restaurateur and a magazine editorial director on the runway andrei shevchenko , a ukrainian soccer star , in an armani show tim henman , tennis star and newly signed img model , on the court and in british vogue the mogul skier jeremy bloom will be featured in a fall advertising campaign by tommy hilfiger maxim belotserkovsky , a principal dancer with the american ballet theater , has recently signed a modeling contract with the elite agency \( agence francepresse \) \( matthew stockman allsport \) \( chester higgins jr the new york times \)
lakeland , fla , march 5 the veteran yankees , the ones who will make the team or have a chance to , have lockers along the walls of the legends field clubhouse the 30 or so other yankees huddle in four banks of lockers in the middle of the room crowded space , high uniform numbers , low profiles this is where you find drew henson , no 75 , next to jalal leach and across from bo donaldson seven players in the middle lockers were cut today , and henson , who might have been the top pick in the nfl draft next month , will be cut soon , too before henson s first exhibition game last week , manager joe torre told him he could hit 900 or 100 and he would not make the team 'that does n't mean you 're not going to help us , maybe before the year is out or next year or whenever that time is , ' torre said he told henson , a third baseman 'just enjoy your time here and do n't try to put any more pressure on yourself' it has been almost a year since henson slipped from the national scene into obscurity he signed a sixyear , 17 million contract with the yankees last march 26 , giving up his position as michigan s quarterback and the pro career that would have followed for henson , what passes for big these days is a game like tonight s , because he was playing against the detroit tigers and his college friends could watch on tv henson was 1 for 5 with a runscoring single in the yankees' 53 loss to leave and just kind of disappear for a few months or a year or so , playing in front of 2 , 000 people as opposed to the huge crowds , that s fine , henson said in a way , it s helpful , because i can just focus on getting better there s no need for me to be perfect every day right now there s not as much pressure to be ready henson batted 222 with 11 home runs in 71 games for class aaa columbus last season , and this is his first full spring training third baseman robin ventura has one year left on his contract , and the yankees want henson to take over next spring but they will not say it with certainty that would be nice , but none of us wants to put that kind of restriction on him , said mark newman , the yankees' senior vice president for baseball operations all of us really want to lower expectations but it is hard for the yankees to contain their excitement about what they may have in henson he is 6 feet 5 inches and 222 pounds , and newman said his agility was improving now that he is training exclusively for baseball henson batted 314 in the arizona fall league , ranking in the league s top five in extrabase hits , slugging percentage and runs batted in his swing s gotten better , his plate discipline s gotten better , and his defense has gotten a lot better , despite yesterday , newman said , referring to henson s three errors on monday against the twins he is very bright , and he s a quick study even given those characteristics , he needs to play more games that s what he 'll do but the most stunning thing about him is how much he s improved with how little he s played newman said the yankees evaluate three elements of a player s makeup his willingness to prepare and to compete and his ability to lead the 22yearold henson is so strong in them all , newman said , i think he s a jeter type in terms of those three aspects henson first signed with the yankees in 1998 , and he made progress for the next two years while also quarterbacking michigan until his trade to cincinnati in the denny neagle deal but yankee instructors told henson that for all the progress he might make , he would regress a bit when he returned from football now , said henson , who was traded back to the yankees last march 21 , he can sense the pattern changing now that i'm a fulltime baseball player , there is n't that step back , henson said i can take what i finish with , rest , lift , condition , start hitting again in january the curve will continue to go up henson said his biggest transition had been on defense , which is not second nature and will only become so , he said , with more game experience but he does not feel he is far from the majors in my heart , i think you could throw me into a major league game right now and i would do fine , henson said whether that would actually happen at this time , who knows \? but you have to approach things that way henson is currently on borrowed time as a yankee his chance to answer his question will come later inside pitch derek jeter , who has a strained neck muscle , said he was feeling sore but better on tuesday jeter sustained the injury on sunday , and the yankees want him to wait five days before allowing him to return jason giambi , who will rest his tight hamstring until thursday , said his injury was not serious reliever steve karsay left tuesday s 85 loss to the texas rangers with a bruised right heel karsay will rest for a day or two photo there s no need for me to be perfect every day right now , said drew henson , who had three errors monday \( steve nesius for the new york times \)
savage run by c j box 272 pp new york g p putnam s sons 2395 this spry mystery novel by c j box begins on the third day of a honeymoon , as an infamous environmental activist named stewie woods and his new bride , annabel bellotti , are driving metal spikes into threatened trees to deter loggers then a cow explodes and blows the couple up until then , box writes , their marriage had been happy with this opening , box risks not only losing his hindu readership but coaxing the rest of us into thinking we 're about to encounter a slapstick novel what s surprising is that savage run turns out to be not merely funny but , more often than not , thoughtful it is a seriocomic thriller about how the tensions between the environmental movement and industry are played out in the lives of ordinary people in the american west we 've been here before in twelve sleep county , wyo , in the author s first novel , open season in that novel box introduced us to his unlikely hero , a game warden named joe pickett , a decent man who lives paycheck to paycheck and who is deeply fond of his wife and his three daughters pickett is n't especially remarkable except for his honesty and for a quality that harold bloom attributes to shakespeare the ability to think everything through for himself this makes joe quite skillful at getting to the bottom of questions like the one before us here who would bind a cow with explosives in order to kill stewie woods \? box acquaints us with the two henchmen in the early going charlie tibbs and his reluctant partner , john coble for this pair , think grumpy old men meets natural born killers both men are in their 60 s and have been given a mission to eliminate , with savage but intentionally ridiculous techniques , a handful of people at the forefront of the environmental movement charlie savors this work and speaks of his animus toward treehuggers and their sandals and little glasses and lawsuits and trust funds as the killings continue , we wonder who is behind these guys meanwhile , pickett is caught in a small poaching dispute with a developer when his wife begins receiving calls from a man who claims to be stewie woods in time , pickett unravels this mystery as well as the larger force behind the series of environmentalist killings , but not before he has been chased through the wyoming backcountry and coped with the revelation that his wife had once , before she was married , slept with stewie another cow explodes unexpectedly at the book s end , lending the story a peculiar symmetry to traipse through the plot in this way is to miss the novel s intricacies a treesitter and a loggingindustry executive could both finish savage run and argue that box is on their side the book s nuanced message comes through most vividly when john coble abandons his murderous colleague out of guilt and confesses his conflicted emotions to one of the conservation movement s leaders you people expect everyone out here to suddenly give up the only jobs they 've ever known in mines and the fields and the forests , he says none of you know or appreciate how tough it used to be in this country box , a native of wyoming , treats hobby ranchers and subdivision builders with contempt , but he also demonstrates understanding for locals like coble who resent holierthanthou preservationists telling them what to do a couple of box s environmentalists are strident , uncompromising caricatures yet at the same time , the author shows charlie tibbs to be a much more unappealing type he is violent toward anyone who might even question the implications of clearcut logging practices or strip mining and is consumed with hatred for liberal thinking , which he perceives as weakness the book leaves you hoping that between tibbs and woods lies a third way for the american west an approach to environmental policy that is diligent , that understands the culture that it is seeking to transform and that also like this jaunty and thoughtprovoking novel is serious in purpose but does n't take itself too seriously

san francisco by almost any measure , charles r schwab should be a hero on wall street he made himself a billionaire a few times over by starting a brokerage firm and building it into a financial powerhouse whose lowpriced internet trading service helped fuel the boom of the late 1990 s this year , as disillusioned investors fled the market , it was mr schwab who planted ideas with president bush that might bring them back at least among politicians in washington , he is receiving credit for proposals to reduce taxes on dividends and to increase the allowable deductions for investment losses , measures that have taken root with some republican lawmakers and that may well blossom into breaks for investors next year but despite his impressive r sum and close connection to the bush administration , mr schwab is less popular than ever among his peers he may be even more disliked on wall street than eliot spitzer , the attorney general of new york , who has vilified investment bankers , stock analysts and the executives who employ them some senior executives of other brokerage firms cannot contain their rage at the mere mention of mr schwab s name his repeated denouncements of the conflicts of interest at other big brokerage firms and his moreethicalthanthou pronouncements have fanned the flames when the microphones are turned off , top officials of competing firms call mr schwab s behavior disingenuous at best , parasitic at worst if mr schwab , 65 , were to retire now he said last week that he had no intention of quitting anytime soon he might be remembered most by his competitors not for his accomplishments but for a single phrase let s put some lipstick on this pig an actor portraying a wall street manager uttered that line in a television commercial that schwab started broadcasting last spring the manager was exhorting brokers to sell a weak stock to unsuspecting investors the ad appeared just as mr spitzer was making hash of merrill lynch s reputation by releasing embarrassing email messages written by some of the firm s analysts one of the messages referred to a recommended stock as a dog schwab , which does not underwrite stocks , stopped using that commercial last month , but the anger it generated persists it was , frankly , a cheap shot , said james p gorman , who runs merrill lynch s brokerage operation there s a basic principle that you do n't kick somebody when they 're down they violated that principle and they 're getting a lot of heat over it the unique dual role mr schwab plays a mr insidemr outside of the financial world has placed him squarely in the spotlight as lawmakers and regulators struggle to find ways to rebuild faith in the american financial markets but there is a subplot mr schwab s stature as a guru of democratic markets may have risen , but his stock as a visionary manager of his own company has sunk though not tainted by the conflicts of interest plaguing its competitors that own investment banks , the charles schwab corporation is in financial distress even after its third round of companywide layoffs , schwab reported a net loss of 4 million last quarter , when most big securities firms were able to squeeze profits out of the depressed financial markets last week , one analyst downgraded the company s shares , saying they were worth about 30 percent less than their current price of 1170 because its prospects were lackluster some wall street executives have dismissed mr schwab s criticism of them as the lashings of a competitor whose bullmarket business model , largely dependent on individual investors , is failing in a prolonged slump but in an interview in his office in san francisco last week , mr schwab said the outbursts aimed at him were misdirected if they took the same energy and put it into the correction process , we 'd be a lot further ahead today than being in denial , he said to this moment , i do n't know of any grand mea culpa by our industry to say we 've made a mistake , a bunch of mistakes , and we 're now going to clean them all up and go forward so you can feel confident coming back and doing business with us in letters this fall to president bush and harvey l pitt , the departing chairman of the securities and exchange commission , mr schwab proposed a code of conduct for the top executives of financial services companies he recommended that they be required to certify periodically that conflicts of interest had not motivated their employees to put the interests of corporate clients ahead of those of individual customers mr pitt praised mr schwab this month in a speech before wall street executives at their annual convention in boca raton , fla speaking for the first time since announcing his resignation three days before , mr pitt said mr schwab had laid out some thoughtful proposals he mentioned no other industry officials john h schaefer , who preceded mr pitt on the podium that morning , had trouble suppressing some lesscharitable views , however
kandahar , afghanistan , feb 20 they sat on chairs or crouched on the floor in their turbans and shawls , faces turned in hope toward the young clerk at the computer but one after another , the men silently moved away from the desk , the shock and pain only discernible in the fixed stare of their eyes no , he s not on the list , whispered one father , isaqzai , 69 his eldest son , shah maqsud , 22 , forcibly conscripted by the taliban last november and sent to the front line in northern afghanistan , has not returned he has not been heard from since the last taliban stronghold in the north , kunduz , fell to the northern alliance on nov 25 like thousands of others here in southern afghanistan , mr isaqzai , who uses only one name , has been waiting in the dark for news of his son although he heard that thousands of taliban soldiers were being held prisoner in the north , he says he is too frightened to travel there to search for his son , in case he is also accused of being taliban by the authorities now in power there there is a harsh divide in afghanistan while most former taliban soldiers in the south were simply told to go home , antitaliban feeling runs high among the ethnic minorities in the north and thousands of taliban conscripts are still being held in detention in grim , even lifethreatening conditions this week mr isaqzai filed into the office of the international committee of the red cross with six other men hoping to find their brothers and sons on a list of prisoners registered at the main prison in the north , in shibarghan shah maqsud was forced to go and fight on the front line , his father said the taliban came to our house and told my son , 'it s your turn to go , ' mr isaqzai said i said i would not let him go , and they hit me and pushed me around they said to my son , 'you will defend your country' several weeks later , just three days before kunduz fell , he had news of his son via a radio link in the taliban military headquarters in kandahar my brother talked to him , he said he told him that they were going to surrender my brother was happy he said , 'he is going to surrender and he will come home' but shah maqsud never came home one other man from his village was missing too , he said , and 15 altogether from the district a third man from the village returned badly wounded after losing a leg in the american bombing of kunduz all six men with mr isaqzai came away with the same news there was no trace of their relatives yet the red cross has only just begun registering prisoners and helping families trace them it estimates that there are 5 , 000 prisoners being held around afghanistan , most of them afghan taliban fighters , says a spokesman , michael kleiner each day , 40 to 60 people turn up at the red cross office in kandahar to seek news of their relatives , and as word of the list spreads , the organization expects many more thousands of former taliban soldiers could be missing , either hiding or killed in the bombing or in battles with the northern alliance hundreds died in captivity after they surrendered but none of those seeking information know yet what happened an estimated 8 , 000 afghan taliban were in kunduz at the surrender but only 2 , 200 arrived at shibarghan prison god knows if he is alive or in some other jail , said dur muhammad , 30 , a laborer who came for news of his older brother , khan muhammad , 35 we would have gone ourselves there to look if it was secure most of the people interviewed said their relatives had been forcibly conscripted just as the united states began its bombing campaign , on oct 7 they have pieced together tidbits of information since then akhtar muhammad , 30 , talked to his brother hajji muhammad , 27 , and his cousin muhammad nabi , 25 , the day before they were due to surrender both were casual laborers like himself , and they had been conscripted to fight in november and had been sent to the front line at khwajaghar and then to kunduz along with two friends from their village they said the bombing was very heavy , but they said they were fine and they were just sitting tight , he said the surrender of kunduz , negotiated between the taliban and an uzbek general , abdul rashid dostum , and the followers of ahmed shah massoud in the northern alliance , would allow them to turn in weapons and return home , they had told him but the men did not come home , and weeks later mr muhammad found his brother s two friends on the red cross list , but no sign of his brother or cousin akhtar muhammad has returned to check the list six times in recent weeks , hoping the names will pop up somewhere and he thinks all the time of risking the journey north to try to see the two friends , but says he fears arrest or even worse let us go there to find our relatives , dur muhammad burst out the government should organize it i make a request to all the world release our prisoners , or let us go there and find them ourselves there are

the third largest accounting firm in the world , kpmg , is negotiating a deal to move its offices downtown , from park avenue in midtown , a relocation that would buoy a business district still suffering from the sept 11 terrorist attack a midtown law firm , richards spears kibbe orbe , is already making the trek to lower manhattan , where rents are a lot lower than in the uptown towers but even as downtown landlords are crossing their fingers that kpmg will complete its deal for 500 , 000 square feet at 1 world financial center , a large insurance company , aon , is moving in the opposite direction the company , which had offices in the world trade center , has decided to create a new home in a 44story glass tower called park avenue plaza , at 55 east 52nd street the decision was first reported yesterday in the daily news aon is the last of the major tenants from the world trade center to secure a new home all of the major tenants have largely abandoned the historic financial district , where there are acres and acres of vacant office space empire blue cross blue shield , for instance , is moving its headquarters to brooklyn , while marsh mclennan , the financial services conglomerate , is heading for a new waterfront tower in hoboken , nj , with 2 , 000 employees morgan stanley dean witter and the port authority of new york and new jersey have scattered it s always disappointing when a firm displaced by the attack decides not to return , said carl weisbrod , president of the alliance for downtown new york but i'm confident that as downtown becomes even better than it was before sept 11 we 'll attract many new companies downtown the exodus has prompted fear among city and state officials and downtown landlords that one of the largest business districts in the country will disintegrate many corporations are concerned about practical transportation problems downtown , where the path train and some subway stations are being rebuilt , and emotional reactions to the loss of life fueled with federal money , city and state officials have created a multibilliondollar grab bag of cash incentives to entice large and small businesses to stay in lower manhattan or move there deloitte touche , ambac financial , nomura holding america , the century 21 department store and 10 other companies have signed agreements pledging to remain in lower manhattan in return for millions of dollars in cash grants dozens of other companies are considering it tax incentives and taxexempt bonds are also available a number of midtown law firms and other professional services are considering the move downtown people are milling about trying to figure out what to do , one broker said the numbers are so compelling that any service firm is going to kick the tires downtown but none of them has actually landed some business executives have criticized the use of cash incentives for professional firms , which they say are not major job generators they argue that the federal money should be spent on improving transportation , rather than propping up rents , major downtown landlords or companies that control vacant space city and state officials , however , are hoping to lure a major company like kpmg that would serve as a symbol of vitality there are five large companies employing over 10 , 000 people that are looking at downtown space right now , said andrew m alper , president of the city s economic development corporation we find that very encouraging kpmg has been scouring midtown and lower manhattan , but real estate executives and government officials said the accounting company was serious about 1 world financial center it is negotiating incentives with the city and rent with lehman brothers , which controls the space but has moved thousands of employees to midtown it s quite real , said one executive but it s not done kpmg was noncommittal yesterday we 're considering all our options in manhattan , said george ledwith , a spokesman for kpmg , which has its headquarters at 345 park avenue that would include downtown locations richards spears kibbe orbe recently completed a lease with lehman brothers to lease about 90 , 000 square feet at 1 world financial , starting at 41 a square foot real estate brokers expect the net cost of the space to drop with the downtown incentives by contrast , aon is completing a deal to rent 270 , 000 square feet at park avenue plaza in midtown for about 58 a square foot , according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the talks the decision to move there came while aon was negotiating a downtown incentive package with the city aon is still looking to move a smaller group of employees downtown , possibly to 55 water street or 75 wall street but according to one executive involved in the discussions , aon would probably not leave enough employees downtown to qualify for a cash grant
the vinland map must be the world s most contested piece of parchment donated to yale university by the philanthropist paul mellon in 1957 , the map , which famously describes the viking discovery of north america , has been stuck in scholarly deadlock ever since the subject of endless studies and counterstudies , the map is either a rare medieval artifact the first cartographic representation of the continent or else a modern fake consider the two conflicting studies that appeared in scientific journals last month one , published in radiocarbon , gives a date for the map s parchment of 1434 , suggesting to the researchers that the map could well be authentic the second study , published in analytical chemistry , comes to the opposite conclusion , arguing , as previous studies have , that the presence of a mineral called anatase in the map s ink indicates a 20thcentury origin even if the parchment is far older and just last sunday , in the boston globe , the rival factions were rehashing the debate once again but now the forgery camp may have some fresh ammunition a norwegian historian says she has fingered the forger a german jesuit priest named josef fischer , whom she believes made the map partly to protest the nazi regime he would have made the map not for profit and not to flaunt it publicly , but mostly as a private protest , said the historian , kirsten a seaver , an independent scholar based in palo alto , calif , who is the author of a wellregarded book about the viking exploration of north america i'm very convinced it was done to tease the nazis politics and religion are at the heart of ms seaver s intricate case against father fischer , which she has laid out in several scholarly articles and is turning into a book that she hopes to publish next year and though her evidence is mostly circumstantial father fischer left no confession experts say her theory merits serious attention he seems pretty plausible , said robert w karrow , curator of special collections and maps at the newberry library in chicago it may have been intellectual arrogance or just a game , but he was in pretty much the right place at pretty much the right time and had the right information i think it all hangs together as ms seaver points out , in many ways the jesuit is an obvious suspect he was an avid scholar and collector of old maps , credited with discovering the now legendary waldseem ller world map from 1507 the first to use the word america he was also passionately committed to the idea that the norse had been to this continent long before christopher columbus , publishing a book on the subject in 1902 at the time , there was little evidence for father fischer s theory yet he was convinced a cartographic record of the venture must exist these facts alone might qualify as probable motive , but ms seaver s theory is more elaborate father fischer , she argues , would have been outraged by the nazis' persecution of jesuits in 1938 , nazi officials forced the sale of stella matutina , the jesuit college in feldkirch , austria , where father fischer had taught and was living in retirement \( he moved to munich the next year and died in 1944 \) at the same time , ms seaver contends , father fischer would have been appalled to see ancient norse history put to use as nazi propaganda the third reich did a bustling traffic in ersatz norse art and artifacts , she points out , as german officials saw in the vikings an aryan people with territorial ambitions much like their own in particular , a viking conquest of north america would supply a perfect rationale for the reich s empirelust overseas by making the vinland map , father fischer would thus seem to be fulfilling a cherished nazi dream but and here s the rub the map is laden with catholic imagery the legend in the top left corner refers not only to the discovery of vinland by the companions bjarni and leif eiriksson , but to a trip there soon after by eric , legate of the apostolic see and the bishop of greenland this , ms seaver argues , was father fischer s ruse to give the nazis and history a viking conquest of the new world but to make clear that it was a catholic one as well the map shows two things clearly , she said the roman catholic church was here first , long before hitler and the third reich could claim any rights to the region , and it showed the norse had discovered america long before columbus whoever the nazi authority was who was going to pronounce on such a map in the public eye would have to make a choice should the map be discarded because of its catholic symbolism \? or should they go with the lovely idea of the norse discovery of america \? anomalies in the map s legend including its idiosyncratic account of norse history further implicate father fischer , ms seaver says , who would have relied on inaccurate secondary sources but her most tantalizing clue concerns a czech library that may once have housed the vinland map parchment when mr mellon purchased the map from a connecticut rare books dealer in 1957 , he also acquired two associated 15thcentury works the tartar relation and speculum historiale the latter volume was incomplete , however , consisting of just the first four sections but in a swiss auction catalog from 1934 , ms seaver found a listing for a manuscript fragment that appears to be the volume s missing fifth section the catalog attributed the fragment to the mikulov castle library in brno , a collection that was known for its antique maps and that father fischer consulted when the library was sold in the early 1930 s , ms seaver speculates , father fischer either bought or was given a bound edition containing boththe tartar relation and speculum historiale , later converting some of the parchment into the vinland map if correct , said peter barber , head of map collections at the british library , father fischer s connection to speculum historiale is close to a smoking gun close may be the best ms seaver can do like her , father fischer was interested in map forgeries , and even published an article on some renaissance world maps that he suspected were fakes and like her , he lacked a smoking gun as far as i can see , none of these maps has an absolutely impossible appearance , he was obliged to concede but all of them are to a greater or lesser degree strange and different from all other hitherto known maps photos detail of the vinland map , which supposedly describes the viking discovery of america new data suggest it was forged by a jesuit priest as a political protest \( courtesy j m stenersens forlag \) \( pg b7 \) the rev josef fischer , prime suspect in what might have been a sly dig at hitler s aryan supremacy doctrine \( austrian national library \) \( pg b9 \)
newark , may 14 sharpe james became the first mayor in newark s history to win a fifth term tonight , staving off a fierce challenge from councilman cory booker and cementing his reputation as one of new jersey s most formidable politicians mr james , who had never lost a race in his 32year political career , won with 53 percent of the vote to mr booker s 47 percent after a bitter contest in the most expensive election newark has seen a third candidate , dwayne smith , received less than half a percent despite being outspent by his rival , an ivy leagueeducated lawyer exactly half his age , mr james , 66 , convinced enough voters that his efforts to bring about an economic revival in this longdistressed city were moving in the right direction in an exultant victory speech at 10 55 pm standing beside the rev al sharpton , the mayor first thanked gov james e mcgreevey , saying , i would not be here without the support of a great governor when he mentioned his opponents by name , thanking them for their participation in the democratic process , boos welled up from the floor , but mr james quickly calmed the crowd tomorrow we go forward as a family , he said mr james feted his supporters inside the ballroom of the robert treat hotel , which sits across from one of his administration s greatest triumphs , the new jersey performing arts center in contrast , the booker campaign , which tied its fortunes to the idea that mr james had neglected the neighborhoods , gathered at a brazilian restaurant in the city s ironbound section surrounded by a halfdozen city council candidates who were part of his slate , mr booker tried to ease the gloom by vowing to continue fighting for his adopted city we do n't even need to say we 'll be back because we 're not going anywhere , he said to thunderous cheers he also promised to keep working on behalf of two council candidates who face runoff elections next month we have slipped the small end of a larger wedge into the door of this political machine , he said let us show our dignity by being gracious in this minor defeat turnout in the nonpartisan race was moderate amid scattered reports of voter intimidation and minor electionlaw violations , although the united states attorney here said none of the incidents were serious as the most fiercely contested mayoral race in recent newark history , the election was closely watched by both the united states justice department and national news organizations , who were drawn by this madefortv drama featuring a veteran populist battling a political newcomer in the end , mr booker raised 28 million for his campaign mr james , facing his first serious political challenge since becoming mayor in 1986 , raised about 23 million ronald l lester , a pollster for the james campaign , said tonight that the results showed that mr james , not his rival , was the real agent of change in the end , he said , mr booker s spending could not move loyalists away from the mayor this was not a generational struggle , he said this was a struggle between outside interests over city interests that theme seemed to resonate with voters in their final push to win undecided voters and rally the faithful , the candidates darted around the city today during an afternoon sweep through the city s ironbound section , mr booker was mobbed by cheering youngsters and women offering hugs this is a wonderful day for newark , he said amid the throng of wellwishers the problems we have are not bigger than we are mr james spent part of his day campaigning with mr sharpton , and stopped in at the headquarters of the newark teachers' union to thank a roomful of supporters who were making calls to voters as the union president , joseph delgrosso , nodded in agreement , mr james called his opponent a republican dressed as a democrat , noting mr booker s past support for school vouchers and his fleeting association with prominent republicans like former representative bob franks and bret d schundler , the unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate if you walk like a duck and quack like a duck , you 're a duck , mr james said you ca n't walk with republicans to get national fame and then say you 're a democrat at the city s 121 polling places , voters were passionate about their candidates soon after voting rakima henderson , 25 , a recreation therapist , said she had been wary of mr booker s promises and worried about his lack of experience with mr james , she said , you know what you got you put somebody else in there , he s saying one thing and you do n't know what he s going to do kevin nelson , a 41yearold mechanic , said he had been concerned about electionyear promises and unfulfilled pledges made by mr james every year we 're talking about the same things , he said sixteen years is long enough i think cory booker can do it a former state senator and something of a local legend , mr james was backed by new jersey s democratic establishment , from governor mcgreevey to newark s entire city council except , of course , for mr booker james is probably the most powerful africanamerican political figure in the history of new jersey , said merle treusch , a political science professor at kean university , in union although mr booker lacked union and party support , he compensated with paid labor and a battalion of volunteers sold on his promise to bring significant change to newark , a place that has made notable progress but still ranks as one of the nation s poorest cities his rallying cry , it s time for a renaissance for the rest of us , was aimed at mr james s claim that newark s downtown development reflected a true civic renaissance mr booker claimed that the progress was largely superficial and had come at the expense of newark s outlying wards , where a third of the residents live in poverty mr james had countered with his own broadsides citing a 52 percent drop in crime , 4 , 000 new units of housing and the city s newfound optimism mr james s supporters tended to be longtime residents and city employees who felt he had helped turn the city around many of mr booker s supporters were 20something professionals and recent college graduates for a lot of people , it s been more of a movement than just a political race , said alle ries , 30 , mr booker s coordinator of volunteers in the end , however , the race largely pivoted on the symbolism of two very different men mr james , a veteran of the civil rights era , and mr booker , a suburbanbred wunderkind whose journey through stanford , oxford and yale universities was eased by the struggles of men like mr james not surprisingly , during the campaign mr james got his most fervent support from older voters who could recall his rise from neighborhood defender during the 1967 riots , to one of newark s first black councilmen , and later , the mayor who helped rehabilitate the city s reputation mr booker , by contrast , generated his most enthusiastic support from younger voters and the growing number of latin american immigrants who felt no loyalty to mr james despite weeks of nastiness in the campaign and election day accusations of unsavory politicking , many experts saw the race as a watershed event in newark history even if his greatest aspirations lay beyond newark , the fact that mr booker moved here six years ago and ran for public office , those experts said , shows how far newark has come ten years ago , i do n't think anyone on his way up would have said this is a good stepping stone , said richard c leone , a chief aide to former gov brendan t byrne for the longest time , this was the place politicians stayed away from photos councilman cory booker greeted supporters in a

concord , nh , april 29 almost 300 roman catholic priests , nuns and other church workers from new hampshire took part today in a national pilot program here on how to detect and prevent the problem that has created a crisis in their church , sexual abuse by priests with the help of graphic videotapes made by a churchowned insurance company , the participants struggled with how , in a rapidly changing world , to express affection for children in their parish in an appropriate way , how to spot early warning signs of a predatory priest and when to know if an accusation of sexual abuse is credible we as a church have to change , said the rev edward arsenault , who is in charge of handling sexual misconduct accusations for the diocese of manchester , which covers new hampshire the church has made mistakes in how we 've handled this , using confidentiality to prevent scandal , father arsenault told a hushed audience that has made it worse the policy of the manchester diocese now includes mandatory reporting to the police of credible accusations of sexual abuse by priests , swift removal of accused priests from their posts and increased education to make priests aware of what is acceptable behavior toward children , father arsenault said several members of the audience raised concerns that false accusations might be made against priests in the current emotional atmosphere , in which hundreds of priests have been accused nationwide since the scandal surfaced in boston in january but father arsenault said , we have not had an allegation of sexual abuse that has not turned out to be credible , i am sorry to say forty priests have recently been accused of child sexual abuse in new hampshire , some of the cases dating back many years in the latest case , the rev george robichaud , pastor of two churches in wolfeboro , was arrested last friday on aggravated felonious sexual assault charges involving a 13yearold altar boy in 1985 none of the cases occurred since 1990 vivian vago , an organist at a church in manchester , said at the session today that she was worried about falsely accusing a priest i would hate to crucify a person before we are certain , ms vago said afterward , ms vago said that she had asked the question because she had been suspicious for several years that a priest she works with was abusing children , but that church officials had dismissed her complaints at least now i feel i have an avenue , she said on the videotapes , a boy describes how he was abused by a priest at a summer camp when he was 10 , a girl tells how she was abused by a teacher when she was 12 and a priest recalls how he tricked 500 young girls into letting him fondle them the videos were made by national catholic services , an insurance company owned by 60 dioceses around the nation joe naff , a social worker who is director of counseling services for the manchester diocese , tried to outline improper ways for priests to express affection kissing on the mouth , putting children on his lap , touching of genital areas , getting into bed with a child and wrestling with or tickling a child some of these behaviors may have been acceptable in an earlier generation , mr naff said unfortunately , in today s world , rules for contact with children have changed , he said church workers should also watch for priests who engage in boundary violations , he said , like spending too much time with a child or meeting them in a nonpublic area like the rectory new hampshire was chosen as one of four pilot dioceses for the training sessions , along with newark , kansas city , mo , and tulsa , okla today s session was originally scheduled for last sept 13 , before the sexual abuse scandal gained its current notoriety , but was postponed after the terrorist attacks on sept 11 one of the biggest challenges in avoiding sexual abuse by clergymen , father arsenault said , is that priests minister to people , so there is a desire to have intimate relations but in the current crisis , he said , some of us may want to give up on intimacy , as too dangerous but , if priests give up on intimacy , he continued , the church might as well be out of business photo bishop francis christian , right , with the rev don jeffrey at a session on sexual abuse prevention for the diocese of manchester , nh \( associated press \)
the alto saxophonist , composer and ideologue steve coleman says he makes music as a craft , not as an art anyone can learn that s a redflag statement jazz musicians are generally defensive about their sound , their language if you do n't call it art , you set them back 75 years once i heard him make that remark in passing , during a public workshop last month at tonic , a small lower east side nightclub none of the other statements he made that day seemed particularly shocking on imperfection listen to charlie parker it s not perfect there s still the human thing there von freeman told me once 'do n't tune up too much , baby you 'll lose your soul' on rhythmic sensibility in school , they only talk about understanding things with your mind but you can also understand things with your body it s a fallacy of western civilization that the mind is doing all the thinking on composing in phrases that do n't conform to meter a lot of times i'm imitating nature i see different levels of cloud movements , and those are n't in 4 4 mr coleman , 45 , is a superbly disciplined musician who is trying to go beyond catechism to find out why we make music in the first place since he did n't expand on the craftversusart issue at the workshop , i called him a few weeks later to ask about his statement mainly , he said , it s a criticism of how we view science and logic in the west , we view them as separate realms of thinking from inspiration , intuition , motion i come from a culture that does n't believe in that separation though i do n't mean that every black person thinks that s true and i'm also talking about something that s very old the domination of mind over body is a postaristotle way of thinking , mr coleman said , and i do n't agree with that way of thinking \( an example a musician counting in cycles of 4 or 7 or 15 rather than thinking in phrases that he intuitively feels \) he risks sounding like a crank and with his talk of craft , ritual and nature , he seems almost unaware that jazz is becoming less vernacular and more academic but mr coleman is an idealist , and judging by the turns his work has taken in the last five years and the number of young musicians whose work he has directly influenced the ideals are viable after a long period working and traveling in paris , san francisco , ghana , cuba , brazil and egypt , mr coleman , it seems , is suddenly a new yorker again \( he s been a resident of allentown , pa , since 1991 , but it s mostly just a place to send his mail \) there was a trio gig at the knitting factory in february he performed with abbey lincoln s group at lincoln center in march and then there was his extraordinary residency at tonic five public workshops and eight concerts in july and early august it s good to have him back fifteen or so years ago , steve coleman was somewhere at the center \( do n't call him the leader , please \) of mbase , the brooklynbased school of musicians mbase wanted to make a new and inclusive jazz that fused charlie parker , hiphop , the funk rhythms of james brown , irregular meter and , in coleman s case , eastern and african philosophy and culture in the end , mbase proved to be more of a philosophy than a recognized style of music , but it produced mr coleman , greg osby and cassandra wilson , three of the most important jazz musicians of the last 20 years mr coleman was widely written about as the dominant force in mbase , but in the late 80 s , once the musicians embarked on individual careers , americans stopped paying much attention to mr coleman \( though his audience in europe remained loyal \) his albums continued unabated \( 21 in 16 years \) , sometimes coming in two s and three s , but by the mid90 s they were becoming hard to find in this country , and in 2000 , his decadelong relationship with bmg came to an end in the mid1990 s , mr coleman studied ancient civilizations and their cultures mathematicians from india , the philosophy of the nile valley , the yoruba religion and its music , which started in west africa and fanned out to the new world all of that discovery went into his music \( yes , one can experience information fatigue with his work \) but what s nice about most of his work and in the performances by his working band , five elements is that it really does n't require studious attention it s hard , funky , buoyed by mr coleman s clear , beautiful alto saxophone tone it is rhythmically and contrapuntally orderly feeling it with your body is easy if at first you 're intrigued enough to count the beats per measure , the music soon gives way to a pleasing multiplicity of meter , and you let it wash over you the day i showed up at a tonic workshop , in july , mr coleman talked about practical matters of the musician s life rules of wisdom rather than rules of music interestingly , the stories he told by way of example had to do with john coltrane , dizzy gillespie , paul desmond , art tatum not musicians from other cultures \( whatever else he delves into , it seems that the history and process of jazz are at the core of his being \) musicians took out their instruments only at the end of the session to have a go at the intervallic patterns he was talking about he was offering an inkling of how he composes and improvises , but mostly he left the rules to them later that night , mr coleman played with a sextet version of five elements the band ran through bebop standards like straight , no chaser as well as his own pieces it was energetic , thrilling dafnis prieto , the drummer from cuba , and gregoire maret , a harmonica player from switzerland , are two of the most naturally exciting musicians i 've seen in years jonathan finlayson , a 20yearold trumpeter and a student of mr coleman s , is progressing into a contender and mr coleman s tone , which has grown both harder and more beautiful in the last decade , was at its best it s likely that in the next five years we 'll see the effects of his little guerrilla operation at tonic , because we 've seen the effects before a number of musicians affected by mr coleman s mid90 s workshops in san francisco and cuba \( including mr prieto , the saxophonists yosvany terry and rudresh mahanthappa , the pianist vijay iyer , and the guitarist liberty ellman \) have gained a foothold in the jazz scene here what s most impressive is that he is n't slowing down , and even as his work grows , he makes himself more available his latest album , alternate dimension series 1 , ca n't be found in record stores go to his web site , www mbase com he gives it to you free photo steve coleman at the nightclub tonic last month on the lower east side , where he put on concerts and workshops \( hiroyuki ito for the new york times \)
bamian , afghanistan hussein jan , a 51yearold farmer , tossed a stone into a shallow pit dug on a slope above this town they shot us here , 76 people , they killed everyone , and only i survived , he said with me there were 11 people from my village , most of them relatives , and i alone survived , he said he laughed , tipping his head back , but his face suddenly twisted into a grimace of terrible pain in tales like this , the people of the bamian region have been counting their dead since they returned to this fabled valley seven months ago , after the departure of the taliban the ancient buddhas carved into the great cliffs on one side of the valley are gone , destroyed by the taliban in its islamic fundamentalist fervor gone , too , are an estimated 1 , 400 villagers , killed in waves over the four years of taliban rule the hazara , the main ethnic group here , say the massacres were part of a sustained campaign by the taliban to eliminate them but the scale and circumstances of the killings have not been independently established as with so much else in afghanistan in the years of unending violence that followed the soviet invasion of 1979 , it remains uncertain if they ever will be a united nations forensic team examined one mass grave in april , found the remains of 18 bodies and promised to return they have not yet william d haglund , a forensic anthropologist who took part in the mission , said much more investigation needed to be done before the teams could come back the new transitional government in kabul has set up a human rights commission , but it faces a huge task the national death toll over the last decade alone probably runs into the hundreds of thousands , and one million are thought to have died during the soviet occupation of the 1980 s for now , the families returning to the valley , from hideouts in the mountains or exile in pakistan , have discovered at least six mass graves local leaders are collecting the dead they say the pattern of killing shows an ethnically motivated campaign against the hazara , who are distinct for their asian features and who are shiite muslims , while most other afghans are sunnis \( the two groups differ over the line of succession from muhammad and the validity of some islamic writings \) hussein jan has no doubt of the purpose of the killings when taliban forces seized control of the valley in 1998 , he and his family fled to the mountains a few days later , the taliban announced a pardon for all villagers and said they could return home to bring in the harvest they tricked us , hussein jan said if we had known they would kill us , we would not have come within hours of returning to his fields , he was arrested by taliban soldiers and was taken to the police station eighty men , he said , were detained they were all from these villages around here , he said most were farmers and villagers none of them were fighters that afternoon four men , their arms tied , were taken away in the back of a pickup truck \( hussein jan learned a few days later that the four had been executed \) they insulted us , and said hazara were unbelievers , that we were not muslims , that we were buddhists , that we did not pray , hussein jan said about 9 pm that night , taliban soldiers marched the other 76 men out when they tied our hands and brought us out of the prison , we knew they were going to kill us , hussein jan said they were taken to a wasteland a quarter mile from the prison and made to squat down in a square shallow pit , he said two taliban soldiers opened fire there was one man who was very strong , hussein jan said he was a porter his name was ganjai he fell on top of me a bullet struck his head and he lost consciousness , he said at some point , taliban soldiers examined the pile of bodies by flashlight , and he acted dead hours later , when everything was quiet , he struggled out of the pit and headed for the mountains at a village , two men foraging for food untied his hands one of them asked about his father , and i told him his father was dead , hussein jan said there was no reason to kill us , he said it was just that we were hazara the hazara , and particularly their main political party , hesbewahdat , themselves gained a terrifying reputation in the factional fighting from 1992 to 1995 , when thousands of civilians died in kabul , mazarisharif and the bamian valley ethnic tajiks are still afraid to return to bamian because of the presence of wahdat fighters who chased them out in the early 1990 s many of the 1 , 400 civilians killed during taliban rule died in reprisals as battle lines shifted and taliban forces fought off repeated hesbewahdat attacks , said the party s political representative in bamian , jawad \( who uses only one name \) the party lost only 150 soldiers in the fighting civilians accused of supporting the wahdat fared worse every village in the valley lost at least 15 to 20 people , mr jawad said , and in one of the worst incidents , in yakowlang , a town higher up the valley , 350 people were killed the killings were intended to rid the mountainous hazarajat , the area where hazara live , of the entire ethnic group , he said

that those aspirations might be a tad too ambitious the answer to life s nagging questions , it turns out , appears to be simplicity itself this new generation of publications tells women that they

the newer entrants , mirrors successful retail concepts just as pottery barn and crate and barrel have democratized style with nonintimidating environments , these magazines make nesting seem very attractive the music of everyday life , rendered in ohsoserious and sometimes spiritual tones , may blow a whistle that most men can not hear , but busy women are willing to listen to any new angle on what has become a chronic conflict our reader is overworked , overcommitted and overscheduled , said robin domeniconi , publisher of real simple she loves her life and has way too much on her plate , but she does n't want to give any of it up and this simple service approach , shared by the others , appears to resonate with advertisers i think this phenomena has the potential to stay with us , said george sansoucy , managing director of the print division of initiative media , a media buying firm owned by the interpublic group of companies they provide some of the same service coverage as other women s magazines , but in a more contemporary way , one that takes into account the incredible complexities of our lives in terms of look and mood , the magazines owe much to martha stewart living , the elegant bible of lifestyle aspiration from martha stewart living omnimedia but the message is remarkably different while ms stewart teaches women to be domestic goddesses , real simple schools them in how to fake it convincingly with an easily searchable display of helpful tips and merchandise martha stewart s world used to be my fantasy , but it is complicated and requires time , which is the one thing i do n't have , said terry press , the head of marketing at dreamworks , a hollywood studio , and the mother of twin threeyearolds i got the halloween issue of martha stewart , she added , and it might as well have been delivered from mars the pumpkins in there looked like they had been carved by michelangelo donald welsh , the chairman and publisher of budget living , said it is not about the aspirational any more we want our readers to realize their lifestyle right now organic style , which is already on its third editor , has struggled to meet the expectations of maria rodale , rodale vice chair and successor in waiting peggy northrup , the current editor in chief , says her magazine is trying to marry the message of simplicity with ecofriendly choices simplicity is the new fantasy , she explained people want to strike a balance much of the simplicity movement began with chic simple founded in 1992 by kim johnson gross , former fashion director of esquire and fashion editor of town country , and jeff stone , former publisher of bantam books , the company has published a series of books that live by the australian aboriginal motto the more you know , the less you need the duo had written a column for instyle , a time inc magazine , but do not still harbor grudges for the company starting real simple instead of trying their concept in the early days , i was feeling ripped off , mr stone said now i just think that we happened to point out something big that we are all a part of simple can be small and not too serious the yearold readymade , a doityourself magazine with a tiny circulation of 60 , 000 , has published a hilarious howto on making a wallet out of duct tape in the phylum of budgetminded magazines , we share some dna , said shoshana berger , editor and founder but none of them has our voice we are a young , cheeky magazine even martha stewart s company recognized that perfection is not always a good thing this january , it will begin testing a magazine called everyday food , which will be displayed at supermarket checkout counters and will feature recipes that can be put together in 30 minutes or less our consumers have additional desires for simplicity , said margaret roach , editor in chief for martha stewart living omnimedia but do not expect the flagship magazine to simplify they still go to for a certain dreaminess , a magazine that they can spend time sitting alone reading and being inspired , said ms roach for those magazines pushing simplicity , the rush into the newly created niche can create redundancy last holiday season , real simple published a feature about 50 gifts under 50 the magazine repeated the popular feature this year , while budget living published the same feature with different choices and organic style upped the ante with 57 gifts and the imperative of simplifying everything can can get sort of silly the december issue of real simple includes a graphic of 10 grooming essentials and a chart on the world s seven major faiths in spite of its success , time inc executives said that real simple s readers are not renewing at hoped for levels , suggesting that readers may tire of the motif and force the company into spending more to find new subscribers a spokesperson for real simple said that the renewal rate at the magazine is in line with the beginnings of other successful magazines at the company the need to eliminate clutter and maximize quality of life is not something that is going to go away , said ms tuhy of real simple this magazine is founded on something very resonant and reliable , she said life is messy and you ca n't live perfectly , but you can live better photos the december january issue of real simple drew on its gospel of ease and convenience in its holiday package hearst is testing two issues of chic simple , a spinoff of a book series
mack brown thinks he finally has this bowl championship series formula figured out if you do n't win your games , you will drop , brown , the texas coach , said yesterday and if you do win your games , you may drop , as crazy as the system is and sometimes even an impressive victory does not guarantee a nice boost when the everunpredictable bcs computer finishes grinding data the bcs has a new leader this week , and , once again , it is not miami , which is fresh off a victory at tennessee ohio state \( 110 \) is the new no 1 team in the bcs ranking released last night , even though the buckeyes are ranked behind the hurricanes \( 90 \) in both polls known as the human element of the bcs system the seven computer rankings over all prefer ohio state by just a bit , and the buckeyes have played a slightly stronger schedule and ohio state won a nonconference game on sept 14 that did not make a big blip on the national radar at the time the buckeyes beat washington state that day , 257 the cougars \( 91 \) have since won seven straight and scaled to the no 3 spot in the bcs ranking ohio state gets 08 of a point sliced off its total this week for what the bcs called a quality win so the buckeyes' point total dropped below miami s although the hurricanes have beaten opponents like florida , florida state and tennessee , they have no quality wins only victories over teams in the bcs top 10 receive the bonus the victory over washington state helped ohio state in other ways in the bcs computer the buckeyes' schedule is ranked as the 22nd toughest in the nation miami s schedule is ranked 40th ohio state is no 1 in four of the seven computer rankings used by the bcs , including that of the new york times miami is no 1 in the other three the top two teams in the final bcs ranking will be invited to play for the national championship on jan 3 at the fiesta bowl in tempe , ariz , so the hurricanes do not have as much to worry about as they did a week ago , when they were ranked behind oklahoma and ohio state ohio state and miami are likely to play each other for the title if both win the rest of their games neither has to worry about the booby trap of a conference championship game , but both have tough games remaining ohio state , fresh off a lastminute victory over purdue , plays at illinois this week , then it plays host to its nemesis , michigan , on nov 23 miami plays pittsburgh , at syracuse and virginia tech as recently as two weeks ago , there was some grumbling to scrap the bcs system because eight teams were undefeated and a computer might begin showering sparks if it had to decide which two should play for the national title but six of those eight have fallen since then , bringing teams with one loss into play and the oneloss teams have a new leader as well washington state the cougars must still play rival washington , in the annual apple cup game on nov 23 texas \( 91 \) , which dropped to no 5 from no 4 in the bcs despite hammering poor baylor , has to play at texas tech this week on nov 29 , texas will play host to texas am , which just dropped oklahoma from the ranks of the unbeaten as a result of saturday s loss at texas am , oklahoma \( 81 \) fell to no 4 from no 1 in the bcs the sooners are still in the running , but they have to do something to get to the fiesta bowl that none of the other leaders must do win a conference championship game we recognize we 've got an awful lot ahead of us , oklahoma coach bob stoops said yesterday because the sooners beat texas last month , they hold the tie breaker in the big 12 conference south division that means if oklahoma beats baylor , texas tech and oklahoma state , the sooners would probably have to beat colorado whom they defeated on nov 2 for the big 12 title but oklahoma could lose before then , meaning texas would have to win the conference championship to have a chance at the fiesta bowl i just wish we 'd go to a playoff and settle it on the field , so we can quit talking about the bcs , brown said we 've made the bcs bigger than the game
in may 1999 this page described impressive plans to create a new penn station in manhattan s general post office and indicated that it would be nearly finished in 2003 a lot has happened since then , not including this project sept 11 left a gaping if temporary hole in such ambitious civic proposals , and negotiations with the postal service over the general post office , also known as the james a farley building , proved unexpectedly difficult those negotiations are now at a fitting end new york state has agreed to buy the farley building for 230 million most of the postal service operations would be housed at the morgan station and annex a few blocks south , but the postal service would retain 200 , 000 square feet in the farley building at the top of the majestic flight of steps leading up from eighth avenue in addition , the state acquires one million square feet of commercial space for redevelopment on ninth avenue this gives the goahead , at last , to the creation of a far more efficient and far more beautiful penn station something akin to the old pennsylvania station that was torn down in the early 1960 s , but in a more modern vein the architectural plans developed by skidmore , owings merrill have a functional elegance that seems even more persuasive after sept 11 the entrance to this penn station will be on 33rd street , and only an enormous arching glass and metal roof will stand between new yorkers entering the station and the sky overhead the effect will be to reframe the classical grace of the farley building , which now seems almost monolithically distant from the street texture of new york many proposals have been advanced in the past few years for the far west side of midtown manhattan , including plans to expand the javits center , build a football stadium , create an olympic complex , or some combination of the three all these plans take as their premise the improvement of transportation to the neighborhood , including the possible extension of the no 7 train to connect grand central terminal and penn station that means that their premise is really the construction of this new penn station but the new station depends on none of the other west side plans to explain either its beauty or its utility , which is selfevident to anyone who uses the present penn station that much has n't changed since 1999 what has changed is the financial climate it will be essential to finance the construction of this new station carefully , and without unhinging the ratio of commercial , retail and public space that made the original plans so attractive
based on his own analysis , david john oates believes that george w bush has been a powerful , consistent leader he is strong and resolute , mr oates said , speaking by telephone from his home in australia his reversals were very forceful there was no internal wavering inside himself wait a minute reversals \? internal wavering \? what exactly does mr oates mean \? to understand , let s begin with the popular factoid that flushing toilets swirl backward in australia one day in 1983 , mr oates said , he discovered that the toilets can also make technology work backward , when he accidentally dropped his cassette player into one on removing it and checking to see if it still worked , he said , he was surprised to find his michael jackson cassette playing in reverse as he listened to it , he heard mr jackson singing what sounded like actual words even though the song was running in reverse this was not intentional backwardmasking \( like might be used by a heavy metal group surreptitiously advocating devil worship \) but accidental hidden messages that came perhaps from the subconscious of the singer intrigued , mr oates began to discover all sorts of messages encoded backward in songs and speech clear phrases and sentences often created by a person s hems and haws reversals are primarily formed by the inconsistencies in speech the stammers , the stutters and the rapid alterations , he said it s not primarily the words , but the sounds of the speech two people might say the same sentence , but you 'll get completely different reversals mr oates grew to believe that these speech reversals contained subconscious messages , and since then he has advocated their use in therapy and investigation \( where they serve as a sort of lie detector test \) reverse speech , as he calls it , can also provide covert peeks into the minds of pop stars , if one believes in this homemade science in thinking of you by lenny kravitz , mr oates and his students discovered the backward message still missing mom we 'll be missing you jewel , in deep water , says , cryptically , you 're glamorous , and you live with a nazi these and examples from queen , ozzy osbourne , bonnie raitt , the beatles and more can be heard forward and in reverse on mr oates s web site , reversespeechcom , which contains thousands of examples in one of mr oates s most infamous reversals , he claims to have found the words desert storm in a speech by the elder george bush before the announcement of the military operation some of the examples on his web site sound like clear phrases , while others are more of a stretch to interpret as coherent statements so when the current president bush talked of the war on terrorism after sept 11 , his reversals , according to mr oates , contained phrases like i am avowed , we will get them and skies , we have seen the limit with terror at the same time , mr oates found a more ominous note in the president s speeches his phrase an act of war against our country , when played backward , revealed the phrase rule the planet meanwhile , in a speech by osama bin laden , one of mr oates s students discovered the reversal , our government is wrong terror now james underdown , the executive director of the center for inquirywest , which promotes scientific and critical thinking , said that he had seen no hard evidence supporting mr oates s claims he compared reverse speech to a rorschach test different people will imagine different words it s looking at a pattern that s already out there , and assigning meaning and intent to something where there was none originally , he said for nearly 20 years , mr oates has been promoting reverse speech as builtin radio transmissions from the subconscious mind he said that because the unconscious mind develops before the conscious mind , children often start speaking intelligible words in reverse before they do in regular speech in his practice , his clients range from couples seeking therapy to defendants fighting off litigation to companies seeking insights on potential employees in the 1990 s mr oates lived briefly in san diego , where he appeared on art bell s radio show and reversespeech was lumped in among paranormal phenomena after a falling out with mr bell , subsequent anonymous death threats and the destruction of his home in what mr oates believes was arson , he moved his reversespeech empire back to australia of course , if mr oates can dish it out , he must be prepared to take it after the interview , i played the tape backward to discover what was really on the reversespeech pioneer s mind when discussing how his desert storm research went public , he admonishes himself in reverse , saying , you must behave , you must at one point , he seems to doubt himself discussing his hopes for becoming more commercially active soon , he says , observe humorous me telling you this and , most revealing , after being asked a question , he displays his intimidation at the hands of such a masterful interviewer unhand me , his reversal says neil scares photo david john oates says speech run in reverse can say a lot
the new issue of family circle crossed the desk the other day a small item caught the eye the magazine had asked american women in an online poll whom they would choose if they could switch places with a famous man for 24 hours in first place was tom cruise , favored by 31 percent of the 1 , 300 respondents nothing out of the ordinary there but guess who was second , right on the actor s heels with 28 percent none other than rudolph w giuliani the former mayor left the likes of michael jordan , tiger woods and jay leno in the dust before you think that those names somehow came to the women in a vision , you should know that the magazine , for its own reasons , offered the five men as the only possible choices still , that mr giuliani made it to the list , and then finished right behind a certified heartthrob , tells you something this is a man that women think of in the same league as the most popular movie star in america , said susan kelliher ungaro , family circle s editor in chief the country s continuing swoon over mr giuliani is a striking feature of postsept 11 life it s remarkable , really by now , nearly nine months later , one would have thought the bloom would be off the rose , at least a bit ours is a society accustomed to creating celebrities at breakfast , chewing them up for lunch and forgetting about them by dinnertime but mr giuliani endures the obvious reason is his majestic performance in the first weeks after the attack on the world trade center but something else may be at work here most people want an identifiable face to help satisfy their hunger for heroes , and it is hard to think of anyone who fits the bill more than mr giuliani few people can attach a face , or even a name , to the hundreds of dead firefighters and police officers most know of todd beamer , the valiant passenger on the hijacked plane that crashed in pennsylvania but the bitter reality is that the despised hijacker mohamed atta is far more recognizable so mr giuliani becomes the designated hero sometimes , the adulation can take puzzling forms for example , a magazine called consulting has just named him consultant of the year , even though his company , giuliani partners , is only a few months old and little tested it is certainly not apparent what good giuliani partners did for an early client , merrill lynch , which , hoping to stave off criminal charges , agreed last week to pay 100 million in penalties to new york and other states now come the madefortelevision movies two are in the works , both based on books that present mr giuliani as ruthless and fatally flawed given the way the world has turned since those books were published in 2000 , neither is likely to emerge intact on film the news this week was that james woods would play the mayor in the first movie out of the box , produced by the usa network from los angeles , reuters reported that the giuliani role seems to be against type for woods , who has made his name playing unsympathetic or evil characters that observation could not have been more laden with paradox this film is based on a biography , by wayne barrett of the village voice , that portrays mr giuliani as about as sympathetic and benign as vlad the impaler converting the barrett book to giuliani hagiography is akin to filming mary shelley s frankenstein as the wizard of oz but hollywood seems headed there the former mayor is a rarity in a scandalobsessed culture good images of him have driven out the bad , except perhaps among diehard giuliani haters \( who still exist , to be sure \) the reasons for this have been reinforced in the last few days by the haunting hbo documentary in memoriam new york city , 9 11 01 that day produced little of eloquence from our political leaders the documentary is a reminder that the one exception was mr giuliani silence was the wise course two days ago for the ceremony signaling the end of recovery operations at ground zero the gold standard had been established by mr giuliani in the first hours of the disaster , when he declined to be drawn into speculation about the death toll at the trade center the number of casualties , he said in an unsteady voice , will be more than any of us can bear it was the perfect elegiac note , and it set the stage for the valorous image that remains who 'd have thought that he 'd have movie star status \? ms ungaro of family circle said who , indeed \?
the rebuilding of lower manhattan requires making direct transit links to kennedy and newark airports , burying west street and erecting a major transportation center , a group of business and real estate officials say in a paper that is to be released today the sixpage white paper identifies a number of what it calls essential transportation projects , ranging from ferries to long island rail road service new york needs to retain the financial district and attract new businesses and build housing downtown , according to the paper , being issued by the alliance for downtown new york , the association for a better new york , the real estate board of new york and the new york city partnership not all of the proposals in the paper are new the four big business and real estate groups that are releasing the paper seem intent on using it to focus and speed the debate over downtown revitalization , which has often been mired in discussions about building designs , memorials and how many skyscrapers the developer larry a silverstein should build on the world trade center site we all know there has to be a wonderful memorial on the site , said steven spinola , president of the real estate board , a trade group for one of the city s most powerful industries the market will dictate how many buildings larry silverstein builds on the site but none of that matters if we do n't do the infrastructure that was a point made earlier this week by patrice derrington , a vice president of the lower manhattan development corporation , when she said , the reconnection of this area to the rest of the world begins first with transportation she also suggested building highspeed rail links to newark liberty and kennedy international airports mr spinola and the other executives say that lower manhattan has played a crucial role in the city s and the state s economies the area is often described in real estate circles as the third largest business district in the country , behind midtown manhattan and chicago but over 50 years , lower manhattan has lost jobs to midtown and new jersey because it lacks direct access to westchester county , long island and other parts of the region the groups also expressed some nervousness about the new york stock exchange s plans to build a second trading floor outside manhattan , either in westchester or in another borough they said the exchange , the symbolic center of the financial district , has to be persuaded to stay downtown i think it s imperative that lower manhattan remain the financial capital of the city and this country , said william rudin , chairman of the association for a better new york in the last year , the region has been battered by the trade center attack , a recession and the relocation of major downtown employers like lehman brothers , morgan stanley and empire blue cross and blue shield carl weisbrod , president of the alliance for downtown new york , contends that the city and the state must bolster the financial district and attract other large and small companies to the area the main way that will happen , he said , is by companies' seeing new transportation projects that will make lower manhattan more accessible the business community believes strongly that the chief goal here has to be to maintain and enhance downtown as a worldclass business district , mr weisbrod said the way to do that is to focus on building the necessary infrastructure to assure that happens madelyn g wils , chairwoman of the local community board , said she endorsed many points in the position paper , although some community board members had expressed reservations about construction problems related to digging a tunnel for west street like mr weisbrod , ms wils is a director of the lower manhattan development corporation the groups' paper calls for building 8 , 000 apartments south of canal street , schools , recreation space and a performing arts center but the groups say office space and cultural institutions , not housing , should be built on the trade center site itself the groups said the footprint of the twin towers should be considered sacred ground , but unlike some families of the victims , they believe that commuter train networks could be built below the surface
following is the state department s list of what it called inadequacies in iraq s statement dec 7 about its weapons programs illustrative examples of omissions from the iraqi declaration to the united nations security council anthrax and other undeclared biological agents the un special commission concluded that iraq did not verifiably account for , at a minimum , 2 , 160 kg 4 , 761 pounds of growth media this is enough to produce 26 , 000 liters 27 , 500 quarts of anthrax 3 times the amount iraq declared 1 , 200 liters of botulinum toxin and 5 , 500 liters of clostridium perfrigens 16 times the amount iraq declared why does the iraqi declaration ignore these dangerous agents in its tally \? ballistic missiles iraq has disclosed manufacturing new energetic fuels suited only to a class of missile to which it does not admit iraq claims that flighttesting of a larger diameter missile falls within the 150km 93mile limit this claim is not credible why is the iraqi regime manufacturing fuels for missiles it says it does not have \? nuclear weapons the declaration ignores efforts to procure uranium from niger why is the iraqi regime hiding their uranium procurement \? vx \( nerve gas \) in 1999 un special commission and international experts concluded that iraq needed to provide additional , credible information about vx production the declaration provides no information to address these concerns what is the iraqi regime trying to hide by not providing this information \? chemical and biological weapons munitions in january 1999 , the un special commission reported that iraq failed to provide credible evidence that 550 mustard gasfilled artillery shells and 400 biologicalweaponcapable aerial bombs had been lost or destroyed the iraqi regime has never adequately accounted for hundreds , possibly thousands , of tons of chemical precursors again , what is the iraqi regime trying to hide by not providing this information \? empty chemical munitions there is no adequate accounting for nearly 30 , 000 empty munitions that could be filled with chemical agents where are these munitions \? unmanned aerial vehicles \( uav \) programs iraq denies any connection between uav programs and chemical or biological agent dispersal yet iraq admitted in 1995 that a mig21 remotepiloted vehicle tested in 1991 was to carry a biological weapon spray system iraq already knows how to put these biological agents into bombs and how to disperse biological agent using aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles why do they deny what they have already admitted \? why has the iraqi regime acquired the range and autoflight capabilities to spray biological weapons \? mobile biological weapon agent facilities the iraqi declaration provides no information about its mobile biological weapon agent facilities instead it insists that these are refrigeration vehicles and foodtesting laboratories what is the iraqi regime trying to hide about their mobile biological weapon facilities \? summary none of these holes and gaps in iraq s declaration are mere accidents , editing oversights or technical mistakes they are material omissions
pete rose amassed more hits than any player in baseball s past but has continually struck out in his attempts to be restored to baseball s future now , after more than 13 years on the permanently ineligible list , rose could finally be in position to gain reinstatement , but a person who has been told details of the development said yesterday that rose still faces one major hurdle he must acknowledge betting on baseball games his hangup is he s been denying it for 13 years , the person said to him , that s troubling to admit after lying about it for so long but that has to happen rose , who was barred aug 24 , 1989 , by the commissioner at the time , a bartlett giamatti , met with the current commissioner , bud selig , just before thanksgiving , the person said another person who has been told of the developments said the meeting had been brokered by three hall of fame players mike schmidt , who played with rose in philadelphia in the latter part of rose s career , and joe morgan and johnny bench , who played with rose on the big red machine teams in cincinnati in the 1970 s schmidt also attended the meeting , which was held in milwaukee the first person said that no agreement was imminent and that further discussions had to take place but that people involved on both sides believed rose would probably be reinstated so long as he took the final step in his baseball rehabilitation the matter , however , remains highly sensitive , this person cautioned , and people on both sides were concerned that any tentative agreement could blow up , possibly fueled by public disclosure of the seligrose meeting and the possibility of rose s reinstatement although rose applied for reinstatement in september 1997 , he and selig had , until now , never met to discuss his status selig has never acted on rose s application and has maintained that there is no reason to alter rose s status even after rose received rousing cheers while attending the world series in 1999 and again this year , selig was not moved to change his view but schmidt , morgan and bench apparently decided to intervene after seeing the fans in san francisco chanting hall of fame ! while rose , who has been denied entry , stood on the field in october rose is generally barred from working in baseball or participating in baseball events , but he was invited to participate in promotions at those two world series selig was traveling yesterday and was not available for comment rose s lawyer , warren green , did not return a telephone call rose , through a friend , told wxix television in cincinnati that he had no comment the only comment from major league baseball was , in effect , a no comment pete rose applied for reinstatement to commissioner selig several years ago , bob dupuy , baseball s chief operating officer , said in a statement that application has been pending since that time given the pendency of the application for reinstatement , neither the commissioner nor anyone in our office will comment on the pete rose matter further rose was not barred for betting on baseball and has never admitted betting on games but evidence amassed by john dowd , a washington lawyer acting as major league baseball s chief investigative counsel , left little doubt that rose , as manager of the cincinnati reds in the latter half of the 1980 s , did bet on games , including those his team played further , at a news conference announcing rose s banishment for life , giamatti , in reply to a question , said in the absence of a hearing and therefore in the absence of any evidence to the contrary , i am confronted by the factual record of the dowd report , and on the basis of that , yes , i have concluded that he bet on baseball and , he was asked , on the reds \? yes rose , at his own news conference at the time , said , regardless of what the commissioner said today , i did not bet on baseball he has made the same denial ever since by being on the ineligible list , rose is also ineligible for the hall of fame under a rule that the hall s board of directors wrote after rose was banished from baseball had he not been , rose , with his 4 , 256 hits , would undoubtedly have been elected his first time on the ballot and been inducted in 1992 some hall of famers have been outspoken in their opposition to rose s entry , saying they would not attend future ceremonies if he were inducted but baseball officials have either spoken to them or will do so to pave the way for rose to join them baseball s investigation into rose s gambling began in february 1989 , when he was summoned to new york early in spring training to meet with the commissioner at the time , peter ueberroth a person familiar with the subject of the meeting said it was about rose s gambling , but back in the reds' camp in plant city , fla , the next day , rose denied it that s not the reason , rose said he asked me to come there he and giamatti were both there they wanted my input and advice on a couple things i gave it to them it took an hour i left , and that was it asked if the meeting could have bad implications for him , rose replied , you can read anything you want into it , but i do n't see anything bad asked if it was unusual for him to be summoned that way and for the commissioner to solicit his advice , rose said , a lot of unusual things happen to me because i'm an unusual guy dowd was hired after that meeting to investigate rose , and he produced a 225page report supported by seven volumes of exhibits that contained testimony chronicling rose s gambling activities much of the evidence came from convicted felons , prompting rose s supporters to question their testimony , but dowd produced concrete evidence , too , such as betting records that showed a series of bets on reds games during one season none of the evidence showed that rose ever bet against the reds , but baseball officials said that when he did not bet on a game , it was tantamount to rose s telling the bookies he did not think the reds would win there were also two betting books that united states postal inspectors seized in the arrest of a onetime business partner of rose , but the books were held as evidence in that case and never released to baseball or anyone else the baseball rule dealing with betting on games is posted in every team s clubhouse it warns players , managers and coaches that anyone who bets on games he is not involved in will be declared ineligible for one year and that anyone who bets on games he is involved in shall be declared permanently ineligible rose was barred under a fivepage agreement , reached after four months of sporadic negotiations , that said , in part , nothing in this agreement shall be deemed either an admission or a denial by mr rose of the charges that he bet on games rose was instead barred under a rule that says that a person engaging in acts , practices or conduct not in the best interests of baseball can be rendered permanently ineligible in a deposition in april 1989 , rose admitted that he had bet on sports other than baseball fay vincent , who was giamatti s deputy when rose was barred and later succeeded him , told the associated press yesterday that rose should be required to admit he bet on baseball as a condition of reinstatement otherwise , vincent said , he would be very disappointed dowd told the ap , i would be very careful before i put him back photo pete rose , flanked by cal ripken , left , and hank aaron , at the world series fans chanted hall of fame ! when rose was introduced \( associated press \) \( pg d2 \)
johannesburg flying around this continent of dilapidated airports on dysfunctional airlines can take much time and patience andrew mthembu , a south african mobiletelephone executive , has little of either so when mr mthembu , the man leading the expansion of vodacom , the cellular service provider , contemplates where his company will set up next , one question is never far from his mind he wonders how often the new area is served by south african airways , which the official airline guide regards as the most reliable carrier in africa he just ca n't afford the troubles on other african airlines unannounced stops that turn a threehour flight into a dawntodusk excursion departure delays that stretch into days airline employees who could n't care less if south african does n't fly there , i 'd rather go charter , said mr mthembu , deputy chief executive of vodacom sometimes , he has had to do just that he and his company s accountants are not the only ones unhappy about it even as south african airways has planted a sweeping footprint across southern africa , establishing itself as the dominant airline , it knows that the mother lode awaits a bit farther north , in places like nigeria , congo and angola rich in oil and diamonds and poor in almost everything else , they are the next frontier for entrepreneurs like mr mthembu , as south africa sheds its apartheid isolation and positions itself as the economic engine of the poorest continent what the entrepreneurs need is someone to take them there and back , and andre viljoen , the president and chief executive of south african airways , wants to serve them it s a completely untapped market , he said in an interview it has stayed that way , mr viljoen said , because regulations governing air service remain restrictive but pressure for change is building for the last year , south africa , senegal , nigeria and algeria have been promoting an economic growth plan that they call the new partnership for africa s development they hope to attract more investment and aid from the developed nations while highways and rail links are essential pieces of the plan , air transportation is also a priority for just as cellular telephone service has leapfrogged its copperwired cousin in places with poor land lines , air travel can often crack open markets faster than trains or trucks if you 're talking about growth , you need to make links with the global market , and the best way to address that is with air transport links , said zaza manitranja ramandimbiarison , a world bank official who tracks transportation issues in africa the last year has underlined the challenges for the aviation industry in africa air afrique , a carrier owned by 11 west african governments , stopped flying in january and declared bankruptcy in february sabena , the belgian airline that collapsed last year , had provided a crucial intercontinental link for its former colonies , in particular congo air france , which already had a strong foothold among its former colonies in west africa , has since expanded service in the region , and british airways and virgin atlantic are said to be earning good returns on their routes from london to lagos , nigeria but such service , principally between african capitals and london or paris , is scant compared with what air afrique had aimed to offer within the continent south african airways , the biggest and bestequipped airline in africa , is for now the only carrier that could fill that need from its johannesburg hub , with a fleet of 60 aircraft , it flies to 20 african destinations outside south africa and to a dozen overseas in june , it completed a deal with airbus for a new fleet to be phased in over 10 years in july , it reported that profits for the fiscal year ended in march nearly quintupled , to 21 billion rand , or about 210 million , from 408 million rand the year earlier revenue rose 26 percent , to 136 billion rand much is riding on whether the airline can expand within africa if only it were as simple as flying more planes longstanding accords among african governments still limit how often one country s airline can fly to another country south african airways , for example , can fly between johannesburg and luanda , angola , three times a week , and taag , the stateowned angolan airline , can do the same south african airways , however , wants to fly to luanda daily angola has resisted , fearing that south african airways' superior service would hurt its airline opening the skies could spell the end for more than a few of the continent s stateowned airlines , and few countries have shown any willingness so far to take that risk in theory , the african countries pledged to deregulate air travel with an agreement in 1999 known as the yamoussoukro decision , named for the ivoirian capital , where it was signed but there has been little movement since the agreement would free airlines from many limitations south african airways , for example , could increase its flights to luanda without receiving angola s permission the agreement would also allow south african airways to fly between two other countries , say nigeria and angola some people hope that the pact may eventually lead to agreements allowing foreign airlines to fly within countries , say from dar es salaam to zanzibar in tanzania until that gets implemented , growth opportunities will be much slower than they need to be , said donald s garvett , the executive vice president for strategy and planning at south african airways
a bill that would deny tax breaks to some american companies that have reincorporated in bermuda , or plan to , was passed by the senate finance committee yesterday on a voice vote until yesterday , congressional republicans had been delaying any votes on a variety of bills to stop the bermuda moves , even though the bush administration has said urgent steps should be taken to prevent companies from using a tax haven , most often bermuda , and a country with a tax treaty , most often barbados , to convert taxable profits earned in the united states into tax deductions when money is removed from the united states the senate measure was sponsored by max baucus , a montana democrat , and charles e grassley , an iowa republican none of the 12 senators attending yesterday s brief meeting spoke against the measure the senate bill would also permit the internal revenue service to monitor several insurance companies that have acquired bermuda offices to eliminate taxes on profits earned in the united states it is unlikely that the full senate will consider the move soon this is not the highest priority , senator john breaux , democrat of louisiana , told bloomberg news
washington it s amazing how much you can learn about one medium over the course of viewing a few focused , often modest and seemingly unrelated museum exhibitions take the five shows , spread among four museums , that i visited on a sultry summer day here the shows had so little in common that i felt i had been dropped down on a series of small , isolated islands so much arthistorical ground was covered so quickly that aesthetic jet lag seemed likely yet by the end of the day , i realized that the shows' different coordinates were more connected than they had seemed , and that the link was the meandering ways and means of painting in fact , the works in these shows come from three different continents , span about eight centuries and are n't necessarily on canvas , or even flat but painting in one guise or another is their common ground and they have much to say about its evolution , persistence and variety looked at from these angles , these little islands of painting define a terrain much greater than the sum of their individual territories i am not kidding about the lack of canvas or even flatness some of the best painterly effects in these shows appear on the pieces of furniture , ceramics and textiles included in an american vision henry francis du pont s winterthur museum at the national gallery of art sometimes paint is altogether absent , as in winterthur s superb examples of needlepoint , blankets and quilts one standout is a veritable monument to crossfertilization a quilt that was not simply inspired by the profuse floral designs of the woodblockprinted cotton exported from india to the american colonies , but was actually constructed from them its maker appropriated these designs directly , cutting leafy flower motifs from a piece of indian cotton and then quilting them , together with homespun calicos , to create a tree of life the lush blooms and the plainer calico leaves , bark and ground are delightfully at odds , but the undulating rhythms of the tree s sinuous form not so far removed from those of a multiarmed indian goddess provide the unifying force an american vision , which was organized by wendy a cooper of winterthur , also has several impressive works on canvas there is a wonderfully awkward portrait of the four slightly stiff , very serious children of the gore family , painted by john singleton copley in 1755 , before his style was smoothed out by training in england and an unknown artist s charming fulllength portrayal of young magdalena douw , from around 1740 , depicts the daughter of a wealthy dutch family \( she later became mrs harme gansevoort \) she is shown in all her finery , including a blue brocade dress and brightred shoes it is a picture in which nearly every element has a life of its own , from the boldly bulbous table she stands beside to the blue and flamingopink clouds in the windows behind her my interest in things pictorial should not distract anyone from the fact that everything in this exhibition is exceptional and attests to du pont s extraordinary eye and passion for excellence in addition , the show , which is often arranged in period groupings , provides an unusually clearcut introduction to the different influences and styles european , asian , american , folk , rococo and neoclassical evident in the american decorative arts before 1840 painting is limited to traditional canvas in anne vallayercoster painter to the court of marie antoinette , a second exhibition at the national gallery this is the first retrospective accorded this french painter , who is known mostly to specialists but was wellestablished in late18thcentury paris it was initiated by the dallas museum of art , where it was organized by eik kahng \( now a curator at the walters art museum in baltimore \) the show is going to dallas in october and the frick collection in new york in january the daughter of a goldsmith , who grew up around artists , vallayercoster \( 17441818 \) was accepted into the french acad mie at the age of 26 she was given an apartment at the louvre \( with the intervention of her patron , queen marie antoinette \) and her work was acquired by the most discerning collectors of her day diderot mentioned her favorably in his review of the salon exhibition one year and other critics were similarly admiring , although none failed to mention that the artist was a woman vallayercoster excelled at stilllife paintings , especially of flowers , which were her most popular subject the national gallery show begins with a room of nothing but flower pictures , and while they are breathtakingly exquisite they also seem fussy and rarely match the quiet straightforwardness of chardin s flower still lifes , one of which is also displayed in the first gallery after this slightly disappointing introduction , the show grows steadily stronger by its end , with a gallery devoted to still lifes of plums and grapes , you may consider vallayercoster nearly chardin s equal that she is a more daring colorist is confirmed by several large still lifes with seashells , coral , lobsters and other sea creatures , riven with pinks and reds , including one completed the year before she died
politics in newark has never been a garden party so it comes as no surprise that cory booker , an impressive 33yearold member of newark s city council , has found himself in rough territory as he challenges mayor sharpe james in the city s may 14 mayoral election mr james , who has been in the job for 16 years , deserves credit for lifting newark from an urban wasteland to a slowly recovering metropolis what the city needs now is a dynamic new leader unencumbered by newark s long , corrosive history of machine politics who can take it to the next level cory booker fits the bill he can move newark forward with better schools , more job opportunities and more hope for prosperity for all newark residents this race is the 66yearold mr james s first real political test since he took the mayor s job in 1986 known for years as a oneman cheerleading squad for the city , mr james helped lower crime , add jobs , demolish decrepit buildings to make way for development and promote a stylish new performing arts center to anchor downtown nevertheless , he has run the city like a fiefdom , rewarding friends and punishing foes to promote his increasingly limited vision of the next stage of progress one sign of the raw patronage system that fuels his power is that almost a third of mr james s campaign contributions come from city workers mr booker has a lessconventional political pedigree and a more farreaching set of proposals to advance the city he grew up in a middleclass new jersey suburb and attended stanford , oxford and yale yet he has chosen to live in one of newark s poorest housing projects in one of newark s poorest areas , which he serves as a councilman from that vantage point , he has been hearing firsthand about how newark works for the less fortunate he has outlined impressive plans to raise the quality of life citywide , lowering crime not just in the new business compounds but in elderly housing and projects like his own he pledges to work with the state in more creative ways to improve newark s failing schools he has also persuaded many business leaders that he can best attract new investments to turn newark into a thriving and more commercially competitive city there are several troubling aspects to the newark campaign , and none reflect well on mr james the strongarm tactics of his supporters are deplorable they have harrassed mr booker s campaign workers , including a filmmaker trying to videotape the mayor in public , and disrupted meetings by locking the halls or by shouting mr booker down equally disturbing is the racial subtext that mr james has introduced though both men are africanamericans in a city that is slightly more than half black , the james campaign has constantly tried to characterize mr booker as a candidate who represents white , moneyed interests outside the city such charges do both candidates a disservice , shortchanging mr booker and making mr james seem desperate mr booker has presented many imaginative ideas to spur newark s renewal , including streamlining the city budget process and campaign finance system , as well as modernizing policing to target pockets of drug or gang activity more effectively a few of his proposals are more problematic , including his endorsement of vouchers for the poorest students , which could end up eroding public support for public schools that said , mr booker clearly offers newark a more dynamic alternative he has great empathy for the poor and the will to make the city the bustling urban center it deserves to become for these reasons we endorse him in the race for mayor of newark
the mets thought it would be easy after juan gonzalez said he wanted to join them , the mets figured they would make the best offer , gonzalez would take it , and their supersized lineup would have even more meat last night , the mets learned , the story was too good to be true gonzalez , the freeagent outfielder , agreed to a twoyear , 24 million contract with the texas rangers , the team he played for while winning the american league most valuable player award in 1996 and 1998 the rangers will defer some of gonzalez s salary , bringing the presentday value to about 22 million , his agent , jeff moorad , said the mets offered two years for 25 million , with none of the money deferred in choosing the rangers over the mets and the baltimore orioles , the other team to make an offer gonzalez picked the comfort of texas over the new challenges he would have faced in new york gonzalez has spent all 13 of his major league seasons in the american league , including his first 11 with the rangers , and he has played at least a dozen games at designated hitter in each of the last seven seasons he did say we were his first choice and he wanted to play here , general manager steve phillips said but we all enjoy the right to change our minds things obviously changed in their camp from where they were at one point to where they ended up juan said he wanted to go to new york , but the league factor became an issue in the end , it clearly was n't a money issue at all the mets offered a 12 million signing bonus and salaries of 6 million for 2002 and 45 million for 2003 , with the buyout of an option year worth 25 million the rangers offered a 2 million signing bonus and salaries of 10 million the first year and 12 million the second nothing in the rangers' offer was subject to state income tax because texas does not have a state income tax moorad said the reason gonzalez spoke hopefully of signing with the mets was that he had never expected the rangers to bid for him even the rangers' initial offer of two years and 18 million fell well short of the mets' only proposal i do n't think juan or i ever thought texas would be as serious a player as they were in the end , moorad said the mets had the most serious interest from day 1 of free agency , and there was a time when i believed a deal would ultimately get done with the mets the rangers slowly but surely put themselves into the fray moorad flew to san juan , pr , on monday night to meet with gonzalez and analyze the offers roberto alomar , the mets' new second baseman , who is a friend and former teammate of gonzalez s , called gonzalez several times , moorad said , and rangers players also tried to influence him moorad gave gonzalez s phone number to phillips , but gonzalez never spoke with phillips until after he had picked texas phillips said he believed he could have persuaded gonzalez to change leagues we tried to get access , but he was not accessible , phillips said phillips himself had been skeptical about adding gonzalez he passed on him last year when john hart , now the rangers' general manager , signed gonzalez to a oneyear , 10 million deal with the cleveland indians but others in the mets organization pushed hard to sign gonzalez , and phillips eventually agreed those who know gonzalez , however , believe comfort is especially important to him with the detroit tigers in 2000 , he rejected an offer that would have given him baseball s highest salary but saddled him with a team he disliked this time , presented with two appealing choices , gonzalez went with the most familiar we have nothing to apologize for , phillips said we made a very fair , aggressive offer it was n't about the money i think that , at some point , what came into play was his reluctance to leave the american league one person familiar with the negotiations said that if the mets had guaranteed gonzalez a third year , they would have gotten him but because of concerns about gonzalez s back condition , the best the mets could offer was a thirdyear option triggered by playing time ultimately , moorad said , gonzalez did not want any option years in his contract he will be a free agent again in two years , when he will be 34 phillips admitted to being disappointed by not signing gonzalez , but he said , i think we 've revamped our offense as it is still , the mets will pursue outfield help through a trade , and pitching help through free agency the mets could use pitcher bruce chen to make a trade for san diego outfielder bubba trammell , and milwaukee s jeromy burnitz and tampa bay s ben grieve are also options the freeagent starting pitchers pedro astacio , james baldwin and rick helling are possibilities , but the mets learned yesterday that they did not make the winning bid for the rights to negotiate with the star japanese lefthander kaz ishii the los angeles dodgers reportedly bid highest phillips said all winter that signing a premium free agent was a long shot because ownership wanted to hold the payroll at 95 million signing gonzalez would have pushed the mets well over that mark , but phillips said they are not now obligated to spend that money the decision to raise the payroll , he said , will be made case by case

the colorado rockies are apparently going to keep doing it differently until they get it right at the rate they are going , however , they may very well run out of ways to do it before they get it right the rockies are in the process of trying to lower their payroll and their age the younger the players the cheaper their cost they traded mike hampton last week , tried unsuccessfully to trade larry walker and continued to try to trade denny neagle we 've had way too much money allocated to four players , jerry mcmorris , the chairman and moving force behind the team in its 10year existence he referred to hampton , walker , neagle and todd helton , whose average annual salaries consumed twothirds of the rockies' payroll for their 40man roster this season but it was only two years ago that the rockies signed hampton to an eightyear , 121 million contract and neagle to a fiveyear , 51 million contract , and suddenly they are personae non gratae in colorado dan o 'dowd came in as general manager and in his first season , 2000 , we got up over 500 , mcmorris said , referring to the team s 8280 record the baseball people were all unanimous that we needed topoftherotation pitching and we had a chance to compete in their first coming , the rockies had been the blake street bombers , blake street for the location of coors field , bombers for the contingent of lusty hitters vinny castilla , dante bichette , andres galarraga , ellis burks and walker that team was good enough to be the wild card in only the rockies' third season , 1995 , but then it regressed when o 'dowd became the general manager , he changed the team s personality slugging was out , ability to get on base and manufacture runs was in o 'dowd also acquired a slew of new starting pitchers the 8280 record gave the rockies hope and prompted them to secure even more accomplished and expensive pitchers pitching , despite the team s pitcherunfriendly park , would be the future the first half of 2001 mike was 92 and made the allstar team , mcmorris said from then on it did n't work we 've had a year and a half of frustration for all of us , including mike neagle s results speak for themselves , pretty mediocre neither one of them has been happy here after what the results were last year , you ca n't make a mistake and keep riding it so we had to do something it s not new if i looked back , i 'd say we made plenty of mistakes , spent too much money we 've spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on freeagent pitchers that did n't pay off enter phase three , or is it four or five \?

kabul , afghanistan , march 25 for a man occupying a post that has led almost inevitably in recent years to exile or execution , hamid karzai exudes a surprising confidence mr karzai , the chairman of the caretaker government installed after the taliban s collapse , blithely tosses out the gruesome anecdotes of presidential succession najibullah , disemboweled and hanged from a street pole muhammad daoud , shot by his own guards as he sat on a palace couch noor muhammad taraki , smothered with a pillow a little civility is what afghanistan needs , mr karzai said recently at his office in the presidential palace if i had guns , people would hate me who wants guns \? it is with such assurance that mr karzai presides over this roiling and ruined country , now the focus of a westernbacked experiment to hatch a democracy where terror and tyranny ran loose for nearly a quartercentury his task is to provide the bridge between afghanistan s previous rulers , the deposed mullahs of the taliban , and a more lasting provisional government intended to lay the groundwork for nationwide elections as he enters the second half of his sixmonth term , mr karzai has cut a dynamic figure in kabul and the west with his fluent english and dazzling attire , he eclipsed expectations that he was merely a colorless standin for the western coalition that ousted the taliban with trips to 15 capitals , mr karzai has helped sustain interest in his country at a time when it might have begun to wane he and his aides are busy devising a plan to spend 45 billion in promised foreign aid on everything from hospitals to highways and schools yet for all mr karzai s cheeriness , there are growing signs that the interim government over which he presides is a troubled enterprise , sustained almost entirely by his charisma and western cash turmoil that could ultimately threaten his government , from ethnic strife to battles among warlords , percolates nearly everywhere outside the capital in the north , two of the country s most powerful warlords , gen abdul rashid dostum and gen ostad atta muhammad , continue to clash as their armies struggle to outmaneuver each other for supremacy across western and northern afghanistan , iran exerts its own influence , funneling cash and guns to its local prot g s indeed , outside kabul there seems little evidence of a central government at all without a functioning telephone network or highway system , rural outposts are almost completely isolated civil servants in nearly every province have gone unpaid since mr karzai s government took office taxes , where they are collected at all , appear only rarely to reach the government s coffers we do n't have any contact with the central government , said saleh muhammad zari , the governor of faryab province in the northwest like many other officials , mr zari has an office with no electricity , no phones and no furniture he sits on the floor , and none of his employees have been paid mr karzai s government has been unable to provide basic security , and soldiers nominally in its employ are often the agents of chaos soldiers under the command of general dostum , the deputy defense minister , have been blamed for expelling thousands of pashtuns from their homes across northern afghanistan the checkpoints that used to make the fighters known as mujahedeen notorious for rape , murder and extortion again block roads across the country by contrast , kabul is resurgent since the interim government came to power on dec 22 , money and people have flowed in from the west , giving the ruined city a dynamism and sense of hope it has not felt in years nearly 5 , 000 foreign troops have made the city safer than many western cities with help from the united nations , the government ministries are humming with purpose indeed , mr karzai often appears to be less a head of state than a mayor in his three months in power , mr karzai has ventured only occasionally into the provinces , which , with their mudbrick huts and oxcarts , sometimes seem separated from kabul by centuries his domain mostly kabul on the rare occasion that mr karzai steps out to meet his own people , he is met with whoops and cheers during a recent stop in jalalabad in eastern afghanistan , thousands of residents lined the roads and threw afghani notes a traditional greeting at his car as he swept past then mr karzai ducked into a memorial service for abdul haq , a warlord killed fighting the taliban , said a few words , boarded a helicopter and flew away mr karzai acknowledges the capital s , and his own , remoteness from the rest of the country but he insists that his interim government inspires the loyalty of afghans everywhere we do n't have contact with the provinces , but that s not same thing as not having power , he said when we call a governor and tell him to come , he is here the next day but mr karzai s breezy style has begun to trouble some of his western friends and even those in his own government , who worry that beneath his exuberant surface he lacks the will to confront the country s problems or his own internal enemies sometimes he is too optimistic , a senior member of the interim government said we think he should be stronger , but he has never been in such a position before
breaking clean by judy blunt 303 pp new york alfred a knopf 24 when judy blunt was 15 years old and living on her parents' ranch in the middle of montana , she caught the eye of a hardworking local cowboy who had just returned from a tour of duty in vietnam his name was john and he was more than a decade older than she was after not quite two years of polite courtship , he came over one evening , sat on the front porch with judy s father , drank some whiskey , talked cattle and worked out a marriage deal the teenage bridetobe was not part of this conversation instead , she was hovering inside the kitchen with her mother , wishing desperately that the older woman would grab my cold hand and tell me how to run but there was no running from this marriage the contract was sealed and so , the very next spring 18 years old , smart , tough and brave but thoroughly trapped judy blunt became a montana ranch wife just as her mother and grandmother had been before her breaking clean is a powerful memoir about just how much strength it finally took for the author to wrench her life away from the destiny that had been virtually branded on her skin at birth after 12 years of struggling through the combined hardships of ranching , marriage and child rearing \( i collected children and nervous tics the way some of the women collected dress patterns and ceramic owls \) , judy blunt divorced her husband in so doing , she severed generations of tradition and expectation she turned her back on it all her marriage , her beloved horses , her responsibilities as a ranch hand and the cherished rural montana landscape of her heritage and she moved to the college town of missoula , got herself an education and became a writer as the ultimate betrayal , she tells us , i have taken john s sons , interrupting the perfect rites of passage it is a measure of how patriarchal montana ranch culture is that blunt speaks here of her sons as belonging to her husband she ca n't even claim her children as her own , no more than she was ever allowed to claim ownership of the cattle she was raising or the land she was tending out west , all the really important resources still belong to the men the wonder of this book , though , is that it s not a mere complaint judy blunt is thirdgeneration montana , after all she would n't know how to complain even if she were , say , kicked in her pregnant belly by her livestock which happened she s also been thrown from horses , trapped by blizzards , nearly raped by a local cowboy , beaten with a stick by her uncompromising parents and told only once in 12 years of marriage by her silent husband that he loved her still , the story she tells here is not an indictment it s a judgmentfree depiction of a place and time and ethic most of us will never experience it was n't especially rough treatment that she endured everyone in the community lived like this ranching is always hard , but ranchers are expected to be harder \( oh for christ s sake , you are n't hurt ! was the refrain of every parent \) but people did get hurt blunt writes unflinchingly about her little brother calmly spitting out a palm full of tooth chips and wading back in to grab the biggest calf in the branding pen she writes about a female relative who cut off three fingers on the blades of a mower and finished the job before she came in to get help none of this information is particularly new , of course we 've all read about the bitethebullet pioneer spirit before what makes blunt s book different from anything i 've ever read about the west is the delicate eloquence with which she captures the cost of these hard lives on people s souls for instance , i was n't especially disturbed by blunt s graphic account of her father s nearly losing his hand in a piece of farm machinery i would expect this of a ranch memoir what destroyed me , instead , was the far quieter description of her father s stoic progression from a dashing cowboy who wore his youth like a new hat to a man so beaten down by the staggering workload of ranch life that he would come in from his 12 hours of labor every evening and pull up a chair to the dinner table like a workhorse entering a stall , waiting to be fed , pushing his plate to the center of the table when he finished , shedding clothes as he made his way to bed just as unbearable is another moment that blunt captures with devastating grace when she imagines what it must have felt like for her young mother , whose dark eyes once snapped with humor and play , to discover that she was pregnant yet again , in a tworoom shack 20 feet from the outhouse and a dozen miles from a telephone her mother must have awakened to these changes in her body , blunt speculates , like a driver in a bad dream , fumbling for the brakes and feeling her feet sink all the way to the floorboards the writing is always this original blunt s description of the slow approach of a montana blizzard is the most terrifying portrait of nature s power i have read outside of the perfect storm and her depiction of the frostbitten cattle that survived this blizzard \( their ears and tails and testicles turned black around the edges , as if scorched by fire , their eyes sealed tight under an inch of milky ice \) is nothing short of apocalyptic judy blunt is such a natural writer and this book is so good , it s unthinkable to imagine that she might have never pursued this craft , that she might have lived out her years as one of the dutiful and voiceless ranch women whose lives she honors in this book \( even as she turns away from that life \) but that was probably never really a possibility she bought herself a typewriter one day , and when her fatherinlaw smashed it to bits with a sledgehammer because he felt her hobby was interfering with her ranch duties , she simply packed up her boxes and left that ranch forever this choice came at great cost to her family , to her community and to herself but if there s nothing else that judy blunt learned from the tough people who inhabited the hard landscape of her upbringing , it was this you do what you must do in order to survive and what she had to do , in order to save her own life , was to leave her entire world behind so she could finally write about it drawing \( gregory nemec \)
when it comes to mind games , ploys and white lies , some national football league coaches say or do almost anything to motivate their players and when it comes to the coaches of two of the teams playing today in the conference championships , st louis and pittsburgh , none are better at getting their troops mad at the other team , even if the truth is sometimes stretched like a balloon there is no better example of this than what happened before the steelers' manhandling of the baltimore ravens last week in the days leading up to the game , ravens guard edwin mulitalo , one of the more softspoken players on the roster , said nothing derogatory about pittsburgh as other players on both teams trashtalked throughout the week yet , amazingly , he served as inspiration to the steelers the pittsburgh defensive coordinator , tim lewis , told steelers nose tackle kimo von oelhoffen , the man mulitalo would battle , that mulitalo said on his web site that von oelhoffen was a decent run stopper but not much of a pass rusher kimo took it to heart , lewis told reporters after the game from what i could see , he ran through mulitalo the whole game he was in the backfield an awful lot one problem mulitalo does not have a web site lewis smiled and said , and your point is \? do whatever it takes to get the most out of your players that is the point , of course but lewis is not alone among coaches when it comes to playing mind games with his players one of the best is rams coach mike martz , whose team is also one step from the super bowl before playing the packers , martz was upset by comments made by the espn football analyst merrill hoge all hoge said was that the packers , with one of the league s best running games , might be able to rush up the middle of st louis s defense , not necessarily an outlandish observation most of the time coaches ignore such comments not martz he told players that hoge had called them soft , something hoge never quite said rams players were bothered by hoge s soft comments , the ones he never really made then , on monday , after the rams' 4517 victory , martz said at a news conference that he wanted to choke hoge martz added that when hoge had made the comment about the st louis defense , i almost threw something at the tv hoge , who sustained multiple concussions as a player with the steelers , was so taken aback by the criticism that he called martz to clear the air , then wrote an article about the entire episode i expect people to either agree or disagree with my analysis , hoge wrote that is fair and understandable but i have a problem with people attacking my comments based on what happened to me at the end of my nfl career , when i had to retire due to concussions in particular , someone said i must have made my analysis as a result of getting knocked out of the game and taking too many hits that is complete ignorance they can attack my analysis , but not my personal tragedy no , this is not a sport for the thinskinned in football , all s fair in touchdowns and first downs , and it is actually smart for a coach to use his ploys , if he can get his players to buy into what is being said although what martz and lewis said was obviously transparent , rams players were furious and had extra motivation so did von oelhoffen but why \? do n't players know they are being manipulated \? do n't they realize that sometimes coaches stretch the truth merely to fire them up \? of course players understand they simply go along because motivational tactics can add an extra edge i 've seen a thousand things coaches have done , ravens tight end shannon sharpe said sometimes they work sometimes they do n't if a coach can get a little something out of those things , they will and it is not only the rams and the steelers new england coaches , upon learning that pittsburgh coach bill cowher told his players last week that they could use one day only to make super bowl plans , spread what cowher said among the patriots players , who took cowher s words to mean he was looking past new england of course what cowher meant was plan for the big game just in case the steelers get there , which is a big difference it is not unusual for teams in the conference championships to make such plans because there can be little time between the end of the title games and the departure for the super bowl city but no one lets a little thing like the truth get in the way and pittsburgh s coaches are back at it as well last week , they circulated among the players comments from new england cornerback ty law , who said that if the steelers' physical wide receivers , hines ward and plaxico burress , tried to manhandle him , he would manhandle them right back they 're confident , maybe even cocky , law said of the two wide receivers i guess i 'll say that they are cocky well , that s good , because i'm the same way i just think they have n't been smacked in the face that s what we 'll give them if they want to play rough , good that s my type of game bring it let me see what you got burress said , he must be intimidated by us thanks to law , the steelers might not need lewis s creative talents this time the gruden watch as the coaching vacancies are starting to be filled , many people in the nfl are focusing on a coach who already has a job oakland s jon gruden it is a truly unusual situation gruden , who has masterminded the raiders' recent turnaround , has one year left on his contract most teams would have resigned gruden to a longterm deal by now , realizing he is one of the smart young talents in football but there is nothing but silence coming from the raiders , especially since gruden s agent , bob lamonte , frustrated that both sides have not been able to reach a deal , said last week that gruden would not sign a multiyear extension gruden , whose relationship with the owner , al davis , has soured , is planning to become a free agent when his contract is up after next season because davis is saying nothing , no one knows what will happen next there are several possibilities davis , known to be punitive at times , may wait until all of the jobs are filled , then fire gruden if that happened , davis could then hire dennis green , the former minnesota coach davis could trade gruden to the tampa bay buccaneers for a combination of players and picks , say a firstrounder and defensive lineman warren sapp the problem is that there is no certainty the league would allow it , though the nfl might not be able to stop it also , the buccaneers , a team official said , would love to get gruden , but they also like the rams' defensive coordinator , lovie smith , a former assistant in tampa bay dealing with the raiders might be messy , but getting lovie would be smooth and he could end up being just as good a coach , the official , who requested that he not be named , said davis could also simply wait , have gruden coach his last year of the contract and let him go or he could wait and hope to make a deal with gruden after next season photos pittsburgh nose tackle kimo von oelhoffen \( 67 \) , above , and st louis coach mike martz \( photographs by reuters \)
the jets' salarycap purge began yesterday when they released punter tom tupa , safety chris hayes and receiver matthew hatchette they will also release middle linebacker marvin jones today , jettisoning the third veteran starter from the defense in little more than a week teams must be under the 71 million salary cap by friday last week , the jets lost cornerbacks aaron glenn and marcus coleman , both starters , to houston in the expansion draft none of yesterday s releases were a surprise tupa , a pro bowler in 1999 , was hampered by injury last year and averaged a careerlow 39 yards a punt tupa and his special teams coach , mike westhoff , never meshed , but interest in tupa will be high hayes lost the starting free safety job to damien robinson and hatchette , who was signed as a free agent last year with hopes he would become a starter , caught two passes there is a chance jones could return to the jets after exploring free agency , which begins friday jones and the jets could not agree on how to restructure his contract by friday his deal calls for him to be paid the average of the salaries of the top five linebackers in the league , nearly 6 million a year there was no way the jets would pay that jones had the secondmost tackles on the team last season , with 163 , but he was hampered by a pinched nerve at the end of the season still , the jets have expressed interest in bringing jones back albeit at a lower price his agent , drew rosenhaus , spoke to coach herman edwards and ted cottrell , the defensive coordinator , yesterday marvin is very interested in returning to the team , rosenhaus said but it s going to be after we test the open market we 're not closing the door on returning , but right now we 're pretty far apart in what we 're interested in there s a mutual understanding that just because he s a free agent does n't mean he wo n't be back with the jets and we 'll talk more as free agency starts edwards wants to transform the jets into a younger , faster team , so there could be more shakeups the jets and the agent for linebacker james farrior , whom the jets hope to keep , exchanged messages over the weekend , but there has been no movement toward a new contract farrior is an unrestricted free agent the jets have not made a decision on the future of another starter , defensive tackle shane burton he was on the jets' expansion list but was not selected by houston rosenhaus , who also represents burton , said the jets wanted burton back but with a pay cut he would count 117 million against the cap under his current deal rosenhaus said those talks would continue the jets have made little progress in reworking the deals for robinson , a free safety who is due a 27 million signing bonus on friday , and cornerback ray mickens , who is due a 2 million bonus we 've talked about it but we 're getting nowhere , mickens s agent , james sexton , said we always do it at the last minute with so many contracts yet to be reworked , general manager terry bradway admitted yesterday that it was unlikely they could all be done before friday several players could be resigned after being released for cap reasons or after becoming free agents extra points the new contract for coach herman edwards has been completed , general manager terry bradway said edwards will receive an extra year , making it a fouryear deal , and he will get a raise edwards s original fouryear deal was believed to be worth about 900 , 000 , among the league s lowest salaries for a head coach
following is an excerpt from a document filed in federal district court by lawyers for john walker lindh to support their motion that he be released from jail pending his trial on charges of conspiring with al qaeda to kill americans in early november 2001 , troops of the state of afghanistan defending a battle line against northern alliance advances in the takhar region retreated toward kunduz mr lindh walked without rest for about two days , covering approximately 50 miles through mountainous terrain before arriving in kunduz upon arrival , he was exhausted , severely dehydrated and in physical and psychological shock that impaired his ability to speak on approximately nov 24 , 2001 , mr lindh and others surrendered their weapons to troops under the command of gen abdul rashid dostum and were driven by truck to the fortress at qala jangi near mazarisharif at qala jangi , mr lindh was held prisoner by dostum s forces dostum and his troops have a reputation for massacring , raping and looting prisoners that reputation was known to mr lindh and others on or about nov 25 , 2001 , mr lindh was seated on the ground in the area around the qala jangi fort with his hands bound behind him at that time , he heard an explosion when mr lindh attempted to run , he was hit by shrapnel or bullets and fell to the ground , where he lay for some hours until he was helped into the basement of the fort by other prisoners mr lindh remained in the qala jangi fort basement for about seven days until dec 1 , 2001 during that time , mr lindh had almost no food and very little drinking water while mr lindh was in the basement , dostum s soldiers threw grenades through ventilation ducts , killing prisoners below at one point , dostum s soldiers poured oil or diesel fuel down a duct into the basement about 5 to 10 minutes later , dostum s soldiers lit the fuel and also poured it into another area of the basement , in which prisoners were more tightly packed many prisoners died from the fire dostum s soldiers also fired large rockets into the basement through a ventilation shaft , killing many prisoners toward the end of the week , dostum s soldiers directed ice cold water through the ducts to flood the basement as the water rose , mr lindh was able to stand up with the help of other prisoners to avoid drowning around mr lindh , other prisoners who could not stand were drowned wounded , starved and freezing , mr lindh emerged from the fort on dec 1 , 2001 he was dizzy and numb from the events and apparently still had shrapnel or bullets imbedded in his body after mr lindh emerged , he was taken into us custody government agents restrained and blindfolded mr lindh and drove him from mazarisharif to a location where he was held for approximately 5 to 6 days mr lindh was held in a room with a single window that was covered with a black cloth such that mr lindh could distinguish day and night only from light he detected around the cloth s edges armed guards stood sentry inside the room although a medic checked mr lindh , the medic did nothing more than change his bandages despite his state of malnutrition and dehydration , mr lindh was provided only small portions of food his requests for medical attention to his wounds and for additional food were refused unidentified government agents interrogated mr lindh in this dark room over the course of two or three days mr lindh provided the interrogators with whatever information he had that might assist them in the war effort during this time , mr lindh asked his interrogators on more than one occasion when he could see a lawyer and when he could he see a doctor the interrogators never advised mr lindh of his right to counsel and stated that they did not know when mr lindh could see a lawyer after the interrogations , mr lindh was provided somewhat more food , and the guards were no longer posted in his room 24 hours a day on or about dec 6 or 7 , 2001 , mr lindh was taken by airplane to camp rhino , a us marine outpost in the high desert zone about 70 miles south of kandahar , afghanistan he was blindfolded and tightly handcuffed with plastic straps so tight that they cut into his skin and cut off the circulation to his hands during the course of being transferred to camp rhino , mr lindh s government custodians threatened him with death and torture when the airplane landed , soldiers cut off all of mr lindh s clothes completely naked , other than his blindfold , mr lindh was then placed on a stretcher he was bound to the stretcher with heavy tape that was tightly wound around his chest , upper arms , shoulders , ankles and the stretcher itself completely immobilized and still blindfolded and handcuffed , mr lindh was then placed inside a rectangular , windowless metal shipping container the metal container sat on the desert floor surrounded by rolls of barbed wire and a watchtower guards were posted outside the container there was no light , heat source or insulation inside the container there were at least two small holes in the container that allowed some light and air to enter mr lindh s hands and feet remained cuffed such that his forearms were forced together and fully extended , pointing straight down toward his feet mr lindh remained fully exposed within the metal container until , after some time had passed , a single , thin blanket was placed over him mr lindh was kept in these conditions continuously for two to three days during that time , he was provided minimal food and little medical attention due to hunger , the cold temperature and the position in which he was restrained , mr lindh was able to sleep little if at all during this time , he began to experience pain in his feet , in addition to the pain from his untreated shrapnel wounds guards would frequently shout epithets at mr lindh through the small holes in the metal container after approximately three days' being held in these conditions , mr lindh was led from the shipping container to a nearby tent and sat on a cot when his blindfold was removed , he was facing a man who identified himself as an fbi agent when mr lindh asked for a lawyer , the agent told him there were no lawyers there mr lindh was not told that his parents had retained an attorney for him who was ready and willing to see him in afghanistan the government had also prevented the red cross from delivering a note that mr lindh s parents sent to him on or about dec 3 , 2001 , stating that they had retained counsel for mr lindh this was the first of several attempts by mr lindh s parents to communicate with him through the red cross , none of which were allowed after interrogation by the fbi agent , mr lindh continued to be held in the metal shipping container , but his treatment began to improve his leg and hand cuffs were loosened somewhat , and he was no longer blindfolded at all times the duct tape was removed from his body , allowing him to move his legs and arms as long as he requested permission to do so he received more food and , eventually , a thermal blanket on approximately dec 14 , mr lindh was transferred to the uss peleliu sometime after transfer to the ship , mr lindh , for the first time , received surgery for his wounds on jan 6 , he was allowed , for the first time , to receive letters from his parents and the lawyers that they had retained on his behalf
it s in the bible not the coaches' bible , from which all truths in the national football league descend the real bible and now abideth faith , hope and charity , these three , it reads in 1 corinthians , but the greatest of these is charity obviously , the bible never had spellcheck everyone who follows the nfl knows that it should read faith , hope and parity but the greatest of these virtues , at least when the super bowl playoffs are approaching , is parity , as proclaimed in commissioner pete rozelle s bible and promulgated now by commissioner paul tagliabue parity has fostered either faith or hope in the nfl , as so many others have written it is easy , terribly easy , george bernard shaw wrote , to shake a man s faith in himself steve spurrier learned that thursday in dallas when the washington redskins lost to the cowboys , 2720 , their coach s faith in somehow getting to the playoffs was shaken all spurrier and cowboys coach dave campo , each with a 57 record , have now is the hope of winning their last four games for a 97 record and as alexander pope wrote hope springs eternal in the human breast but for the redskins and the cowboys , it s a forlorn hope with a long way to spring as it is for the st louis rams , the buffalo bills , the baltimore ravens , the jacksonville jaguars and the kansas city chiefs , each with a 56 record and five games remaining , beginning today when william shakespeare was writing measure for measure , he understood that the miserable , he had claudio saying , have no other medicine but only hope i have hope to live and am prepared to die several teams have died carolina , chicago , minnesota , detroit , arizona , seattle , houston and cincinnati only one , green bay , has kept the faith , having already clinched a playoff berth that leaves 16 teams , half the league , with realistic hope but one , tampa bay \( 92 \) , knows it ca n't get overconfident 'tis well averred , robert browning wrote , a scientific faith s absurd but for the giants , even after their embarrassing 1614 loss to the expansion texans last sunday , at least scientific hope exists with a 65 record , they could still overtake the philadelphia eagles \( 83 \) , now down to their no 3 quarterback , a j feeley , for the title in the national football conference east and an automatic playoff berth but if the eagles are vulnerable , the giants are inconsistent in order to make their dec 28 season finale with the eagles meaningful for the divisional title , the giants would need to win at least three , if not all , of their next four games home today against tennessee , at washington , home against dallas , at indianapolis the giants' most realistic hope is to jump over the new orleans saints \( 74 \) and snatch the nfc s second wildcard berth the atlanta falcons \( 731 \) not only are the leader for the first wildcard berth , but in what could be a headtohead tie breaker , they also defeated the giants , 1710 , with doug johnson , their backup quarterback where an equal poise of hope and fear does arbitrate the event , john milton wrote , my nature is that i incline to hope rather than fear although the giants and the jets have the same 65 record , the jets , with four consecutive victories , are a much better team than the giants but the jets have a much tougher finishing schedule at oakland tomorrow night , denver , at chicago , at new england , then green bay in their season finale the jets are also in the stronger american football conference , where 10 above500 teams are battling for six playoff berths hope is a good breakfast , sir francis bacon wrote , but it is a bad supper in the new eightdivision alignment , only two wildcard berths are available in each conference , not three as in the past and just as a team with a spotty record , like the afc northleading pittsburgh steelers \( 641 \) , will qualify automatically as a division champion , at least one team with a better record is likely to be eliminated he that lives upon hope , benjamin franklin wrote , will die fasting both afc wild cards , for example , could come from the afc west , where denver , oakland and san diego each has a 74 record in the north , the steelers are only onehalf game ahead of the fourthyear cleveland browns \( 65 \) in the south , the indianapolis colts \( 74 \) are one game ahead of the titans \( 65 \) in the nfc , the races are much looser the eagles are two games ahead of the giants in the east , tampa bay is one and onehalf games ahead of atlanta in the south , green bay has clinched , and the san francisco 49ers are two games ahead of the rams but with five games remaining for most teams , anything can happen the new england patriots , now 75 after thursday s 2012 victory in detroit , know that better than anybody with five games remaining a year ago , the patriots were a mediocre 65 but they won all five , then swept through the playoffs and won the super bowl so there s hope for the jets and the giants and all those other 65 teams with malice toward none , abraham lincoln wrote , with charity for all the great emancipator needed spellcheck too he really meant parity for all
there must have been a time , years ago , when nobody worried about why a detachment of midspring days , like the ones just past in new york city , would pop up at the tail end of january last weekend was georgia weather in central park , a hint of the carolinas on the grand concourse , temperatures 20 degrees and more above normal enjoyable as they were , those temperatures were also inherently worrisome people who wanted only to sit in the sun had to do so next to people who wanted to sit in the sun but could n't help asking , what does it mean \? before being overcome by the joy of basking like a lizard on a hot rock in a way , the high temperatures of the past few days have made it easy to forget that the whole winter , so far , has been unusually warm we 've had almost none of those dark , snowdriven nights when you dread coming to the corner of a block because an arctic crosstown wind waits there to snatch at your coat and chafe your ears most winters bring a week or two when you feel as if you 've turned into glass and are about to break this winter has been unobtrusively warm , but warm nonetheless and dry where are the curbdeep slush ponds of yesteryear \? by itself , the warmth poses no immediate regional problems the dryness does the city s reservoirs are only half as full as they should be this time of year , and yesterday the city issued a drought warning mayor michael bloomberg has asked new yorkers to take voluntary measures to cut water usage basically , he said , what we have here is a failure of nature to cooperate the mayor must have been speaking ironically the idea that nature cooperates with new york city is striking in fact , the possibility of a drought even the call for voluntary conservation measures is a useful reminder that nature entirely calls the tune , something all too easy to forget on a balmy january afternoon where else would we get the 438 billion gallons of fresh water the city uses every year \? the warm spell should end by the weekend , and more normal temperatures should return while it s comforting to know that the warm weather will be back , we hope in season , there are no guarantees of a spring wet enough to fill the reservoirs now is the time to conserve water , when there are no lawns or gardens to irrigate , and when , by next week , the hose could be frozen anyway the conservation measures that would be relatively painless now will be much harder to follow when april really comes
albany , jan 6 by all accounts , the 2002 legislative session promises to be one of the nastiest in memory , as lawmakers confront the financial crisis caused by the world trade center attack not only must gov george e pataki and legislative leaders close a multibilliondollar budget gap , but they must also do it in an election year in which districts are being redrawn and all are trying to protect their political futures the fireworks are set to begin on wednesday when mr pataki is to give his state of the state address before a joint session of the legislature it looks like it could be a painful year , said the assembly speaker , sheldon silver the shortfall in revenues is going to make things very difficult no one yet knows how big the shortfall might be governor pataki has predicted revenues could drop 3 billion to 6 billion in the fiscal year that begins april 1 he has painted a fiscal picture darker than any the state has faced since the great depression the leaders of the assembly and senate have not yet produced their own estimates privately , senior staff members on both sides of the aisle say they expect a budget gap that is smaller than the governor predicts , but one still hefty enough to require major cuts in service it s siren time , one of the legislature s budget analysts said the inevitable clash over budget cuts does not bode well for other significant bills last year , the legislature and the governor had high hopes to overhaul laws on drug crimes , automobile insurance , aid to schools and women s health insurance coverage none of the changes happened , thanks to partisan strife , a protracted budget battle and the effects of the sept 11 attack indeed , the 2001 session was widely seen as a great disappointment the year s top achievements were a bill permitting up to six indian casinos to be built and a ban on holding a cellphone while driving even so , some bills from last year s legislative agenda might have a better chance of passage in an election year , if a budget deal can be reached quickly mr pataki and all 211 seats in the assembly and senate will be up for reelection this fall , and some bills are politically valuable to the members as long as they do not cost much issues like education and health care and the lagging upstate economy become more difficult after sept 11 , said mr silver , a manhattan democrat , because they involve a lot of dollars but things like the drug laws and auto insurance probably become easier in an election year politicians spend more freely in election years when times are flush , but this year many fear the struggle will be just to save other programs from the ax senator joseph l bruno , the republican majority leader , also indicated some programs would have a tough time getting financed in the current climate i'm afraid the budget and the out years are now , mr bruno said , with the pain that is there financially going to be an inhibitor pataki officials and legislative leaders all seem to agree that the budget , and sagging revenues , will preoccupy lawmakers several financial indicators are worrying them income tax revenues flattened out , and barely grew in the first eight months of the fiscal year that ends march 31 , while business and sales taxes dropped off sharply after sept 11 , tax department records show spending , however , has continued at twice the rate of inflation , and the state appears to be rapidly spending down the 3 billion surplus it had last april as a result , the budget choices facing mr pataki are prickly he has said he does not want to resort to layoffs , and last month he met with union leaders to ask for their help in drafting an early retirement plan , and talked about a possible hiring freeze and other steps he might have to take to cut the state payroll but it is unclear how much money might be saved through those measures , union leaders say , and the governor has not ruled out layoffs mr pataki has vowed not to increase taxes , with one exception he is considering raising the tax on cigarettes to 150 a pack , from 111 he may also propose postponing some of the 294 million in tax cuts , mostly intended to help businesses , that were to take effect next year , though he has said he is loath to do so once again , the governor is also expected to propose streamlining the state s cumbersome schoolaid formulas to save money , his aides said this year , however , the board of regents has thrown its support behind the concept , proposing an even greater simplification , with the cities gaining at the expense of wealthier suburbs \( about 38 percent of state taxes are spent on schools \) mr pataki is also likely to try again to reduce medicaid costs one of five state tax dollars is spent on medicaid and other health care programs none of these ideas will be palatable to the assembly s democrat majority or to the senate s republican majority , especially in an election year voters tend to judge local representatives by how much school aid they bring home cutting health care benefits for the poor is never popular with democrats , and raising taxes or putting off scheduled tax cuts are anathema to republicans
wimbledon , england , july 3 on a normal day , jennifer capriati tends to rush through games with the haste of a shortorder cook , moving from point to point without a pause today , she was even more frenetic stir crazy and agitated after waiting through four rain delays in the wimbledon locker room , she treated the changeovers of her quarterfinal match like drivethrough service , grabbing a swig of water , barely sitting down as she waited for am lie mauresmo to take her place on the worn grass courts , she huffed a blown horn of sorts , as if to say , hurry up , am lie but unlike many players , mauresmo refused to let capriati dictate the pace using the allotted time , she sat on the changeovers with her eyes closed in a scene straight from a yoga video the relaxation techniques left mauresmo calm and poised this was n't like her for all the potency of her swashbuckling backhand , for all the rockettelike kick on her serves , the talented mauresmo has n't competed with a free mind in more than three years today , she gave peace a chance at ease on center court , mauresmo stuck to an aggressive net strategy and mixed up her slice and topspin to leave a flustered capriati helpless during a 63 , 62 upset in between cloudbursts , secondseeded serena williams also moved on to the semifinals , where she 'll meet the ninthseeded mauresmo against the lanky but deceptively strong slovak teen daniela hantuchova , the 11thseeded player , williams was able to deliver 115mileperhour serves on command to fend off several breakpoint scares during her 63 , 62 victory a year ago , williams might have folded in such a pinch maybe a dr feelgood is making the rounds at wimbledon , because mauresmo has newfound confidence as well for the first time since she was a na ve 19yearold finalist at the 1999 australian open , she advanced past the quarterfinals of a major she s never been as consistent as she was today , said the thirdseeded capriati , who had n't exited before a semifinal in her last seven majors usually , if you can stay with her , she can make a few unforced errors and kind of give you the opportunity just streaky there was none of that i was n't waiting for it to happen i was trying to play my tennis , to get into it , trying to stop her she was simply beaten to capriati s credit , she did n't blame a sore shoulder for her loss in fact , she took the defeat well , looking almost relieved that her wimbledon was over at times , capriati s second tour of her fairytale return has left her sullen and irritable now , she could go home to florida , relax and regroup that did n't mean she was on the court to lose against mauresmo , but on some days , an opponent s groove ca n't be decoded capriati never knew what was coming against mauresmo dealing her own brand of threecard monte , mauresmo kept crossing up capriati , sneaking to the net , standing wide to serve and maintaining the unpredictable the formula was mauresmo s focal point with her head into the blueprint , she did n't let her mind wander to the issues of panic that have sabotaged her potential over the last three years during a firstround meltdown at the 2001 french open , mauresmo was paralyzed by a list of fears , including fear of expectation and fear of letting down her country a year ago , she all but vanished from the tour , unable to cope with the pain of losing in paris this year , she went soulsearching for a new outlook at the french open after her round of 16 exit i decided never again to put my head under water like that , mauresmo said when i lost this year , i let it go after three days with the support of her partner , she returned to work after losing 10 pounds on a new fitness routine this season a program that includes fewer nights on the town mauresmo prepared herself for the grass courts of wimbledon when she s on , the variety of her game is suited for the grass today was proof in the sixth game of the second set , mauresmo took a 3015 lead on her opponent s serve when she crept into the net with the stealth of a cat burglar while capriati turned to pound a forehand when she looked up , there was mauresmo , cutting the fuse on the powerful ground stroke with a stab volley for a winner at that moment , rain began to fall for the second of three times during the match with her eyes blinking from the drops , capriati hurriedly served two double faults in a row to hand a break of serve and a 42 lead to mauresmo i probably should have stopped , capriati said that was a key time once the game ended , the umpire called the players off the court suddenly , they were headed to a locker room turned holding cell again i saw that she was getting upset in the locker room , mauresmo said i stayed calm , and i think that helped ten minutes later , mauresmo came out and clung to her serve , saving two break points with kick serves on the first , mauresmo pulled capriati off the court as she reached for a forehand return that went wide on the second break point , she left capriati lunging for a return that ricocheted off her frame mauresmo s momentum went unabated in the second set in the fifth game , mauresmo broke capriati s serve by taking a daring forehand topspin swipe at a ball that kicked off the sideline chalk for a winner under pressure , she was uncommonly cool i'm trying to let go , mauresmo said i do n't want any regrets match points the women s semifinals will be played thursday , with serena williams facing am lie mauresmo and topseeded venus williams matched against sixthseeded justine henin because of the rain delays , the topseeded lleyton hewitt s quarterfinal match against sjeng schalken of the netherlands was postponed until thursday with only 20 minutes on the court , tim henman took a oneset lead against andre sa of brazil before their quarterfinal match was suspended wednesday photo am lie mauresmo after the final point she s never been as consistent

mombasa , kenya , nov 30 as investigators struggled to determine who was behind the attacks on israeli targets here on thursday , they are reexamining evidence that east africa has served as both a useful base and a target for osama bin laden s terror network for nearly a decade we are aware that kenya has been bombed before by al qaeda and we do n't want to rule them out , julius sunkuli , kenya s internal security minister , said today mr sunkuli , with israeli and american help , is coordinating the investigation of the bombing of an israeliowned hotel and the failed missile attack on an israeli airliner the hotel attack killed 10 kenyans and 3 israelis , along with 3 suicide bombers but while al qaeda remains a strong suspect in the case , the kenyan police reported few leads today , the police released 2 of the 12 people who had been held for questioning an american woman and her spanish husband who had hastily checked out of a nearby hotel after the bombing officials said the two were apparently leaving because they were frightened and were not suspected of involvement the other 10 people still undergoing interrogation are 6 pakistanis and 4 somalis , none of whom have been confirmed to have connections to al qaeda , officials said the men had been detained several days before the attacks , for illegally entering mombasa s port on a small boat kenyan investigators called on the public again today to report any suspicious behavior but the record of recent years suggests the difficulties they may have in cracking the case american intelligence officials have said that suspects include al qaeda and al itihaad al islamiya , a somali terrorist group believed to have links to al qaeda evidence of al qaeda s operations in africa emerged even before the 1998 bombings of the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania but rooting out the terrorist network has proven especially challenging for intelligence agencies around the world most of the suspected qaeda operatives arrested by the kenyan police after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon were later released in one instance , the police announced the capture of a senior aide to mr bin laden , only to say later that they had mistakenly taken in a man with a similar name to my knowledge there were a number of arrests but nothing ever stuck , said a united states official who has monitored the kenyan investigations of al qaeda american officials have had similar difficulties in tracking the organization in africa , where porous borders and the easy availability of fraudulent passports make it easy for people to move around unnoticed and to bring weapons along for the ride we have always been very concerned about the susceptibility that africa offers to terrorist organizations , a senior united states official said today in a telephone interview from washington these countries have huge borders , long coastlines and populations in some areas that could be hospitable to terrorists difficulties have also been encountered in tanzania and uganda , where the local police rounded up scores of suspected qaeda members after sept 11 but never established definitive ties to the terrorist organization several months after the attacks in the united states , uganda s president , yoweri museveni , said , the americans recently captured some documents highlighting a possible uganda link to al qaeda they discovered that uganda was targeted for 'liberation' by mr bin laden s network , mr museveni said despite the difficulty in tracking qaeda operatives in africa , it is known that mr bin laden once lived in sudan , which borders on kenya according to evidence from the trial in new york last year of four men charged with conspiracy in the bombing of the american embassy in nairobi , mr bin laden sent some of his men to kenya in 1993 to scout out bombing targets , including not only the american embassy but also unspecified israeli interests evidence introduced in the trial also indicates that al qaeda has operated in the kenyan capital since at least 1993 , and in mombasa since 1994 in kenya , american investigators have said , al qaeda established safe houses for its members and others who were passing through it used small businesses and relief organizations to subsidize and conceal its activities , and it made the country a jumpingoff point for operations in other countries in the region for example , american officials said , a letter the authorities in nairobi seized in 1997 that was written by a member of the kenya cell warned that the americans knew that mr bin laden s operatives in kenya had helped to train the fighters who attacked american troops in somalia in 1993 , an assault in which 18 american soldiers died they know that since kenya was the main gateway for those members , there must be a center in kenya , the letter said the letter was found at the home in nairobi belonging to wadih elhage , who american investigators said had served as mr bin laden s personal secretary and then moved to kenya in 1994 to help run the kenya cell
chapri base camp , pakistan , jan 25 a twohour scramble up a trail of crumbling rock , frozen mud and snow leads to an old hunting shelter that a dozen pakistani soldiers have turned into a tworoom headquarters here from a barren promontory on this wild northwestern border , 10 , 000 feet high in a tribal area that had long rejected pakistan s army and laws , the soldiers watch the surrounding hills , ready to shoot or to try to capture anyone trying to sneak across from afghanistan other troops simply pause at this hut for breath and hike seven more hours into the thin , frigid air to tent camps along the crest of the white mountains that mark the border they stay on the icy peaks , often at elevations of more than 14 , 000 feet , for eight days at a time , with orders to scour the intervening valleys in constant fivehour patrols down the other side of the peaks is the caveriddled region called tora bora , where the americans bombed for weeks in pursuit of osama bin laden and sent hundreds of his qaeda fighters fleeing the soldiers here still hear the rumble of american warplanes , prowling afghanistan s jagged border zone for remnants of enemy forces the troops here , the first pakistani soldiers ever to enter this border region , are charged with preventing the escape of al qaeda or taliban forces their officers were anxious to counter any impression that pakistan might have slackened off the task i'm sure that no one could get across this border , said lt sher ayaz , field commander of the mountain base we are patrolling around the clock , and it is not possible it is impossible to certify how tight the seal has been hundreds of bedraggled arab and other fighters were captured early on , but in this part of the border , at least , none have been sighted in the last few weeks but the arduous efforts of the 4 , 000 troops assigned to guard the border across the northwest tribal zone are plain to see up on the high peaks , the soldiers have to heat snow with burning twigs for drinking water and to endure the frigid winds helped by local tribesmen who serve as guides , they carry rifles , binoculars , nightvision goggles and satellite phones the border search reflects a sharp turn in pakistan s foreign policy after the terror attacks of sept 11 , when pakistan s leader , gen pervez musharraf , ended the country s support of the taliban the entry of army troops into this border zone may also prove to be a turning point in pakistan s domestic history , officials say , as the government makes its strongest push ever to extend authority into the fiercely independent tribal areas the 19thcentury british colonial authorities granted autonomous legal status to the pashtun muslim tribes of the northwest those tribes had long been known for their harsh codes of male honor , blood feuds and aversion to outside control , as well as their generous hospitality and their jirgas , or decisionmaking assemblies of male elders many had close links with afghan groups , and with their walled mud houses , turbaned men and burkaclad women , their settlements resemble the ones across the border when pakistan was formed in 1947 , the northwestern border tribes kept their special legal status most criminal cases , for example , are handled by a tribal jirga rather than by the national police and laws tribal chiefs have shared power with officials of the national government the border zones remained off limits to the police and the military , allowing rampant smuggling of guns , drugs and electronic goods and the cultivation of opium poppies many tribal groups are militantly islamic , too , and had sent men to fight alongside the afghans against the soviets after sept 11 , thousands of tribesmen , especially from the bajaur and mohmand districts , defied the authorities and rushed to fight again , against the americans so when the united states began pressing pakistan to close the afghan border , the government faced a delicate challenge initially , existing border guards and tribal militias were ordered to patrol but in december , with the intense american bombing of the tora bora region in afghanistan , general musharraf decided to send army troops to pakistan s tribal border zone for the first time ever the task was made easier , local people say , by the appointment of lt gen ali muhammad jalim aurakzai as northwestern army commander the commander , who has a tribal background , convened a grand jirga that persuaded tribal leaders to acquiesce , officials say the army , in turn , promised to send mostly pashtospeaking troops and began medical assistance , road building and other activities to benefit the local people , said maj muhammad amir uppal , an army spokesman within 24 hours of that grand jirga , the first troops were flown by helicopter onto the border ridges but after the initial weeks , all supplies have been lugged up the mountains by porters and mules , and the soldiers have had to hike to their posts the chapri base camp is in the kurram agency , which historically is more developed and has better ties with the government than several neighboring tribal areas in the nearby khyber agency , an official said , some tribes opposed the army s entry , and as a result several leaders have been detained more than tribal pride is at stake the presence of the army and outside law could threaten lucrative smuggling and other illegal activities the interests of tribal leaders and political agents who have personally profited in the past , political experts say , may also be diverging from the interests of the tribal people now , with an imperative to get firmer control over the border , general musharraf s government has started a campaign to , as officials benignly describe it , bring the tribal areas into the mainstream the government is offering the carrot of more development funds and more representation in the national legislature , as well as the stick of more stringent law enforcement such talk has prompted angry reactions from some tribal leaders last week , thousands gathered just south of peshawar in the town of darra to protest against encroachments on tribal independence sayed yusuf hussain , the chief of the bangash tribe here in the kurram agency , said he had been asked to join that demonstration but refused i told them that they are just doing this to protect their illegal activities , he said it s people with interests in arms , drugs and fake currency that are protesting i do n't think the tribesmen are supporting them we are treating the pakistani army like our guests , he said , making clear that important boundaries of sovereignty remain we want to be in the national mainstream but i would never want anyone to interfere with our jirga system , he added , referring to the islamic justice meted out by the tribal meetings it s fair , speedy and economical one local tribesman who did not seem overly concerned is muhammad taqi , a graybearded man who does not know his own age and who this weekend was cutting scrub oak branches along the trail below the chapri base camp , for use as cooking fuel he has made money as a guide and porter for the troops , he said his face lit up when asked if he was aware of the 25 million reward the united states has offered for the capture of mr bin laden i saw those pamphlets that the americans dropped , and i 've been looking all over for osama , he said but maybe my luck is n't so great this time , he added with a laugh photo pakistani soldiers at their camp on the northwestern border with afghanistan they are to shoot or capture anyone trying to cross into pakistan \( joao silva for the new york times \) map of pakistan highlighting the chapri base camp

paterson , nj , june 7 after 12 days of deliberation , a jury awarded 380 , 000 today to three women for illnesses it said the dupont company had caused by polluting a nowshuttered explosives plant in pompton lakes the award , to be split by the three women , ended an eightweek trial in which the 14member jury reached an impasse repeatedly , and was sent back for more deliberations in new jersey superior court here indeed , the jury remained stalemated today on a key issue a request that dupont pay for medical monitoring for seven other past and present residents of pompton lakes , where the plaintiffs say the company caused widespread contamination judge frank m donato declared a mistrial on the monitoring issue and and ended the trial the financial award was apparently a compromise forged by the jury after it reported three times this week that it was deadlocked on the issue after each jury note about an impasse , judge donato ordered the panel to continue , though a lawyer for dupont , john dwyer , asked for a mistrial each time , arguing that the judge was coercing a verdict that did not represent the jury s true views michael lombardi , a lawyer for the residents , said today of the damages award , all in all , we 're satisfied he said none of the three women had suffered a severe disability , something that is usually associated with sevenfigure awards he also expressed hope that dupont would enter settlement talks on the claims of nearly 1 , 600 other residents whom he represents their trial is still pending in a statement , e i dupont de nemours company said it was too early to discuss an appeal or settlement talks the statement called the 380 , 000 award comparatively small it also accused mr lombardi of overstating his case during the trial and said that the town is not generally contaminated the statement added , dupont will continue to work with pompton lakes city officials and community leaders on environmental issues and on redevelopment of the site the jury s verdict came in separate parts over two days on tuesday , it found that dupont had caused bladder cancer in helen maikath , 44 , and the insomnia , nervousness , mood swings and headaches suffered by colleen dunkerly , 42 today the jury awarded each woman 140 , 000 the jury also broke an impasse over the claims of a third woman , melissa robinson , 37 , and found that dupont was responsible for her rheumatoid arthritis and a hysterectomy she was awarded 100 , 000 two jurors reached tonight said that the panel discussed figures ranging from no award to 1 million for each woman before settling on an amount for damages the two declined to say how the panel settled on the final figures during the trial , mr lombardi , the residents' lawyer , argued that over decades , discharges of lead , mercury and chemical solvents from the plant had created townwide pollution in pompton lakes , a threesquaremile suburb of nearly 11 , 000 , and had contaminated a well there dupont acknowledged polluting the groundwater under the 600acre site and an adjoining neighborhood , as well as tainting a nearby river and scores of backyards along the acid brook , which flows about two miles from the plant site to a lake , pompton lake but the company said the well met drinking water standards dupont also said that any pollution found after the mid1980 s , when extensive monitoring started , did not exceed state and federal safety standards in the 1990 s , the company said , it spent about 130 million removing contaminated soil from about 130 properties near the plant , which produced blasting caps and fuses for military and commercial use from 1902 until it closed in 1994 in 1997 dupont paid 385 million to 427 residents , mostly plant workers , who lived in a companyowned village next to the site that settlement prompted 1 , 600 residents to sue for damages and medical monitoring , including the 10 in the trial before judge donato in addition , about 500 other past and present residents have sued dupont in federal court in newark the jury found on tuesday that all three women , plus a fourth , meghan debonta , 18 , who said she suffered from regular headaches , had been exposed regularly to dupont s pollution but the panel decided that dupont was not responsible for ms debonta s ailments on tuesday , the jury required dupont to pay 115 , 240 for medical monitoring for ms maikath , ms dunkerly , and ms robinson

there is a chance orlando hern ndez made his final home start for the yankees last night hern ndez has one more scheduled start , on saturday in baltimore , and from there his future is uncertain will he start in the postseason \? will the yankees trade him this winter to squeeze jeff weaver into the rotation \? or will hern ndez , who has somehow survived to this point , play an important role this october and beyond \? hern ndez struck out eight tampa bay devil rays over eight innings last night , but he lost , 32 , because the yankees could cobble only two unearned runs on six hits the game ended with the yankee stadium crowd standing and chanting mvp ! for alfonso soriano , who lined out to right and has been stuck on 39 home runs for the last six games soriano needs one home run to become the fourth major leaguer with 40 homers and 40 steals in the same season he was hit by a pitch , singled twice and walked before he lined out the three balls he put in play went to center or right , a sign of plate discipline when he could be swinging freely , especially with the yankees' division title secure my dream is over i hit already 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases , soriano said if the 40 comes for me , i will be happy about it but if it does n't come , i'm ok i think about 3030 , and i do it i'm a little surprised to have 39 home runs now i'm more patient , and i want to play my game and think about the playoffs i do n't think about home runs it s better for me to be ready for the playoffs hern ndez said flatly that he was not looking ahead to the playoffs he grew impatient when asked if he was concerned about his status i do n't worry about that , he said through a translator just ask questions about today s game , that s it my family s waiting for me later , hern ndez added we have n't gotten to the postseason yet we still have games to play here , and that s what i worry about mariano rivera followed hern ndez and worked a scoreless ninth inning , breaking the bat of each of the three hitters he faced it was his second outing since coming off the disabled list with a shoulder strain , and manager joe torre will pitch him on consecutive days at some point this week rivera was encouraged by the movement on his pitches and said he would be ready for october as soon as he worked on consecutive days once i do that , i know i will be ok , he said hern ndez s performance was not an audition torre said he had all the background he needed to decide on a playoff rotation , and he talked about it last night with the pitching coach , mel stottlemyre honestly , we have not made up our minds , torre said i know it s been assumed that duque will be left off this mix , but that has not been decided the yankees \( 9858 \) trail oakland by one game for homefield advantage throughout the playoffs , but they are not vigorously pursuing that edge none of the regulars rested last night , but that will be the exception this week being on the road in october is no big deal , torre said , but the yankees may win in spite of that attitude because they start an established pitcher every night torre faces some tough choices as he narrows the rotation and lines his pitchers up the yankees will probably play the wildcardleading anaheim angels in the first round , which starts at yankee stadium next tuesday night if they do , that matchup would favor roger clemens to start game 1 and , potentially , a deciding game 5 anaheim devours lefthanded pitching , with a 3015 record when the opponent starts a lefty no other team in the majors has more than 26 victories in such games despite the secondhalf success of the lefthanders andy pettitte \( 102 since the allstar game break \) and david wells \( 92 \) , clemens could draw the assignment that is pettitte s prediction i have no idea , but i feel like roger s going to go game 1 , said pettitte , who beat the angels twice in august other than that , i do n't really know i feel like i'm going to pitch , and that s the way i'm approaching it i have no clue , but i imagine that he would lead us in clemens did not face the angels this season , but he has more career victories against anaheim \( 27 \) than against any other team and is 192 at yankee stadium the last two years experience will enter into it , torre said of his decision he 'll have to pitch well here it s who we play , too you shake them all up and see who comes out torre often says there are no egos in october , pointing out that in 1999 , clemens recommended hern ndez to start the first game but with an 85 record this season , hern ndez has done little to set himself apart he pitched in relief in the final game of the 2000 division series and had a save coming off the disabled list this june otherwise , hern ndez has been adamant about his preference to start torre knows he will soon have a difficult conversation with the starter he removes from the rotation he is hopeful that pitcher will understand i think any one of my starters , in a postseason situation , can pitch out of the bullpen , torre said i 'd like to believe when the decision is made and they 're made aware of it , they say , 'i may be unhappy , but it s more important to win than what type of role i'm going to play in it' inside pitch jason giambi returned to the lineup as the designated hitter after missing three games because of a stiff back giambi visited a chiropractor , who adjusted his vertebrae and ribs , which had been out of alignment hopefully , it wo n't pop back out , giambi said manager joe torre said he expected giambi to return to first base soon , and giambi said the injury did not concern him a shirtless fan jumped from the stands in the ninth inning last night , a scene reminiscent of the attack on tom gamboa , the royals' firstbase coach , last week in chicago the fan approached tampa bay right fielder randy winn , but quickly moved away and was led off the field by security officers photo orlando hern ndez , in what may have been his last home start as a yankee , gave up eight hits in eight innings \( barton silverman the new york times \)
the brooklyn public library has picked a leading mexican architect to design its visual and performing arts library as a luminous , spectral speedboat floating at anchor in front of the brooklyn academy of music and the williamsburgh savings bank tower , poised to sail down flatbush avenue before selecting enrique norten of ten arquitectos in mexico city , the library considered three other distinctive proposals a trelliswork tsunami , a mirrored jewel case and a cubist wedge none of which resembled a classic marbleclad repository but each of which would send the message that a quiet institution had begun to stir there s been a nagging sense that this place has n't gotten the recognition it deserves , given its reach and scope , said evan kingsley , the library s deputy director for external affairs we have begun to dream big dreams the greatest symbol of that is the visual and performing arts library the building would be the cornerstone of a new cultural district envisioned in fort greene by the brooklyn academy of music local development corporation harvey lichtenstein , chairman of the corporation and member of the jury that chose the design , said the new library would be a beacon , making things transparent and inviting people to come in the choice of mr norten , to be announced today , puts the library in the company of other new york institutions the hearst corporation , the museum of modern art , the new york times company and the pierpont morgan library among them that have reached outside the city recently in awarding important commissions only one finalist for the brooklyn project , rafael vi oly architects , is based in new york this firm designed the dramatic , arching wavelike structure the jewelcase proposal , wrapped in a screen of mirrored panels , was by ateliers jean nouvel of paris huff gooden of charleston , sc , designed a wedge with wall planes and columns at angles recalling a cubist canvas ground is not to be broken

operating budget ten to 15 percent of the cost will be met by the local development corporation , mr lichtenstein said , using capital funds from the mayor , the borough president and the city council he declined to specify the amount , but simple math suggests a figure around 10 million the library would eventually share the triangular cityowned block now the site of midtown s green house garden

sense of cultural unity northsouth that i'm hoping becomes more active in coming years , mr riley said the visual and performing arts library is mr norten s first commission in new york city , though he has served as a juror in design competitions here he is a professor of architecture at the university of pennsylvania among the best known projects by ten arquitectos are the hotel habita , which

said , were its appropriateness as a gateway to arts resources its capacity to delight , inspire and welcome the degree to which it advanced the practice and theory of architecture its permeability

washington , jan 17 the justice department announced a global manhunt today for five suspected members of al qaeda who were videotaped in afghanistan offering what attorney general john ashcroft described as martyrdom messages , indicating that they could be preparing for a suicide attack at a justice department news conference , mr ashcroft said the statements were made on five hourlong videotapes found by american special forces in the rubble of a compound occupied by muhammad atef , one of osama bin laden s chief commanders military officials have said mr atef was killed in an airstrike on kabul in november mr ashcroft said the videotapes , one for each of the five , depict young men delivering what appear to be martyrdom messages from suicide terrorists exactly what the men said could not be verified because the authorities stripped the sound from the excerpts played at the news conference , and they provided no transcript because the language was still being analyzed nevertheless , mr ashcroft said the tapes showed that the men represented a significant threat he said they may be trained and prepared to commit future suicide terrorist acts he asked people around the world for help to identify , locate and incapacitate terrorists who are suspected of planning additional attacks against innocent civilians one of the five men , ramzi muhammad abdullah bin alshibh , was named last november as an unindicted coconspirator in a case that was brought against zacarias moussaoui , the only person charged so far in the sept 11 attacks mr shibh , a yemeni citizen , was an associate of mohamed atta , the suspected ringleader of the hijackings , and the authorities believe he was intended to have been one of the hijackers mr shibh , who lived in germany , provided mr moussaoui with thousands of dollars that the authorities said mr moussaoui spent for flight training and other preparations for the sept 11 plot , according to the indictment against mr moussaoui the other four men are a mystery one man s identity is unknown the others were identified by justice department officials as abd alrahim , muhammad sa'id ali hasan and khalid ibn muhammad aljuhani mr ashcroft said the authorities did not know the nationalities or backgrounds of the four men or when the tapes were made none have been charged with a crime , but their pictures are being circulated to police agencies around the world and anyone with information is asked to contact the nearest united states embassy or fbi office in other developments involving al qaeda , the british authorities charged two algerian men arrested last september with membership in the terrorist network page a10 excerpts from three of the tapes were played today , depicting mr hasan , mr juhani and mr rahim the other tapes were found damaged , officials said photographs of the men have been retrieved from those tapes , but experts are trying to extract the full content of the videos the tapes were made on digital video recording equipment , officials said in the tapes shown today , mr hasan , whose head was wrapped in a cloth , seemed somber , his eyes downcast as he read from a text mr rahim was sitting informally on the floor with his back against a bare wall he wore a dark green sweater and gestured with his left hand , smiling once , as he spoke mr juhani sat in front of a sheet , his arms around a kalishnikov automatic rifle in the excerpt shown , he closed his eyes and hung his head with his lips touching the gun barrel abruptly , he looked up and grinned law enforcement officials said the tapes were found recently but would not say precisely by whom or when or where in mr atef s compound answers to such questions would be critical if prosecutors ever sought to use the tapes as evidence in a criminal trial officials said military personnel had given the tapes to the central intelligence agency , which gave them to the fbi in classified form in the past week so far , translators have produced only a working consensus about the overall meaning of statements on the three undamaged tapes , the officials said they have not prepared a full written translation from arabic one official said the men invoked allah and spoke of accepting their fate on behalf of a great cause the official described the statements as rambling , philosophical testimonials the tapes contain harsh antiamerican rhetoric and allusions to war against the infidels but do not describe specific operations or any timetable for action even so , when senior fbi and justice department officials were told of the suicidal statements , they decided to make them public before completing a translation , the officials said mr ashcroft said he and other officials would decide later whether to release the sound or other details from the videos , depending on security concerns about whether the tapes contain hidden messages the portions we released today we felt were safe for release , and we did n't believe they contained any surreptitious messages or coded signals that would be designed to alert parts of the terrorist network , he said mr ashcroft acknowledged that experts who had analyzed the videotapes could not determine where , when or how the men might be planning to carry out a terror operation whether or not the attack would be imminent is something we ca n't determine , mr ashcroft said , adding that the government was justified in issuing a warning the right time to release is in advance of any attack , if there is to be an attack robert s mueller iii , the fbi director , said the tapes were culled from a trove of valuable information collected by troops and intelligence officers in afghanistan he said there was no evidence that any of the men had entered the united states , although mr shibh had tried photos muhammad sa'id ali hasan ramzi bin alshibh khalid ibn muhammad aljuhani abd alrahim identity unknown \( photographs from fbi \)
salt lake city , feb 21 four years are a very long time to wait particularly if you are 17 , as michelle kwan was in nagano in 1998 she cried when tara lipinski dashed out and took the gold , but kwan soon decided to try again in 2002 , and the next four years began last night it went bad all over again for kwan sixteenyearold sarah hughes , skating with joy and maturity and a nearly perfect arsenal of jumps , rushed confidently from fourth place and took the hearts of the crowd and forever claimed the title of goldmedal champion in the biggest single event of any winter games irina slutskaya of russia held on to second place while kwan , subdued but gracious afterward , took the bronze the evening was much like the one in nagano , four years ago in 1998 , kwan was the favorite going into the long program , but she came out lethargically , and spindly young lipinski came out jumping hughes appeared a bit too calm in the short program on tuesday , but last night she was radiant from the moment she took the ice , second in the final group of six nothing she did caused her to lose that glow she jumped and she spun and she stepped and she spiraled , and when it was over she smiled with a mixture of disbelief and pride oh , my gosh , it was amazing , hughes said just a roar i could n't hear my music you had to be here to believe it it was electric actually , around 16 , 000 people were there , but none of them was on the ice , and in that wonderful zone , the way sarah hughes was i skated for pure enjoyment , she said that s how i wanted my olympic moment to be she is a poised highschool junior from a solid family with five siblings from great neck , ny she lives at home and studies in the long car rides going across to her training site in new jersey and she reads the papers and she generally has a grip , as well as a sly urban sense of humor on the biggest night of her life , at least so far , she was bursting with good energy to go along with her athletic skill she comes by the moves from her father , john , now a tax lawyer , who was a hockey star at cornell and was later cut from the toronto maple leafs in his native canada the daughter had the competitiveness to skate hard , even though she started the night in fourth place i did n't think it was possible , after being fourth in the short , hughes said after kwan had stalled and slutskaya had skated an admirable program that would have won her the gold if the 16yearold long islander had not already seized the evening it is not mathematically easy for somebody in fourth place to move to first through the long program , but hughes was overpowering a few people with russian jackets clapped in the press section when kwan fell during her program , totally bad form the predominately american crowd cheered loudly for kwan , and cheered more than politely for slutskaya , but the fans knew they had seen a goldmedal level performance by the youngster the competition was under the specter of a lateafternoon threat from russia to pull its athletes out in protest over various perceived injustices in the judging and testing of athletes maybe the russian olympic officials were merely verbally banging their shoes on the table , a la nikita khrushchev at the united nations in 1960 , but as word spread last night , there could have been distractions for skating judges there could be issues for officials in the big usrussia semifinal men s hockey game scheduled for today there was also the threat of a south korean legal action over a controversial decision in speedskating wednesday night all this tumult came after the decision to award duplicate gold medals in the pairs of figure skating last week the olympics have gone litigious , big time kwan was ahead going into last night s long program but there were no guarantees , no ironclad prenuptial kind of deal that said she would automatically take first place just by skating serenely sometimes figure skating is akin to totally competitive sports things got more perilous for kwan in salt lake city with the crabby little squabble involving the canadian pair of jamie sal and david pelletier , and the latterday scheherezade , the woman who told a new story every day , now known forever as the french judge once that whole thing blew up , the judges gave signs of thinking for themselves , which made it highly dangerous for kwan , who skates smoothly but has trouble nailing two triple jumps in a row the judges were hearing about the proposed plan to go to a new scoring system that rewards jumps and plays down the scripted look any instability threatened kwan going into last night , but the judges' acknowledgment of hughes was a nobrainer it s not that there are not upsets in figure skating in 1988 , katarina witt was the favorite , and debi thomas showed up with something else on her mind love she crashed and burned within seconds and liz manley of canada whirled into the silver , and might even have taken the gold if the judges had not already chosen witt in their minds in 1992 , kristi yamaguchi just flatout won the gold in 1994 , nancy kerrigan of the united states skated beautifully , but then oksana baiul of ukraine skated with imperfect passion , and threw in some jumps at the end and won the gold baiul s triumph has been seen as a victory for spontaneity , but it may have reflected regional tastes in skating , if not outright geopolitical leanings these are still kicking around , as we can see four years ago , a youngster outperformed kwan when it mattered most kwan has insisted she did not come back merely to claim what was rightly hers she knew better than to make that statement but competitive skating was her life , and she continued on with it for another four years i heard the audience try to lift my spirits when they started clapping in the middle of the program , kwan said last night i made a few mistakes but i kept on going strong it just was n't meant to be tonight in some sports , tonight means just one night in the olympics , tonight really means four years , and that is a very long time to wait , and have another young skater take the prize away photos sarah hughes skated the cleanest and most technically difficult free program , jumping from fourth place to win the gold medal \( photographs by ruth fremson the new york times

birmingham , ala , nov 19 an alliance of environmental and civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit here today in a lastditch effort to block the army from burning tons of chemical weapons in a populated area the suit demands that the army complete more environmental studies before proceeding with its plan to incinerate thousands of old shells containing nerve gas , mustard gas and other deadly agents at the anniston army depot the lawsuit contends that the plan should be halted so scientists can consider recently discovered , less risky alternatives the army plans to begin destroying the weapons early next year to stop the project , one of the issues the alliance must prove is that the weapons disposal poses an imminent danger to the community to place this burden on us is unacceptable , said brenda lindell , a homemaker who has been active in local causes in anniston , a city of 24 , 000 people 58 miles east of birmingham if there is an accident , there is no way to protect us what about our children \? what about our elderly \? what about those of us who like to be outside \? to help make anniston residents feel better , local officials said they would pass out gas masks and duct tape to seal homes that made most people feel worse they know it s not safe or they would n't be doing do that , said the rev abraham woods , president of the birmingham chapter of the southern christian leadership conference and i hate to play the race card , but it s always in communities with high proportions of minorities that the government is committed to using outdated , dangerous technologies anniston is about half white and half black the army , which houses 9 percent of the nation s chemical weapon stockpile at the anniston army depot , says that its process of burning chemical weapons at 2 , 700 degrees is completely safe and that no fumes that could hurt the public will be released the project has already safely eliminated 25 percent of the nation s total stockpile , including 38 percent of all munitions using the current technology , said michael b abrams , spokesman for the anniston chemical agent disposal facility local officials , though , say they are not ready for the burning to begin they are still waiting to obtain bids for gas masks and other equipment the project has already been delayed several months opponents of the plan called a news conference today on the steps of the federal courthouse in downtown birmingham , where the suit was filed , but the turnout was sparse several environmental lawyers accused the army of taking advantage of what they called alabama s lax environmental laws and its image as backwoods and poor they 're treating us like a third world country , said byron bart slawson , who helped draft the suit there are other plants that burn old chemical weapons , including ones on johnston island in the pacific ocean and at tooele , utah , in the great salt lake desert but none are in populated areas the anniston plant is in a hilly region surrounded by churches , parks , schools , fastfood restaurants and homes despite the repeated assurances from army officials , people here expect trouble they have been told that a shrill whoopwhoop is the most serious of several publicaddress siren tones , signaling a major disaster they have studied evacuation plans army officers now acknowledge that more than 800 mortar shells and m55 rockets are leaking , though only trace amounts , of deadly nerve gas the lawsuit , which seeks a preliminary injunction against the army , is similar to suits filed in other states , including one pending in oregon , but few have prevailed the anniston suit has three parts , with the first arguing that the government is obligated , under federal environmental law , to research safer alternatives to burning weapons in the past few years , scientists have discovered how to neutralize weapons with chemicals , but the last environmental impact study the army did for the anniston plant was in 1995 , before much of that research was done the second part of the suit says burning weapons creates imminent and substantial endangerment to public health the third says the army knowingly misrepresented and underestimated the risks and impacts of the emissions on minority populations mr abrams , the army spokesman , declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit photo an army plan to incinerate chemical weapons at this site in anniston , ala , is under attack from environmentalists and civil rights groups \( grant bankenship the gadsden times \)
french scientists digging in central africa have uncovered a skull , virtually complete and almost seven million years old , that belonged to an individual about the size of a chimpanzee it is , they say , the earliest known member of the human family , by perhaps as much as a million years the discovery , described in today s issue of the journal nature , is being hailed as the most important fossil discovery in decades surprised by the age , complexity and geography of the fossils , paleoanthropologists spoke of the find as a critical and perhaps revolutionary turning point in the study of human origins the scientists said it was too early to know whether the skull represented a species on a direct ancestral line to humans in fact , the fossils a cranium , two lower jaw fragments and several teeth suggest an evolutionary complexity and diversity in human origins that seem to defy description by the simplified family trees of the past what is especially striking , and puzzling , is the skull s mixture of primitive and advanced characteristics the braincase is apelike , but the face and teeth are more like those of a human the cranial capacity is similar to that of living chimps the skull is of an age , scientists said , that it could be expected to provide telling evidence of life at the time the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged some of its characteristics suggest that the skull is closely related to the last common ancestor of humans and chimps and may yield an understanding of what those apelike creatures were like in the journal report , the discoverers called the skull the oldest and most primitive known member of the hominid family , close to the split of hominids and chimps as such , they predicted , the find promised to illuminate the earliest chapter in human evolutionary history at any rate , the specimen is sufficiently distinct from apes and other human precursors , or hominids , to be given a new genus and species name by the discovery team , headed by dr michel brunet of the university of poitiers in france its formal name is sahelanthropus tchadensis , recognizing that all the specimens were found in the harsh desert region known as the sahel in central africa south of the sahara more commonly , the hominid is being called toumai , a name often given to children born close to the dry season toumai is arguably the most important fossil discovery in living memory , rivaling the discovery of the first 'ape man' 77 years ago the find which effectively founded the modern science of paleoanthropology , said dr henry gee , nature s paleontology editor this is really an extraordinary find , said dr ian tattersall , an expert on fossil hominids at the american museum of natural history it broadens our perspective in two directions in time and in geography the absence of volcanic ash layers at the fossil site prevented the discoverers from dating the specimens in absolute terms and with the usual scientific methods but a comparison of other fossils found at the site with similar ones from welldated sites in east africa yielded an estimate of six million to seven million years for the chad fossils it s seven million years old , so the divergence between chimp and human must be even older than we thought before , dr brunet said molecular biological studies have indicated that the divergence occurred five million to seven or eight million years ago although the research is controversial , orrorin tugenensis , a specimen reported in kenya two years ago , had until now claimed the title of earliest hominid , at about six million years an ardipithecus ramidus , which lived about 58 million years ago in ethiopia , was a close competitor so the chad discovery opens a window on a fateful period in evolutionary history about which the fossil record has been so sparse that the remains could fit in a shoebox also , none of the other early specimens include almost complete skulls , which are considered more revealing of a fossil species' place in the hominid family toumai is about three million years older than the nextoldest hominid skull the discovery site , in the djurab desert in chad , is more than 1 , 500 miles west of the more familiar fossil beds of east africa , in ethiopia , kenya and tanzania as dr daniel e lieberman , a harvard paleontologist , said we 've been looking exclusively in east africa and south africa and basing our evolutionary tree on what we find there brunet has reminded us that we must find out what was going on in central africa and west africa , and that s going to be harder to do because of more difficult environmental conditions in studying the skull , dr lieberman recognized a third reason , besides the specimen s age and location , for scientists to be excited and challenged by the discovery that is the skull s mosaic of primitive and advanced characteristics you expect something that age to be very chimplike , dr lieberman said but this one s face is the face essentially of a homo habilis , at two million years ago , and yet this face is almost seven million years old this is all the more puzzling because australopithecus afarensis , the lucy species that lived 32 million years ago , has a decidedly chimp like face what s happening \? reversing evolutionary patterns and trends , dr lieberman said , is extremely rare , if not impossible several scientists said the discovery thus seemed to undermine the simplest linear models of hominid evolution if the earliest hominids like toumai were directly ancestral to australopithecines like lucy , dr lieberman pointed out , there would have had to have been two reversals to reach the advanced characteristics of the homo lineage otherwise , he added , toumai is ancestral to some other hominids that then gave rise to the homo species , in which case australopithecines are a side branch outside the human ancestral line in an appraisal accompanying the journal report , dr bernard wood , a paleoanthropologist at george washington university , favored a bushy model of hominid evolution over a simple linear model the many branches reflect evolutionary diversity in response to new or changed circumstances so dr wood said the bushy , or untidy , model would predict that at six to seven million years ago we are likely to find evidence of creatures with hitherto unknown combinations of hominid , chimp and even more novel features dr wood further predicted that toumai was just the tip of an iceberg of taxonomic diversity during hominid evolution five to seven million years ago one important question is whether the newfound fossil species stood upright and regularly walked on two legs , which has been a defining aspect of hominid behavior the discovery team has yet to find any skeletal bones associated with toumai dr brunet , the team leader , said the position where the spine entered the head does n't prove that he is bipedal , but it shows he could be photos a

shares of tyco international fell 28 percent yesterday after a research firm questioned whether tyco is the subject of a government investigation the research firm , sec insight of plymouth , minn , had asked the securities and exchange commission in november to disclose its recent correspondence with tyco , a bermudabased conglomerate that employs 240 , 000 people worldwide and makes a wide range of things including security systems , health care products and telecommunications equipment in a newsletter published yesterday , sec insight said the commission had turned down the request last month on the grounds that disclosing the information might interfere with law enforcement activities in rejecting the request , the commission did not say whether tyco was actually being investigated , sec insight said nor did it offer any specifics about what government agency might be investigating tyco or disclose whether any possible inquiry was civil or criminal maryanne kane , a spokeswoman for tyco , said yesterday that tyco was not currently being investigated by the sec she said she was not aware of any other civil or criminal investigations by federal , state or local authorities , aside from one federal grand jury investigation in connecticut that the company has disclosed that investigation concerns accusations of violations of the clean water act at one or more of tyco s plants , the company has said an sec spokesman declined to comment yesterday john gavin , president of sec insight , said we 're trying to evaluate a data point that suggests there s a new investigation today we do not know for sure that there s a new investigation mr gavin said that the commission refused to provide its correspondence with tyco to sec insight on dec 19 , in response to a request that his company had made in november he said the refusal was striking because the commission had not invoked the law enforcement exemption in response to a similar request by sec insight about tyco in april short sellers of stock , who profit when the share prices of companies fall , have for years contended that tyco s accounting practices are overly aggressive , and yesterday s questions seemed to rattle tyco s shareholders the stock fell as low as 5569 in midday trading before rebounding somewhat to close at 5725 , down 165 more than 21 million shares were traded on the new york stock exchange , twice the average daily volume but wall street analysts , who are bullish on tyco , said the selloff was an overreaction by investors skittish about accounting problems after the recent collapse of enron , the huge energy trader the market is acutely sensitive to any potential indication of impropriety , said michael regan of credit suisse first boston we find none in the sec insight newsletter s claims , but investors want to shoot first and ask questions later two years ago , tyco was the subject of an inquiry by the sec into its accounting practices the commission concluded the investigation in july 2000 without taking action against the company
following through on one of its most provocative business plans , orbitz , the airlineowned online travel agent , has activated an electronic connection that allows it to book tickets directly in the reservation system of american airlines the setup allows orbitz to bypass the central reservation systems that handle nearly all of the airline bookings by other travel agencies another eight airlines have agreed to create similar links with orbitz , which now sells about 2 percent of the airline tickets in the country orbitz had been using worldspan , one of the three big reservations systems , to handle all its bookings , and will continue to use worldspan for airlines that do not offer the direct connections orbitz says that the fee that it will charge airlines to make reservations directly will be about onethird what the airlines are paying to worldspan booking fees are something on which we spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually , said craig kreeger , vice president for passenger sales at american orbitz supplier link offers a new , lowercost model american has created a direct connection to one corporate customer and hopes to establish similar links to other corporations and travel agencies the new system will not change the way travelers use orbitz , though it may reduce errors in which flights were offered but were not actually available in their desperation to cut costs , the airlines have singled out the fees they pay to the reservation systems as a major source for potential savings the three big reservation systems sabre , galileo and worldspan each charge the airlines about 4 per flight segment on each ticket booked the average ticket has about 25 segments , meaning the airlines pay 10 a ticket on average to the reservation systems orbitz estimates that airlines in the united states pay a total of 22 billion in booking fees particularly galling to the airlines , the reservation systems rebate as much as half of the booking fees to travel agents , and offer their computer terminals to the agents free over the last few years , the airlines have been cutting the commissions they paid to travel agents , and most eliminated base commissions entirely last year , and they view the reservationsystem rebates as a back channel for commissions the airlines created orbitz , which opened to the public in june 2001 , in large part to create a cheaper way for them to sell tickets the airlines agreed to give orbitz access to cheaper web fares that previously were available only on their own individual web sites these low fares allowed orbitz to quickly become one of the three biggest online travel agencies , along with expedia and travelocity in return for those cheaper fares , orbitz agreed to pass back to the airlines 60 percent of the rebate it receives from worldspan that deal meant the airlines' cost to book an average ticket on orbitz was 8 , compared with an overall average of 11 with its new service , orbitz is charging the airlines 4 a ticket , no matter how many flight segments are involved competitors argue that orbitz s deal to get exclusive low fares is unfair and an antitrust violation rivals have begun intensive lobbying in washington to have the deal declared illegal in the meantime , they dismiss the orbitz directconnection system as more promotion than substance if you have a direct connection , you are just pushing costs from one place to another , said sam gilliland , the chief executive of travelocity , the online travel agency owned by sabre holdings in the end , it will have very little economic benefit to the airlines alex zoghlin , the chief technology officer of orbitz , said that the online service is performing every function for american that worldspan had and that the costs to set up the link with american , a unit of the amr corporation , was minimal sabre , meanwhile has its own proposal to reduce reservation fees , but for corporate travel , rather than for the individuals who mainly use orbitz sabre has proposed cutting its fees to the airlines in half if travel agents agree to forgo fee rebates and to use sabre s online corporate booking service , gettherecom such an arrangement would involve agreements by airlines , travel agents and their corporate clients so far it has no takers both galileo , owned by the cendant corporation , and worldspan , which is owned by three airlines , have said they are looking at ways to address the airlines' concerns and reduce their fees and the travel agent rebates but none has made specific proposals mr zoghlin says that orbitz will be able to handle reservations far more cheaply than can the big reservations systems because it uses newer , lessexpensive technology the orbitz reservations system that replaces worldspan took only 14 computer programmers to create and runs on six 3 , 000 pc s but analysts questioned the significance of the orbitz arrangement for the airlines unless other travel agencies copy the model the airlines say this will save them money , but orbitz is still a small percentage of tickets sold , said lorraine sileo , an analyst with phocuswright , an online travel consultant until they can get 10 , 20 , 50 percent of tickets sold using direct connect , they are not going to get real savings
thirteen years after a central park jogger was beaten and raped on a night of teenage violence that horrified new york , prosecutors pointed to a convicted killer yesterday as the probable lone rapist and asked a court to throw out all the convictions of five harlem men whose graphic but unsupported confessions had sent them to prison in a remarkable turn in the infamous case , the office of the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , submitted to state supreme court a report on new evidence that not only presaged a reversal of the convictions early next year but also appeared to raise the curtain of mystery that has long shrouded the events in the park on the night of april 19 , 1989 excerpts , page b6 the prosecutor s report reopened a window on 1989 , an era of rampant crime and racial tensions in new york that had generated a climate of fear and a sense of vulnerability in a citizenry that felt helpless against marauding teenagers in the streets , subways and parks contradicting a longstanding theory that the jogger had been gangraped , the report said that an 11month reexamination of the case had found dna and other persuasive evidence that the woman had been brutally beaten , raped and left for dead by one man , matias reyes , a murderer and serial rapist who confessed last january that he alone had attacked the jogger the report , a motion by nancy e ryan , mr morgenthau s chief of trials , to join the defense in seeking a dismissal of all charges , said that a fresh look at the confessions of antron mccray , kevin richardson , yusef salaam , raymond santana and kharey wise , and a reconstruction of the events that night suggest that the youths could not have raped the jogger because they were elsewhere in the park , assaulting , robbing and harassing joggers , bikers and others , on a night of what one suspect called wilding , a term police investigators had never heard before the report also said that the convicted youths' confessions videotaped , written and so powerful that they persuaded two juries who had heard almost no other evidence were actually so full of discrepancies and errors regarding the rape , even about where , when and how it took place and who was involved , as to make the statements implausible as evidence of the rape in addition , the report said , many details in the confessions were never corroborated none of the dna evidence linked the youths with the jogger , for example , and their descriptions of her clothing and injuries , the weapons used and other details were at odds with the facts the report also noted that these weaknesses were not exploited by defense lawyers in two trials the report said nothing about investigators' using coercion or trickery to obtain the confessions , as supporters of the convicted men have charged but it suggested that the youths' statements regarding the rape each minimizing his own role while implicating others might have amounted to false claims by the teenagers trying to become witnesses rather than defendants the report also undercut the only physical evidence offered by prosecutors in the trials to link the youths directly to the jogger it said that strands of hair found on mr richardson and on another youth who was charged but never prosecuted in the rape had been shown in recent dna tests not to have come from the jogger , though prosecutors had exploited them in the trials as matching or consistent with hers the report contained no sweeping admonitions about a miscarriage of justice , and did not portray the convicted men as innocents who committed no crimes in the park on the night of the rampage but in an avalanche of facts , it focused narrowly on legal grounds and argued that , given the new evidence , the verdicts probably would tip in the defendants' favor if new trials were to be held but in carefully constructing an argument that the five men had been wrongly convicted , the report made no attempt to assign blame for how it happened , and it did not criticize , or even name , any of the detectives and prosecutors who handled the case , one of the most important in mr morgenthau s 29year tenure besides the dismissal of rape and assault charges in the jogger case , the report recommended that the men s convictions for other assaults , robberies and crimes that night should also be set aside while there was ample evidence to show they were part of a pack of 30 youths who beat and harassed eight other victims , the report said the youths had been portrayed in court as predators in a vicious sexual assault , and thus jurors' perceptions of them would have been tainted for judgments on the secondary charges we conclude that there is a probability that the new evidence , had it been available to the juries , would have resulted in verdicts more favorable to the defendants , not only on the charges arising from the attack on the female jogger but on the other charges as well , the 58page report concluded while mr morgenthau approved the report , he made no comment yesterday and declined requests for interviews elizabeth lederer , who led the prosecution in two trials in 1990 , and linda fairstein , who oversaw the prosecution as chief of the sex crimes unit , also made no comment
the wellspoken fellow who rules the stage in brutal imagination , cornelius eady s lyrical meditation of a play , is a custommade partner in crime he is ready , willing and , well , weary he s been this way before , you see , always appearing when called , slightly changing his contours to suit the situation and take the blame his name is mr zero , and he s the ultimate imaginary accomplice and adversary the menacing black man as scapegoat programmed both to live forever and never to exist at all for many americans , mr zero was indeed briefly a real person , figuring menacingly in news reports for more than a week in 1994 , as the anonymous black man who carjacked a mazda belonging to a south carolina woman named susan smith , with her two young children in it ms smith , it turned out , had killed her children the carjacker was entirely her invention resuscitating this frightening invention of racism and desperation and letting him speak for himself is the bold and inspired idea behind brutal imagination , which opened last night at the vineyard theater it s the sort of concept that grabs you instantly and ferociously , and a corresponding excitement glitters through the opening moments of this twocharacter chamber work , directed by diane paulus the excitement , however , is intellectual , which in theater is enough to arouse interest but not to sustain it despite a highly polished performance by joe morton as mr zero , this production registers as an elegant but often frozen abstraction mr morton s character is described in the play as a flimsy ghost of an idea who is groomed to only go so far and therein lies the inherent problem of the play brutal imagination maps the construction and deconstruction of this phenomenon in vivid metaphors but you really get the whole portrait 10 minutes into the show though there is some provocative , stylishly staged interplay between mr zero and his creator , ms smith \( sally murphy \) , you are always aware of these people as conceptual tools whether speaking in character or from news accounts of the time , their voices are always the author s , not their own brutal imagination was adapted by ms paulus and mr eady from his long poem of the same title , a 2001 national book award nominee not surprisingly , the play s language can be ravishing , with phrases that burrow and grow in the memory listen , for example , to mr eady s evocation of uncle tom , commenting on mr zero i watch another black man roam the land , dull in his invented hide such observations are set off moodily by an elegiac musical score by diedre murray , who collaborated with mr eady and ms paulus on running man , a stirring \( and more thoroughly realized \) musical theater piece from 1999 the designer mark wendland has created an evocative threedimensional collage of objects ranging from a car door to a baby stroller that suggest an entire life smashed by headon collision , superbly underscored by kevin adams s lighting unfortunately , these ingredients never cohere into a transporting whole the effect is mostly of a poetry reading , with incidental music and annotative gestures the 70minute production might indeed have worked better in a straightforward concert presentation as it is , you are always aware of the gap between dramatic gesture and ruminative text mr morton , best known for his lead role in the john sayles s film the brother from another planet \( 1984 \) , brings energy , presence and flash to his part , which embraces not only mr zero but also his cultural forebears \( these include the usual suspects buckwheat , aunt jemima and stagolee , as well as uncle tom \) but he is glazed throughout with a distancing air of irony ms murphy works hard at suggesting the emotional neediness that drove ms smith to behave as she did but mostly her character is defined only in relation to that of mr zero there s none of the anchoring personal detail that would make her truly scary or pitiable every so often , words and performances blend into images that suggest a real play could be made of brutal imagination , scenes in which a destructive mother and her fantasy villain seem to melt into a single identity for the most part , however , brutal imagination seems to turn into printed words even as you watch brutal imagination by cornelius eady music by diedre murray directed by

washington , april 11 with the bush administration and congress uncertain about what should happen to amtrak , and the railroad discussing the possible abandonment of its longdistance network at the end of the summer , the general accounting office provided a different perspective today the system is already just about gone jayetta z hecker , director of physical infrastructure issues at the accounting office , told a house subcommittee on railroads that of the 46 states the system served , 34 had fewer than 1 , 000 passengers a day ms hecker said that in 12 states there were fewer than 100 passengers a day in some places only one train a day runs in each direction , or sometimes none but , ms hecker said , amtrak was much more successful on shorter routes where it could compete more effectively with airplanes new york , new jersey and california had more than 5 , 000 passengers a day amtrak carries about 64 , 000 passengers a day , ms hecker said , but outside california and the washingtonnew yorkboston corridor , that number is only about 20 , 000 in contrast , interstate buses carry nearly 1 million people a day and the airlines carry about 18 million that is despite recent improvements in the use of amtrak the national association of railroad passengers , a nonprofit group , said the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 was the fifth straight year in which ridership grew although airline passengers have declined because of fear of terrorism , amtrak s ridership was higher from november to february , compared with the same period the year before while amtrak struggles with longdistance service , acela express , its highspeed rail service in the bostontowashington corridor , appears to have drawn even in ridership with the airline shuttles serving that route in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks , the associated press reported today acela ridership stood at 219 , 917 in march , or about 300 a train the airlines do not issue corresponding numbers for the shuttles , but filings with the government s bureau of transportation statistics show that delta air lines and us airways reported 215 , 366 passengers on the boston shuttle routes in december , down from 330 , 040 in december 2000 as for amtrak s four transcontinental routes , ms hecker said they were just not designed to serve the market trains that pass through rural states once a day or less , in the middle of the night , are not a viable means of transportation , she said , and the amtrak strategy to make the system more useful by having more frequent trains had failed the bush budget listed 521 million as a place holder for amtrak , but the administration appears not to have a position on the issue at this point it has been discussing franchising parts of the system , or handing them out to private companies under competitive contracts , but does not appear to have decided chart large numbers of amtrack acela express riders in 2001 ridership per route line width indicates total number of riders in 2001 graph shows number of riders , measured in thousands do not make up for amtrak s losses nationwide on long distance routes loss per route line width indicates amtraks operating losses in 2001 graph shows losses , measured in millions national ridership 4 , 146 , 000 acela express 2 , 652 , 000 national total a loss of 5812 milllion acela express a gain of 513 million \( source amtrak , amtrak reform council \) map of united states highlighting routes

phoenix the year was 1990 , and of the thousands of newcomers arriving in arizona , at least two were not lured by the blue skies and the dry desert heat kenneth williams , fresh from the fbi academy , came as a rookie agent and would soon become the terrorism expert at the bureau s office here hani hanjour , only 18 , came to study english , and later flying he would become a terrorist their paths would apparently never intersect in his years in arizona , mr hanjour overcame the mediocrity of his talents as a pilot and gained enough expertise to fly a boeing 757 into the pentagon but according to former agents , mr williams could not overcome the limitations placed on him , namely a phoenix field office whose commitment to fighting terrorism did not match his own in recent months , mr williams has earned national praise after the disclosure that senior officials of the federal bureau of investigation ignored his memorandum last july calling for a nationwide canvass of flight students from the middle east the rejection of that memo , combined with the whistleblower testimony of coleen rowley , an agent in the bureau s minneapolis office , has created the impression of a washington bureaucracy impeding the work of the offices in the field but an examination of mr williams s tenure as an agent , and of mr hanjour s simultaneous flight training , shows that many problems now attributed to fbi headquarters also existed in arizona for much of the 1990 s , some former agents say , the arizona division , preoccupied with fighting drugs , treated international terrorism as a low priority , even though tucson had been one of the nation s earliest hubs for radical muslim groups this has always been the lowest priority in the division it still is the lowest priority in the division , said james hauswirth , who retired from the phoenix office in 1999 but stays in contact with other agents last december , mr hauswirth wrote a letter to the bureau s director , robert s mueller iii , criticizing the way terrorism was handled by the arizona division , which comprises the bureau s several offices in the state , the main one here only last year the phoenix office , citing budget cutbacks , disbanded the surveillance unit often used by the division s terrorism squad and mr williams , regarded as the best terrorism agent in the office , had to interrupt his presept 11 investigation of middle eastern flight students in order to spend six months on a highprofile arson case he filed his flightstudent memo to washington a month after the arson case was solved he fought it , mr hauswirth said of that assignment why take your best terrorism investigator and put him on an arson case \? he did n't have a choice guadalupe gonzalez , since 1998 the special agent in charge of the phoenix office , defends the handling of international terrorism on his watch mr gonzalez agrees that the top priority in the office before sept 11 was fighting drugs , because of arizona s standing as a busy transshipment point for narcotics from mexico still , he says , he and other supervisors did not neglect efforts against terrorism i think the work that was done in arizona was good , said mr gonzalez , who is leaving the office in august to take over the dallas office it s kind of like timing if sept 11 had been a year later , maybe other things would have evolved it s like guessing we can all guess about what could have happened resources to fight terrorism were limited , however the arizona division grew enormously during the 1990 s , partly because of antidrug programs like the southwest border initiative of the division s current total of 230 agents , mr gonzalez said , roughly 60 are dedicated to drug work , while about 16 handle international and domestic terrorism , a task that includes monitoring domestic militias one former agent says the number of agents dedicated to guarding against international terrorism is about eight in last year s annual ranking of office priorities , mr gonzalez said , drugs ranked first , international terrorism fourth one former arizona agent , roger browning , who retired in 2000 , said the fact that the phoenix office dedicated substantial resources to customary crime fighting was understandable but he questioned whether the fbi needed to be so heavily involved in drug work the domain of the drug enforcement administration and said agents wasted too many hours on tasks like chasing deadbeat dads fear and frustration mr hanjour , who remains the least known of the four men believed to have piloted the hijacked airliners , has often been described as meek and hesitant , hardly the sort to attract fbi scrutiny he first came to arizona in 1990 to visit a brother in tucson who had arranged for him to take an eightweek english course he soon returned to his native saudi arabia to work on a family farm , and his time in tucson appears to have been uneventful but if mr hanjour had apparently not yet come in contact with terrorist groups , the tucson he visited in 1990 was already a wellestablished stop for islamic militants during the 1980 s , their enemy had been the soviet union , which had invaded afghanistan alkhifa , a group that recruited fighters and raised money for the jihad in afghanistan , had one of its three american offices in tucson federal authorities believe that by 1990 , after the soviets retreated from afghanistan , osama bin laden had absorbed alkhifa into al qaeda , his new terrorist organization
daniel j fuss and kathleen c gaffney say they are n't having any trouble finding cheap bonds for their 13 billion loomis sayles bond fund despite the uncertain economy and tensions with iraq , the managers say the unusually wide gap between the yields of corporate bonds and treasury securities should narrow , with corporate bonds likely to be the winners as the economy improves because of credit worries and an oversupply of issues , they are finding particular bargains among investmentgrade and junk bonds issued by technology , telecommunications and power companies , mr fuss said from his office in boston in some cases , bonds that typically yield five to eight percentage points more than 10year treasuries are now trading up to 20 points higher obviously , these are very highrisk bonds , he said however , there are a few within the group that represent reasonable speculations the managers are also finding value in cyclical securities , which should respond favorably to a rebound in economic activity , ms gaffney added as a result , the fund , which had nearly 10 percent of its assets in treasury securities in september , owns none today the fund returned 57 percent a year , on average , for the three years through thursday , versus 37 percent for its group of multisector bond funds , which own a mix of corporate and government bond issues in the united states and overseas , according to morningstar inc it returned 11 percent in the last 12 months , versus 51 percent for its group mr fuss , 69 , is vice chairman of loomis , sayles company , the fund s adviser ms gaffney , 40 , is a vice president of loomis they choose the fund s 300 or so issues mostly from among american investmentgrade bonds they can invest up to 35 percent of the fund s assets in highyield , or junk , bonds that stake is now 28 percent spreads in some parts of the highyield universe are very high right now , ms gaffney said , although we have to be careful , with ratings surprises coming through the fund can also invest up to 20 percent of assets in emergingmarkets and other overseas issues that stake is now 15 percent the managers look for call protection , which forbids issuers from paying off the bonds within a specified number of years as a result , they generally avoid mortgagebacked securities when interest rates fall , mortgage holders tend to refinance loans , forcing investors to reinvest at lower rates the managers also seek bonds with high yields for their duration and credit quality say , 50 basis points , or hundredths of a percentage point , more for mediumgrade corporate bonds rated singlea or tripleb over all , the fund s yield to maturity is 828 percent , versus 678 percent for its customized benchmark a weighted combination of the merrill lynch government corporate bond index and the merrill lynch high yield master index the governmentcorporate index gets twothirds of the weight in september , the fund bought norwegian sovereign debt due in january 2007 and rated aaa by standard poor s it paid 10278 kroner , then worth 1372 , for each 100 kroner in face value on friday , the bonds closed at 10390 kroner , or 1447 the yield to maturity is 599 percent , versus 262 percent for united states treasury securities of comparable maturity norwegian shortterm rates are high , mr fuss said , because norway s central bank is worried about inflation he said he would not buy more because of the risk of a decline in the currency this fall , the fund bought a zerocoupon bond issued by nextel communications and due in october 2007 the bond , rated b by s p and thus in the highyield category , added a 975 percent coupon in october , creating a blended yield of 1476 percent the managers paid 8150 for each 100 in face value it now trades at 92 the bond was cheap because telecommunications companies have been out of favor , ms gaffney said , adding , over the next two years , we expect the credit to improve to bb because of the improving growth and profitability of the company among cyclical companies , ms gaffney and mr fuss like fort james , a unit of georgiapacific that raised capital for its european operations in 1999 the managers paid 87 euros for each 100 euros in face value for the 475 percent coupon bond , due in june 2004 it closed on friday at 9250 euros mr fuss said the issue , rated bb by s p , is sharply discounted for three reasons many european investors are unfamiliar with this type of bond , he said , and many american investors are uncomfortable with eurodenominated debt and many people are worried about the parent company s asbestos risk , mr fuss said , adding that he thinks it is containable photo bond bargains can be found in the technology and telecommunications sectors ,

lewiston , me , oct 10 rumors began running through this overwhelmingly white workingclass city after a stream of somali immigrants started arriving a little over a year ago people whispered that somalis were getting free cars , courtesy of the government , 10 , 000 grants , even free airconditioners and groceries word had it that they got to jump to the head of the line for governmentsubsidized apartments none of this was true , but the intensity of the false rumors reflects the distinct unease surrounding the sudden arrival of so many somalis to this fraying mill town more than 1 , 000 have poured into this city of 36 , 000 in the last 18 months immigration experts said they could not think of another city that , proportionately speaking , had absorbed so many newcomers so quickly a downtown dotted with seenbetterdays stores and adult book shops is now also filled with somali women in the colorful head scarves called hijabs about half of the 400 somali adults have already found jobs , but city officials say the somalis have also strained social services , including welfare , job training and englishasasecondlanguage programs the culture clash came to a head this month when mayor laurier t raymond jr wrote an open letter to the somalis of lewiston , asking them to stop other somalis from coming the mayor s letter , written in english to a community with many nonenglish speakers , said please pass the word we have been overwhelmed and have responded valiantly now we need breathing room our city is maxedout financially , physically and emotionally the letter exploded like a grenade among somalis here and set off ripples across the state and beyond somali elders responded with their own letter , accusing the mayor of being an illinformed leader who is bent towards bigotry they wrote that many somalis or their children were american citizens and were helping lewiston s economy by moving into vacant apartments and opening new stores we think your letter is an attempt to agitate and incite the local people and license to violence against our people physically , verbally and emotionally , they wrote state officials and others got involved attorney general g steven rowe wrote to tell the somalis how important you are to our maine community gov angus s king jr wrote to lewiston residents announcing a task force on immigration and refugee issues and trying to welcome somalis without disregarding the concerns of many of lewiston s other residents i know larry raymond and he is not a racist , governor king said in an interview i would n't have written that letter he wrote i was in lewiston last month meeting with somalis and my message was , 'you 're welcome here' but i think he felt that what he wrote was more innocent than was interpreted the recent blowup has really obscured the fact that lewiston has really dealt with a situation that would be difficult for any community on friday , after days of not speaking publicly or to the somalis mr raymond , 71 , finally met with somali leaders he stopped short of apologizing , but said in a statement , those who have interpreted my letter as a 'call to draw lines in the sand' totally misunderstood my message the mayor , who is giving interviews only to local reporters , told the lewiston sunjournal , for me to apologize just to placate them , when i did n't believe i did anything wrong , would be an insult the mayor conceded that he should have met with somali leaders before releasing the letter somalis have complained that the mayor had not met with their community in his year in office we 've met a lot of the senior folks , the governor , the previous mayor , said mohamed farah , vice president of somali community service of maine , one of several social service agencies the somalis have set up here this mayor , he does n't know what s going on somali leaders issued a softer statement after friday s meeting , saying we understand the social and economic pressure that new entrants bring to the community we hope that others appreciate the potential richness and opportunity newcomers bring to the city many people say the tensions remain for one thing , the sentiments in the mayor s original letter seem to have many adherents the somalians are thinking that they 're going to come here and that they 're basically going to take over our city , said jim spencer , 29 , who started circulating a petition about the immigration problem even before the mayor s letter the petition has 116 signatures one signer scrawled , send them all home ! a lot of them will give you dirty looks , they 'll talk in their own language when you walk by and they 'll laugh and they 'll point and go heehee haha , said mr spencer , a former 7eleven employee whose neighborhood has many somali residents some somalis are smarting i think they are a little bit trying to undermine our intelligence , said garaad dees , 43 , who moved to lewiston seven months ago from new orleans when you see something that is wrong like the letter and they tell you it s not , then that is insulting on sunday , about 300 people attended a march organized by a methodist church to support the somalis the mayor did not participate most somalis arrived in lewiston from atlanta , placed there by the federal government as refugees but many found lewiston cheaper and safer just like everybody else , i want my kids to do well and be safe , said said tani , 42 , who moved here five months ago just like everybody else , i want to have a house by the beach one day phil nadeau , the assistant city administrator , said the city , maine s second largest , has worked hard to accommodate the somalis , piecing together federal and state grants mr nadeau said the welfare budget has nearly doubled and the city has earmarked 350 , 000 , about 1 percent of its budget , for services to help somalis this fiscal year that may sound small , he said , but lewiston , with one of the state s highest tax rates , is nervous that state and federal money might dry up somalis say that the mayor s letter was poorly timed because the influx had already begun to slow they say they commute as far as portland and freeport for jobs some residents say they fear the mayor has only stoked resentment it was just very poor judgment and very poor leadership , and it affects the whole community very badly , said kim blake , 38 but the mayor has many defenders the mayor could have done it in a different way , but you know what , with them people you almost have to be blunt like that , said susan bergeron , 25 , an employee at sears they think this is a great opportunity for them , this prejudice thing if you look at them the wrong way or they do n't have enough money , they say it s prejudice photo somali women strolling in downtown lewiston , a city that has been a magnet for somalis in the last year \( herb swanson for the new york times \) map of maine shows the location of lewiston more than 1 , 000 somalis have recently moved to lewiston , me

citing an analysis that shows stiffer prison sentences meted out in federal court for gun crimes , police commissioner raymond w kelly is seeking to expand a program under which people arrested by the police for certain crimes can be prosecuted by federal authorities the move is part of a broader effort to stem gun violence , and comes in response to a recent surge of shootings , particularly in parts of northern brooklyn and the bronx , despite a decadelong decline in reported crime the initiative , project impact , is in some measure modeled after a program that was started nearly two decades ago by rudolph w giuliani , then the united states attorney in manhattan , under which people arrested for certain crimes , mostly involving drugs , would be prosecuted in federal court on certain designated days mr kelly said the new initiative began on tuesday in the bronx , where the office of district attorney robert t johnson began reviewing certain types of gun and drug cases when the cases fit certain criteria , mr johnson s prosecutors will forward them to the office of the united states attorney in manhattan , james b comey , for prosecution while the program is in its earliest stages , mr kelly said the department was talking to district attorneys in other boroughs and hoped to expand it to other parts of the city the end game is , generally speaking , get people more time , based on the structure of federal offenses , mr kelly said this week generally speaking , people do more time when prosecuted by federal authorities , he said odalys c alonso , a senior aide to mr johnson , said the program would focus on certain problem areas of the bronx , where officials believe narcotics crime is fueling violence the initiative is intended to expand on a fiveyearold program called project triggerlock , under which the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms takes certain state gun cases to federal court that program has been successful , said alan vinegrad , the united states attorney in brooklyn , whose office has used it to nearly double its gun convictions in recent years while none of the 12 arrests in the bronx on tuesday fit the criteria , and were all handled in state court , mr kelly said he hoped to increase the number of cases given to mr comey s office state gun arrests can be prosecuted federally , ms alonso said , when the person arrested is also in possession of drugs , admits to being a drug user , is a convicted felon or a fugitive who has fled another state , is an illegal alien , is subject to a restraining order or has been convicted of a domestic violence offense the analysis of prison sentences in state and federal gun cases cited by mr kelly was conducted by garry f mccarthy , the department s deputy commissioner of operations it found that of the 151 people prosecuted for gun crimes under project triggerlock since 1997 , 64 percent were sentenced to one to four years in prison and 34 percent to four to eight years or more of 6 , 965 felony gun arrests during the same period handled in state courts , 57 percent were sentenced to a year or less in jail there are some pitfalls several defense lawyers who handle federal cases said the plan could flood the federal courts mr comey said that while his office traditionally focused on larger narcotics organizations and international traffickers , the police department had asked them to help out what we 're looking for both in terms of the streetlevel drug enforcement and in firearms enforcement is to find ways the da s and police department think it makes sense to use federal resources , he said my philosophy of being a federal prosecutor is almost like being a free safety in football the object is to follow the play and figure out where the defense can use your help
washington , oct 17 the director of central intelligence , george j tenet , told a congressional panel today that the risk of a new terror attack inside the united states was as grave and immediate as it was before the sept 11 hijackings , even though american intelligence agencies have vastly expanded their counterterrorism efforts in the past year the threat environment we find ourselves in today is as bad as it was last summer , the summer before sept 11 , mr tenet told the joint intelligence committees investigating the attacks it is serious , they 've reconstituted , they are coming after us , they want to execute attacks you see it in bali , you see it in kuwait , said mr tenet , who along with other bush administration officials has said in recent days that al qaeda s resurgence has been demonstrated by recent attacks on marines in kuwait and the terror bombing in bali that killed more than 180 people they plan in multiple theaters of operation , he said they intend to strike again mr tenet was not asked directly how the cia could stop a future attack when it failed to stop last year s hijackings he told the panel that the agency had greatly increased its counterterrorism budget and staffing in the past year and had taken new steps to penetrate and disrupt terrorist organizations the warning was not the first such assessment from the country s intelligence chief but it was mr tenet s starkest warning yet of another attack , and he offered it as he defended the agency s performance from unusually harsh criticism by lawmakers at today s hearing some lawmakers accused the cia and other intelligence agencies of misreading warning signs and ignoring numerous opportunities to thwart the sept 11 attacks others questioned whether mr tenet was moving aggressively enough carl levin , a democratic senator from michigan , accused the cia of a serious error in failing to alert the fbi in march 2000 after the agency learned from a third country that nawaq alhazmi , who later turned out to be among the hijackers , was inside the united states responding combatively at times , mr tenet defended the cia s counterterrorism record and said the united states faced a relentless adversary that would attempt terror strikes at any cost but he conceded specific missteps , like the failure to alert the fbi about mr alhazmi other officials have said the cable about mr alhazmi was buried under the thousands of overseas reports received each day there have been thousands of actions in this war an intensely human endeavor not all of which have been executed flawlessly , mr tenet said despite the lapses , the cia director insisted that his agency had long been aware of the threat posed by osama bin laden s terror network he said that with the creation of the agency s bin laden issue station in 1996 , the cia had been engaged in a sustained , highpriority effort to disrupt al qaeda at the start of today s hearing , the intelligence committee s staff released an updated report about its investigation of the fbi s lapses in the case of zacarias moussaoui , who has been charged with being part of the sept 11 plot the report offered new evidence of how his arrest aroused suspicion at the fbi and cia that he might be a terrorist hijacker the committee also released portions of testimony that mr tenet delivered to the panel about the sept 11 hijackings in a closed session on june 18 in that hearing , mr tenet said that when an associate of mr bin laden s suggested attacking the world trade center with small aircraft packed with explosives , it was mr bin laden himself who suggested using even larger planes today , mr tenet said the cia had built up its counterterrorism operations even as the agency faced budget restraints in the 1990 s after the collapse of the soviet union , the agency s main adversary during the cold war he said that the intelligence community , like much of the national security community , was asked by both congress and successive administrations to pay the price of the 'peace dividend' at times , the tension between mr tenet and some lawmakers , mainly democrats , flared into the open bob graham , the florida democrat and chairman of the senate intelligence committee , tried to restrict mr tenet to a 10minute statement , reminding the cia director to cut short his remarks as mr tenet continued past 20 minutes sir , mr tenet replied icily , i just have to say i 've been waiting a year mr graham relented , and mr tenet spoke for nearly an hour before he completed his opening statement mr tenet told lawmakers that before sept 11 , the cia received threat reports about the prospect of a large qaeda operation , but none of them indicated where , how or when mr bin laden s operatives might strike in the months leading up to 9 11 , we were convinced bin laden meant to attack americans , meant to kill large numbers , and that the attack could be at home , abroad and both and we reported these threats urgently , mr tenet said , adding that none of the reports were specific today s hearing was the final public hearing of the joint committees after a halting start , the panel conducted a series of hearings and produced a series of reports critical of the cia and fbi robert s mueller iii , the fbi director , and michael v hayden , the director of the national security agency , also testified today but it was mr tenet who came under the most scrutiny in his testimony , mr tenet said the cia had broken up several terror plots before and after sept 11 but he acknowledged there would be more failures it is important for the american people to know that despite the enormous successes we 've had in the past year indeed over many years al qaeda continues to plan and will attempt more deadly strikes against us there will be more battles won and , sadly , more battles lost mr levin offered the most critical assessment of the performance of american intelligence agencies prior to sept 11 , us intelligence officials possessed terrorist information that if properly handled could have disrupted , limited or possibly prevented the terrorist attacks , mr levin said at crucial points in the 21 months leading up to sept 11 , this intelligence information was not shared or was not acted upon and , as a result , numerous opportunities to thwart the terrorist plots were squandered mr levin asked mr tenet why the cia had failed to alert the fbi when the agency learned that mr alhazmi might be in the united states my question , he said , is do you know specifically why the fbi was not notified of that critical fact at that time \? mr tenet answered , the cable that came in from the field at the time , sir , was labeled 'information only , ' and i know that nobody read that cable mr levin continued , why did the cia not specifically notify the fbi \? sir , mr tenet replied , if we were n't aware of it when it came into headquarters , we could n't have notified them nobody read that cable in the march time frame should it have been read \? mr levin asked yes , of course , in hindsight , mr tenet answered of course , it should have been read photo george j

islamabad , pakistan , jan 5 pakistan has broadened its crackdown on extremist religious groups over the last few days , stepping up arrests of religious militants , but with a focus on groups accused of domestic sectarian violence the politically sensitive move came as president pervez musharraf traveled to nepal for a summit meeting of asian leaders india has massed troops along the border , threatening war over what it says is pakistani support for terrorism in the disputed region of kashmir general musharraf recently detained the leaders of two groups that have sought to drive india out of kashmir and have been labeled as terrorists by the united states more than a hundred followers of those two groups , lashkaretaiba and jaishemuhammad , have also been arrested over the last few days , more than 300 members of a militant sunni muslim group and about 100 members of a rival shiite muslim group have also been rounded up across the country , according to supporters of the groups , in what authorities describe as a drive against domestic terrorism the two groups have often clashed and have frequently been accused of killing opponents western diplomats are applauding the widening crackdown on militants here , but the latest detentions are only indirectly related to the violence in kashmir that led india to mobilize its armed forces the arrests , carried out at the height of the tense confrontation , do help to underscore general musharraf s politically useful claim that the crackdown on religious militants is intended to save pakistan itself from disarray , not to please foreign governments members of the target groups would have none of that they 're only making these arrests because of world pressure , mujib ur rahman , spokesman for the sunni muslim group sipahesahaba pakistan , said by telephone from lahore it s all because of the kashmir dispute and international pressure mr rahman denied that his group its name translates as army of the companions of the prophet was engaged in terrorism , saying , we are just a religious organization and we believe in the constitution and the law the rival shiite group suffering detentions is called tehreekejafria pakistan , which means movement for the shiite sect

at 78 , robert g shulman remains an active and distinguished member of the academic community at yale holding the title of sterling professor , yale s most prestigious rank , in the department of molecular biophysics and biochemistry , dr shulman still goes to his laboratory every day , where he conducts research on brain metabolism while teaching advanced biochemistry to mdphd candidates at yale medical school until the end of the spring semester , when he finally decided to give it up , dr shulman was also a team teacher of an undergraduate seminar on science and literature there are things i 've wanted to do and i can do them here , he said , explaining why he continues to work full time when other colleagues have long since retired eight years after congress put an end to college regulations that forced faculty members to retire by 70 , a growing number of professors have begun working past that age this is particularly true at some premier northeastern institutions like yale , columbia and new york university , but at other leading research universities , like the university of chicago and johns hopkins , faculty members also remain highly motivated and working conditions are close to ideal some college administrators continue to argue , as many did before the retirement rules were changed in 1994 , that the new workplace environment encourages professors protected by tenure to stay well beyond their prime this , they say , prevents promising younger scholars , particularly women and members of racial minorities , from gaining permanent positions other administrators say they are losing the energy and ideas that younger professors bring to their fields the problem is doubleedged , said jonathan r cole , provost of columbia chronological age is not always a good indicator of research and teaching ability , and some of the most cherished members of our faculty are older than 70 but , he said , a major research university always needs to revitalize itself with new ideas and new perspectives and those more often than not come from younger faculty members still , the evidence suggests that although many faculty members may indeed be putting off retirement , a great majority of them are still retiring by their mid60 s , and the trend of working longer has not been a major factor in the overall decline of employment opportunities at most colleges ronald g ehrenberg , the irving m ives professor of industrial and labor relations and economics at cornell , noted , for example , that while the number of fulltime faculty jobs shrunk significantly over the last decade , the primary reason has been fiscal teaching jobs have been eliminated or converted to parttime positions to save money the vast majority of american faculty are going to retire before age 70 , so lifting the age cap is not going to be that important at most institutions , he said the exception , he and others say , appears to be at the nation s elite private research universities , where professors tend to work longer than their colleagues at other institutions , and where there is more pressure to remain productive and stay in the forefront of scholarship these are people that are just so tied to their jobs they cannot conceive of doing something else and they want to keep working , said dr ehrenberg , who is chairman of the committee on retirement for the american association of university professors exactly how many faculty members are now working past 70 is not known david card , an economist at the university of california at berkeley and a coauthor of a major study last year on changing retirement patterns in academia , estimates that perhaps as much as 18 percent of the faculty members at the nation s fouryear colleges and universities are now 70 or older , whereas eight years ago , virtually none were but he noted that data in his study , done with orley ashenfelter of princeton , showed there was much variation among institutions and that the percentage of older faculty members appeared to be significantly higher at some of the nation s bestknown institutions calls to several universities seemed to confirm that at yale , almost 9 percent of the 370 tenured faculty members in core arts and sciences faculty are 70 or older at princeton , 49 percent are columbia , 7 percent harvard , 7 percent new york university , 7 to 10 percent and johns hopkins , about 10 percent for the last few years , columbia has offered a 30 , 000 financial incentive to professors who retire before the age of 70 but the steady rise in the ranks of older professors and complaints by department chairmen that they were losing flexibility to hire new teachers prompted the university this year to offer members of the arts and sciences faculty who were 70 or older a onetime offer of a full year s paid leave if they retired by june 30 to date , 14 faculty members have accepted the offer , according to david h cohen , vice president for arts and sciences a trend seems to be growing among colleges and universities to offer retirement incentives it began building in the early 1990 s when it became clear that congress would eliminate the exemption universities had under the age discrimination in employment act
at a promotional news conference tuesday morning , major league baseball unveiled its selections for the 30 most memorable moments in its history the allstar game played that night will not be no 31 in a worstcase scenario growing out of an evolution of baseball s popular midsummer game between the best players in the american and national leagues , the 73rd game did not have a winner the allstars played 11 innings and wound up with a 77 tie because the teams ran out of pitchers perhaps this day had been coming once an often fiercely competitive contest , the allstar game has evolved into an event that is the hub attraction of an entertainment extravaganza the managers still want to win the game , but they have made it a priority to attempt to get all 60 players into it that s what joe torre of the yankees and bob brenly of the arizona diamondbacks did in milwaukee on tuesday night , and by succeeding , they left themselves short of pitching when the game went into extra innings commissioner bud selig , in whose city the game was played , was left with no other decision than to end the game after 11 innings fans at miller park lustily booed the announcement that was made with one out in the nl half of the 11th and chanted , let them play ! in a telephone interview yesterday , selig reflected on the outcome the more i thought about it , i 'd have to make the same decision today that i made last night , he said the only option was to have position players pitch in the 12th inning that would have been a travesty nevertheless , he said we 've already started discussing it , and we will continue in the offseason to make sure this does n't happen again how do you do it with 30 players \? have pitchers and position players play longer instead of letting them play to a decision tuesday night fans obviously want decisions even in exhibition games , which is what the allstar game is major league baseball was left with another questionable development that added to a growing list of problems afflicting it the owners and the players are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement but are seemingly more on course to their ninth work stoppage in 31 years than to labor peace allegations of steroid use have called into question the achievements of baseball s most popular sluggers and have created demands for testing of all players the owners are trying to eliminate two teams for reasons of economic health and , in fact , would have already jettisoned the minnesota twins and the montreal expos had legal challenges not stepped in the way selig , in an interview in yesterday s houston chronicle , said one team might have difficulty meeting its payroll on monday and the television ratings are n't encouraging , either , with tuesday night s game the lowest rated for an allstar contest , down 14 percent from a year ago even an attempt to honor the memory of one of the game s greatest players went awry , though through no fault of baseball ted williams , who died friday , was a central part of the pregame ceremony , but the script had to be revised because of the attempt by williams s son to have his father s body frozen for possible future use and the allstar game s most valuable player award was renamed for williams , but it was n't given tuesday because no mvp was chosen had a player been named most valuable despite the tie and an award made on the field after the game , the scene would most likely have only incited the fans even more while standing by the decision to end the game , selig acknowledged yesterday that the tuesday night announcement had omitted one very important piece of information we should have done much better , he said , agreeing that the announcement should have included the reason we did not communicate as well as we should have to understand two significant ways in which the allstar game has changed , one need only look at two games and one scene from each at riverfront stadium in cincinnati in 1970 , pete rose scored the winning run in the 12th inning by crashing into the american league catcher , ray fosse , who was never the same player afterward as the teams changed sides after the first inning tuesday night , barry bonds met torii hunter , the al center fielder , near second base and spontaneously picked him up and held him over his shoulder it was bonds s goodnatured response to the catch hunter had just made , leaping above the centerfield fence and robbing him of a homer in the 12inning 1970 game , the al used seven pitchers and left two unused while the nl used five pitchers and left three on the bench the other night torre , who played in the 1970 game , used all nine of his pitchers and brenly used all 10 of his there was also a difference in the makeup of the staffs all 12 of the 1970 pitchers were starters of the 19 pitchers in milwaukee , 10 were closers and an 11th was also a reliever managers like having closers on their teams now because closers are accustomed to pitching one inning and pitching it effectively tuesday s closers plus the 11th reliever , mike remlinger , pitched 10 2 3 of the 22 innings none of the eight starting pitchers worked longer than two innings in 1970 , 4 of the 12 pitchers worked three innings each
inchon , south korea , june 11 david trezeguet s body language told it all after hitting the crossbar in the 74th minute , he lifted his palms to the sky and smiled meekly , as if to say , what can you do \? the french could do little today they could do little at this world cup and now they are gone the defending champions were knocked out at the end of the opening round by losing to denmark , 20 france became the first defending champion not to reach the second round since brazil failed in 1966 after winning the 1998 world cup and the 2000 european championship with open , attacking soccer , france did not score a goal in three games , losing twice and tying once the last team to play three games without scoring in the world cup was greece in 1994 , when the greeks gave up 10 goals and lost all three games , but they were not the defending world champions saudi arabia also lost its third game today , giving up 12 goals over all without scoring denmark , coached by morten olsen , a star of the attractive danish team in the mid1980 s , qualified for the second round with firm defense and enlightened counterattacks the danes reached the quarterfinals in 1998 , losing to brazil , but have not won anything since shockingly winning the european title in 1992 not even the return of zinedine zidane , france s star of the 1998 final game , could lift the french he tore a muscle in his left thigh in a friendly game against south korea 16 days ago and missed the first two games of the tournament it is difficult to say that even zidane could have raised this mismatched and weary lot france s defense has become creakingly old since 1998 , but at the same time it seemed to be coming up with a new generation of attackers none of it worked here , with or without zidane france lost in the ceremonial opening game to senegal , a former french colony whose players earn their living in the french league that seemed like an upset at the time , but senegal wound up qualifying for the second round in its first world cup , while france is done the old champs did manage to tie uruguay , 00 , in the second game , but a disputed red card to striker thierry henry , for a moderately physical tackle , forced france to play for a tie in that game and barred henry from today s game denmark came into today s game with 4 points and france with 1 denmark would have qualified as long as it lost by no more than a goal so the danes sent out essentially a 631 defensive alignment , with france trying to get at least one goal early , sending in long balls to zidane , despite this being his first game back from injury when those long balls failed , denmark waited and moved the ball downfield the stumpy stig tofting lofted a throwin toward the french goal , and it was rebuffed , but tofting poked it with his foot directly to dennis rommedahl , who ran onto the ball and easily beat fabien barthez in the 22nd minute now france was desperate , and denmark packed in its defense tofting , whose large bald head , squat body and droopy kneelength shorts make him look even shorter than his 5 feet 9 inches , popped up all over the defensive perimeter tofting might have been the most dominant player on the field today , although , mysteriously , zidane was named the man of the match , an award that could have come only from his copious marketers and sponsors the old champs showed a few glimpses of the fluid attack that thrilled and dominated europe in 2000 trezeguet s header came close in the 30th minute , and zidane whacked a free kick wide from 35 yards in the 38th minute early in the second half , marcel desailly hit a header off the crossbar then sylvain wiltord blasted one directly into the hands of goalkeeper thomas sorenson in the 63rd minute in the 66th minute , denmark got behind desailly and jon dahl tomasson converted for the insurmountable lead still , france tried to score , if only to remind people what it could do a few weeks or months ago but trezeguet hit the underside of the crossbar , and two minutes later wiltord actually fell down trying to flick the ball home from a few yards out he was not alone the entire french team fell down afterward , roger lemerre sounded like a coach about to lose his job a draw and two losses make it clear , he said it s hard to explain it i ca n't do it he said france would have to regroup for the 2004 european championship , and he said it was time to turn the page but after this failure , there will be a lot of pages turning on this glorious generation of french soccer that wilted so quickly senegal survives , advances suwon , south korea , june 11 \( ap \) senegal , a newcomer to the world cup , claimed a berth in the second round today with a 33 tie against uruguay uruguay rallied from a 30 deficit in the second half and came desperately close to eliminating senegal and advancing to the second round in the final moments senegal finished second behind denmark in group a and will play either sweden , england or argentina on sunday senegal scored its goals in the first half , one on khalilou fadiga s penalty kick and goals 12 minutes apart from papa bouba diop uruguay rallied in the second half the substitute richard morales scored in the first minute and diego forlan connected in the 69th a penalty kick by lvaro recoba in the 89th minute tied the score at 33 photo the forlorn star zinedine zidane , back , during france s loss yesterday \( reuters \)
washington it s not surprising that many officials in washington are talking about convening an independent panel to investigate the federal government s actions before the sept 11 attacks we now know that the federal bureau of investigation was warned by an agent in its phoenix office in july 2001 that operatives of osama bin laden could be studying at american flight schools and yet president bush was not told until recently about the warning we also know that mr bush was shown a daily intelligence report in august 2001 indicating that qaeda members were threatening to hijack american planes , but we do not know much about its context given these revelations , we will see various investigations within the fbi and other agencies , by congress , and perhaps even by a blueribbon commission of the kind appointed by lyndon johnson to study the john f kennedy assassination and by ronald reagan to study the challenger disaster it s a sign of our democracy s health that americans tend to question government even during national crises a halfdozen congressional , military and other panels investigated pearl harbor while americans were still dying in world war ii such investigations can calm public anxiety , push reforms upon government agencies and in some cases force out ineffective officials what they are unlikely to do is give us the kind of understanding that normally comes only decades later from history , when we will have full access to information and the distance to judge it properly the first reason for this is politics even the most avowedly nonpartisan investigation will inevitably be political hardbitten pols in washington know that if blame for the sept 11 tragedy can somehow be attached to former president bill clinton or mr bush the way the depression was once pinned on herbert hoover , years of partisan advantage could be gained the congressional investigation of pearl harbor in 1944 was enveloped in politics thomas dewey , who was running against franklin roosevelt , concluded after being briefed on the inquiry that fdr had known in advance about the japanese attack and failed to stop it privately fuming that roosevelt was a traitor who ought to be impeached , he was prepared to denounce the president publicly when general george marshall sent an aide to plead with him not to raise this divisive issue nevertheless , dewey s running mate , john bricker , told voters that the president was hiding his complicity in the disgraceful episode politics can also cause investigators to pull punches the joint congressional committee probing ronald reagan s role in the irancontra affair in 1987 might have fought harder for evidence of presidential wrongdoing if it had not been not so reluctant to risk the implosion of another presidency so soon after watergate another reason to keep our expectations modest is that no panel is likely to be allowed to comb through all of the information from institutions like the central intelligence agency and the national security agency that might show exactly what warnings of a qaeda attack were available and to whom that information was sent when congress investigated pearl harbor , for example , franklin roosevelt was understandably reluctant to let anyone know that the united states government had broken the japanese code in 1960 , when congress probed the soviet downing of a cia u2 spy plane , which exacerbated the cold war , the eisenhower administration was so determined to keep the blame away from the president that secretary of state christian herter may have perjured himself during his senate testimony although he knew that eisenhower had secretly approved every one of the provocative u2 missions , herter told the senators that decisionmaking about the u2 had never come up to the president in another case , when members of congress and the press scrutinized the cia s failed plan to topple fidel castro by landing a tiny force of cuban exiles at the bay of pigs in 1961 , they were not told of one aspect that might have made success more likely the expectation that mr castro might be murdered just before the men hit the beaches , and thus be unable to rally the cuban military against the invaders as richard bissell , architect of the invasion , told me in 1985 , the agency s plotting against mr castro was intended to reinforce his plan , making victory much easier a tendency by investigative panels to focus on a single document or warning without context can also lead to wrong conclusions after the cia belatedly discovered that the soviet union had slipped nuclearcapable missiles into cuba in midoctober 1962 , john kennedy s critics noted that a month earlier senator kenneth keating , a new york republican , had publicly charged that nikita khrushchev was installing offensive weapons in cuba and that kennedy was doing nothing about it was n't kennedy guilty of negligence \? it turned out that at the same time mr keating was making his accusations , the cia had been searching without success for unambiguous evidence of offensive weapons in cuba , and that keating s warnings were largely a lucky guess
pasadena , calif jorge ramirez shouted himself hoarse as his soccer team , the los angeles galaxy , trounced the dallas burn , 30 , in late june he left the rose bowl arm in arm with two friends , delighted by the victory , even though his primary sports allegiances lie elsewhere he wore a jersey from a mexican club am rica the one he grew up rooting for in mexico city and when mexico was defeated by the united states , 20 , in a secondround match of the world cup on june 17 , he was so upset , he recalled , that he grimaced and then cried an immigrant from mexico who moved here 14 years ago , ramirez said he loved his adopted country , but he remained loyal to the mexican teams because of what he called sports patriotism on 9 11 i was out there waving the american flag because this is my country , said ramirez , who is 32 and works as a cashier at a gas station and a porter at a bowling alley but soccer is different mixed feelings and all , ramirez represents what could be the salvation of professional soccer in the united states a readymade audience of zealots for a sport that is struggling to make money and striving to gain an emotional footing he is the kind of committed fan for whom major league soccer yearns , who could sustain professional soccer while it works to win over a reluctant mainstream market but so far fans like ramirez have proved elusive , for reasons that may have to do as much with missteps by mls and the united states soccer federation as with hispanics' sophistication about the sport and their sense of identity in this country los angeles , a county with a population of 95 million that is roughly 45 percent latino and overwhelmingly of mexican descent , is the kind of place where hispanic soccer fans take to the streets to celebrate their team s victory in an important match mexico s team , that is hello , columbus it is also the kind of city the united states national team has often avoided , having experienced booing and worse in games against teams from latin america for this world cup , the americans held qualifying matches in places like columbus , ohio \( where it defeated mexico , 20 , in february 2001 \) , to get a friendly home crowd although many hispanic fans are knowledgeable enough about the gamesmanship in international sports to understand the team s need for a homefield advantage , some noted that shunning an entire region is hardly the way to woo people they 're not taking advantage of their natural market when they decide to play away from where latinos and immigrants , not just latino immigrants but all of the immigrants , live , said antonio villaraigosa , a former speaker of the california state assembly sometimes , soccer officials have even appeared to go out of their way to antagonize latino fans in washington , humberto martinez , a native of el salvador who is now an american citizen , filed a federal classaction lawsuit last month against the united states federation and the operators of dc united , the mls team in washington he contended that he was denied premium seats for a world cup qualifying match against honduras last september because of his spanish surname martinez , a computer programmer who regularly attends dc united games , said he had received an invitation in the mail to buy tickets for the game but when he tried to buy seven tickets in the vip section at 55 each , he was told the seats were sold out federation officials restricted the purchase of the best seats through advance sales to what they call the us soccer family , which consisted of anyone who registered at the federation s web site thomas j simeone , martinez s lawyer , said his client was never told about the web site and he argued that the restriction was intended to keep latinos out of the seats closest to the field mr martinez was n't even going to root for honduras , simeone said it is a different story with local clubs like the galaxy , which depend on latino fans for survival and are trying to increase attendance by broadcasting games on spanishlanguage radio , playing exhibitions against latin american clubs and investing in a new stadium the crowd at galaxy games , which averages more than 20 , 000 , can be as much as 60 percent latino even fans like ramirez , who would root for his beloved am rica against the galaxy any day , attend most galaxy home games and follow the team for matches in san jose , a fivehour drive but many marketing experts and fans say that the legal dispute in washington and the national team s avoidance of los angeles reflect the failure of american professional soccer to reach out effectively to the country s 35 million latinos despite an increased focus on latinos , they say , the federation and mls seem more targeted toward the suburbs and the general market the galaxy right now , they do n't have a single mexican , said angela vasquez , 25 , who has attended the galaxy s home games for the last three years \( the team has five hispanic players , but none from mexico luis hern ndez , a mexican star , played two seasons for the galaxy \) with so many mexicans in la , to not have a mexican on the team is not very smart a failure to scout
like countless other high school guidance counselors , lloyd thacker has never believed that the academic attributes of colleges could be tabulated and ranked like the wonlost records of professional football teams in his 16 years as director of college counseling at jesuit high school in portland , ore , mr thacker has instructed his seniors to pay closest attention to whether the strengths of their dream colleges match their own interests , and whether the students at those colleges report being inspired by their professors and infused with confidence about their future to mr thacker , the percentage of applicants rejected by a university each year , or the median sat score of those accepted nuggets prized by handicappers like us news world report reflects little about what occurs in a classroom \( colleges nonetheless track these rankings as ardently as parents and students do , seeking , for example , to recruit record numbers of applicants in part because they know us news may be impressed \) but however much he considers us news s findings to be based on dubious science , mr thacker sees them as quantum mechanics compared with a roster purporting to identify the nation s top 100 high schools , at least as measured by their ability to supply graduates to highly selective colleges that survey was compiled this fall by a personal investing magazine called worth , whose only criterion was the percentage of students from a particular high school who had gone to harvard , yale or princeton hyp , in the magazine s shorthand from 1998 to 2001 it s so myopic that it s laughable , said mr thacker , who , like so many of his counterparts , urges applicants to consider the fouryear colleges , more than 2 , 000 in all , beyond the gates of harvard , yale and princeton a survey like this lacks courage it s educationally irresponsible , because we all know that a great education happens in all kinds of places the senior writer at worth who compiled the survey , reshma memon yaqub , acknowledges that the list of colleges she placed in her elite group should have been more comprehensive ideally , ms yaqub said , she would have liked to include seven more the five other members of the ivy league , as well as stanford and the massachusetts institute of technology but , she said , none would give her admissions records organized by high school nor , for that matter , would harvard , yale or princeton , or the high schools themselves ms yaqub found a way around their intransigence through back channels , she obtained the freshman class directories prepared each fall by harvard , yale and princeton , which include the high school affiliations of each student she thus had the grist for her study , which found that 94 high schools on this list of the hot 100 were private , including the three at the very top roxbury latin in massachusetts , and brearley and collegiate in manhattan though she said she had hoped to supplement her research with a second variable the average sat score of the seniors at each of the 100 high schools ms yaqub was unable to obtain a complete list of that information , either but as to the underlying premise of the exercise she ultimately performed that a high school s success can be measured , in large part , by the number of applicants it places at three premier universities ms yaqub is unapologetic nor is she concerned about the message she may be sending to parents and students about what is important in a high school education this is the only quantitative measure of high schools that has been successfully done , said ms yaqub , a graduate of winston churchill high school in potomac , md , which does not appear on her survey , and later the university of pennsylvania parents need something i feel this is at least something i wish the high schools would open their data to us , she said they do n't want to be ranked is it na ve to think that they should not have to be \? the proliferation of guidebooks that treat universities and now high schools as if they were no more complex than blockbuster movies this year s surveys include the princeton review s 345 best colleges \( up from 311 best three years ago \) has left lloyd thacker worrying that more and more children are making educational choices for unsound reasons mr thacker has become so concerned that this fall he has been sending email messages to university administrators to solicit essays for a book that he 'd like to edit its working title is college unranked college presidents and deans discuss admissions as if education matters among those institutions that have expressed interest , he says , are many that rank high in us news drawing \( david suter \)

confrontation that devolved into tragedy , in hungary , she wrote urgent appeals were broadcast to the western countries for help none came , only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed hungarians to keep up their struggle soviet troops crushed hungary s fight for freedom in 1956 , but more than three decades later , in 1989 , miss lewis witnessed the collapse of communism all over europe the new era starts now , she wrote in the foreign affairs column of the new york times in 1990 , after german unification emerged from the wreckage of the communist empire the decisions being taken will hold for a long time , perhaps as long as the cold war lasted this sense of novelty , of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications , accounts more for the unease , i think , than the behavior of germany from bismarck to 1945 in 1980 miss lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of the new york times , following anne o'hare mccormick and c l sulzberger , and held that position until the end of 1990 she remained a senior columnist of the times until 1994 , and after the newspaper ended that arrangement , she continued writing columns regularly for the new york times syndicate and the international herald tribune in paris , right up to this spring on the reporting trail or behind a typewriter she never learned to use a word processor , or would n't miss lewis was a formidable presence fiercely competitive , she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job , and she could outdrink it off the job no matter what the hour , her news antennae were always on miss lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with the associated press in new york and washington over the decades , she worked in europe and latin america for european and american newspapers , including the washington post her first column was published by newsday in 1966 she joined the times in 1972 as bureau chief in paris and also became the paper s european diplomatic correspondent this has always been a problem of mine , this tendency to spread myself too thin , miss lewis selfdeprecatingly told esquire magazine in 1980 , after she had left reporting to be a columnist again i dabble i 'll write about a gastronomic binge , i 'll write about nato , i 'll do an interview with nureyev , i 'll do a political piece i do n't know a hell of a lot about anything her journalism won her many awards , including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the georgetown university school of foreign affairs flora lewis was born in los angeles on july 29 , 1922 , the daughter of benjamin lewis , a lawyer , and the former pauline kallin , a pianist a precocious child , flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the university

a monroe resident and retired firefighter has been in the bridgeport correctional center since a dec 12 altercation with police , who went to his home with a searchandseizure order and removed two pigs that the man , stanley czupkowski , was keeping as pets this was not the first time monroe police have seized pet pigs from mr czupkowski , 58 police originally removed the two pigs , a vietnamese potbelly pig and the unburied remains of a fourth pig from the property june 18 under an order to cease and desist violating the town s zoning regulations in addition to relinquishing the pigs , mr czupkowski was ordered to post a 10 , 000 bond for the town to clean up his property police obtained the second searchand seizure warrant months after mr czupkowski bought the two pigs , called rosie and arnold , back from the middlesex livestock auction in durham mr czupkowski said he attempted to find a permanent home for them he temporarily kept them at a farm in newtown , where he often visited and fed them , until the man who was keeping them lost his lease mr czupkowski said he tried to find another farm to take them , but when that failed , he brought them back home he placed them in a shed in the rear of his property where they had the run of the yard , but they sometimes wandered away the police said the pigs tore up neighboring yards on nov 24 , 26 , 27 and 28 the two pigs damaged hundreds of square feet of lawns , said john salvatore , the monroe police chief the pigs pushed the turf up and tunneled under it it actually looked like it had been bulldozed one neighbor estimated damage at 2 , 000 he and an adjoining property owner , whose yard was also wrecked , hired a landscape contractor to repair their yards mr czupkowski , interviewed in jail last week , said he was sorry about the damage and said he had offered to repair the damage right then and there i said i would make full restitution , he said i always try to make things right with people since 1993 , the monroe police department has logged 125 animal complaints against mr czupkowski for obstruction of traffic , yard damage and related nuisance charges mr czupkowski s pets , which have included pigs , geese and a sheep , caused at least one traffic accident , mr salvatore said the complaints resulted in multiple infractions , misdemeanor summonses , and custodial charges for failure to appear in court he has no previous criminal record mr czupkowski has also been battling the town , which has sued him , since 1988 over about 30 unregistered vehicles he had kept in his yard the town s zoning regulations forbid unregistered vehicles that are not shielded from view mr czupkowski said he has an antique fire engine and other oneofakind vehicles he also used the vehicles for parts monroe zoning regulations require five acres for barnyard animals mr czupkowski s 48acre property falls short of a strict interpretation of the regulations , but probably would not have caused a problem had the animals not repeatedly roamed , town officials and neighbors said none of the previous showdowns between mr czupkowski , the police and the town have been violent police said mr czupkowski lost his temper and began wrestling with officers who arrived at his home to remove the pigs mr czupkowski said he was scared when the police showed up at his door , but said he did not intend to harm anyone i may have resisted , but i never raised my hand , he said i wanted to call my lawyer to find out what was going on police said three officers were injured in the melee , and police subdued mr czupkowski with pepper spray one officer cut his finger when a door slammed on it , and another officer slipped and cut his elbow , requiring stitches a third officer was accidentally sprayed with pepper spray , mr salvatore said mr czupkowski was charged with interfering with a searchandseizure warrant and three counts of assault on a police officer he has been further charged with criminal mischief in the third degree and three counts of cruelty to animals he is being held on 30 , 000 bond a bridgeport superior court judge also ordered a competency hearing , mr salvatore said mr czupkowski retired from the stamford fire department in the mid1990 s after 22 years , he said he admits to having depression , resulting from the death of his parents and of his son , john , who was killed in a car crash in october 2000 he said he is so attached to the pigs , which he has had for three years , because rosie belonged to his son , who had raised her from birth john was attached to the pigs , mr czupkowski said rosie was the runt , but she was a spicey little thing and very special to him the only thing i have from him is the pig police found the pigs living in mud and their own droppings in a room off the ground level of the house , under the porch , with little hay and no water dishes , mr salvatore said there were scales and sores on the pigs , he said an emaciated dog with mange and little fur was found in another room the dog was euthanized , he said mr czupkowski said he and his wife were treating the animal , who had a severe skin sensitivity to fleas a neighbor who asked not to be identified said he did not agree with the way police and the town were handling the situation i do n't know why the town let this go on so long , said one neighbor , who asked not to be identified jack brandt , the monroe zoning enforcement officer who inherited the case three years ago , acknowledged that some people think the town has dragged its feet the case goes way back , he said i tried to work with stanley and his attorney he did store some of the vehicles in a garage , but the place was still a mess we 've removed 14 truckloads over the past week among the items removed were 100 tires , scrap metal , car parts , wire and other items , mr brandt said jack has been great i ca n't say the town has been demanding , said john turner , a lawyer in bridgeport who is representing mr czupkowski in his civil suit with the town stanley tried to comply with the court order he was building a garage and little by little was doing things he conceded that mr czupkowski s emotions ran high dec 12 , but said mr czupkowski would not hurt or neglect his pigs he did n't keep them penned and knows he made a mistake , but it s ridiculous for him to be sitting in jail , mr turner said photos roger tavella , assistant animal control officer in monroe , feeding rosie and arnold at left , workers repairing damage that the pigs caused to a neighbor s yard when they escaped from their own yard in november at far left , stanley czupkowski , owner of the pigs \( above and below , photographs by chris maynard for the new york times \)
george e pataki ran for governor in 1994 promising tax cuts , tougher criminal penalties , welfare reform and not much else it was a conservative platform well suited to the year of the gingrich revolution and it worked , as mr pataki unseated gov mario m cuomo times have changed , and so , it seems , has mr pataki his signature issues lost their political bite in an era of economic expansion , falling crime and plummeting welfare rolls now , mr pataki is seeking a third term on a platform of increased spending on schools and medical care , as a friend to the labor unions that once vilified him , and as the governor who has delivered gun controls , penalties for hate crimes and , prospectively , an equalrights law for gay people , which the senate has promised to pass in december in short , the governor is running in the nov 5 election as a liberal , although he would never use the word to describe himself critics on the right , like tom golisano , the independence party candidate , say mr pataki has become a counterfeit conservative critics on the left , including the democratic challenger , h carl mccall , call him a counterfeit liberal he defies easy labeling as right , center or left , said gerald benjamin , a political scientist at the state university of new york at new paltz , who is a republican and a former ulster county legislator he s pragmatic , he s opportunistic and he s very shrewd , politically a review of mr pataki s record reveals the paradox he has lowered taxes but increased spending , increased aid to schools but challenged a courtordered restructuring of school finance formulas , increased the open land under state protection but fallen short of his own goals on greenhouse gases there are more jobs under his watch , but upstate new york is hurting economically he has expanded access to health care , particularly for lowincome families , but the mentally ill languish in adult homes and nursing homes the governor s own words complicate the task of assessing his record he declined to be interviewed for this article but on many issues , he has set out on a fairly conservative course , then taken a turn to the left democrats complain that he has a habit of joining the parade midway through the march , then claiming to lead it michael mckeon , mr pataki s communications director , said the governor had been consistent there are basic principles that he believes in tax cuts , controlling spending , reducing welfare , a tough approach on crime , mr mckeon said he has always been a social moderate he s prochoice , he opposes discrimination in any form , and he s stood up against antiimmigrant policies what are often taken as changes in the governor s outlook are a product of changing times , mr mckeon said we inherited a 5 billion deficit , and then later there were record surpluses , he said the governor has worked hard to control the legislature s impulse to spend more than we can afford but the governor has always been eager , when the resources have become available , to put them into providing good services still , much of mr pataki s record begs the question should he be judged on what he proposed , or what he later agreed to \? how many of his original stances are merely bargaining positions , as administration officials say , taken to hold back the legislature s excesses \? with those questions in mind , here is a review of mr pataki s eightyear record in some major areas taxes and spending tax cuts were the central promise of mr pataki s 1994 campaign and the signal achievement of his first term the governor maintains that he has cut 19 different taxes 63 times , reducing taxes more than any other state his opponents complain that new york s state and local taxes are the highest in the nation and that property taxes are rising fast both sides are right we 've dropped from no 1 in the nation , all the way down to no 1 in the nation , said brian backstrom , president of change new york , a conservative group lawmakers have eliminated the income tax on suburbanites who work in new york city , the tax on utility bills and the state sales tax on most clothing , among others but the biggest state tax , the one mr pataki cut most deeply , is the personal income tax new yorkers are paying 21 percent less than they would be paying if the law had been left as it was in 1994 , a savings of more than 5 billion a year but by another measure , known as the effective tax rate , income taxes have declined far less in 1994 , new yorkers paid 495 percent of their incomes in state income tax in 2001 , it was 47 percent , because the prosperity of the intervening years greatly increased the share of income taxed at the highest rates the income tax cuts also made the system more progressive that is , the lower the income , the greater the savings , proportionally that was true of mr pataki s original 1995 plan , and the legislature pushed it further in that direction if you look at the whole array of tax cuts , they 've been very significant , and they 've been distributed in a way that benefits every taxpayer , said carole e stone , mr pataki s budget director

barcelona , spain , july 7 the vast majority of young gay and bisexual men in the united states who were found to have the aids virus in a new study were unaware of their infection , according to findings reported as the 14th international aids conference opened here today the rates of unawareness among minority gay men ages 15 to 29 in the study were staggeringly high among those found to have hiv , the aids virus , 90 percent of blacks , 70 percent of hispanics and 60 percent of whites said they did not know they were infected most of these infected men perceived themselves to be at low risk of being infected , despite having engaged in frequent highrisk sex like unprotected anal intercourse , said duncan mackellar , an epidemiologist from the federal centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , which conducted the study the study involved 5 , 719 men who were interviewed at dance clubs , bars and other places frequented by gays in baltimore , dallas , los angeles , miami , new york city and seattle it tested the men for exposure to the aids virus , finding that 573 had hiv of those , 440 , or 77 percent , had said they were unaware they were infected the results of the hiv tests were available to the men , but it is not known how many sought them , or learned that they were infected it is alarming that in the third decade of the epidemic we do n't know why so few black gay men know their status , said phill wilson , executive director of the africanamerican aids policy and training institute in los angeles mr wilson said more research was needed to send the best prevention messages to ensure that these men know their risk and understand how to prevent infection the study s findings got the conference off to an unnerving start as health officials reported that the spread of hiv in the united states continued to be disproportionately high among blacks disease centers officials , who are responsible for tracking the aids epidemic in the united states , reported that 55 percent of new hiv infections in 25 states from 1994 through 2000 were among blacks , who make up only 12 percent of the population in the united states blacks have also accounted for most new hiv infections in the united states since 1994 in 1995 , blacks surpassed whites in the percentage of americans who had a diagnosis of aids in 2000 , the latest year for which data are available , blacks accounted for 43 percent of aids cases , whites for 34 percent hispanics , who make up 13 percent of the population , accounted for 21 percent of the cases other ethnic groups accounted for the rest the study shows that the very men who are at greatest risk of hiv infection are those who are least likely to think they are at risk , mr wilson said that s a direct call to develop not only new prevention messages but also new messengers he added , the reality is also that many africanamericans are not within the health care system at all in presenting an overview of the aids epidemic in the united states at the conference , dr ronald valdiserri , an aids official at the disease centers , described what he said was a growing apathy about the hiv epidemic in the country dr valdiserri joined many of the 17 , 000 conference participants who called on the world to change its attitude about the disease and to put new energy into the fight against it we ca n't sit back and wait for a vaccine , dr valdiserri said health officials say it will most likely take several more years before an effective vaccine is developed , if one ever is as dr valdiserri called for a revival of the old passion that advocates expressed in the early years of the epidemic , scores of participants marched outside the conference hall they called for increased spending and action to combat a virus that has killed 20 million people and infected an additional 40 million , mostly in africa because not all states report new hiv infections , federal health officials use data from the 25 states that have monitored hiv the longest to help gauge national trends one problem officials must consider in extrapolating information elsewhere is that the 25 states account for only onefourth of the nation s aids cases federal officials said they felt confident in reporting that the number of new hiv infections has been stable in recent years , with an estimated 40 , 000 americans becoming infected each year government officials estimate that 900 , 000 americans are living with hiv or aids the number has increased by 50 , 000 since 1998 , largely because advances in treatment have controlled the infection in many people , allowing some to go back to work and live longer one reason for the continued spread of hiv , however , is that about half of the 900 , 000 infected americans have not been given a diagnosis or treated or both many unknowingly transmit the virus to their sex partners dr valdiserri renewed the disease centers' pledge to reduce by 50 percent the number of new infections in five years health officials cautioned that the stability in the number of new infections may be deceptive by masking increases among gay , bisexual and heterosexual people in some areas gay men account for the largest proportion of new hiv infections , or 43 percent , followed by people infected by heterosexual sex , 27 percent , and intravenous drug users , 23 percent
life s work confessions of an unbalanced mom by lisa belkin 221 pages simon schuster 23 life s work , a collection of sliceoflife essays by lisa belkin that focus chiefly on the plight of middleclass working mothers , exemplifies the small pathologies of an unfinished revolution the second women s movement may have airlifted a generation of women off their domestic pedestals and dropped them en masse into the workplace , but it does n't seem to have succeeded yet in persuading a lot of those women and their daughters to stop apologizing for having professional ambition and minds of their own ms belkin , a contributing writer for the new york times magazine , characterizes herself as a feminist , a married working mother of two young boys and a journalist who sort of stumbled into her career in these essays many of which were first published in life s work , the column she writes for the times she frequently betrays qualms about making judgments and thus ruffling feathers for instance , in the essay going home again , she concludes a reflection about her decision to work from home by reassuring readers that my own life s choices do n't represent a solution , because no choice is a solution so much as a new packet of complications who could argue with such an amiable truism \? and therein lies the congeniality of ms belkin s persona and the weakness of so many of her essays , whose subjects range from the challenges of being pregnant on the job to the ambivalent relationships many working mothers have with their children s baby sitters to the decision by tony blair , the british prime minister , not to take paternity leave after the birth of his last child ms belkin s voice and views are so politely muffled that most issues here seem weightless , most decisions without consequences indeed , work itself often seems pretty easily dispensed with in this collection of essays about work in several of them , ms belkin charts the adventures of a young couple , brandon and jill lowitz , who decide to quit their highpowered jobs in new york and move to bali they return to the city some months later , thin and tan and out of work , and seemingly untroubled by that in another essay , firewalls , ms belkin considers how professionals , like her own husband , a pediatric cardiologist , deal emotionally with tough jobs she decides that the lesson for the rest of us , those for whom work is not a matter of life and death but has the ability to use us up nonetheless is to come up for air periodically , to step back now and then to turn off the computer , even on deadline , and simply be there for your husband , so you can both go back out tomorrow and do it all again sane advice that s also a bit too blithe none of the aforementioned essays , for instance , acknowledge the class privilege that allows for such mental health breaks , whether they be extended sojourns in bali or brief escapes from the home office \( how many deadlines can most of us break before our jobs disappear along with those halfwritten essays on the computer screen \? \) the issue is not ms belkin s privileged vantage point , per se , but rather her refusal to consider selfconsciously how that vantage point enlarges and occludes her social vision the frustrating que sera sera tone of this collection is especially curious , given that ms belkin is also the author of show me a hero \( 1999 \) , a compelling account of a controversial lowincome housing desegregation plan that the city of yonkers adopted in the late 1980 s in that book , she demonstrated how every decision made by the homeowners and minority single mothers and politicians she interviewed had tremendous import many of the personal issues ms belkin mulls over in life s work are certainly just as significant as the public ones she investigated in show me a hero , but she risks so little intellectual capital in analyzing them that her reflections vaporize almost as soon as they hit the page occasionally something solid lingers a funny rumination on take your parent to work day at a dotcom company an edgy reflection on how children need to be taught that work is tedious as well as fulfilling but then the softening mists of niceness descend again perhaps by any other name is the most telling essay in this collection , in terms of its characteristic failure to think things through to a potentially selfchallenging conclusion , as well as because of the anxieties it betrays about the scariness of female ambition and desire in that essay , ms belkin considers the fallout of using her husband s surname , gelb , in her private life and retaining her maiden name in her professional life my two selves even have separate personalities lisa belkin talks faster and is bubblier at parties she s taller , too , probably because she stands up straighter and wears heels more often lisa gelb is partial to tshirts , black leggings and dangly earrings she chews gum too much and she likes to cook in a crowded room , she s more likely to listen than to talk the implications of this weirdly reactionary split personality that ms belkin sets up for herself towering , intimidating working woman vs slouchingbutkindly hausfrau are never acknowledged why she chose to create problems for herself by taking her husband s last name in the first place is a decision , like so many others , that she never examines instead , she shrugs if the curled lip of derision is martin amis s characteristic essay trope , and the wink of complicity is calvin trillin s , then the shrug the frustrating adolescent kind is ms belkin s in her introduction , she describes a literal shrug she gave to another mother who visibly disapproved of ms belkin s attention to a magazine article she was working on as she was sitting in the pediatrician s waiting room with her young son go ahead , ms belkin advises her readers shrug raise your hands in mock surrender toward the ceiling and repeat after me so what \? ' so what , indeed if the author does n't care , why should the reader \? photo lisa belkin \( dorothy handelman simon schuster \)

not one coach raised his hand so newell repeated the question the response was the same i said , 'you know what you 're telling me , ' newell said in a telephone interview last week you 're telling me that if kareem went to your school and liked basketball , he would be the biggest darn manager in the history of the game' imagine if professional basketball had never featured abduljabbar s graceful sky hook , or the legendary battles waged by bill russell and wilt chamberlain , or even the faceoffs between patrick ewing and hakeem olajuwon sound farfetched \? well , many respected people in basketball believe skilled post play is essentially a thing of the past and that the center position , once the most glamorous and dominating in the game , is now virtually bereft of firstrate players as evidence , they point to the national basketball association s 51st allstar game , which will be played sunday at first union center in philadelphia of the original 24 players selected to play , only 3 are bona fide centers shaquille o'neal , the only offensively dominant center left in the league , will not play because of a toe injury thus , the western conference team will feature five guards and seven forwards the east will counter with seven guards , three forwards and two centers , neither of whom averages as many as 16 points a game as an aging generation of great centers ewing , olajuwon , david robinson , dikembe mutumbo and alonzo mourning , who has been slowed by a kidney disease becomes less of a factor , a new wave of agile big men is redefining the role of frontcourt performers players like minnesota s kevin garnett , sacramento s chris webber and dallas s dirk nowitzki are changing the game by playing on the wing , facing the basket and showcasing the skills traditionally associated with small forwards or even guards meanwhile , the center position is left to less talented , less athletic , often plodding players so while six years ago there were five centers in the top 10 in scoring and rebounding , this season , o'neal is the only center among the league s top 20 scorers among the top 20 in rebounding , only four play center exclusively it s kind of a lost art , said jerry west , the hall of fame player and former laker general manager who constructed several championship teams , including the current one if you look at all these young kids coming out who are 69 to 7 feet tall , they all want to play outside they handle the ball extremely well , but the bottom line is that when somebody s that big , you certainly would prefer that they play closer to the basket , and more importantly , develop the kind of skills that backtothebasket centers have i do n't view this trend as a positive thing newell , who has run his highly regarded big man s camp for the last 24 summers , said the nurturing of traditional post players began to fade when college and high school coaches began employing motion and flex offenses almost exclusively in the 1970 s and 1980 s in contrast to the postoriented offenses that ran through the center and featured plenty of cutting and backdoor action , the motion and the flex rely on screening and creating shots for players coming away from the basket they also congest the area near the basket , eliminating the space that is necessary for a post player to operate that is why none of the coaches at newell s clinic two years ago could imagine a player like abduljabbar having the room to utilize his sky hook in their offensive schemes the adoption of those offenses meant the position of the post player was changed totally , said newell , who has worked with olajuwon , abduljabbar , o'neal and bill walton , among hundreds of others motion and flex kind of took the center out in terms of being a skilled passer and shooter with various moves hooks , reverses , spin moves , fake hooks several of today s more versatile big men point to another factor in their development the effect of magic johnson and larry bird , two icons of the 1980 s johnson , the 6foot9 point guard with the dazzling floor play , and bird , the 69 marksman , destroyed the notion that height relegated one to playing in the post the allure of giving and taking bruises beneath the basket could not compare with the excitement that young players associated with johnson leading the fastbreak and tossing nolook and behindtheback passes when i was younger and saw magic , george gervin and larry bird , who was 69 shooting 3 s , i wanted to emulate them , said webber , who is 610 i think it s just an evolution it s more about being a basketball player now , and i think that s good the misconception is gone that because you have a tall eighth grade son , he has to play center dirk nowitzki s 7 feet shooting 3 s i think that s awesome for basketball
washington , june 20 the constitution bars the execution of mentally retarded offenders , the supreme court declared today in a landmark death penalty ruling based on the majority s view that a national consensus now rejected such executions as excessive and inappropriate of the 38 states that have a death penalty , 18 now prohibit executing the retarded , up from 2 when the court last considered the question in 1989 this dramatic shift in the state legislative landscape , especially when anticrime legislation is extremely popular , provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal , justice john paul stevens wrote for the 6to3 majority excerpts , page a14 the decision , in the case of a virginia man with an iq of 59 who was convicted of committing a murder and robbery at the age of 18 , could ultimately move 200 or more people off death row mental health experts believe that as many as 10 percent of those convicted of capital murder are mentally retarded , although states often dispute the claim in individual cases in fact , virginia is disputing the evidence that the defendant in this case , daryl r atkins , is retarded the supreme court said today that it would be up to the states to develop appropriate ways to apply the new constitutional prohibition the generally accepted definition of mental retardation is an iq of approximately 70 or less accompanied by limitations on abilities like communication or caring for oneself the dissenters today , chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas , disputed that there was a real or lasting consensus against executing the retarded in a dissenting opinion that he read from the bench , justice scalia said that 18 states out of 38 was only 47 percent , not even half in the absence of an authentic consensus , the majority had simply enshrined its own views as constitutional law , he said , adding , the arrogance of this assumption of power takes one s breath away further , he said , there is something to be said for popular abolition of the death penalty there is nothing to be said for its incremental abolition by this court chief justice rehnquist said the majority had improperly gone beyond looking at state legislative action to consider polling data and international opinion as well if it is evidence of a national consensus for which we are looking , then the viewpoints of other countries simply are not relevant , he said the 15 countries of the european union filed a brief on behalf of mr atkins , as did a group of senior american diplomats who told the court that the practice of executing retarded offenders was out of step with much of the world and was a source of friction between the united states and other countries amnesty international said that since 1995 , only three countries were reported to have executed mentally retarded people kyrgyzstan , japan and the united states , which the organization said had executed 35 mentally retarded defendants since the court allowed states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976 the court s decision today will provide the us criminal justice system with a critical tool to uphold human rights standards , the organization said the decision overturns a ruling of the virginia supreme court while the justices disputed the outcome , there was no dispute on the basic analytic approach , unique to the eighth amendment , that depends on a sense of community norms to decide whether a practice violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment all agreed with the statement of chief justice earl warren in a 1958 case , trop v dulles , that the amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society rather , the debate was over whether the evidence supported the evolution that the majority discerned the court s previous examination of the retardation question came in 1989 in a texas case , penry v lynaugh , in which justice sandra day o'connor s controlling opinion said that there was no current consensus against executing the retarded but kept the court s door open to future developments the developments came quickly from the original two states , georgia and maryland , the list of states exempting retarded people from capital punishment grew to include new mexico , kentucky , tennessee , arkansas , colorado , washington , indiana , kansas , nebraska , south dakota , arizona , connecticut , florida , missouri and new york , which excluded the retarded when it reinstated its death penalty in 1995 the federal death penalty , reinstated in 1988 , exempted the retarded when the court agreed last year to revisit the issue , it did so in a case from north carolina , but north carolina abolished the death penalty for the retarded last summer , before that case , mccarver v north carolina , no 008727 , could be argued the justices then substituted the case they decided today , atkins v virginia , no 008452 it appeared earlier this year that the atkins case might become moot as well in february , the virginia state senate voted unanimously to abolish capital punishment for the retarded , but the house decided to delay action until after the supreme court decision surveying this rapidly changing landscape , justice stevens noted that the numbers alone did not tell the full story it is not so much the number of these states that is significant , but the consistency of the direction of change , especially in a strong anticrime climate , he said
none of the major technical issues raised by opponents of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty posed a serious problem , a panel of experts reported yesterday the treaty was defeated in the senate in 1999 the panel was convened by the national academy of sciences to assess objections to the treaty the 19member panel , including three former directors of national laboratories , former nuclear weapons designers , several physicists and military experts , completed the report after a yearlong study opponents of the treaty had argued that some countries might undertake clandestine tests to develop nuclear weaponry or improve an existing stockpile and that the united states' stockpile of nuclear weapons could deteriorate and become unreliable without testing those objections , in particular the stockpile issue , have no solid technical basis , says the panel , which was led by dr john p holdren , a physicist who is chairman of the program in science , technology and public policy at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard we judge that the united states has the technical capabilities to maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of its existing nuclear weapon stockpile under the ctbt , provided that adequate resources are made available , the report concluded even in the testing era , which for the united states ended in 1992 , explosions were used more for creating and building new weapons which the nation is no longer doing than for testing the existing stockpile for reliability , the report says scientists also use computer simulations and other techniques to assess stockpile components without nuclear explosions most of a nuclear weapon s 6 , 000 parts are nonnuclear components that are not only the elements most likely to deteriorate and fail but also those that can be tested separately for problems , dr holdren said you can test the hell out of the electronics , he said you can test the hell out of the high explosives you can test the hell out of the fusing the only thing you ca n't test under the treaty , is the nuclear subsystem itself inspections , technical assessments and repairs of existing warheads in the nation s stockpile stewardship program should be adequate for those other tests , the report said if the work is adequately financed and rigorously performed senator joseph r biden jr , the delaware democrat who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and a strong supporter of the test ban treaty , said the report should be read by every official who cares about the future of our nuclear deterrent we especially need to heed its recommendations regarding stockpile stewardship , mr biden said others said the panel s findings were hardly surprising this does n't dramatically change the debate , said lester munson , the republican spokesman for the foreign relations committee , whose ranking minority member , jesse helms of north carolina , opposed the treaty after its defeat in the senate , the treaty returned to the foreign relations committee , where it remains since the bush administration has signaled its opposition to the treaty , reintroducing it is unlikely for the moment but a senate democratic staff member pointed out that some of the report s recommendations , like those on stockpile stewardship , could be put into practice now the report concluded that major nuclear tests were so difficult to hide from worldwide seismic monitors that nations that tried to cheat on the test ban treaty would almost certainly be caught a scheme often discussed for masking underground nuclear tests is to carry out the explosions in a large cavern that would reduce the intensity of seismic waves that radiate outward and can be detected but even with such measures , explosions larger than about a kiloton equivalent to 1 , 000 pounds of conventional explosive could be detected , the academy panel found because even the earliest nuclear weapons had yields of 10 to 20 kilotons and modern weapons have yields of more than 100 kilotons , undetectable tests would provide little help in developing or refining nuclear weapons

who wants to be a millionaire , probably the most powerful force in american entertainment only two years ago , died last week as a regular primetime show after a long period of declining health it was not yet three years old the cause of death was complete exhaustion , compounded by overexposure to harsh competitive elements in its prime , the show altered television , ushering in the era of reality , or nonscripted , programs to prime time it also changed the fortunes of abc and the walt disney company , elevating its stock price and affecting the careers of the executives who had been lucky enough to ride the wave of its success as a testament to its influence , the program was at the center of one the biggest media showdowns of recent years , as disney was able to stand up to a threat by aol time warner to remove abc stations from several of its large cable systems largely by persuaded the public to demand that who wants to be a millionaire not be taken away from them but the program had been on life support in recent months abc made a final decision on tuesday to remove it from the apparatus that had been keeping it alive the weekly primetime schedule michael davies , the deceased s executive producer , had openly asked abc to pull the plug to give two of its progeny , a syndicated version and an occasional primetime tournament version , the opportunity to thrive on their own while the program s passing had been expected , it still aroused questions among friends and supporters about why it had died so young it was an amazing story both on the positive side and the negative side , mr davies said regis philbin , the show s spokesman who put a public face on it and the phenomenon , recently expressed his disappointment with the care and attention the show had been given he said the network had used it as cannon fodder other associates openly charged that who wants to be a millionaire had been a victim of the highpressure climate it had lived in rivals used the term ratings crack to describe what who wants to be a millionaire had become to abc born in new york in august 1999 , who wants to be a millionaire was by any measure a child prodigy few predicted it would survive a month but millionaire defied the effort to give it a quick burial from the very start , it captivated hearts after a twoweek debut on the national stage that summer , it had an even bigger twoweek run in november the show was given permanent primetime status in january 2000 , with a regimen of three performances a week for the rest of that year and much of the next , it swept away competitors it introduced a catch phase to the american vocabulary , is that your final answer \? profits soared , from commercial sponsorships to products like board games as all great entertainers do , millionaire spawned a host of imitators they came with names like 21 and greed and weakest link none matched the performance of millionaire , but they perhaps helped weaken the appeal of the original in spring 2000 , abc made two fateful decisions it pushed millionaire to perform four times a week at the same time it reduced its budget for developing programs that could have relieved the stress on its champion abc resolved to bank every dollar it could from the hard work millionaire was putting in the total profit tied to the program exceeded 1 billion by november 2000 , millionaire was already showing signs of strain millionaire brought in guest stars , from comedians to olympians but the stress and the overexposure seemed to wear the show down in september 2001 , millionaire cut back its performances to twice a week the reduced load did not help , perhaps because abc was still asking millionaire to battle much stronger rivals , like csi and will grace by last week millionaire was a shadow of its former self its demise made few ripples mr davies provided one eulogy , saying , i do n't think we 'll see anything like it again he noted that millionaire had generated over 350 episodes , the equivalent of a 16year life span for a regular series the show made an indelible mark , proving that a nonconformist could break through to become the leader of the pack in television other successful programs , from survivor to fear factor , acknowledged that they owed a lot to the pathsetting course run by who wants to be a millionaire the show is survived by the syndicated and occasional tournament versions of millionaire mr philbin , who remains the leading man on another program , live with regis and kelly and many europeans and asian cousins , some of whom , unfortunately , are also reported to be in failing health at this time photo regis philbin , the host of who wants to be a millionaire , says abc used the show as cannon fodder the program has been removed from prime time , but will appear in tournament and syndicated versions \( abc \)
the canadian filmmaker toni myers was enjoying some muchneeded r r when her cell phone rang colonel james s voss was checking in from the international space station with a surprising development i 've shot six seconds of aliens ! , he announced from 220 miles above earth aliens \? as producer and director of space station 3d , the new largeformat 3d release from imax , ms myers had developed an advance shopping list of setups and situations , and aliens were no part of the scenario the project was documentary in character and proud of it still , ms myers had encouraged the orbiting crew members to contribute their own suggestions col voss s extraterrestrials , she learned much later , were stowaways from the ground children s toys , cool totems of home , hanging out happily in zerog according to a poll conducted by cnn , more than 86 percent of the respondents would buy a ticket for a flight into space if money were no object the logical destination would be the international space station an astounding exclave of our mother planet , the project combines the technological wizardry of 16 countries it is not due to be completed until 2006 , yet crews are already living and working there at 47 minutes , space station 3d , in worldwide release since friday , features extended footage covering an 11month period that began in september 2000 given the fascination with space travel , the orbiting crew may peer out their portholes one day and discover the queue of ticket buyers reaching toward the moon consider the endorsements on a recent visit to new york , ms myers reported that michael collins , the apollo astronaut who went on to serve as first director of the national air and space museum , had called imax the only medium to approximate what you see from spaceand that was when space movies were still being shot in conventional 2d tom cruise , who narrates space station 3d , cannot speak with the same authority , but he sounds fairly wowed , too the film is the first shot with spacerated 3d cameras , ingeniously scaled down and modified to the constraints of space travel viewers who have seen it in preview are almost unanimous never has the medium been married to more suitable content go ahead fit your hands into the padded gloves hovering there at arm s length watch the gloves turn to ectoplasm as you do so that s a good reality check no , you are not gazing out from a space helmet , spacewalking in the void above the cloudswept disc the human race calls home still , the sensation is very real the cameraman for that shot was colonel brian duffy , the pilot and commander of numerous nasa missions now he is an associate program manager for space operations at lockheed martin , the presenter of space station 3d in cooperation with nasa you feel a long way away out there , he said recently from his office at the kennedy space center in florida one time on my last flight , we were crossing over boston it was dark on the ground but we were still in the light , looking like a shooting star i found out later that my son was watching for us on the roof at his frat house at mit it s important when you 're up there to feel connected to your family , your loved ones , your planet it s easy to start feeling very remote home was never like this to sleep , space travelers zip themselves into pods resembling garment bags , which are tethered to the ship water squeezed from a container forms luminous crystal globes \( the usual way to drink in space is with a straw but you can also slurp liquids straight out of midair watch \) one crew member cuts another s hair , catching the clippings with a vacuum cleaner the size and shape of a blowdryer uniforms \?

east rutherford , nj shaquille o'neal acknowledged he has a boom , boom , boom game if the first two booms fail , o'neal , the hulking center of the los angeles lakers , goes to the third boom i put the big booty on you and you 'll be under the basket and it s a dunk , he said yesterday but not too many people can withstand my boomboom on his origin i'm not from this planet i was looking at my mother s book , trying to find baby pictures i did n't see any baby pictures then i saw a certificate that said i was found on a train the assembled members of the news media doubled over , laughing at the goofball headliner who killed the room silly shaq , the big monologue , would be needed stage left tonight at continental arena in game 4 of the nba finals he has owned the lakers are up by three games to none , and o'neal is averaging 37 points and 13 rebounds , dunking mercilessly on the poor , helpless nets with suspense at a premium , levity was much needed yesterday o'neal obliged , as usual yet beneath the humor , the excitement of a third consecutive title within his grasp , the big man was headed back to the past , to the old newark neighborhood where much of his family still lives o'neal s companion , shaunie nelson , flew in on a redeye monday night with their three children they drove out to newark yesterday to visit with o'neal s 83yearold greatgrandmother , cillar o'neal , known as muma muma s son , sirlester , shaquille o'neal s grandfather , and donald harrison , his grandfather from his stepfather phillip harrison s side , were also there when asked what there was to do in new jersey , o'neal smiled and said i do n't know you probably can go to vivi s house , get some fried chicken you could see my cousin brian , ida ann , go see grandpa he would not be meeting joe toney , his biological father , who lives and works in a downtown shelter less than 20 minutes from continental arena o'neal last saw toney , who left the family when o'neal was an infant and spent time in federal prison on a checkcashing conviction , when he was 9 or 10 years old his mother brought him to a small apartment where toney lived they spent a few minutes together and o'neal has not seen him since in a recent interview with the los angeles times , toney said he planned to attend game 4 but he has long since given up hope of reestablishing a relationship with o'neal much of that has to do with his son nothing personal , but phillip harrison raised me and made me the man i am today , o'neal said during a quiet moment after he had finished his news conference it would be disrespectful to him to call somebody else my father i would never do that , no matter what the circumstances are if i meet him in passing , i 'll be nice and be courteous , but i'm not going to arrange a meeting and i'm not going to let him arrange a meeting through the media o'neal added from 2 to 19 , i never heard from him but then you get drafted and make a lot of money and then you hear from him so , you know , newark knows the stories about what happened o'neal s youth has other tales , like the one in which an exasperated mother could not convince the train conductor that her growing 8yearold boy should still be eligible for a child s discount the conductor wanted to see a birth certificate for the 6footer or the time when muma used to sneak baby shaq a bottle when he was 3 years old , and harrison , his new father , a military man nicknamed sarge , would take it away because he wanted to make sure the child was as rugged as the old man leave that boy alone ! muma said she promptly popped harrison , an army supply sergeant , in his head with her shoe over a homecooked meal , the people who knew o'neal long before he was pro basketball s largest superstar pulled more memories from the attic in the corner of the world where he was born , they all laughed and ate by nightfall , he would return to manhattan , where a palatial central park suite , his celebrity life and his job awaited him it is hard to believe that o'neal not wilt chamberlain or kareem abduljabbar is likely to be the first lakers center since minneapolis s george mikan to lead the franchise to three consecutive championships before he was put in the same pantheon of great big men as bill russell and the others , o'neal was just another young knucklehead trying to find his way in the nba sweeping the nets would be some accomplishment after his first trip to the finals , with the orlando magic , ended in a fourgame sweep by houston in 1995 it was a hard feeling , o'neal said i only cried about four times in my 30year lifetime first time was when my father hit me with the right hook he also cried when his grandmother odessa chambliss passed away and when his other grandmother , irma harrison , died in the past year the third time was when we got swept , he said of the houstonorlando series i said to myself 'if i ever have the opportunity to make it to the finals again , i wo n't let my teammates down i have to make my presence known we just have to win' when we were driving out of the arena , it took us two hours to get to the hotel , o'neal said of that day in houston they were hitting the buses with the brooms and throwing bricks and rioting i was just sitting there crying , looking out they were laughing at me yesterday , the day before he may win a title in his own backyard , we are all laughing with him photo shaquille o'neal , on the cusp of his third straight title , took time yesterday to visit family in newark \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
there are several ways to describe how the past 12 months have gone for the new york city fire department , and none of them are good the numbers speak for themselves 343 killed 91 vehicles destroyed 213 members of the senior command lost to retirement 104 million paid out in death benefits as many as 500 firefighters at risk of leaving the force because of lung damage suffered at ground zero 4 , 971 applicants for the department , a fraction of the 25 , 000 or so who typically apply in a given year 4 , 400 years of collective experience vaporized in the span of some 30 minutes the images speak , as well mountains of flowers placed outside firehouse doors across the city , a sea of whitegloved men and women standing at attention as another coffin was carried from another church , blackened bunker gear , a tattered flag beyond the statistics and the emblems , however , lies the swerving emotional course of this past year , which cannot be described by the department s own members at least not clearly somehow , the firefighters of new york confronted death , guilt , deification , disillusionment , fear , hordes of tourists and the numbness of having to tell their stories over and over again , and yet still mostly managed to go out each day to do their jobs they are tired and overwhelmed they are , by and large , sick of their own pain it has shown they scuffled with the police after the city reduced their numbers on searchandrecovery teams at ground zero the families of their lost comrades made millions through charitable donations but worried , with reason , about being tarred as rich beyond need some members have sued the city , contending negligence in endangering their health at the ground zero cleanup firefighters submitted to both an internal critique and a highly public one , and winced when it was found that their chiefs were at sea as disaster struck though bond traders and janitors died the day the towers came down , it was firefighters who emerged from the rubble as the face of last year s tragedy the department did not quite ask to be a national symbol of grief and perseverance , but its members have grieved and persevered , in public , nonetheless you ca n't go through life being a world trade center survivor , right \? one lieutenant said you 've got to do other stuff a year has passed for the survivors , and in recent weeks city officials and the department s own leaders have taken steps toward assessing where the 11 , 100member force now stands and how best to rebuild and improve it the steps , large and small , have included everything from an overhaul of the department s top management to a new policy ordering ambulances to bear placards making clear they are not terrorists in clever disguise the first priority has been to replace the 343 dead men , nearly 50 times the number 7 who die in the line of duty in any average year the department lost 20 percent of its elite forces and 42 members of its five rescue units , which are called upon to save fellow firefighters in distress in the aftermath of the attacks , the department scrapped entry requirements to allow recruits who have not finished college to begin training it pushed through classes of roughly double the normal size the first , a class of 313 , was sworn in last november a fourth class graduated in july because the department lost so many of its officers , including its first deputy commissioner and its chief of department , it has pushed through 671 promotions since last september there is a new chief of department , a new chief of operations , 3 new assistant chiefs , 14 deputy assistant chiefs , 29 new deputy chiefs , 71 new battalion chiefs , 179 new captains and 331 new lieutenants the department s top management was reorganized and expanded as well , under a plan set forth by mayor michael r bloomberg last month at its core , the plan called for increasing the number of staff chiefs , the department s highestranking uniformed members , to 18 from 10 five of these men were given direct authority over each of new york s five boroughs , instead of each of them being responsible for the entire city the staff chiefs also traded the timeworn practice of working 24 hours straight and then taking three days off for a regular fiveday workweek mayor bloomberg has said the department s managers should match their work schedules to the rest of the city s business week retirements drain force in a single morning , the collapsing towers killed more men than are usually in an entire class at the fire academy , and yet , some officials say , the impending flood tide of retirements will be just as damaging to the force scores of the department s supervisors , including some of its most senior commanders , have retired since last september and hundreds more have notified their union that they expect to leave in the next year the same mass exodus is occurring among frontline firefighters they are retiring at more than double the usual rate the retirement thing is going to be , in retrospect , the worst thing that has happened to the new york fire department post9 11 , bar none , said stephen j cassidy , president of the uniformed firefighters association
moscow , oct 26 we were waiting to die , said olga chernyak , a journalist who was one of more than 800 hostages inside a theater here as the siege by chechen guerrillas reached its violent , bloody climax already more than two days in captivity , they had to keep waiting at 2 am , four hours before the guerrillas' own deadline to begin killing their hostages , two of the captives were shot , a man and a woman it was not clear why the man was shot in the eye , said ms chernyak , a journalist for the interfax news agency , and there was a lot of blood medics carried the man and the woman from the building at 2 30 am , and then nothing the standoff dragged on through the cold , wet night , raising tensions inside and outside the theater , a renovated community center for a nearby ballbearing factory at 3 25 a loud explosion reverberated through the neighborhood , followed by bursts of gunfire , but then yet another lull officials at the russian command post continued to contact the leader of the guerrillas , identified as movsar barayev , by telephone through the morning , but received what one called unclear responses about what was happening inside the siege continued , it appears , until russian special forces began pumping the theater full of gas around 5 30 , sending invisible but pungent fumes through the hall i do n't know what kind of gas it is , but i see the reaction , another journalist , anna andrianova , said from inside the theater in a desperate interview with the radio station ekho moskvy , which was being conducted even as the raid began we see , we feel , we breathe through fabric , she went on , straining to continue through the fumes and fear ours are doing something , she said referring to government forces as they stormed into the building repeated bursts of gunfire could then be heard in the background oh , god ! she said , gasping can you hear us \? we will all be blown up to hell then the telephone went dead russian officials said today that they launched the raid because the guerrillas had begun to kill hostages , but according to official statements and witnesses' accounts , the predawn assault unfolded in slow motion , beginning more than three hours after the first two hostages were shot sergei ignatchenko , a spokesman for the federal security service , said a firefight began when a group of hostages tried to break out of the theater television video showed several women emerging from the theater s front doors just after 5 30 , but it was not clear how they managed to escape or what they were running from heavily armored troops escorted them into the parking lot and began breaking the glass doors and windows with their rifle butts as they moved in , a thunderous explosion shook the building , setting off dozens of alarms on the cars parked outside the theater , intensifying the cacophony of sirens and gunfire in the darkness gunfire and explosions continued , including two more thunderous blasts at 6 10 and 6 20 almost immediately after the last explosion , an eerie silence fell over the scene convoys of ambulances and buses then poured into the area to begin evacuating the wounded and dead one of the surviving guerrillas was hustled from the building mr ignatchenko and other officials said that the russian special forces had been prepared to launch their raid at the 6 am deadline , but that the firefight erupted early once the guerrillas began firing moscow s mayor , yuri m luzhkov , said they had infiltrated underneath the building , apparently through the sewers or newly dug tunnels at least one of the blasts was caused when the russian forces blew a hole in a wall to enter the theater it was not clear when ms andrianova survived , and so did ms chernyak their accounts where the first detailing what happened inside the building this morning but many of the details of the raid remained unclear , with confused and contradictory statements emerging through the day ms chernyak said later that when the shooting began , the women among the guerrillas jumped to seats in the theater , apparently according to some prescribed plan she said they looked happy the women had explosive devices , but none apparently were detonated ms chernyak said that ultimately she had passed out , only regaining consciousness in the hospital , where she remained tonight her husband , sergei , who had joined her for a night at the theater , was among those still unaccounted for i am sure that we were saved from imminent death , she said about 750 hostages were freed , but at least 67 of the hostages were killed many of those killed had been subjected to the gas for at least an hour and suffocated on their own vomit the tactic the russians used in hopes of minimizing deaths apparently caused many of them photos relatives embraced on learning their mother and sister were safe \( james hill for the new york times \) soldiers escorted a guerrilla yesterday from the moscow theater after a raid that officials said killed 50 of the rebels , 32 men and 18 women \( agence francepresse \) the bodies of several female guerrillas lay inside the moscow theater yesterday after it was stormed by russian special forces \( ntv via associated press \)
trenton in a gerontocracy like the united states senate where strom thurmond , 99 , and robert byrd , 84 still hold seats , frank r lautenberg might be considered something of an adolescent but given mr lautenberg s age , 78 , and his unfocused style as a speaker , it was inevitable that republicans would get around to suggesting openly that he was just too old to be an effective united states senator and when they did , it was just as inevitable that democrats would respond by pointing to their secret weapon videotapes and transcripts of mr lautenberg s verbal meandering two decades ago in the month since he replaced senator robert g torricelli as the democratic nominee , mr lautenberg has built a steady lead over his republican opponent , douglas r forrester despite republican attempts to paint mr lautenberg as a liberal stooge , a defender of terrorists , a dove on iraq and a puppet of the state s democratic political bosses , most polls show that he offers many new jersey voters two things they seem to crave he is a democrat and his name is not torricelli recent polls have shown mr forrester now trailing mr lautenberg by 8 to 12 percentage points so after making insinuations about mr lautenberg s age for several weeks , republicans have begun making more pointed comments questioning mr lautenberg s mental acuity in an interview with the new york times , mr forrester said he was disappointed that the news media had not focused on several important topics , and the first one he mentioned was the age issue mr forrester said it would be improper for a candidate to opine on whether his opponent s age had rendered him unable to serve , but he invited reporters to make those judgments and even encouraged them to view a videotape of mr lautenberg s recent appearance before an editorial board last monday , mr forrester s republican allies turned up the heat , using the word doddering to describe mr lautenberg and suggesting that he had been ducking debates because he was afraid he might appear befuddled on camera the next day , when newspapers reported that mr lautenberg had given a rambling response to a question , the forrester campaign issued a release expressing its alarm and saying that the development had raised questions about mr lautenberg s fitness for office it is a risky strategy for several reasons , not the least of which is that it may damage mr forrester s own credibility to speak to mr lautenberg one on one , or to watch him move through a crowd , is to encounter a man who appears in command of the issues while mr lautenberg may walk at a slightly slower pace than he did in his 20 s , he still brags that he can outski mr forrester or any senator for that matter and there is little doubt that he remains quickwitted and lucid and though he has made a limited number of appearances during his campaign \( his staff says that his late entry into the race has forced him to devote time to fundraising \) , mr lautenberg usually seems to make special efforts to mingle with voters and exchange repartee senator jon s corzine who will never be mistaken for daniel webster tried to defend mr lautenberg by saying that anyone is prone to become tired during the rigors of a political campaign and make a statement that wanders far from the point other democrats argue that mr lautenberg has never been particularly good behind a podium none of his aides will say so publicly \( mr lautenberg is said to be quite touchy about both his age and his reputation as an orator \) , but many of those who praise his record on transportation and the environment , and admire his tenacity as a campaigner , concede , off the record , that his public speaking skills have always been limited at best in 1994 , when mr lautenberg stumbled through a closing statement during a debate , republicans questioned whether at 70 he was losing his grip mr lautenberg won the race handily and serve what is widely regarded as the most effective of his three terms in office even back in 1982 , when mr lautenberg upset millicent fenwick the eccentric , pipesmoking 70yearold who inspired the character lacey davenport in the doonesbury comic strip he was an elliptical public speaker frank s incredibly smart and hard working and aggressive , said one admiring democratic elected official but he s a babbler , and he always has been mr forrester has suggested that the real issue is n't age , it s hypocrisy last week he stated , with a straight face , that what he really wanted was to make mr lautenberg apologize for the way he questioned ms fenwick s age back then of course , the fact that ms fenwick died in 1992 might make that apology hard to deliver without a ouija board many political analysts view the republican ploy as a sign of desperation and warn that it might backfire more than 11 million of new jersey residents are over 65 , according to the 2000 census , and if those voters believe mr forrester is being unfair , they could hurt mr forrester the forrester campaign seems willing to run that risk , in hopes of raising doubts about mr lautenberg s effectiveness that suits mr lautenberg just fine i can probably outrun , outthink , i think , and certainly outski doug forrester , he said last week photo david kocieniewski
trenton people who notice these things have been seeing him three or four times a day lately as they scan the nightly news reports on television jon corzine standing behind frank lautenberg on the state house steps jon corzine smiling behind representative rush holt in princeton jon corzine shaking hands in bergen county with anne sumers , the democratic candidate for congress there from nonentity and the butt of moneybags jokes two years ago , when he spent 60 million of his own money to win his senate seat , senator corzine has remade himself into mr indispensable for state democrats this election season he has campaigned tirelessly for other candidates , brokered backoffice deals with the best of the old wheelerdealers , contributed millions from his wall street fortune to candidates and filled a vacuum in the new jersey democratic politics left by senator robert g torricelli s forced withdrawal from the race and by james mcgreevey s shrinking governorship under the weight of financial and other crises in washington , he has become a player as the democratic spokesman on the financial crises and the enrons of the world , said harold hodes , the trenton lobbyist and former clinton state campaign director he is in line to head up the democratic senatorial campaign committee , which is an unusual appointment for a firstterm senator he played an important role in the selection of lautenberg , and he not only has the financial wherewithal but the energy to get out and help all these candidates here at home take last tuesday mr corzine started the day with representative rush holt , greeting commuters at the princeton junction train station then he and mr holt gave their nonlawyerly views on constitutional issues and foreign policy to a class of seniors at the west windsorplainsboro high school north after he and mr holt called for more money for breast cancer research at the princeton ywca , the senator headed to bridgewater to campaign at a retirement center with tim carden , who is trying to unseat representative michael ferguson in the 7th district then it was off to trenton , to stand with mr lautenberg and the black ministers council of new jersey and he ended the day in new york city , attending a fundraising event for mr lautenberg a couple of thoughts these are all jobs that mr torricelli used to perform , so in a sense , mr corzine is only stepping up to the role of senior senator that people would expect him to perform but second and unlike so many pols mr corzine actually seems to be enjoying himself it was one of the open secrets of his 2000 election campaign that mr corzine was a better campaigner than people who could not see beyond his money gave him credit for apparently he has not lost that zest for the campaign trail , and he also seems to have raised his game a bit it s been very interesting to see , said jeffrey garcia , dr sumers s campaign director in the 5th district race , who said that no other politician had been as active on her behalf since her nomination he s very different from the way people would imagine there s none of the heavyhanded advice and that sort of thing mr garcia later added i 've been in campaigns all around the country , and he is unlike any other united states senator i 've ever met that s why he s the most popular man in new jersey in a sense , mr corzine appears to be extending the role that brought him to the top of goldmansachs when he was cochairman of the big banking house mr corzine , the midwestern farm boy , was known as a conciliator and honest broker in the wall street jungle , and he appears to be doing the same thing here two years ago , state republicans were in the unusual position of accusing a rich man of throwing his money around for his own political aims now the fortune that helped him win his seat is a weapon in the causes mr corzine belives in he has five political action committees operating out of an office in newark , and according to the federal election commission , mr corzine has contributed nearly 1 million from his own pocket in the current campaign cycle to senate races as well as made smaller contributions to dozens of groups , including 5 , 000 each to the progressive majority s action committee , emily s list , the group that supports candidates who back abortion rights , and the gay and lesbian victory fund one of the things that i tried to say in my campaign is that i believe in the democratic ideals , senator corzine said in an interview i want to be putting my shoulder into protecting the democratic majority in the senate and , hopefully , helping candidates who are close to winning their seats in the house mr corzine said he wanted to sharpen campaign skills that he will need as chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee , but also to bring attention where attention is due it s pretty amazing , really , the effort that a lot of unsung heroes are making to make our communities better , the senator said and if i can give them a helping hand , or shine a light on their efforts , or give them a sense that their efforts are being recognized , that s what i 'll do photo iver peterson
a friend from chicago showed up in atlanta last week with final four tickets , a surprise gift from his sons it was more of a bonding weekend than a fan fest none of them had attended a college that was competing in the tournament at breakfast , i asked them whom they were rooting for dad , a lawyer and a sophisticated news consumer , thought awhile before he picked maryland how could you not root for juan dixon , he said , a skinny orphan who worked himself into becoming an extraordinary player while staying four years in college \? so it was the back story that did it i argued for indiana coach mike davis had actually returned to college in his 30 s to get a degree , and he was overcoming a severe stutter and the ghost of his predecessor , bob knight but my friend , marty robinson , held firm , and he turned out to have picked right indiana was game but no match for a team with at least three bona fide professional prospects who had been playing together for years this is becoming less common these days as college underclassmen and high school boys \( misleading , since some of them are 20 years old , having been held back in elementary school so they could grow taller than their peers and then polished at postgrad prep schools \) move directly into the nba it s one reason that colleges and a complicit news media tend to hype the coach he is almost always around longer than the players but college players are certainly promoted their pictures and stories are used to sell tickets , boost tv ratings \( for the coach s weekly show as well as the broadcast of the game \) and to move clothing juan dixon gets no direct income from the sale of no 3 maryland jerseys in fact , he was not permitted to sell his story , although he was supposed to sit for endless interviews about his parents' death from aidsrelated illnesses and the strong support from other family members , including his brother , a police officer in return , he has been getting an athletic scholarship that pays almost all his expenses whatever else top players may receive from friends of the program , it is rarely compensation enough for the money they bring in , and scandalously low compared to the coach s salary , perks , tv and sneaker deals , and summer camp fees while some critics might snipe at the quality of dixon s education given his fulltime basketball job did the terrapins and the hoosiers take homework to the ncaa tournament \? did all those righteous suits check \? i think he has learned more about the ways of the world in his five years at college park , md , than any of his classmates majoring in philosophy or urban studies has he been cheated in any way \? theoretically , perhaps , but if he signs the expected big pro contract and goes on to a healthy and happy career , his five years at maryland will have been an acceptable apprenticeship , whether or not critics liken it to slavery but dixon is not the true issue the superstars never are it s the supporting players who need to be protected from the iron spider web of rules the ncaa has wrapped them in to protect their colleges from having to operate in a free market if the ncaa were really smart and devious \( if i were in charge , for example \) , it would secretly finance the sporadic campaigns to pay college players , not only to infiltrate the dogooders but also to expose the hopelessness of the idea even though amateurism as an athletic cult in 19thcentury america was created , among other reasons , to protect gentlemen from the likes of juan dixon , much of the allure of college sports is maintained by promoting the illusion that it is about pure love of the game that s good business contemporary amateurism means you do n't have to pay players over the table with the attendant insurance premiums , healthcare costs , payroll taxes , workers' compensation and the loss of certain tax exemptions the ncaa has been alert to early warnings of their athletes becoming employees last year , the collegiate athletes coalition , led by a former ucla linebacker , ramogi huma , came up with some reasonable demands of the ncaa , including yearround health coverage for sportrelated injuries and the elimination of the 2 , 000 a year cap on offseason earnings ncaa officials patronized the coalition until the athletes' group announced support from the united steelworkers of america , at which point the ncaa brushed it off as irrelevant dave meggysey , the former st louis cardinals linebacker , now the western director of the nfl players association , supports the coalition the pro players unions have been generally silent on college athlete welfare issues after all , they represent the juan dixons and meggysey , one of the brightest and most progressive voices in sports , is speaking for himself when he says there is little difference between the athletic departments of the top 50 power schools and general motors he calls college players workerathletes , and says , pay them ! an interesting alternative comes from w burlette carter of the george washington university law school in a clear and absorbing series of law journal articles , carter , a sportslaw expert , argues that the ncaa has received too much deference from the courts over the years even as it has betrayed its moral and legally defined role as a protector of youngsters it has perverted the in loco parentis doctrine like the greedy parents of a financially valuable child actor carter writes perhaps more than in any other 'educational' endeavor , studentathlete rights and interests may be in stark conflict with those of the institution nevertheless , carter thinks the link between education and college athletics is desirable , if not unbreakable without enormous dislocation she would create nonprofit agencies to supervise the relationship between athletes and colleges , to disburse stipends , mediate disputes , provide money management advice , create insurance and savings plans and act as advocates in many ways , carter s suggestions are more radical than unionizing and paying college athletes , which would merely substitute the pro for the amateur model it should n't impinge on the pleasures of the game my friend marty , the intelligent and compassionate sports fan , could enjoy rooting for juan dixon and his teammates even more knowing he was not complicit in their exploitation the series so far previous articles in this series on college sports have explored race and athletics , gambling and the final four robert lipsyte s email address is thelipsite aolcom photo it was difficult not to root for juan dixon , who helped maryland win the ncaa title \( reuters \)

the corporate ladder , she is as confident in boardroom battles as in a cottoncandycolored miniskirt in the mentality of corporate mexico , women are considered synonymous with brainless , said ms aramburuzabala , in a rambling interview from her 25thfloor office overlooking the mansions and chic shopping malls on the northwest edge of the capital i had three things going against me when i started out i am a woman i was young with no experience and i was daddy s girl ms aramburuzabala , 39 , a divorced mother of two , is an heiress to grupo modelo , one of mexico s largest publicly traded companies , and now one of its most powerful directors the brewer of corona beer , grupo modelo was cofounded by her grandfather , a penniless basque immigrant , in the wake of the mexican revolution her father , pablo , helped make corona the bestselling imported beer in the united states , and the fifthmostpopular in the world while daddy worked , his daughter enjoyed the privileges of wealth at 19 , she married a successful business executive who was eight years older she finished an accounting degree at the elite technological institute of mexico after she graduated , she began having children basically our lives were focused on family , not on work outside our homes , said patricia flores , who has been one of ms aramburuzabala s best friends since college ms flores , the daughter of a former general director of quaker oats in mexico , had also married at a young age and had the first of her four children before she turned 20 the women were drawn to each other by their similar situations there remains something similar about their vivacious and unabashedly feminine ways ms flores said she and ms aramburuzabala even dressed their children alike she recalled trips downtown to see santa at christmas and vacations at disney world sometimes the women would sneak away from their families for massages at a day spa or scandalous shopping sprees if you would have asked me 10 years ago whether mariasu would be doing what she is doing now , ms flores said of her friend , i would say no way everything changed when ms aramburuzabala s father died of cancer at 63 he left no male heirs , only a wife and two daughters none of them had read a spreadsheet , much less annual reports still grieving , the women took stock of all that had been left them , and struggled to figure out how to save it ms aramburuzabala recalled their situation in a speech last march at harvard business school it seemed we were a big pie to eat , she said with a wry grin , and everybody wanted to eat it , by the way mostly , she said , what many of her father s former business associates wanted was to move her and her mother and sister out of the way the world caved in on us , she said in the recent interview friends , enemies , boyfriends everyone wanted control less than a month after my father died , we had people coming to tell us that he had left them in charge , and that they were going to manage things for us instincts for selfpreservation took over , ms aramburuzabala said the offers for help and advice sounded to her like the promises of usedcar salesmen she consulted her mother , who was still in deep mourning , and sister , who was pregnant she decided , she said , not to pursue control of the company her brotherinlaw had been named general director but she was determined not to lose any of the family stake in grupo modelo on the day her youngest son started kindergarten , she started work i could have sat home eating popcorn and watching tv , she said but my mother , my sister and i decided that we were not going to put our fate in anyone else s hands from an office about the size of a supply closet , she followed the only advice her father had passed on to her she read the company statutes , its investment agreements and all its outside contracts with the help of her brotherinlaw , she made alliances within the company to keep control of her father s seats on the board of directors and his shares in grupo modelo still , without a victory of her own , she was hardly taken seriously by senior members of the board most of them thought that because i was a woman i would get tired of work , she said they thought i was just playing the little businesswoman , and that after a while i would go back home to prove herself , she took on the company s most difficult challenges two of its yeast companies had gone bankrupt , and directors at grupo modelo wanted to sell them ms aramburuzabala offered to make the companies profitable within a year it would be , she said , her mba i had an education , so i knew how to think , she said what i did n't have was experience she got the experience from the top to the bottom of the yeast companies she reduced payrolls and merged divisions she got rid of corrupt accounting managers and union leaders she oversaw purchasing , and she helped managers on the overnight shift supervise production a year later , the companies were back in the black the board , she said , seemed pleasantly surprised and next they assigned her to help lead negotiations to sell a 502 percent noncontrolling stake of grupo modelo to anheuserbusch it was a deal worth about 16 billion ms aramburuzabala s family is believed to have made about 500 million but the deal won her something even more valuable the respect of her associates in 1996 , she became vice chairwoman of grupo modelo ms aramburuzabala says she has become extremely comfortable hobnobbing as the only woman in a corporate league dominated by men but she still delights in girlish fun dinners with her , her friends say , are often filled with family talk and jokes and gossip ms flores recalled a trip that she and ms aramburuzabala took to paris last year they spent almost all of their time eating and shopping on the last day , they realized that they had not seen a single monument or museum during the visit what would they tell their friends \? on the taxi ride to the airport , the travel buddies asked their driver to stop at several of the most important tourist attractions and take photos of them in front of each one we were as silly as 15yearolds , ms flores said but we had so much fun photo mar a asunci n aramburuzabala
washington , oct 29 a 100 million project to develop a new kind of map of the human genome was announced today by an international consortium its goal is to hasten discovery of the variant genes thought to underlie common human diseases like diabetes , asthma and cancer the consortium includes government agencies from japan , china and canada , and a medical charity , the wellcome trust of london its largest contributor , from the united states , is the national institutes of health , which is investing 39 million over the project s three years the map will be constructed by analyzing the genomes of people in four ethnic groups japanese , chinese , the yoruba people of nigeria , and americans of northern and western european descent if these four groups do not capture a thorough enough pattern of human variation , more may be added later the principle underlying the map is a discovery about the human genome made only a year ago by dr mark j daly and colleagues at the whitehead institute in cambridge , mass they found that human dna has been inherited generation after generation in large , unchanged blocks , up to 100 , 000 units in length , from the ancestral human population and , contrary to what had been assumed , has not yet been thoroughly mixed by the vigorous shuffling of dna from the maternal and paternal chromosomes that takes place between generations these large blocks of dna are known as haplotypes , and the new map , called the international hapmap , will chart the location of these blocks throughout the human genome dr eric lander , dr david altshuler and other members of the whitehead institute have rapidly expanded on dr daly s discovery , and the nih has boldly built the hapmap project around it dr francis collins , director of the genome institute at the nih , said today that the undertaking was virtually certain to be successful he described it as a project that will provide a critical missing link to allow researchers all over the world to uncover the hereditary factors in common disease and behind the response to drug therapy but in part because the discovery is so new , other population geneticists do not yet agree on the nature or the extent of the haplotypes in the human genome , and some doubt that the hapmap approach will be very useful in tracking down the variant genes that cause common diseases i have some major reservations , said dr kenneth kidd , a population geneticist at yale i'm not opposed to going ahead , but a smallerscale effort would probably be better when there are fundamental basic science questions , a factorylike approach is not the best way dr kenneth weiss , a population geneticist at pennsylvania state university , said he was skeptical about the chance the hapmap will satisfy the objectives of identifying common major disease variants and dr kari stefansson , chief executive of decode genetics of reykjavik , iceland , said he thought the hapmap would be an inefficient way of finding disease genes dr stefansson said his company had identified seven common disease genes and found the location in the genome of 25 others by studying patients in icelandic genealogies in his view , the hapmap approach is n't useless , but this is not the most effective way of doing what they want to do the goal of the hapmap is not to find disease genes directly but to create a general tool that will allow others to do so it is designed to work in general populations and does not require patients to be related to one another , unlike the basis of the decode approach in iceland the 3 billion human genome project provided the sequence of a single genome but did not catalog the variations that are thought to underlie many common diseases the genome sequence was expected to speed the search for such variations , but in practice they have proved much harder to find than expected the disappointment has been all the greater because of the success scientists have had in identifying the cause of diseases that proceed from a single gene , such as cystic fibrosis most of these diseases are quite rare unlike the singlegene diseases , most common diseases are thought to be caused by several variant genes acting together because each contributory gene has a weak effect , none stands out since 1996 , geneticists have hoped to track disease genes by establishing a snp map snp s \( pronounced snips \) are the sites of common single base variations in the human genome with a set of snp s spread out across the genome , it should be possible to see where in the snp field the patients differ from people free of a disease , and thus to pinpoint the genetic changes at the disease s root but some 500 , 000 snp sites across the genome are needed to make the process work , and given the cost of detecting each snp some 30 cents the price of charting each person s snp map became prohibitive that gloomy picture seemed to change when dr daly and his colleagues , looking for the genetic cause of crohn s disease , an inflammation of the bowel , found that large blocks of snp s stayed together between the generations and seemed to have been inherited more or less unchanged from the ancestral human population the swapping of genetic material seems to occur at special hot spots along the chromosome , leaving the material in between pretty much unshuffled since snp s are inherited in blocks , or haplotypes , the whitehead scientists soon figured out that it should be possible to define a block by identifying just a few of its snp s if a haplotype map of the human genome could be constructed , then the genomes of patients and control groups could be compared block by block , helping to identify the block in which a diseasecausing gene resides present data suggest that each block comes in three or four versions in the human population , said dr altshuler , of the whitehead institute dr collins , of the nih , said the hapmap would provide a powerful and elegant shortcut to locating disease genes though most geneticists believe that the hapmap will be useful to some degree , there is a range of expectations dr collins said his guess was that well over 60 percent of the genes in common disease will be amenable to this approach but some experts feel that less than 60 percent of the genome exists in haplotypes further reducing the hapmap s reach , the haplotype approach is likely to find only the diseasecausing variant genes that are reasonably common in the population some geneticists argue that most diseasecausing variants are in fact rare , and will not be picked up by the hapmap because of these possibly severe constraints , several geneticists voiced suspicion that the project s ulterior purpose was to provide work for the big genome centers , like that of the whitehead institute , now that the human genome project is nearly finished dr collins , however , said that i completely reject the idea that this is a makework project for the genome centers
the courtordered auction of the assets of webvan was something of a spectator sport , silicon valley style dozens of former employees , reporters , television crews and gawkers , many of them unemployed technology workers , gathered in late october at the company s shuttered headquarters near san francisco for a selloff of computer and office equipment it was as much a chance to witness the final chapter in one of the most spectacular failures of the internet bubble as to gaze at piles of some of the most sophisticated technology gear anywhere but for leo hopper , a manager in the technology department of global sports , the ecommerce company , webvan s auction was serious business sitting near the back of a packed room and armed with an inventory list of more than 3 , 000 products , he repeatedly flashed his auction card to bid up an item a sun microsystems server , some networking gear from cisco systems , a data storage system by the end of his buying spree , mr hopper had snapped up several million dollars' worth of equipment at 10 cents to 15 cents on the dollar we have our eye out for bargains , he said it is the kind of frugality that has kept expansion costs down at global sports , one of the few ecommerce companies that is still growing as if it were 1999 less than three years after it began running internet stores including the web sites , warehouses and customer service centers for sporting goods retailers , global sports has become one of the largest and most successful ecommerce survivors unknown to many consumers , global sports , based in king of prussia , pa , runs online stores for the sports authority , sport chalet , the athlete s foot and more than 20 other retailers , media companies and professional sports organizations investors are noticing its 2001 sales are expected to be 100 million , up from 43 million in 2000 it has virtually no debt and had more than 92 million in cash at the end of the third quarter \( results for the fourth quarter will not be released until feb 6 \) global sports shares , which began 2001 at less than 6 , are now trading at 2033 yet its business did not always elicit admiration when global sports ventured onto the internet during the peak of the dotcom boom in early 1999 , its business model was shrugged off wall street and the media reserved praise for etoys , amazoncom and other online stores that were trying to create brands and hoping to displace conventional retailers as most pure play ecommerce companies were perishing , the outsourcing model of global sports started gaining proponents now , none other than amazon is aggressively chasing after the same business we created this business years ago , when people said it did n't make any sense , said michael g rubin , the chief executive of global sports we have proven what an opportunity this is mr rubin and his team still face significant hurdles global sports must prove it can make money on the internet the company hopes that the tally of 2001 holiday sales will help show its first pro forma quarterly profit and that it will be profitable this year global sports has bet that much of its future growth will come from areas where it has little experience , like luxury goods and general merchandise and even with 100 million in sales , global sports remains small enough that it could face challenges from wellfinanced rivals as it becomes more lucrative , it will attract more competition , said evie black dykema , a senior retail analyst at forrester research in cambridge , mass for now , the aftermath of the dotcom collapse is playing in global sports' favor while scores of ecommerce companies have vanished , online retailing continues to grow , and shoppers increasingly expect offline stores to have online branches yet for many traditional retailers , the internet has been little more than a costly headache in recent months , traditional chains including target , walmart and macy s and bloomingdale s , the federated department stores units have scaled back , restructured or canceled online efforts that has made global sports' offer of lowcost , lowrisk internet stores more attractive to retailers last year , it signed up kmart , adding a general merchandiser to its stable of sporting goods companies despite spending more than 100 million on its own ecommerce effort , kmart s internet subsidiary , bluelightcom , had consistently missed sales targets , according to richard blunck , chief executive of the kmart unit after becoming chief in may , mr blunck said he considered several potential partners , including amazon , before settling on global sports this business has been in an absolute turnaround situation , mr blunck said through november , bluelight had reduced operating costs 75 percent while increasing sales 45 percent and improving ontime shipments and customer satisfaction , he said \( bluelight has not yet released total holiday season sales but has said they exceeded expectations \)
kabul , afghanistan the reopening of the national gallery in kabul in february took place in the dark the electricity was out again , a casualty of war , and no one could get the gallery s generator to work a certain grimness lingered in the air more striking than much of the art was a special display of the rippedup drawings and broken frames left by the taliban , lest anyone forget and yet the mood was hopeful , victorious , even joyful presiding over the ceremony , hamid karzai , the leader of afghanistan s interim government , spoke emotionally of the gallery as the locus of great hope and brightness , where afghan culture could emerge out of hiding this is more , so much more , than the reopening of a museum , he declared , toasting the moment with a cup of tea then , with great delight , he watched dr yousof asefi perform an act of sweet triumph dr asefi is an artist who , at great personal risk , had disguised the figures of human beings in 80 oil paintings at the gallery by applying a veneer of watercolor paint over them he had thus saved the pictures from destruction at the hands of the taliban , who had forbidden representations of the human form as sacrilege now , as an assortment of ministers , journalists , artists and local intellectuals looked on , dr asefi , scrubbed up in a starchy new suit , approached a painting , dipped a cloth in water and began washing the watercolor away , revealing the original figures beneath , still intact there was applause all around i had come to afghanistan to see what remained of the country s culture after the depredations of the taliban and the devastation of war and i was astonished to find , amid the bombedout ruins of kabul , an artistic community that was not only optimistic but exuberant everyone i talked to had extraordinary stories to tell about the taliban era , but they had survived that time surprisingly well , and were taking up much where they had left off you would think from the western news reports that kabul is populated only by desperate peasants , many of them warlike , and government bureaucrats and soldiers in fact , kabul also has a population of cultured , soign afghans , some of whom stayed through the taliban years , some of whom have flooded back into the country from selfimposed exile but the beginning of a renaissance is not taking place only among a small elite the union of artists , closed by the taliban , quietly reopened three months ago and has already attracted more than 3 , 000 members countrywide , including 200 women our future depends on these people , mr karzai told me we need to save our culture and bring it forward , make a new culture of afghanistan this is at the top of our agenda afghan women have been slow to give up the enshrouding burka , to westerners the most potent symbol of the taliban s oppression during a twoweek visit to kabul in midfebruary , i spotted no more than a dozen women showing their faces on the streets despite the lifting of the ban their clinging to the garment points to a deep cultural basis for this concealment but while the emergence of women has been slow and ambivalent , the recent proliferation of art high , low , traditional , new , western , eastern shows how suddenly free urban afghans now are contrary to the taliban s propaganda , the prohibitions against art were never based in islam the very idea is ridiculous , said the minister of information and culture , said makhtoum rahim there is no religious justification for such laws nancy hatch dupree , a leading western expert on afghan culture , calls the restrictions total claptrap , entirely political abdul mansour , director of afghanistan television and former president of the cultural ministry , said , they said it was religion , but it was just a combination of thuggery , profiteering and fulfilling the agenda of the isi he was referring to pakistan s secret service , then underwriting the taliban the isi , he said , wanted to see the weakest possible afghanistan he continued and pakistan is jealous pakistan is a new country , a fake country , with no history while we we have a splendid history mr rahim said afghan culture has been destroyed many times by alexander the great by the british army in the 13th century , genghis khan attacked herat and killed everyone sixteen people were out of town for various reasons , and they returned to find that their city no longer existed first , they wept but then they decided to rebuild , and though they were just 16 , herat rose from the ashes we will do it again we want to export a message of love and cooperation for all the world , and to show our great art , so that people understand this is not just a country of warlords and battle it is striking that in its early days , the taliban supported art and was involved in programs of cultural preservation it was only later in the regime , when the terrorist group al qaeda and foreign agents had begun to wield most of the power , that the antiart policies were established and many of the most beautiful things in the country , some 2 , 000 national treasures , were wantonly destroyed the taliban s purpose was to wipe out afghan identity so that nationalist resistance to them would be weak unlike soviets or maoist chinese , who interfered with the arts in an effort to eliminate whatever history could not be used to construct patriotic propaganda , the taliban worked toward annihilation the whole idea of being an afghan was to be eradicated
san francisco , may 19 it was nearly a decade ago that a young microsoft programmer named j allard sounded the alarm and convinced bill gates that the internet was a threat to the dominance of the microsoft windows operating system on monday , microsoft will announce mr allard s next big gamble an ambitious billiondollarplus investment in an online game service to be called xbox live microsoft hopes to create what it describes as the equivalent of an online disneyland , globally accessible over the internet , where gamers who subscribe can find partners for dozens of different adventure , racing and sports games the company is betting the service will save its xbox videogame system , which began shipping last november but still lags far behind the industryleading sony playstation 2 , which has nearly 30 million units in use worldwide , compared with only 35 million for the xbox \( there are an estimated four million to five million nintendo gamecube consoles now in use \) while sony and nintendo have online plans , networked game playing is peripheral to their videogame strategies for microsoft , it has been integral to the xbox plan from the beginning the wedge with which microsoft hopes to gain entry to the nation s and world s living rooms and become an entertainment powerhouse it is a bet as ambitious as it is expensive when microsoft opens the electronic doors for its service this summer , the internet technology in its three data centers in london , seattle and tokyo will have more capacity than its own microsoftcom , which itself is one of the world s largest web sites the risk is that microsoft is entering a quagmire that will soak up vast amounts of investment and lock the company in a bitter , potentially unwinnable battle with sony and nintendo , which will each be describing their own online services at this week s game industry convention , the electronic entertainment expo , which starts wednesday in los angeles for xbox live to become a success the company acknowledges that it will have to attract millions of customers willing to pay 50 or more for each game s software and perhaps a 995 monthly subscription , in addition to the 40 to 60 a month for the highspeed internet connection the service will require those are big if s , because while video games have become a wildly popular form of home entertainment , online game playing so far mainly employing personal computers , not game consoles has never appealed to more than a fraction of internet users , and in almost all cases , only when it is free even more daunting is the fact that there is little evidence that video games have expanded much beyond their core audience of adolescent and collegeage males gaming is a very agespecific and demographicspecific device and experience , said mitchell kertzmann , the chief executive office of liberate technologies , an interactive television equipment supplier based in san carlos , calif there have already been wellpublicized failures in the online gaming business during the internet bubble , startups like total entertainment network and mpath rose and fell on the promise of offering web game portals for paying pc customers and sega , the one videogame company that did start an online service , seganet , way back in 2000 , has dropped that service and no longer even makes game consoles , now focusing instead on software it only works when you get to significantly high numbers of subscribers , said lawrence probst , chairman and chief executive officer of electronic arts , the largest maker of computer and videogame software we 've learned that the hard way with eacom , he said , referring to the company s online computergame service , whose only profitable component is the medievalthemed ultima online , which has about 200 , 000 subscribers another challenge may arise in household geography in most homes , the videogame console is located in the living room , where the television set is nowhere near the highspeed internet connection in the den that assumes , of course that the den has a highspeed connection microsoft asserts that as many as half of its xbox customers already have highspeed , or broadband , internet connections but so far only 12 percent of the nation s households have broadband internet , according to odyssey , a market research firm in san francisco , and the number is growing only slowly if this service requires broadband , just put it in the icebox for awhile , said nick donatiello , odyssey s president and yet microsoft s new service does have its defenders , industry executives who think that online gaming can reach a broader audience than standalone video games have microsoft has the resources to make online gaming successful , said charles bellfield , the vice president for corporate strategy at sega , which develops games for the xbox and will offer versions for xbox live it may not happen on day one , but by the time gaming reaches the mainstream , it will be doing well mr allard , who is now general manager of microsoft s xbox division , argues that microsoft can create a mass audience by the force of a huge effort and by the company s ability to tap into a latent demand that he said he first detected three years ago
mr potter by jamaica kincaid 195 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 20 mr potter is jamaica kincaid s new novel jamaica kincaid s new novel is mr potter the sensation created by that sentence is one that may recur many times in the reader of mr potter , a longing for things to be said only once and a longing for more to be said mr potter is a man without qualities , an illiterate taxi driver on kincaid s native island of antigua , whose life , though full of loss and suffering , is essentially uneventful his illegitimate daughter , elaine cynthia , returns to the island after his death to write his story in fact , to narrate this novel her father may have created her , but he played no part in her upbringing and scarcely acknowledged her existence perhaps there is some element of revenge in her recreation of him the character she gives birth to is nearly as speechless as a newborn infant his favorite expression , eh , eh , or , at times of strong emotion , oooooohhhhh ! there is little or no dialogue in most of kincaid s books , but here it seems to matter more than usual , maybe because mr potter is so very much under the thumb of his unforgiving narrator the book is difficult to read , mostly because of its insistent repetition in the opening paragraph of the novel , the phrase the sun was in its usual place , up above and in the middle of the sky occurs four times , with only the tiniest variations no doubt this emphasizes the relentlessness of the caribbean sun , and the repetitive sameness of caribbean weather but for the reader it is a significantly more difficult experience to cope with than a spell on a caribbean island it would n't be so hard if the repetition were n't coupled , here and everywhere it occurs , with a stern rebuff to any idea that it might be meaningful so the sun was in its usual place , up above and in the middle of the sky , but mr potter did not note this , so accustomed was he to this he does n't notice the sun , but nor does he notice anything else , for this is a man who said nothing to himself and sang nothing to himself and thought nothing to himself nothing crossed his mind and the world was blank and the world remained blank this is how the novel proceeds we are told something , then immediately cautioned against thinking that it might mean anything derek walcott once spoke admiringly of the way that each of kincaid s sentences heads toward its own contradiction in mr potter they tend toward contradictions so final that they could almost be crossingsout the delicate tension between possibility and impossibility has been lost mr potter is an essay in a peculiarly antiguan or peculiarly kincaidianantiguan state of mind , a state of mind that a single sentence in her excellent 1997 memoir , my brother , sums up well we ate the tamarinds they were not good , they were not bad , they were just tamarinds in other words , they were not literary tamarinds or metaphoric tamarinds or signifiersofeconomicoppression tamarinds they were just fruit so with mr potter he eats , he sleeps , he fornicates \( thus fathering numerous children , all of whom inherit his nose \) he likes a clean shirt , a nice car , an open window and that is all there is to him , at least in the eyes of his daughternarrator he is just a man , not good , not bad , but poor , illiterate and not very interesting it is actually impossible for him to be interesting in any conventional literary way he has barely been in love he does n't really dream he has scarcely any feelings for mr potter there is none of the rich man s luxury of thinking and pondering for him there is only poverty s deadening literalism but because he hardly cares , he is hard for us to care about he has none of the startling rage of the caribbean heroine of kincaid s 1996 novel , the autobiography of my mother , and none of the cocky disastrousness of devon in my brother elaine cynthia s narration of her father s life is spare and unemotional , but she cannot resist the occasional display of penmanship mostly the prose shuns decoration , preferring to present the action in a deceptively plain fashion the sentences are chains of and and and , strangely reminiscent of hemingway , of all people and he opened the door and he sat in the driver s seat and he turned the car s key so that the engine would start the car as with hemingway , this technique produces some lines that are arrestingly beautiful and some that are irritatingly bland elsewhere , though , the narrator stops telling and grows showy early in the novel , for example , she makes an impossibly arbitrary rule for herself this sentence should begin with dr weizenger emerging , getting off the launch but this is mr potter s life and so dr weizenger must never begin a sentence the sentence does , of course , begin with dr weizenger anyway and why not a person s position in a sentence is dictated by grammar , not seniority at any rate , the rule is abandoned a couple of paragraphs later , having done little but undermine its inventor the daughter also inserts frequent notebooky parentheses into her story the thick coating of asphalt no longer lay smooth like the icing on a cake \( or something like that \) the light just outside the window \( or the windows , as it may be \) they are perhaps intended to stress her fallibility , to remind us that the novel can only be her writerly guess at the outlines of her father s life unfortunately , the effect as with the dr weizenger must never begin a sentence business is to remind us that she is not just writing but writing , an effect that further obscures the poor figure of mr potter himself \( who cannot , after all , write back \) if it is true that between mr potter and his surroundings there is no distance of any kind , between mr potter and elaine cynthia potter there is , if anything , too much distance if her creation was accidental , sometimes his feels even more so there are flashes of intuition and of tenderness , particularly in the portrait of mr potter s father , a fisherman , or in the glimpse we catch of mr potter s boyhood in these moments , we are reminded of how wonderfully kincaid can write when she takes off her elaine cynthia straitjacket but mostly mr potter is a man erased by his own biography somewhere in the process of becoming mr

like many christmas concerts , the ensemble for early music s program at the cathedral church of st john the divine on sunday afternoon opened with a medley of popular carols popular , that is , in 17thcentury scotland and if none of the tunes are common currency today , the piece all sons of adam from 1666 showed that the medley form , at least , has endured packing a world tour into an hour and a quarter , the ensemble offered baroque music from six countries in small , telling snapshots for the french set , frederick renz , founder and director of the early music foundation , arranged sections of marcantoine charpentier s messe de minuit and other pieces to form a french suite overture , gavotte , minuet and so forth the messe de minuit was also filled with quotations from popular carols , but the only tune familiar to today s audience came from a different source the gigue , which charpentier wrote as a drinking song in a moli re play , which is now known as bring a torch , jeanette , isabella \( mr renz gave it a different , 17thcentury text \) german chorales and jovial english ballads showed off the ensemble work of the six vocal soloists , who , despite a few pitch problems , were generally good eric brenner , a countertenor , sang with feeling and color little solo passages in los que fueren de buen gusto , a humorous form of spanish song called a xacarilla , offered glimpses of oliver brewer s attractive round tenor and gregory purnhagen s melodious baritone and joe chappel was a warm bass anchor , blending his rich voice with the lighter forces above it joining them were christa patton on harp , the urbane grant herreid on plucked strings \( from theorbo to baroque guitar \) and patricia ann neely on the bass viola da gamba
my mentor a young man s friendship with william maxwell by alec wilkinson 179 pp boston houghton mifflin company 22 the tribute to one s mentor is an uneasy genre it masquerades as humility \( i owe everything to him \) , but vanity is embedded in every selfeffacing line \( he made me what i am and the world should be grateful \) great books , like boswell s life of samuel johnson , have resulted despite the odds , and highly enjoyable ones , like paul theroux s sir vidia s shadow , have emerged from the genre s dark twin , the attack on the mentor but fond tributes are probably best reserved for ceremonial occasions retirement parties , birthdays and funerals that limit their length alec wilkinson s my mentor a young man s friendship with william maxwell began as a funeral speech maxwell died in july 2000 at the age of 91 grew into a piece for the new yorker and then expanded again into a short book maxwell wrote novels and short stories , and was for many years a legendary editor at the new yorker while maxwell is revered by many writers with approximately the status of such unflashy masters as peter taylor or wallace stegner he can hardly be called a popular writer a certain tough and uncompromising integrity \( wilkinson writes of his fierceness and his flintiness \) surrounds his reputation , along with the cultish allure of the new yorker , where wilkinson has himself been a staff writer of highly regarded nonfiction for 20 years maxwell s westchester county neighbor and best friend was wilkinson s father , kirk , art director of the magazine woman s day for years , they rode the train together into manhattan when alec wilkinson decided to become a writer , his father suggested that he seek maxwell s advice wilkinson kept on seeking it for the next 15 years in my mentor , which is organized with some of the improvisatory dash of maxwell s own fiction , wilkinson has three stories to tell one is the story of maxwell s career as writer , editor and family man wilkinson quotes liberally two or three pages at a stretch from maxwell s writings , and gives a deft and sympathetic portrait of the greatest man i ever knew a second story is wilkinson s own beginnings as a writer the liveliest pages in my mentor are about wilkinson s stint on the wellfleet , mass , police force observing who waited until their husbands were away dragging nets on boats whose lights you could sometimes find at night on the horizon before bringing their lovers home an experience that provided the material for his first book , midnights \( 1982 \) at this point his idea of fine writing came from the likes of thomas wolfe , one of whose lush sentences , the night was a cool bowl of lilac darkness , stuck in wilkinson s mind enter maxwell , with blue pencil the third strand of my mentor both the most interesting part of the book and the most disappointing brings wilkinson and maxwell together as acolyte and mentor one afternoon following another , one piece or one book succeeding another , we sat beside each other at a table sometimes at maxwell s apartment in new york , sometimes at the house in westchester , and sometimes in the woods surrounding a rented house in wellfleet and he suggested cuts or changed a word i had learned recently to plain english , and otherwise taught me what a writer needs to know annoyed with the beginning writer s tendency to tell rather than show , maxwell admonishes his pupil , henry james said 'dramatize , dramatize , dramatize , ' not 'generalize , generalize , generalize' but when wilkinson tries to convey what a writer needs to know , he settles for a list of vague generalizations when to compress and when to handle a subject at length the order in which to present things how to arrive at a companionable style the benefit of the surprising juxtaposition instead of trusting the reader s curiosity about such things \( how exactly does one arrive at a companionable style \? what is an example of a surprising juxtaposition \? \) , wilkinson reaches for histrionic analogies to heighten the importance of what he is learning maxwell taught me to write the way primitive fathers taught their sons to stalk , to study tracks , to observe the behavior of their prey , to watch the sky for weather , to note the bloom of the bush that signifies that the fish in their migrations have returned to the river well , yes , but what about compression versus length \? this is not dramatizing it is melodrama wilkinson s subtitle is a young man s friendship , but my mentor does not feel like a young man s book wilkinson wants us to know that he has put away childish things he aspires to senescence having my most intimate friend be nearly twice my age did not seem unusual to me , partly because i am no longer captivated by things that younger people are concerned with and again i also do n't much care what younger people are interested in because i was young , and i remember what it was like wilkinson is 50 forswearing popular culture , which tirelessly celebrates excess , outrage and adolescent beauty , none of which appeals to me anymore , he dispenses sententious advice of his own it is important to have the best influences possible , to read the best books , listen to the best music , study the best paintings the therapeutic burden of my mentor during the course of which we learn about both maxwell s psychoanalysis under theodor reik and wilkinson s with a jungian analyst in the village is that wilkinson s father was a brute and a womanizer and that the sensitive maxwell served as his ideal alternative father the reader finishes this book with two wishes first , that wilkinson could accept the limitations of his own father instead of projecting a perfect father onto maxwell , and second , that he could accept his own status as a son or young man after many pages of hearing how awful wilkinson s father was and how wonderful maxwell was , it is a relief to come upon this brief epiphany it has occurred to me that if maxwell had been my father , i might have found the quiet of the household stultifying , and my parents' that is , the maxwells' romance and their preoccupation with art and literature impenetrable , and later on i might have sought out the man i remembered from my childhood who lived up the road the sunday painter with the tools in his barn , who , when the snow was deep enough , hitched his horses to a carriage sled and drove over the fields , and who seemed ebullient and mischievous and full of an appetite for life
dublin , feb 19 in a strange case that is unraveling one of ireland s longestrunning business partnerships , fyffes , the dublinbased distributor of bananas and other produce in europe , is suing a former member of its board , accusing him of insider trading the case promises to set important precedents for corporate accountability here the basic facts are simple and undisputed dcc , an irish industrial holding company , sold its 102 percent stake in fyffes in two batches in early 2000 , shortly after james f flavin , dcc s chief executive and a fyffes director , received internal reports that showed rough times ahead for fyffes fyffes contends that the action amounts to an improper sale based on nonpublic pricesensitive information , and under irish law , that means dcc owes fyffes compensation two influential irish investment funds , eagle star and hibernian asset management , have followed fyffes in filing suits of their own against dcc on the same ground for their part , mr flavin and dcc say he neither initiated nor influenced the share sale they say the inside information he had was not price sensitive and in an odd twist , they say fyffes knew all along about the sale and even encouraged it which fyffes says is true , but irrelevant unless irish fraud investigators decide to make the matter a criminal prosecution , the outcome of the dispute will probably not be known for at least a year , as lawyers on both sides trudge through reams of internal company documents that have become part of the case record ireland has a clubby business community and a lot of patience with whitecollar misdoings one scandal after another has erupted around senior business and political figures , with tribunals appointed to investigate them , to almost no effect antifraud laws that went on the books in 1963 have so far yielded only one conviction , and the sole insidertrading case prosecuted so far ended in january with the acquittal of a real estate executive even so , the fyffesdcc case has captured keen attention because of the bitter split it represents between two highly regarded executives mr flavin and neil v mccann , the chairman of fyffes and patriarch of the family that controls it who had once been close the links go back a long way dcc bought a stake in fyffes when it was starting out as a venture capital company in 1981 , and mr flavin has played an active role as a nonexecutive director of fyffes over the years he advised the mccann family on strategic acquisitions , and he managed the initial public offering of fyffes in 1994 through the corporate finance arm of dcc by the 1990 s , though , dcc had reinvented itself as a health care and technology holding company , and there was no place in its strategy for bananas dcc began trying to sell the fyffes stake in 1998 , according to minutes from board meetings at lotus green , the netherlandsbased dcc subsidiary that held the shares dcc says it held on only to avoid flooding the market and damaging the share price of fyffes an opportune moment came at the height of the internet boom in early 2000 , when the fyffes internet portal , worldoffruitcom , was captivating irish investors and pushing fyffes stock up to nearly 4 euros a share irish stockbrokers approached dcc about going through with the longdiscussed sale of its fyffes shares it was the first time in a decade that there was a significant institutional appetite for the stock , said michael scholefield , a senior dcc executive , adding that dcc saw a sale as being in the interest of both companies mr mccann seemed to agree when he met with mr flavin the day after dcc s subsidiary sold its first batch of fyffes shares , he took along a bottle of champagne on ice to celebrate the sale the following day , mr mccann wrote to mr flavin it would be helpful if the remainder of the shares are disposed of , so that they will not be overhanging the market it is quite an achievement to have disposed of such a volume and get such a good reaction dcc s subsidiary sold the rest of its shares of fyffes in early february 2000 the trouble now arises from the fact that the share price of fyffes plummeted in the months after the sales , eventually bottoming out at 067 euro , as the dotcom bubble burst and worldoffruitcom fell apart did the internal reports mr flavin saw in late 1999 as a fyffes director presage the collapse \? dcc says they were routine announcements in the volatile market for fruit and produce , and that at the time , fyffes was not behaving as if they foretold trouble it issued stock options to several executives and authorized another to sell shares around the same time , in january 2000 and in the annual report being prepared that month , mr mccann s statement to shareholders said that 2000 will be another year of further growth for fyffes , with no reference to the negative reports none of that matters , a fyffes spokesman said the law offers fyffes a chance of winning damages from dcc over the sale , and its fiduciary duty to shareholders requires it to sue to get them experts said that the insider trading statute was not specific about what damages could be awarded , and there are no prior cases to look to for a precedent fyffes has asked for all the gains dcc had on the stock from its purchase in 1981 to its sale 19 years later , some 85 million euros \( 73 million \) in all more than fyffes expects to earn before taxes this year photos at a plant in dublin for fyffes , a distributor of bananas and other fresh produce in europe a lawsuit by fyffes involves a bitter split of two board members and potential damage to some reputations \( photographs by derek speirs \) bananas being put into the ripening vaults last month at the fyffes distribution and ripening center on beresford street in dublin
during world war ii soldiers carried armed services editions of pocketsize books and read them avidly whenever they had time these were literary classics , popular novels , plays and nonfiction issued free to troops around the world the books , increasingly dogeared , were a cultural oasis as well as entertainment some soldiers took them into battle copies were handed out as troops left england for the normandy invasion more than 120 million copies of more than 1 , 300 titles were distributed from 1943 to 1947 these paperbacks included works by twain , hemingway , fitzgerald and tolstoy classics like plato s republic and homer s odyssey plays like shaw s arms and the man thrillers and westerns and nonfiction like joseph dunninger s book on mind reading , what s on your mind \? andrew carroll , an author and archivist , described the program as the biggest giveaway of books in our history with the possible exception of gideon bibles it is , he said , a great forgotten story of world war ii after the war the editions were at least partly responsible for the proliferation of paperbacks in the united states this month , in a pilot project created by mr carroll , the armed services editions are returning with 100 , 000 copies of new versions of four books being printed in the same wide , brightly colored cargo pocket format shakespeare s henry v , the art of war \( sun tzu s classic 500 bc study of military strategies \) and two recent best sellers , medal of honor profiles of america s military heroes from the civil war to the present by allen mikaelian , with commentary by mike wallace , and war letters extraordinary correspondence from american wars , edited by mr carroll once again they are being distributed to american troops abroad they are being published by hyperion , dover publications and the washington square press of simon schuster for the publication and distribution of these first four titles , mr carroll obtained 50 , 000 from a corporate source mr carroll hopes this project will eventually approximate the original one as he said , there s nothing i 'd like more than to see this little effort transformed into what it was in the 1940 s a major collaboration between publishers and the military during the war , more than 70 publishers participated mr carroll has had informal talks with scribner and little , brown and plans to approach other houses if publishers get behind this , he said , there s no reason we ca n't start sending out hundreds of thousands of books some authors he would like to see included are steinbeck , fitzgerald , flannery o'connor , james baldwin , stephen king and john grisham clarence strowbridge , president of dover , which is publishing henry v and the art of war , said that the original editions inspired a whole generation of servicemen and women to become lifelong readers , and i have no doubt these books will do the same after the war dover became a leader in the paperback revolution for the rejuvenated project the choice of books emphasizing the military was coincidental , mr carroll said , and was driven by the immediate availability of publication rights \( the dover books are in the public domain \) the pentagon approved the selections , he added none of the new selections were on the original world war ii book list , which was suggested by a committee of literary figures \( including mark van doren and amy loveman \) and approved by the army and the navy art buchwald , who at 17 joined the marines and was stationed in the marshall islands during the war , has vivid memories of the armed services editions occasionally a comedian like bob hope or jack benny would appear in that remote location to entertain the troops , but the armed services editions remained the principal source of culture we had no magazines , mr buchwald recalled all we had was those books his favorites were thomas heggen s mister roberts and the feather merchants by max shulman , an antic comedy that may have influenced mr buchwald s future career as a humorist we would trade the books like postage stamps , he said i'm happy they 're coming back he added that there was a possibility that some of his own books might also be made available to servicemen although the books were intended to be read off duty , robert adair , a professor emeritus at yale university and a veteran of the 94th infantry division , remembers a rebellious friend of his who would sit in his foxhole and even under fire would read armed services editions later , he said , he was killed in action in books in action the armed services editions , published some years ago by the library of congress , john y cole wrote about the council on books in wartime , a group of publishers , librarians and booksellers who decided to use books as weapons in the war of ideas the books , he said , were sold to the military at cost \( 6 cents a volume in the 1940 s \) and distributed only overseas so as not to interfere with the domestic market portability was the first consideration , mr cole said each book had to fit in a pocket for that reason several novels were abridged , among them mobydick and forever amber there were only a few cases of censorship zane grey s riders of the purple sage was dropped because a proofreader thought it was a bitter attack on the mormons , although nine other grey titles were in the series e b white s one man s meat was temporarily banned mr cole quoted the author as saying that he was never told why , but i always like having a book banned because it showed that somebody has read it the books were placed in wooden crates and shipped as freight later they were sent as direct mail and were sometimes distributed during mail call , with more books naturally going to servicemen not in combat and many going to the wounded in hospitals in an essay in the new york times in 1985 , the german author hans magnus enzenberger remembered his introduction to american literature as a teenager in bavaria in 1945 he was living near an army encampment one day i stole a crate of armed services editions , he said , thick , oblong paperbacks with covers rather in the style of movie posters thus , by courtesy of the american taxpayer , i was introduced to hemingway , faulkner and f scott fitzgerald , as well as louis bromfield i devoured them all , and novels by thomas mann and franz kafka , which were unavailable in nazi germany the editions eventually became collector s items matthew j bruccoli , an author and publisher , collected nearly 600 volumes , while also gathering information about the project in an essay in the library of congress book , he said that 155 , 000 copies of the great gatsby were distributed to servicemen , as against the 25 , 000 copies of the novel printed by scribners between 1925 and 1942 mr carroll first became aware of the editions four or five years ago when he found a steinbeck novel in an antiquarian bookstore in california he soon began his own collection , which includes a rare copy of superman , a novel , not a comic book echoing his predecessors during world war ii , mr carroll said he wanted to promote the love of reading he was adamant about using the original format as an act of nostalgia and a tip of the hat to this great project photos two of the four titles being distributed to servicemen abroad starting this month are at near left two of the titles from world war ii are above and in the hospital haircut picture they helped paperbacks proliferate \( from books in action the

cambridge , mass robert mugabe s declaration of victory in the presidential elections held last weekend in zimbabwe was , despite his unpopularity , hardly a surprise he had already tweaked the system in so many ways that such an outcome was nearly inevitable as morgan tsvangirai , who lost to mr mugabe , said , the election was stolen in a daylight robbery it is neither surprising nor inappropriate , therefore , that most western supporters of democracy have condemned the elections what is a surprise and a tremendous disappointment is the endorsement of the elections by the organization of african unity , which had sent an observer team citing high turnout rates and the able manner in which polling officers conducted the election , the organization , which was founded in 1963 and has 53 member states , declared that in general , the elections were transparent , credible , free and fair the elections were none of those things thugs associated with the ruling party had physically attacked opponents of the mugabe regime for months prior to the election mr tsvangirai s party , the movement for democratic change , estimates that 100 of its supporters were killed in preelection violence throughout the campaign , mr mugabe s supporters broke up opposition rallies much of the international press was run out of the country mr mugabe implemented laws that curtailed press freedom , limited mass gatherings , undermined the independence of the electoral administration and altered \( in the ruling party s favor \) the requirements for voting in the week before the election , mr mugabe s electoral commission reduced the number of polling places in urban areas , where the opposition party had strong support on the two days set out for the election as well as a third , allowed by the supreme court when it became clear that urban polling stations were overwhelmed mugabe supporters reportedly intimidated voters and chased away independent observers what makes the verdict of the organization of african unity profoundly disappointing is not just that it is so clearly wrong , but that it harks back to old and destructive habits , weakens recent commitments to positive change and may undermine the fragile relationships that have been developing between africans and international aid institutions the oau has long been perceived as a club for corrupt , authoritarian leaders distinguished primarily by a tolerance of each others' misdeeds however , the past decade has been one of political liberalization across the continent competitive , if not exactly flawless , elections took place in some of africa s highestprofile countries , including nigeria , ghana , senegal and south africa bolstered by evidence that stable democracies provide a better environment for investment , and therefore development and encouraged by a greater interest in good governance on the part of donor institutions like the world bank africa s new democratic leaders called for a continentwide commitment to democratic principles the oau launched the new partnership for africa s development last october the partnership s manifesto acknowledges that development is impossible in the absence of true democracy and calls for leaders to respect the global standards of democracy , the core components of which include fair , open , free , and democratic elections africa was to have a new resolve to deal with conflicts and censure deviation from the norm the failure to criticize the way the zimbabwean elections were conducted demonstrates that the new resolve and the confidence to censure deviation have yet to be found the partnership could be easily dismissed as a rhetorical exercise and left unmourned such failures are common enough but the need for something like the african partnership is so great that one hates to dismiss it , even after this miserable performance the oau s acceptance of the zimbabwe mess hinders the effort under way to realize the united nation s millennium declaration a truly novel effort to fight global poverty at the heart of this effort , which has been endorsed by the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development as well as the bush administration , is a compact between rich countries and poor ones the former will be more generous and aggressive in attacking poverty , provided the latter commit to the economic policies and democratic institutions most likely to be conducive to real progress the new partnership for africa s development seemed to be evidence that african governments had committed to making changes in their approach to development , and that governments in developed countries could have more faith that their aid would bring positive results the oau s endorsement of mr mugabe s conduct will undermine that faith yet the events in zimbabwe should not lead wealthier countries simply to give up hope for political and economic progress in the region next week s international conference on financing for development in monterrey , mexico , sponsored by the united nations , presents the chance for leaders of poor and rich countries alike to recommit themselves to spreading the benefits of globalization and the principles of good governance african leaders acquiescing to mr mugabe s election fraud needlessly endanger hope for progress on that front
manchester , nh mary jane lavoie is no stranger to colleges going out of business two years ago , she was the last registrar at bradford college in massachusetts , which shut its doors three years short of its 200th anniversary now , as the registrar of notre dame college here , she is going through the same sad routine , sending hundreds of transcripts to colleges for students seeking a new home , writing recommendations for colleagues looking for jobs and finding storage for records accumulated over 50 years how can i get into this situation again \? said ms lavoie , 41 should n't i be able to find myself a job from which i can retire \? bradford and notre dame colleges are not isolated cases at least 27 of the nation s 1 , 600 private colleges many important in their regions , a few known more widely have announced plans to close since january 1997 , a 35 percent increase from the previous fiveyear period dozens more are in precarious financial situations and may face closing if the economy does not improve some of these , like marymount college tarrytown , north of new york city , have chosen to merge with stronger competitors some , like franklin pierce college in rindge , nh , have sought loans many times larger than their modest assets to spruce up their campuses in hopes of attracting students morton o schapiro , the president of williams college in massachusetts and an economist of higher education , said many of these private colleges offered the small classes and intimate settings unavailable in larger public institutions nearby every time you lose one of those jewels , it s unfortunate , he said it s like walmart opens up on the highway , and the momandpop store around the corner closes the economy is not the only reason for the straits of many colleges the more marginal private colleges have been losing students to cheaper public institutions , and women s and religious colleges have been hurt by other societal factors the private college market has shifted , becoming much more national than even a decade ago , hurting many regional colleges high school graduates in the 1980 s might have chosen regional colleges because of family or religious affiliations or simply to stay close to home , but young people today are less inclined to do so the internet has contributed by making it easier to learn about colleges far from home to be sure , top liberal arts colleges like williams and amherst are not facing financial crises endowed with hundreds of millions of dollars each , they are in control of their destinies but of the roughly 500 private liberal arts colleges , fewer than 50 are in such secure positions , said a recent study by mr schapiro and michael s mcpherson , another economist of higher education most have very small endowments or none david breneman , an economics professor at the university of virginia who is a leading analyst of the finances of higher education , said most private liberal arts colleges charged tuition of 15 , 000 to 25 , 000 , lower than ivy league tuition but much higher than tuition at public universities there are not enough families who are willing to pay the prices these schools ask for , he said the odds are stacked against private liberal arts colleges , the experts say most of the rising demographic demand generated by baby boom 2 is being absorbed by public universities and community colleges , said john nelson , a vice president at moody s investors service the competition from the public sector is a lot more intense fifty years ago , half of college students went to private institutions today , less than onefifth do mary peloquindodd , who analyzes the college and university market for standard poor s , said teenagers today choose colleges differently from the way their parents or grandparents did the students are more savvy , she said they are looking for things that cost more money they want apartments instead of dorms they want physical facilities buildings , gyms , computers that are the state of the art but most liberal arts colleges , unlike the big public and elite private institutions , cannot afford largescale construction or periodic computer upgrades to win over more students , many of these regional colleges offer large scholarships , which cut into tuition income in the meantime , the popularity of liberal arts majors has declined in 1969 , about half of all college degrees awarded were in liberal arts the figure dwindled to less than 40 percent in the 1970 s and is about 25 percent today to survive , many small colleges are redesigning their curriculums and redefining their missions the college of st mary in omaha has set aside an entire dormitory for students who are single mothers , even offering day care but the room for error is small , the economists say , and one misstep can push a college under bradford closed its doors after a new dormitory failed to attract a bigger enrollment ms lavoie , the registrar at notre dame college , is not the only one reliving the pain of a college s demise kerry phipps , a notre dame junior , attended trinity college in burlington , vt , for her freshman year and afterward learned it was closing this time , the end is not as sudden , so she can at least say goodbye to professors and classmates i bought a notre dame class ring , she said i really wanted to graduate from here the seniors here are more worried about the lack of an alma mater you know how you want to come back to your school and show your kids , said jimmie denwiddie , a senior on scholarship who has majored in business management i am getting a business degree from a school that goes out of business few of the 62 members of notre dame s faculty have found jobs , and the future does not look rosy no one has bought the georgianstyle campus of bradford in the quaint town with which it shares its name thick dust has settled on dormitory lamps , desks and beds salt and pepper shakers , half full , still sit on dining hall tables it feels like the school were just on a break , said kristen hollenbeck , a fundraiser who runs bradford s alumni organization , as she sauntered recently on the empty campus it feels like next week the kids would all be coming back photos mary jane lavoie , the registrar at notre dame , had worked at bradford college , which closed in 2000

salt lake city the best thing about these games \? valentino castellani asked before the likes of willie nelson and kiss helped put another american olympics to bed i would have to say that i was able to experience a high level of security , but all of us were very relaxed here you know , you can be very secure but also very anxious castellani , president of torino 2006 , next up on the winter olympics docket , spent the past 16 days much like the rest of us going through the metal detectors , turning on his cellphone for the pleasant volunteers , treading carefully past guardsmen in fatigues and occasionally glancing skyward as f16 s roared by as military presences go , this was not much more than the 1992 summer games in barcelona , spain , where machineguntoting soldiers guarded against the risk of an attack by basque separatists but considering the timing , the salt lake games were secure to the point where it was olympic business as usual far more finger pointing than primal fear and this suggests the comfort level was founded in precautions left unseen , the understanding that the united states had 300 million and its reputation as the world s reigning superpower invested you know , 9 11 is like yesterday , castellani said and these are the parameters that created this response from the american side , beginning with the flap over the tattered world trade center flag , it included an entirely acceptable outpouring of passion for lives lost , but also of unfettered north american cheerleading that left many in general and the russians in particular feeling as if they 'd stepped into a cold war blockbuster starring sylvester stallone the united states not only experienced a 34medal harvest that exceeded the most sanguine projections but also celebrated a growing diversity , albeit in one of the most homogenous of cities vonetta flowers , a bobsledder , became the first africanamerican to win winter games gold derek parra , a mexicanamerican , won gold and silver in longtrack speedskating , as did apolo anton ohno , a japaneseamerican , in shorttrack sasha cohen , a jewish 17yearold , narrowly missed winning a medal in figure skating naomi lang , a native american , competed in ice dancing with all due respect to the germans , whose medal count eclipsed the united states' by one , and the canadians , who got the hockey gold they came for and rode the aforementioned cheerleading wave in the figure skating pairs judging morass , this was an american show of federal willpower and athletic might but the olympics are also , and even more so , about having to take your game on the road faster than we think , the athens summer games will be upon us in 2004 the greek delegation , led by its president , gianna angelopoulosdaskalaki , was here in force , including 30 ministry of public order officials , assuring everyone that their execution will be as sound and secure as salt lake s if we have to make changes , we 'll make changes , angelopoulosdaskalaki said with reports of athens lagging in its preparation , with greece never known as a bastion of invulnerability , few here were inclined to believe it from castellani , president of the organizing committee for the winter games in turin , italy , came the hope that such heavily secured games wo n't be necessary by 2006 , or 2004 conversely , other olympic officials like mitt romney , who rescued the salt lake operation from that nasty little bribery scandal , have said that the ongoing specter of terrorism in an unstable global climate has inalterably changed the business of staging the games michael knight , who spearheaded the splendid 2000 sydney summer games , suggested that beyond the american resolve to not back down no matter the cost , the world s lessendowed democracies may be in over their heads trying to pull the games off in their current bloated state however much effort the greeks make to avoid what no country wants with the whole world watching , you can bet that american athletes will not make targets of themselves unnecessarily they will not have their helmets hand painted with the statue of liberty , as picabo street did before the downhill who would be surprised if some of our millionaires in basketball and tennis make other plans for the summer , not eager to give up the home cooking \? i think that the image we 've seen here , everyone is leaving here from around the world with good feelings , said sandra baldwin , the united states olympic committee president i think it greatly strengthens our chances about being able to get the games back here by 2012 she was apparently not watching the same olympics as the russians , the south koreans and the others with grievances , real and imagined we ca n't close our eyes to discrimination and unfair judging , said leonid tyagachev , baldwin s russian counterpart there was a certain nervous atmosphere that disturbed our athletes and coaches like it or not , americans must know there are reasons beyond medal counts that resentment of the united states has grown in international sports , beginning with the belief that it buys favoritism and the olympics itself \( four since 1980 , while no other nation has had more than one \) with network television dollars americans get preachy with their special commissions on olympic boobytrap issues like drugs and bribes , but get caught in the acts themselves americans decry bloc judging and institutional cheating but had no problem jumping into the canadian pairs camp with few of the facts americans have historically applauded the 1972 men s basketball team for leaving the medal podium bare , but ridiculed the russians here for threatening to walk out dr jacques rogge , the new international olympic committee president , said , people of america , utah and salt lake city , you have given the world superb games none of the greatest rhetoric juan antonio samaranch liked to bestow , with the exception of the previous american games , in atlanta this was a solid , safe and unspectacular olympics , a galvanizing homesoil show next come the road games , where american athletes will have real fears to face , and , in all likelihood , fewer friends than before
they were baggage handlers , luggage screeners , security guards and aircraft mechanics their criminal pasts included armed robbery , sexual assault of a child , drug dealing and identity theft but all of the 127 current and former workers at la guardia and kennedy international airports who were recently arrested , or who face arrest , had one thing in common , federal , state and local authorities said yesterday they had received security clearances at the airports either by lying about their criminal histories or by presenting fake identification the crackdown was the biggest yet in a series of finetoothed background checks on workers at major american airports this year so far , more than 900 workers have been arrested or indicted , including 104 at three airports in the washington area 66 in charlotte , nc and 21 at newark liberty international airport last week the investigation , which lasted for nine months , also revealed some of the most gaping holes in the pre9 11 security system at new york s airports for instance , before the 2001 terror attacks , workers who had to be cleared to receive security badges were not routinely fingerprinted , the authorities said social security numbers were not verified and in some cases , employers apparently took applicants at their word when they said they had no criminal history according to the queens district attorney s office , 83 of the 127 accused workers had been arrested as of last night the rest were being sought on warrants about 70 of the workers were currently employed at the airports nine of the 127 had outstanding warrants for other crimes officials involved in the new york roundup stressed that none of the workers , who ranged in age from 22 to 62 , appeared to be terrorists but the unfitness they demonstrated for access to the internal workings of the airports was impressive , and raised the possibility that a terrorist with false identification could have gotten such access jose almodovar , a supervisor at a cleaning company at la guardia airport who had access to the tarmac , was actually mario jimenez , who had once been on the mostwanted list in middlesex county , nj , on cocaine charges , prosecutors said lawrence parris , 33 , a plane mechanic for spirit airlines , had neglected to tell his employer about a 1994 robbery conviction another worker was an immigrant who had been deported for a felony and was wanted for illegal reentry these individuals represent a significant vulnerability to the security of our air transportation system , said roslynn r mauskopf , the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york the authorities said that after investigating all 40 , 000 badgeholders at kennedy and la guardia , they felt confident that there was no one still working there with an undetected criminal past or a false identity they also said that safeguards were now in place that would prevent future security lapses since december 2001 , a fingerprint check has been mandatory it is no longer hit or miss , ms mauskopf said and since a few months ago , the social security number offered by every applicant for a security badge has been verified with the social security administration ms mauskopf said that some workers were able to get away with making their social security numbers up out of whole cloth , while others stole them one 26yearold was using the social security number of an 8yearold child the problems with the backgroundchecking system arose from the fact that there were many parties involved in it and no one coordinating them , ms mauskopf said the security badges were issued by the port authority of new york and new jersey , which runs the airports , or by the united states customs service but in most cases , those agencies were relying on background checks conducted by employers , like airlines , security companies and cleaning contractors there was no uniformity in the process , ms mauskopf said deputy chief robert caron of the port authority police department said that regardless of who did them , the background checks that were done were done under the federal guidelines but , chief caron added , we found out after 9 11 that maybe this was n't sufficient enough the 127 workers , if convicted , face a variety of penalties on top of punishment for any underlying criminal offenses they may have lied about misusing a social security number or lying about a criminal record can result in up to five years in prison , while illegally reentering the country after being deported for a serious felony is punishable by up to 20 years twenty of the workers face deportation , ms mauskopf said ms mauskopf was asked at the news conference at kennedy airport yesterday whether the workers' deceptions ever put travelers in danger whenever you have people who are not trustworthy , she replied , who have demonstrated as part of a critical security background investigation that they ca n't live up even to the requirements of that background investigation , i think it raises issues about their trustworthiness and their access to areas photo a worker arrested at kennedy airport after a

washington , sept 12 for some time , travelers browsing the state department web site for helpful tips about guadalajara , mexico , found much more than they bargained for when they clicked on a photograph of president bush the click transported them to a partisan playground , where they were told how to get involved with the republican party and even how to donate money to it the state department site , it turns out , had been providing a link to a web site run by the republican national committee despite federal laws prohibiting government resources from being used for partisan purposes the link was not removed until late this afternoon , after a reporter asked about it state department officials said they were not sure how long the link had been operating but one person who noticed it said it was operating as early as sept 5 the republican party web site made no bones about its aims , recounting president bush s record and even offering republican memorabilia , including mugs , ties , scarves and ballpoint pens , for sale the site , which had a red , white and blue republican national committee logo , also gave visitors an opportunity to register to vote , sign up as a party volunteer and donate money , all with a click of the mouse help the rnc support the republican party and win elections nationwide , the web site said help us give president bush a stronger working majority in congress the discovery of the link on the state department site prompted protests from politicians and goodgovernment advocates , who called it blatantly political and demanded an investigation into who was behind it claire buchan , a spokeswoman for the white house , referred questions about the web site and its link to the state department but added , i understand that that is being fixed and removed philip reeker , a state department spokesman , called the link to the republican party s web site a mistake and emphasized that agency officials were unaware of it until a reporter pointed it out we have corrected it , mr reeker said we thank you for bringing it to our attention a spokesman for the republican national committee said party officials had no idea that a government agency s web site had a link to the party s site it is unclear whether other government web sites provide such links , though critics have long maintained that government sites themselves are often thinly veiled promotional tools for politicians we 've been saying for years that the principal purpose of many congressional web sites is just to promote members of congress , said gary ruskin , the director of the nonpartisan congressional accountability project election law experts say the link to the republican site may violate several laws , including the hatch act , which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan activities while on duty or in government offices the experts also say the web site and its link may also violate campaign finance laws that impose penalties for soliciting campaign contributions from government property somebody has made a horrible mistake , said trevor potter , a republican who is a former chairman of the federal election commission it just does n't make any sense i can only think that this is some kind of terrible mixup because it is so clearly prohibited by law the situation has prompted representative robert menendez , democrat of new jersey , to send a letter to the white house urging the administration to remove the link to the site mr mendendez , the ranking democrat on a house committee that oversees the state department , also called for an investigation by the federal elections commission , the justice department and the state department s inspector general in an interview this afternoon , mr menendez scoffed at the state department s contention that the link was a mistake you cannot create a link like this by accident , he said no way it takes a lot of thought to create such a link it cannot be inadvertent to get to the republican web site from the state department site , www state gov , a user had to click on a heading entitled embassies and consulates that led to a page listing the nation s embassies and consulates around the world once there , the web user could click to the posting for the united states consulate in guadalajara that posting contains , among other things , an official photograph of president bush a click of the mouse on the president s name , beneath the image , would linked the user directly to the republican national committee s spanishlanguage site , abriendo caminos that site leads to all sorts of information about the party , in spanish and english in his letter to the white house , mr menendez dismissed the link as egregious political material that hardly qualifies as official state department business but mr reeker , the state department spokesman , said the link was probably created by people working in the guadalajara consulate without the knowledge of officials in washington i'm amazed that somebody caught it , he said none of us knew about it photos a click on president bush at the web site for the consulate at guadalajara , mexico , provided a direct link to the spanish language version of the republican national committee s web site , a portal to other party sites

taipei the future has rarely been so cloudy for taiwan s sprawling centuryold tobacco and alcohol monopoly , which the government has begun converting into a publicly traded company competing in a free market the loss of generous tax breaks for the enterprise , which on july 1 was reorganized from a government agency into a stateowned company , the taiwan tobacco and liquor corporation , threatens to sharply reduce its sales , both directly and through contributing to an overall reduction in smoking in taiwan also , the company may be forced to rename its 53yearold flagship cigarette brand , long life , which commands more than 40 percent of the market , because of a proposed law forbidding any marketing claim or suggestion that cigarettes are clean , safe or healthy privatization of the monopoly and withdrawal of privileged tax treatment were steps taiwan promised to take when it was negotiating its entry last november into the world trade organization now that it is organized as a corporation , taiwan tobacco and liquor will be publicly floated in stages , beginning with an initial public offering in 2005 in the meantime , fierce competition is already beginning on the alcohol side , a number of local companies are setting up breweries and distilleries but the big changes are in cigarettes , in a country where half the men smoke \( but only one in 20 women do \) though taiwan tobacco has been the sole domestic manufacturer , it has competed with imported brands since 1987 , when the government took away its monopoly of the retail distribution of tobacco and liquor products but the imports were much more expensive , in large part because they were subject to high taxes while the state monopoly was not to the delight of antismoking activists , the government chose to level the playing field by ending taiwan tobacco s tax exemption , not lowering the taxes it also added a 15centsapack health tax to all cigarettes , domestic and foreign , earlier this year as a result , smoking is suddenly much more expensive here , and consumption is expected to decline the antismoking crusaders are delighted , too , at the regulatory threat to the brand name of one of taiwan tobacco and liquor s bestselling products in the past , there had been strong criticism of the government that it carried on antismoking campaigns while selling cigarettes at the same time , just like a soccer player being a referee at the same time , said judy lin , the chief of tobacco control at the john tung foundation , a nonprofit group in taiwan that has led the fight against smoking here ms lin said that the long life brand name implied that the cigarettes could prolong life , or at the least were less dangerous than other cigarettes while the no health claims bill before the taiwan legislature does not single out long life , it nonetheless alarms taiwan tobacco and liquor , which is determined to preserve the name the brand name is an asset , said chan shihchu , the company s director of tobacco products changing the name would have a substantial effect on our business the monopoly bureau chose long life as an auspicious name when the cigarette was first introduced in 1959 , and never intended to suggest any health benefit , mr chan said no smoker will buy the cigarettes because they believe it will bring long life , he said he acknowledged that cigarette smoking could impair health the tax changes have pushed up the retail cost of a 20cigarette pack of long lifes by 32 percent in a matter of months , making a pack cost 1 to 120 still cheap by american standards , but quite a lot in taiwan , where economic output per person is about 13 , 000 a year , onethird of that in the united states mr chan said long life sales plunged this year , though he would not give figures he said the company hoped that some of the dropoff reflected consumers' having bought in bulk just before the widely publicized tax increases , and that sales would climb again when smokers' hoards were exhausted but chen tzeshu , owner of a small grocery store in taipei , said that long life cigarettes had another problem nowadays , none of the young people smoke long life it s the middleaged and older men taiwan tobacco and liquor s sales slowly eroded in the 1990 s after it lost its retail distribution monopoly but with annual sales of more than 2 billion , it remains one of taiwan s largest companies the company s share of the domestic cigarette market fell from 80 percent 10 years ago to about half now , mr chan said but it has held on to most of the domestic market for alcoholic beverages , mainly because of taiwan beer , a popular , highquality brew belied by its generic name and bland label the former monopoly , whose huge mansion headquarters are across the street from the presidential compound in taipei , has played an outsize role in taiwan history after japan took the island from china in a war in 1894 , it set up the monopoly bureau as a government agency with the exclusive right to a range of goods from cigarettes and beer to salt and camphor steep markups on the products were used to defray the cost of japan s colonial administration of taiwan the monopoly bureau s marketing of opium in taiwan at a time when the drug was illegal both in mainland china and in japan was especially controversial international pressure on tokyo brought opium sales to an end in the 1930 s when japan s world war ii surrender returned the island to china , some taiwan entrepreneurs began selling cigarettes and other monopoly products in defiance of the monopoly bureau , which was seen as a colonial vestige but the nationalist government under chiang kaishek , pressed hard by the communists in the chinese civil war and looking to taiwan as a possible refuge , responded with tightened control on feb 27 , 1947 , an agent of the monopoly bureau beat up a woman selling cigarettes on the street in taipei local residents staged a large protest the next day , and were machinegunned by nationalist troops the incident touched off rioting across taiwan that was bloodily suppressed with the loss of as many as 20 , 000 lives , mainly among taiwan s social and intellectual elite , engendering decades of hostility between nationalists from the mainland and many local taiwanese chart losing its grip sales at the

the doctor s house by ann beattie 283 pages scribner 24 ann beattie s early and very influential fiction often felt as improvisatory and random as her aimless characters' lives in those tales , glittering bits of dialogue , sharply observed contemporary details and sadfunnyironic anecdotes often appeared as non sequiturs , giving us strobelike glimpses of her people s lives motive was rarely attached to her characters' behavior , nor was cause and effect instead , everyone seemed to live in the present tense all this began to change in the 90 s as ms beattie increasingly imposed a narrative shape on her characters' stories , connecting the psychological dots while investigating consequences and causes with story collections like what was mine and novels like another you , this change in authorial method made for fiction with a new depth and emotional chiaroscuro fiction that demonstrated the author s ability to limn her characters' inner lives with the same authority she brought to descriptions of their daily routines unfortunately , ms beattie s latest novel , the doctor s house , combines the worst qualities of her early and late fiction , with none of their assets the novel s main characters come across as parodies of the lost , alienated , passive people found in her fiction of the 70 s and early 80 s , yet are delineated with none of the specificity or ironic wit that lent their predecessors a certain edge at the same time , explanations are clumsily served up to explain these characters' myriad problems , explanations that are so diagrammatic and heavyhanded that they sound like freud for dummies the resulting book , like the author s disastrous 1997 novel my life , starring dara falcon , manages to be simultaneously melodramatic and predictable , implausible and formulaic the novel is told in three parts , each narrated by a different person a freelance copy editor named nina who has led a reclusive existence since her husband s death in a car accident many years ago nina s mother , a serious alcoholic , bitter over her unhappy marriage and nina s brother , andrew , a compulsive womanizer who is constantly rationalizing his behavior though the three overlapping narratives are supposed to show us how subjective memory can be while giving us different angles on nina and andrew s childhood , they actually do little but show us how dysfunctional the family is and how selfabsorbed each of the three is as an individual the doctor s house reads like a long , stultifying list of cruelty , neglect , manipulation , denial , resentment and psychological damage nina feels like a phony distillation of the author s early alienated characters she is detached , anomic and practiced in the arts of withholding and withdrawal she not only resists any further romantic involvements in her life , but also holds friends and relatives at arm s length as she observes in one of her interminable statements of the obvious , the person i found inside me was a person intent upon hiding out nina s mother is similarly reclusive and selfpitying , and given to drinking heavily as well from her longwinded monologue , she emerges not as a vivid individual but as a collection of clich s a 50 s housewife who grew up believing that marriage and motherhood were the culmination of a girl s dreams but who discovered that her own marriage was a sham she rages against her mother for pushing her into a marriage with a successful doctor who turned out to be both a willful philanderer and an angry megalomaniac , and she rages against nina for being a selfish , judgmental daughter as for nina s brother , andrew , he is a cad of the very first order dumping girlfriends when they become pregnant and luring women away from their husbands or boyfriends , only to leave them when they make a commitment as a teenager , he once persuaded two young women to shed their clothes and simulate playboy poses , then persuaded nina to photograph their antics as a grownup , he continues to try to cast nina in the role of voyeur , regaling her with stories about his crazykinkyorotherwiseimpossible girlfriends his latest gambit consists of looking up women he knew in high school and playing them off against one another the cause of all of andrew and nina s problems , ms beattie bluntly tells us , is their father an ogre of a man who referred to himself in the third person as the doctor and who treated his family with cruelty and contempt we 're told that he mocked his daughter and questioned his son s masculinity he cheated on his wife with a succession of women , including the mothers of his children s classmates and he routinely tormented his offspring , often waking them up in the middle of the night to deliver a paranoid tirade by making nina and andrew s father such a monster , ms beattie seems to want to serve up an allencompassing explanation for the problems they 've suffered as adults unfortunately , her insights into her characters have all the subtlety of a wrecking ball her portraits of andrew and nina are thoroughly lacking in sympathy , despite the horrors they have suffered at the hands of their father , and their father in turn is such a comicstrip villain that it s hard to think of him as a fleshandblood human being to make matters worse , ms beattie has eschewed most of her trademark gifts as a writer in this novel , there are no keenly observed bits of dialogue , no telling social details , no palpable sense of the daytoday world her characters inhabit instead , there is a lot of therapeutic analysis in my experience , andrew observes , if you do n't face down your aggressor immediately , others will take up where the first person left off and fuzzy generalizations about how family hurts are handed down generation to generation all in all , it makes for a flimsy , unconvincing novel peopled by whiny , repellent stereotypes , speaking in psychobabble and clich s photo ann beattie \(

following are excerpts from the decision by justice charles j tejada of state supreme court in manhattan vacating the convictions in the attack on the central park jogger first , with respect to whether the newly discovered evidence is merely impeaching of or contradictory to the former evidence , this court finds that although the defendants made incriminating statements linking them to the crime scene , as established in the parties' papers , none of the defendants admitted raping the jogger thus , matias reyes s confession cannot be viewed as contradictory additionally , reyes s confession cannot be considered cumulative either , since the accounts given by the defendants differ on significant details the newly discovered evidence in this case not only consists of statements made by reyes but of reyes s dna , which matched the dna found on a sock at the central park crime scene and the dna on the cervical swab taken from the victim this evidence is certainly newly discovered in the traditional sense , since it was not available at trial and could not have been discovered with due diligence moreover , it cannot be said that this evidence would be merely contradictory of the evidence already in the case since there was no dna forensic evidence presented against the defendants at trial given the facts as conceded by the people and found by the court , it is virtually self evident that the newly discovered evidence , specifically , the confession of a selfadmitted murderer and serial rapist , corroborated by physical evidence including scientific testing establishing that he was the sole source of dna evidence connected to the central park jogger s rape to a factor of 1 to 6 , 000 , 000 , 000 , would create the probability that had such evidence been received at trial , the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendants given the imperfection of the evidence before the jury , it is clear that the defendants' statements played a crucial role in the jury s verdict as to all convictions they laid the foundation for a course of action developed , followed , and relied on for the prosecution and conviction of the defendants that course was based on a theory that the defendants were involved as a group in a crime rampage , which included rape , robbery and other crimes that theory also incorporated a logical guilt by association to the crimes against the central park jogger inference although this theory cannot be said to have been unreasonable in 1990 , given the evidence at the time of the trials , this court finds that the newly discovered evidence is so intertwined with all the crimes charged against the defendants and that it would so weaken the reliability of the confessions , that the newly discovered evidence would create a probability that had such evidence been received at trial , the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendants based on the foregoing , this court concludes that if the statement and the forensic evidence , related to matias reyes , were available at the time of trial , there exists a reasonable probability that the verdicts in the defendants' trials would have been more favorable to the defendants
washington , dec 24 there was no marc rich there was no caspar w weinberger there were no big campaign contributors or old presidential pals instead , the seven men granted pardons by president bush on monday could all be characterized as small fry , at least in terms of the crimes they committed and their public visibility one had stolen 1090 out of the mail another had been caught making moonshine a third had turned back the odometer on a car in choosing them out of the thousands of people who have applied for clemency in recent years , the president seemed to be sending a clear signal that he will use his pardoning power sparingly to avert the kinds of political firestorms set off at the end of their terms by his two immediate predecessors , bill clinton and mr bush s father it was a decade ago today that the first president bush , then a lame duck after having been defeated by mr clinton , pardoned six former reagan administration officials who had been implicated in the irancontra scandal they included mr weinberger , the former defense secretary , who had been scheduled to go on trial two weeks later on charges that he lied to congress it has been nearly two years since mr clinton , in his final hours in office , pardoned mr rich , a fugitive commodities trader whose former wife , denise , was a friend of mr clinton s and a contributor to his presidential library those endofterm decisions focused considerable attention on whether there were enough safeguards against abuse of the presidential power to pardon federal crimes but some lawyers say there is an equally compelling risk that the current president and his successors will be so fearful of setting off another political backlash that they will shy from using a power expressly granted by the constitution the framers were aware that it was a political action , said daniel t kobil , a law professor at capital university law school in columbus , ohio , who has studied pardons what s different now is that although it s a political power , we 're seeing that public officials are so frightened or politically opportunistic that they are unwilling to wield it at all they do n't want to issue anything that could smack of controversy and come back to haunt them george washington was the first president to use the power , granting full pardons in 1795 to the distillers who had fomented the whiskey rebellion thomas jefferson pardoned people convicted under the alien and sedition acts , which he opposed presidents have varied widely in the use of their ability to issue pardons and commute sentences franklin d roosevelt used his clemency powers more than 3 , 600 times during his four terms the current president s father did so only 77 times in his single term , according to a list on the web site of the university of pittsburgh s law school mr clinton took 456 clemency actions , including the 140 pardons he issued as he left the white house the current president had taken none in nearly two years until the seven announced on monday the white house s only comment on mr bush s choices has been to say that the seven men were chosen because they had completed their sentences and gone on to live exemplary lives the pardon program is administered by the justice department , which takes applications , studies them and makes recommendations to the white house the president can also issue pardons that do not come to him through the formal process , as mr clinton did in the case of mr rich over the years it has become increasingly common for presidents to issue pardons just before christmas , though there is no constraint on the timing some lawyers involved in the issue said there had long been reluctance on the part of the justice department , with its prosecutorial ethos , to view the presidential clemency program as a priority but they said the current administration appeared particularly unwilling to use the power because of political sensitivity it s curious that with this president s willingness to stretch all his other powers to the max , this is one power he really wants to shrivel up , said margaret colgate love , a pardon lawyer in the justice department in the clinton and first bush administrations mr bush s reluctance to use executive pardon powers goes back to his time as governor of texas in 1995 , he pardoned a man with an eightyearold conviction on his record for marijuana possession so the man could work as a constable a few months later , the man was arrested for stealing cocaine from a police station , exposing mr bush firsthand to the political embarrassment of a pardon gone awry photo olgen williams was among seven people president bush pardoned \( mike fender the indianapolis star \)
to the editor re the 20 percent solution \( editorial , jan 3 \) i share mayor michael r bloomberg s commitment to closing new york city s budget gap , but i take issue with your assertion that borough hall staffs are patronageladen and are fertile ground for cost savings i require sufficient staff to carry out my city charter responsibilities , including landuse review , capital budget allocations , strategic planning and the functions of the borough engineer and the city employee pension fund even before october , when all borough presidents absorbed a mandatory 15 percent spending cut , brooklyn borough hall had several unfilled vacancies and was operating on reduced staff an agency with hundreds of workers might be able to absorb a further 20 percent cut a small office like mine would have to cut deeply into core functions as for patronage jobs , there are none marty markowitz borough president brooklyn , jan 3 , 2002
london vumile nomanyama was understandably alarmed that his firstever appearance onstage should be in the role of god he was told to practice by standing in front of a mirror and repeating i am god until it became second nature and by opening night , he felt ready he moved to the front of the stage , his muscular chest bare , an african cloth wrapped around his waist , and introduced himself in a confident and clear voice i am god several members of the audience immediately rose from their seats and walked out of the theater six years after the end of apartheid , the idea of a black god still upset some white south africans yet others saw cause for celebration in the multiracial production of yiimimangaliso the mysteries , a songanddance adaptation of the biblical stories as told in medieval england by the chester mystery plays the production , presented at the spier summer festival in stellenbosch near cape town in late 2000 , showed that onstage if not yet throughout society black , white and colored , or mixedrace , south africans could work together on an equal footing it was also evidence of the wealth of artistic talent that had long been suppressed by apartheid still , if in south africa the show was initially viewed as a sociopolitical phenomenon , in london it became an artistic happening last summer , when the londonbased broomhill opera company brought the mysteries as well as its version of bizet s carmen for a onemonth run at wilton s music hall in the east end , both the public and the critics here responded enthusiastically writing in the guardian after seeing the mysteries , michael billington noted played in rep with the same company s 'carmen , ' this is an event that makes london theater an infinitely brighter , better place and quite simply raises the spirits in the independent , mark pappenheim praised the company s lively carmen , but added 'the mysteries' is , if anything , even better now , after adding a radical adaptation of the beggar s opera by john gay to its repertory , the company is again on the road since february , it has performed the mysteries to full houses in london s west end this month , it takes the mysteries and carmen to the united states for the first time , presenting each show four times at the spoleto festival in charleston , sc , between may 24 and june 2 at the international festival of arts and ideas in new haven , carmen will be performed twice and the mysteries three times between june 13 and 16 the beggar s opera will be presented at wilton s music hall in london in september , before it and the mysteries alternate at the old vic through christmas a limited run on broadway next season looks likely so how explain the remarkable success of what , after all , was conceived as an experiment in crossing the racial barriers still dividing south african culture \? one factor is certainly the sheer exuberance of rookie performers another is the humor , comprehensible without supertitles , even when actors switch between english , afrikaans , zulu and xhosa then there is inventiveness \( a bale of hay for jesus s manger \) and a touch of politics \( a white cain kills a black abel \) but none of this would matter if the singing voices both individually and in a cappella choruses were not good and it is here that the company can rightly claim to have discovered talent i think i have a gift that i never realized that i had , said mr nomanyama , the tenor who plays and sings the roles of jesus as well as god in the mysteries i want to become an opera singer i want to go fully into opera it was always my dream now i have the opportunity the story behind the mysteries , though , is at the very least unlikely dick enthoven , an expatriate businessman who returned to south africa in the mid1990 s , bought the spier wine estate outside of stellenbosch , where he built an openair theater and organized an annual summer season of shows , concerts and opera his audience was mainly white meanwhile , in england , mark dornfordmay , the artistic director , and charles hazlewood , the music director , founded broomhill opera in a stately home in kent their audience was middle class but after three seasons , they moved to the workingclass london district of tower hamlets near the tower of london and set about restoring the dilapidated mid19thcentury wilton s music hall one day , a couple of years ago , dick enthoven called me up and invited me to become director of the spier festival , recalled mr dornfordmay , whose experience of south africa was limited to running a weeklong theater workshop with mr hazlewood in a township near durban in 1997 i said , 'it s not my bag' he asked me what i 'd like to do i said , 'an ensemble company , workshops , something genuinely south african' dick said fine , and that was it the two englishmen set off for south africa in search of talent they first organized auditions in traditional theaters and cultural centers in major cities , but soon realized that they were on the wrong track
trenton , june 3 the primary race of no big names and few big issues ends tuesday , when republican voters go to the polls to choose their candidate to face united states senator robert g torricelli in the fall for the state s republican party , which lost control of the governor s seat and the legislature last year , the fight seems to have come down to a battle between douglas forrester s money and party backing and state senator diane allen s appeal to women and her strong base in south jersey the third candidate on the ballot , state senator john mathuessen , has trailed badly in fundraising , but is hoping to appeal to conservatives , who are traditionally the most likely of the state s 882 , 162 registered republicans to turn out in primary elections the fact that none of new jersey s republican heavyweights dared to take on mr torricelli , a tireless fundraiser and bareknuckle campaigner , robbed the republican primary of much of its potential interest early on , party leaders said i do n't think there s been a whole lot of interest in the campaign beyond the people who are really attuned to politics , said robert d prunetti , the mercer county executive , who is supporting mr forrester but it may have picked up a little in the last few days the absence of sharply negative campaigning and of the kinds of deep ideological divides that hurt the republicans in past primaries has been a blessing , said dale florio , chairman of the somerset county republican committee the republican senate primary is the only statewide race on tuesday s ballots , but there are two important local primaries in the fifth congressional district , covering most of bergen county and parts of passaic , sussex and warren counties , five candidates assemblyman e scott garrett , state senator gerald cardinale , assemblyman david c russo , yosri abdelrahman and brian fox are fighting for the republican nomination to face the democrat , anne sumers , for the seat being vacated by representative marge roukema and in essex county , two democrats , thomas p giblin and joseph n divincenzo , are seeking the nomination for county executive to face the republican , candace straight , in the general election mr forrester has kept to a simple campaign strategy , joining his opponents in attacking mr torricelli for questions raised during the federal investigation into his fundraising while also promising to work for strengthened domestic security through tighter border controls , to protect retirement benefits and to lower taxes by reducing spending the investigation into senator torricelli s fundraising was ended without any action taken against him , but its findings have been sent to the senate ethics committee despite mr torricelli s assurances that the issue would be quickly dealt with , the committee has kept it hanging over his head as the general election campaign gets under way senator allen , confident that south jersey residents who know about her or who have voted for her before will turn out on tuesday , hopes that a small turnout elsewhere can blunt mr forrester s strength with party leaders in the north mr forrester has begun to spend some of the 31 million of his own money he has poured into his campaign for getoutthevote drives in bergen , monmouth , essex , union , warren and ocean counties we 're feeling very good about it all , mr forrester , a wealthy businessman who began the race relatively unknown , said at his headquarters near trenton on friday the most recent public poll on the race , conducted by fairleigh dickinson university and released on may 22 , showed that mr forrester s heavy spending on advertising won him slightly greater name recognition among respondents than ms allen , despite her long career as a television news anchor in philadelphia , which was the springboard of her career as a state senator from burlington and camden counties ms allen generally offered a wider range of policy positions , and has won the endorsements of all of the major newspapers widely circulated in new jersey , including the starledger , of newark the record , of bergen county the philadelphia inquirer the courierpost , of camden county and the new york times although the campaign has been generally free from rancor , ms allen has recently turned her monthslong criticism of mr forrester s refusal to release his income tax records into a cudgel she recently mailed a flier likening mr forrester s stand on this issue to mr torricelli s fundraising problems , ending with the phrase , new jersey already has one bob torricelli can we risk another \? mr forrester s supporters have accused her of being negative , but brian donahue , the senator s campaign director , defended the flier we 're talking about his record , and that s fair game , he said the fairleigh dickinson poll also had good news for ms allen , supporting her contention that she is better positioned to take on mr torricelli although mr torricelli easily defeats all three republicans in the matchup , the poll showed senator allen getting 35 percent to mr torricelli s 48 , while mr forrester and senator matheussen each got only 30 percent the poll , of 746 registered voters , was taken by telephone on may 15 to may 20 the margin of sampling error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 35 percentage points , so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant mr forrester called the hypothetical match up fiction senator matheussen s one wild card is his endorsement by new jersey right to life , a 125 , 000member antiabortion group that has set up phone banks and sent its members postcards urging a vote for him
accountants in the auditing group at arthur andersen s denver office have reached a tentative agreement to join the rival kpmg , according to an email message a partner of the firm sent to clients early yesterday morning according to the message sent out by the partner , jeffrey s finnin , the denver audit group has signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with kpmg in the message , mr finnin encouraged clients to follow the auditors to the new firm spokesmen for both kpmg and andersen declined to comment on either the agreement between the firms or the email message describing it mr finnin did not return calls seeking comment lawyers for andersen and for the justice department continued to make progress toward an agreement settling the government s criminal charge against the firm for destroying documents related to its audit of enron a final agreement is expected within days , people involved in the case said the defection of auditors in offices in the united states could be a critical problem for andersen , which needs to hold onto enough accountants to survive a commitment by employees and especially by partners to stand by the firm is also a condition for a takeover of andersen management by a new board headed by paul a volcker , the former federal reserve chairman mr volcker now leads an oversight panel charged with overhauling andersen and restoring credibility badly eroded by the firm s audits for enron this is potentially very significant , said roman l weil , who teaches accounting at the graduate school of business of the university of chicago if the denver auditors can leave andersen , then people in other offices may follow , he said so far partners have been held back by provisions in andersen s partnership agreement that prohibit them from leaving the firm and taking clients with them , professor weil said maybe they have voted to let these guys go without a penalty but that would be unlikely , he said , because even though the andersen accountants who work for specific companies can move to another firm and continue serving the same clients , senior partners with expertise in accounting issues within certain industries are less mobile the guys who are the experts on the energy industry , the retail industry , the airline industry , they say , 'my god , no , we 've got to stay together or else i have n't got a job , ' he said indeed , an executive at one of the firms involved said that some of the andersen partners in denver may have jumped the gun by notifying clients already , before a deal with kpmg is completed none of these things happen overnight , the executive said , adding that groups of andersen auditors in other offices were also exploring possible transactions andersen continued efforts to negotiate a deal for the sale of its prized tax practice yesterday , people close to those talks said potential buyers include the buyout firm fox paine in the san francisco bay area and two other big five accounting firms , deloitte touche and ernst young of course , these deals confront the same problems the denver office faces in trying to join kpmg no buyer wants to take on andersen s exposure to lawsuits resulting from its involvement in enron s collapse that litigation overhang already undermined an attempted transaction with deloitte earlier this year lawyers involved in negotiations on another front , to settle securities classaction lawsuits brought by enron shareholders and creditors against andersen , were en route to new york yesterday to continue the negotiations those talks have led to a consensus on how much andersen could pay about 300 million , with some 250 million coming from insurance coverage but lawyers continue to struggle with preserving claims against parties other than andersen if a settlement is improperly put together , it could effectively preclude plaintiffs from recovering as much money as they might seek from investment banks or other potential defendants , one person involved in negotiations said defections by andersen affiliates overseas yesterday continued to highlight the importance of resolving the various challenges confronting andersen as soon as possible andersen s canadian partnership announced plans yesterday to join deloitte , while affiliates in argentina and in the baltics said they would join ernst young

a thread across the ocean the heroic story of the transatlantic cable by john steele gordon illustrated 240 pp new york walker company 26 this is an oddly delightful and unsettling book the delight is odd because it is evoked by calamity , misfortune , error and failure the unsettling part is odd because it emerges from success a thread across the ocean is about an achievement that seems archaic in these internet days the laying of the first telegraph cables between europe and north america , completed in 1866 but it s still apt we have become so accustomed to the technology that supports our lives that we 've forgotten how difficult that structure was to build this book reminds us , excruciatingly , agonizingly , unforgettably the hero of a thread across the ocean is cyrus field , who made a fortune in the paper and print business by his early 30 s and then found a bigger challenge field s determination was unbelievable , his perseverance magnificent here was a man who , though prone to seasickness , embarked on dozens of transatlantic voyages to promote his idea a man who believed in technology , was betrayed by it , but persisted the challenges that faced field and his partners , who included samuel morse and the physicist william thomson who became famous as lord kelvin were huge telegraph wires were zipping out across the surface of the world , but they did n't have to be more than 2 , 000 continuous miles long , sunk up to more than two miles and laid in place by steamaugmented sailing ships , none of which could carry that much cable no one had a good idea how to accomplish the job , including field , who was simply excited about the notion it was , john steele gordon writes , a bit as if someone in the 1950 s , reading of the success of the russian sputnik , had decided to organize a manned expedition to mars it s good the analogy stops there , or field would have launched dozens of enthusiastic wouldbe astronauts into oblivion gordon s clean prose spares no gory detail the disasters hit with such frequency and magnitude that they induce awe and eventually a kind of horrormovie thrill here comes the chain saw again ! giving away the details would spoil the story it s enough to say that they include vast coils of cable disappearing into the sea brief moments of distraction that cost what today would be millions of dollars storms that , if not perfect , were flawlessly timed to induce chaos foolish adherence to old ideas absurd failures of human communications and repeated proof that arrogance is a sign of stupidity often , work would start off with a celebration during which politicians would gush over what was about to be achieved does it seem , i say , all but a miracle of art , edward everett said , that the thoughts of living men should clothe themselves with elemental sparks , and shoot with fiery speed through the oozy dungeons of the rayless deep \? this sort of thing would be followed by complete failure one new york celebration did n't even wait for the project itself to go bad fireworks set city hall on fire the worst moment was a day in 1858 , after an entire cable had finally been laid between ireland and newfoundland and had actually carried messages , leading to wild acclaim then , in the middle of a message , the new cable fizzled out , probably cooked when one of the team s electrical engineers tried to blast too much electricity through it the acclaim turned to mockery gordon , who writes a column on business for american heritage magazine , explains the technology behind all this with relish and clarity even his footnotes are full of charming morsels his note on the semihard characteristics of the rubberlike substance guttapercha used to coat the cable observes that its slight denting when used for golf balls led to the discovery that dimpled balls flew better than smooth ones more germane , his description of an inquiry into the 1858 failure evokes the murky state of science at the time among other shortcomings , gordon writes , there were no agreedupon terms for the measurement of electricity , which was the foundation of the whole enterprise in a way , the project s problems were also characteristic of the experimental nature of science and technology at that time , when so much was imperfectly understood for us , field s disasters are as much fun as the ludicrous flying machines in the smithsonian s classic imax film to fly we enjoy them because we know that eventually everything comes out all right but does it \? gordon indulges in his one bit of philosophy after this triumph , citing adam smith s invisible hand of progress at work in field s singleminded drive but in another way field s passion is less comforting than that this is fundamentally a story about the fierce human drive to make tools the atlantic cable was made possible not just by field s persistence but also by dozens of equally compelled toolmakers among them was isambard kingdom brunel , who labored unto death to build the grandest ship of the century , the great eastern , which eventually laid the final cable across the atlantic a thread across the ocean also shows how our longing for new tools is often invested with expectations that go far beyond the capacity of the inventions themselves here , sadly , we see the same kind of hopes that the internet seemed to offer us so recently hopes so recently dashed if cables connected the world , one editorialist wrote in 1857 , they would make the great heart of humanity beat with a single pulse wars are to cease , another wrote the kingdom of peace will be set up but the kingdom of peace still eludes us expectations like these have given us the mistaken impression that technology has failed us , when technology has given more than we asked , and we , in a sense , have failed to live up to our tools i suspect i know what gordon would say about that pessimism in a recent column on the enron debacle , he wrote , just as every cloud has a silver lining , so disasters always have a redeeming feature a thread across the ocean celebrates this indefatigable spirit , and there s nothing wrong with that everything never comes out all right , but as cyrus field knew , in spite of the most hopeless circumstances , some things do that s what keeps us going
islamabad , pakistan , feb 28 at least four radical islamic groups , including one believed responsible for the killing of an american journalist , appear to have formed an alliance to mount attacks and resist a government ban against them , pakistani officials said today they said an attack by masked men on a police bus today in karachi , in which one officer was killed , was apparently a failed attempt by members of the alliance to free some 20 comrades who were being returned to jail from court and had been arrested as part of a widening government crackdown pakistani officials said they believed , based on hard information , that additional attacks were being planned by the group responsible for the kidnapping and killing of the journalist daniel pearl the main suspect in the killing , ahmed omar sheikh , was a leader of the army of muhammad , or jaishemuhammad , one of the four groups that the officials said are now believed to have joined forces in another sign of rising confrontation with the militants , the police in karachi today moved mr sheikh to a secure location after a telephone threat of a rocket attack on his jail if pakistan agreed to hand him over to the united states at least three senior law enforcement officials in karachi who have been leading the investigation into the killing of mr pearl have received death threats and are being provided with additional security , pakistani officials said a recent tide of violence and word of the alliance points to the continuing pressures facing president pervez musharraf , who over the last six months has led pakistan on a precarious course of cooperation with the united states and has pledged to strip his country of militants militant islamic groups in pakistan have provided support to one another in the past , but an alliance that could include coordinated attacks would pose a new level of challenge to pakistani authorities , who have been trying to head off a drift toward lawlessness along with jaishemuhammad , the groups believed by pakistani intelligence officials to have formed the alliance are sipahesahaba , harkat ulmujahedeen , and lashkarejhangvi , all banned by president musharraf as part of his promised crackdown the pakistani police today arrested dozens of activists from the banned groups , all of which are listed by the united states as terrorist organizations officials said those picked up were on a new list of about 90 militants to be arrested , on top of some 2 , 000 arrested in the initial phase of the crackdown , which began after the jan 12 speech by general musharraf pledging an allout antiterrorist campaign at the same time today , pakistan released from custody qazi hussain ahmed , the leader of jamaateislami , a religiousbased political party active in demonstrations against the americanled and pakistanibacked war in afghanistan that organization has not been banned , and the freeing of mr ahmed , which had previously been signaled by the pakistani authorities , suggests a willingness to seek accords with islamic political groups even while cracking down hard on the militants but the response from militants appears to be bringing lawlessness closer , the freshest sign of which came with the ambush today of the police bus , which also left a prisoner dead , and five police officers , three prisoners and a bystander wounded , the police in karachi said none of the prisoners were freed , but the attackers escaped unharmed , the police said the ambush came a week after the murder of mr pearl was confirmed with the release of a gruesome videotape , and just days after 12 worshipers were killed by assailants wielding automatic weapons who stormed a shiite mosque in the city of rawalpindi , the headquarters for pakistan s army late wednesday , the united states announced a 5 million reward for information leading to the conviction of mr pearl s killers as word of the reward circulated , pakistani officials said they hoped it might give a boost to their hunt for accomplices of mr sheikh , the britishborn militant now in pakistani custody they said that new information , which they would not disclose , had raised concern that at least some of mr sheikh s accomplices might be planning new attacks in a telephone interview today , a spokesman for one of the banned groups denied that the organization had been involved in the recent incidents and said that the government was using the mosque attack in particular as a pretext for a new and sweeping roundup the government has launched a campaign against us , the religious parties , mujeeb urrehman of sipahesahaba said they are using the incident to go ahead with their agenda the pakistani officials who described intelligence officers' concerns about an alliance among the banned groups declined to provide evidence to support the view , saying that publication of such details could compromise the investigation in the past , some western diplomats have suggested that pakistan might have an incentive to magnify the scope of the threat it is facing to win wider appreciation for its successes , but others have said they have no doubt that general musharraf faces a big internal challenge general musharraf has agreed in principle to the american requests to hand over mr sheikh , but has suggested the transfer not take place until pakistan completes its own investigations and works out other unspecified legal arrangements in its first official comment on the possible handover , a spokesman for pakistan s foreign ministry sought to downplay the possibility that a handover might happen any time soon omar sheikh is under investigation and currently in police custody , said the spokesman , aziz ahmed khan we have to first complete our own investigations another senior pakistani official acknowledged that the government was concerned that a swift handover of mr sheikh to american authorities could ignite an even wider backlash among militant groups but he said the primary reason for delay was the hope that further questioning of mr sheikh might help in tracking down his confederates mr khan , at a briefing for reporters , acknowledged that the united states had been asking pakistan to arrest mr sheikh since november months before mr pearl s abduction when he was secretly indicted by a united states grand jury in connection with a 1994 kidnapping in india american officials have said that that request was essentially ignored , though mr khan suggested today that the reason was not a lack of pakistani will i think the gentleman was in hiding , mr khan said , offering his government s first public explanation for the lack of pakistani action among the incidents that have raised concern over a mounting confrontation with the militants was a shooting on tuesday night at a pakistani air base that killed six airmen in circumstances that have yet to be explained the pakistani authorities have suggested that the cause may have been a dispute over a board game , but they have also said the incident is under investigation the four groups said by pakistani officials to have joined in the alliance have varying backgrounds lashkarejhangvi , which has been primarily involved in sectarian attacks within pakistan , was banned last august it is a more radical offshoot of sipahesahaba , another primarily sectarian sunni muslim group , which was banned in january by contrast , harkat ulmujahedeen , which was banned last september , has made its primary focus the conflict in the disputed region of kashmir , as has jaishemuhammad , which was banned in january photos pakistani officers , above , took a prisoner to a hospital yesterday after he was wounded in an ambush of a police bus in karachi

seoul , south korea , june 25 fireworks boomed again in the night sky , and the south korean players took their customary postgame bows , but this time there was nothing to celebrate a wonderful dream came to an end tonight the chanted appreciation from 65 , 256 fans came in salute for a month well done , not a match well played germany was clearly the better team , defeating south korea , 10 , to advance to the world cup final for the seventh time the germans will seek their fourth world championship sunday against either brazil or turkey south korea had longed to play in that match in yokohama , japan , with all the implications of hoisting a trophy in the land of its former colonial ruler , but it will have to settle for the consolation of third or fourth place on saturday i was pretty sure and convinced we would win this game , even early on , germany coach rudi v ller said disappointment for south korea came suddenly and painfully after weeks of building expectation such a high finish seemed nearly unimaginable a month ago the national team had not won a match in five previous appearances in the world cup yet it won repeatedly and surprisingly here , defeating four european teams and galvanizing an entire country an estimated seven million people gathered in plazas around the nation to watch the match on giant television screens once hesitant to yearn for victory , fearing all but certain defeat , fans seemed sure this time that south korea would prevail , but confidence could not trump germany s experience and resolve in the 75th minute , midfielder bernd schneider stole a ball in midfield and forward oliver neuville dribbled furiously down the right flank , sending a low crossing pass into the penalty area michael ballack knew exactly what to do with it he had scored the only goal in a 10 victory against the united states in the quarterfinals , and he completed his one chance tonight with dexterity opening his right foot , ballack fired a shot that was stopped by a diving lee woon jae , the south korean goalkeeper on saturday , lee had been the hero of a penaltykick shootout against spain tonight , sprawled on the ground , he could not recover quickly enough , and ballack punched in the rebound with his left foot it will be germany s great misfortune not to have ballack , a midfielder who plays for bayer leverkusen , in the final sunday ballack drew his second yellow card of the knockout phase in the 71st minute on a tactical foul committed during a south korean break he stopped the threat , taking down forward lee chun soo , but the foul left him ineligible to play sunday his first yellow card came , perhaps undeservedly , in added time of a secondround match against paraguay , when he was punched by roberto acu a in a midfield scuffle ballack s reliability in crucial moments is now unavailable my first thought is bitterness , ballack said my dream had been to play in the final now it s not meant to be but the team accomplished quite a feat we can be proud of ourselves prior to the world cup , few people would have put money on us going to the final it s nice to prove them wrong we were realistic enough to believe we would not get this far , yet we 've done it germany bombed out in the first round of the 2000 european championship , lost a 51 home match to england in world cup qualifying and entered this championship with three key players sidelined by injury the creative midfielders sebastian deisler and mehmet scholl , and central defender jens nowotny this world cup team is considered the weakest that germany , a threetime champion , has fielded in a number of years yet , under v ller , it has remained disciplined and patient , if seldom spectacular , lobbing the ball into the box and counting on its size and strength to finish chances tonight s game began to turn inexorably in germany s favor with a flurry of free kicks and corner kicks late in the first half none produced a goal , but the germans seemed more determined than their opponents south korea was playing out a fantasy germany is one of the world s soccer powers victory is a relentless expectation , not a delirious wish while south korea had a nation s rabid support , it could not match germany s skill and conviction a world cup that had been engaging for its unpredictability is reverting to form perhaps south korea wore down after weeks of running its most imposing strength may have become its greatest vulnerability scoring had become a greater burden with each match for the second consecutive game , south korea could not manage a goal south korea coach guus hiddink said his players seemed too respectful of the germans in the first half south korea s quickness and creativity were neutralized by a german decision to play four defenders in a compact alignment in the first 64 smothering minutes , south korea managed only two shots on goal the only time that the german goalkeeper oliver kahn was challenged tonight , in the eighth minute , he dived to his right and expertly punched away a shot by lee , the industrious forward kahn has allowed one goal in six matches , the last three of which germany has won by 10 in added time , park ji sung of south korea misfired as the german defender thomas linke slid unnervingly toward him in the penalty area we could n't make the final , ultimate pass , hiddink said nor will south korea be able to savor the final , ultimate victory but it has brought immense pride and unity to the country , and it has showed off its spirit to a worldwide audience no team from asia has achieved this much in the world cup as the south korean players bowed and waved in defeat , the redshirted fans by the tens of thousands applauded loudly and chanted their familiar refrain , daehan , minguk , republic of korea korea , until now , was not well known in the world , said hwang mee jung , a marketing expert who attended the match now we showed what kind of people we are we made asia proud in the past , we were a reserved people , but we showed our emotions we are proud of being koreans i think we should celebrate this game photos michael ballack scored the game s only goal , in the 75th minute , beating goalkeeeper lee woon jae to send germany to its seventh world cup final \( associated press \) \( pg d1 \) oliver kahn of germany recorded

the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york and the fbi said yesterday that they had become involved in the investigation of winning bets worth 3 million on the breeders' cup pick six last month federal investigators have already frozen the personal bank account of glen dasilva of new york , one of the three men being investigated dasilva placed winning bets at two other racetracks early last month that were configured similarly to the disputed breeders' cup tickets investigators have said the bets may have been a dry run for the breeders' cup until autotote shows that somebody tampered with these bets and a crime was committed , what we have is a situation occurring with long odds , said edward hayes , a lawyer for dasilva but all these esoteric bets have long odds and that s why people play them the investigation was initially handled by the new york state racing and wagering board , but it does not have the authority to prosecute the board said last week that it had asked for help from the new york state police , which is now being assisted by the federal bureau of investigation and the united states attorney s office mike saltz , a spokesman for the baltimore field office of the fbi , said its satellite office in dover , del , was aiding the investigation two of the men being investigated live in baltimore and newark , del also yesterday , the national thoroughbred racing association announced that it had asked for changes in the way bets involving multiple races were processed and how suspicious wagers would be dealt with the investigation began shortly after the oct 26 breeders' cup , when it was discovered that the only six winning tickets on the pick six were purchased by one person , derrick davis of baltimore , through a telephone account at catskill offtrack betting in upstate new york davis s bets were so unusual in their structure they picked one horse in each of the first four races and the entire field in each of the final two races that they raised racing officials' suspicions officials are investigating whether the computer system that handled the wagers was manipulated so that a bet made before the races in question had been run was later changed to reflect which horses had won investigators have also been focusing on chris harn of newark , del , who was fired last week from his job with autotote , the company that processed the wagers , and dasilva all three men were members of a fraternity at drexel university in philadelphia payouts have not been made on the breeders' cup bets lawyers for harn and davis have maintained their innocence none of the three men have been charged the changes announced yesterday dealing with wagering security issues were the strongest yet from the national thoroughbred racing association since the pick six investigation began within 21 days of yesterday s announcement , the tote companies must have in place the necessary software to transmit betting information immediately after the bet in question has closed currently , fearing a computer overload , the tote companies do not transmit full information on some multiplerace wagers until after several races in the bet have been run officials are investigating whether harn , a computer programmer , altered davis s pick six bet after four of the races had been run because the information concerning the numbers of the horses on the tickets had yet to be sent to arlington park , where the breeders' cup was run tim smith , commissioner of the national thoroughbred racing association , said the three major united states tote companies autotote , amtote international inc and united tote company had agreed to the new standards the association is expecting member racetracks to no longer do business with account wagering outlets that do not have the equipment to record wagers made with interactive voice response systems , which allow a customer to make bets by hitting touchtone keys on the phone catskill otb did not have the mechanism , which records the actual touchtones in case of later disputes , making it more difficult for investigators to determine the exact bets when they were placed the association is also asking racing organizations to look at winning bets involving multiple races any wagers found to be irregular will be subject to further review by the tracks involved , and the tote company that processed the bet will be asked to provide further information supporting the wagers' legitimacy the new york racing association , churchill downs inc and magna entertainment , the nation s three largest racetrack owners , said in a joint announcement that they approved of the measures the national thoroughbred racing association did not make any proposals about odds fluctuations after a race has started , a source of contention to many fans the odds sometimes change drastically from the time a race begins until the payoffs are posted , raising suspicions that some bets were made after a race had begun racing officials say posted odds can change well into a race because it takes time to process bets coming in from offtrack locations some critics have suggested that races should be delayed until all bets are processed smith said that issue was still on the table

mount hood , ore , may 31 at midmorning , with the perennial snow on the volcano of mount hood softening underfoot in the sun s glare , janet quackenbush looked up toward the summit and saw the chain reaction a party of four slipped just short of a pass called the pearly gates , picked up speed , knocked down two other groups , and were soon swallowed by the big blue opening in the mountain s glacial ice the accident killed three , most likely on impact , and then led to another accident , as an air reserve rescue helicopter went down , tumbling and rolling a thousand feet , though all crew members survived , including one who was crushed beneath the chopper but as haunted as ms quackenbush was by witnessing the latest in a string of alpine accidents during the trafficjam season of northwest climbing , she was also upset that her own summit attempt was canceled today while rescuers tried to get the last body from the crevasse though she had never scaled a serious mountain before , she came from her home in show low , ariz , with the sole intention of climbing oregon s highest peak today the deaths , here and earlier in the week on mount rainier , where three people died after a ferocious storm on the 14 , 411foot peak , did nothing to deter her i'm very sad at what happened , but it does n't make me not want to climb , said ms quackenbush , who is 51 once you get up there , it s the view , and the rush , and the feeling of accomplishment nor are the accidents likely to deter other climbers of mounts hood and rainier , a number that has nearly doubled to about 10 , 000 annually for each mountain in the last 15 years , officials say at this time of year on the basic routes , people bunch up as they near the summits of the northwest s signature mountains the climbers who started thursday s accidents were a few hundred feet from the top when they slipped and snagged two roped parties behind them sometimes it s so crowded you can look up and just see the line like ants going up a hill , said mary ellen fitzgerald , a wilderness ranger with the forest service rescuers who today removed the last of the bodies from the icy tomb of mount hood said they had few answers to what caused the secondworst accident in the mountain s history they did say the climbers were still ascending at a time , about 9 am , when the snow is soft , and could lead to slippage , and most climbers are well on their way down no experience or special permits are required to climb mount hood , which rises nearly from sea level to 11 , 240 feet , other than a simple wilderness entry registration card the climb looks easy , and most people do it in a long day that begins at midnight , at the 6 , 000foothigh lodge , and then a trek of 36 miles to a view of a hundred miles on clear days officials credited the work of the air force reserve helicopter pilots with saving lives as the chopper began to shudder , the pilots backed it away from the rescue site , and a crew member cut a cable that had been hoisting an injured climber both actions probably kept others from dying , rescue officials said if it was n't for the heroic work of the pilots , you probably would have had a lot more casualties , said sgt nick watt of the clackamas county sheriff s office he did not know if the climbers followed the rules of alpine safety for climbing on glaciers climbers are supposed to be roped , to have crampons on their feet , and an ice ax in hand , all intended to stop a slide into a crevasse but some people never rope up , and others climb with no idea that the mountain can turn himalayan at a moment s notice , guides say hood has claimed 130 lives , and none of the deaths reveal a consistent enough pattern to prompt changes in safety requirements , forest service officials say this upper part of the mountain is a federal wilderness and what goes on up there is what we called unconfined recreation , ms fitzgerald said if we start saying what you can and ca n't do , it gets down to micromanaging people s freedom on public land the result of a century of handsoff managing is that mount hood , like rainier , ends up being somewhat of a laissezfaire zone for lovers of high altitude last week a snowboarder , juancarlos munoz , 30 , was trying to glide from the summit he was not roped , and the ridge lines were icy he fell 2 , 500 feet to his death the main investigators of thursday s accident , from the clackamas county sheriff s office , said they would try to find out the cause of the deaths , but would not investigate whether mistakes had been made or if inexperience might have been a a factor that s not something we usually do , sergeant watt said even with four deaths from two separate accidents in the last 10 days , he said there would be no larger questioning beyond routine medical examiner queries the rainier accident earlier in the week involved experienced climbers who were trying to make the summit via liberty ridge , one of the mountain s most challenging routes a snowstorm with gusts of 60 miles an hour forced them into their tents , which collapsed they dug snow caves , and later died stumbling down the mountain in whiteout conditions we leave it up to people climbing the mountain to know what they 're doing , said jeff jaqua , a forest service rescue coordinator you register to climb , then you 're on your own this is public land , and this is what the public wants the peaks attract the powerful , the glamour set , and day visitors in little more than tennis shoes former vice president al gore climbed mount rainier a few years ago , and was caught in a vicious summer storm it looks like it might be easy , he said , but it s one of the hardest things i ever did some officials have said that regulation will be necessary , at least to limit the number of people on certain routes of dangerous peaks like rainier and hood other high peaks limit climbing permits during the peak season but rangers here said that as interest in climbing has risen , so has awareness of the risks that may be one reason that the number of deaths has remained fairly steady as the number of climbers has doubled the main climbing season on mount hood begins in mid to late may and continues through midjuly may and early june can be a treacherous time in mount hood s worst accident , seven students and two faculty members from the oregon episcopal school died after a fall in may 1986 a former teacher at the same school fell off the summit in june 2000 , two people fell to their deaths in may 1999 and a climber died in an avalanche in may 1999 climbing guides like peter keane of bend , ore , said the biggest problem on mount hood was a lack of experience nowadays , he said , there are a lot of people climbing the mountain who really do n't know what they 're doing there are more people on the mountain than i 'd like to see , for sure photo participants in next week s mount hood climb to benefit breast cancer practiced recently two teams of nine each plan to climb the south side of the mountain next saturday and sunday the benefit is being held to raise money for the fred hutchinson cancer

in a report to the government , a panel of leading scientists said yesterday that polygraph testing was too flawed to use for security screening the panel said liedetector tests did a poor job of identifying spies or other nationalsecurity risks and were likely to produce accusations of innocent people the 245page report , by experts convened by the national research council , an arm of the national academy of sciences , said that the scientific basis for polygraph testing was weak and that much of the research supporting its use lacked scientific rigor recently , worries over possible atomic espionage prompted widespread use of polygraph screening at the nation s nuclear weapons laboratories , which are run by the energy department that department requested the 19month study and financed it the report is not the first to question the reliability of liedetector testing , which is known to have limitations that make its admissibility in court , for example , sharply limited but it is the first by the academy , and private security experts said its findings could erode support for polygraph testing inside the federal government defense and intelligence agencies use polygraph testing tens of thousands of times a year as part of the screening of prospective and current employees for espionage national security is too important to be left to such a blunt instrument , said stephen e fienberg , a professor of statistics and computer science at carnegie mellon university and the panel s leader the polygraph s serious limitations in employee security screening underscore the need to look more broadly for effective , alternative methods the report said lie tests , which measure pulse and breathing rates , sweating and blood pressure , had some usefulness in investigating particular crimes but were far from totally reliable but in routine security screening , the panel said , they often flag innocent people as lying , while missing actual security risks no spy has ever been caught using the polygraph , kathryn b laskey , a professor of systems engineering at george mason university and a panel member , told reporters the council is the research arm of the national academy of sciences , an organization of eminent scientists chartered by congress to advise the government on scientific matters the report is the academy s first formal assessment of polygraph testing the panel performed its evaluation by reviewing previous research on lie detector tests and by visiting centers where the tests are performed and developed white house officials said the academy report would be carefully studied it s important to note , said gordon d johndroe , spokesman for the white house office of homeland security , that polygraph examinations are one small part of a very comprehensive background investigation for people in the government s most sensitive programs steven aftergood , a security expert at the federation of american scientists , a private group in washington , said the report could be decisive in the longstanding debate over the polygraph s reliability people will still want to use it , but they will no longer be able to say experts disagree on its usefulness , he said they do n't paul gianelli , a law professor at case western reserve who studies scientific evidence , said the panel s report was sure to stir wide debate and would probably reduce polygraph use this is going to be tremendously controversial because of the institutional investments in the polygraph , professor gianelli said but he said the report would be influential because its attack on polygraph testing was so fundamental congress instructed the energy department to adopt polygraph screening in reaction to the case of wen ho lee , the scientist at the los alamos weapons laboratory in new mexico who was suspected of being a spy but freed from jail after admitting to a security violation a department official said that about 16 , 000 people in sensitive programs were singled out for polygraph testing , and that examiners tested about 2 , 000 people a year energy department laboratory workers have denounced the tests as demoralizing because of false positives and say that some scientists have quit in protest and that others have avoided taking jobs at the laboratories , potentially weakening them linton brooks , the acting administrator of the national nuclear security administration , which runs the laboratories for the energy department , said it would review the academy report and consider the findings of the study in developing a new polygraph program over the next several months congress has called on the department to take the academy s polygraph study into account in redesigning its program and to come up with a new plan in six months the academy panel , mr brooks said in a statement , identified the fundamental conflict that we in the national security community must address how to administer a program that is maximally effective in weeding out security risks while minimizing damage to the vast majority of loyal , patriotic employees there is no easy answer , but it is a question that we will examine very seriously in the coming months to detect lies , polygraphs measure physiological changes as a window into the emotional state of liars the theory is that liars' physical responses are unique but critics say all kinds of emotions hate , anxiety , depression can cause a truthful individual to fail a polygraph exam previously , the most thorough study of polygraph reliability was published in 1983 by the congressional office of technology assessment , which has since been disbanded it raised the prospect that spies may well be the most motivated and perhaps the best trained to avoid detection by developing skills at deceiving polygraphs the academy study , mr gianelli of case western reserve said , is the most important report since then , and a lot more research has been done in those 19 years the 14member academy panel illustrated the unpleasant tradeoffs in a chart showing a hypothetical population of 10 , 000 government employees that includes 10 spies if the tests were sensitive enough to detect 80 percent of the traitors , 1 , 606 employees would fail the test 8 of them spies and 1 , 598 of them loyal the unacceptable choice for the energy department , the report said , lies between too many loyal employees falsely judged deceptive and too many major security threats left undetected panel members said the goal of accurate lie detection was not impossible but that polygraph science tended to avoid innovation and rely on antiquated physiological signs we have newer measures that have not been applied marcus e raichle , a panel member from the washington university medical school , said at a news conference mr raichle cited methods like monitoring brain waves and heat changes on a person s face the panel , he added , found none of these newer methods ready for prime time
who s to blame for much of our weed problems \? possibly jethro tull , the 18thcentury farmer and writer who advocated , and developed , implements for the thorough pulverization of the soil as we gardeners go out every spring to turn over our soil we have also been churning our ground and exposing the myriad weed seeds lurking in every soil to light and air , which is just what they need to sprout years ago , i decided to try to put an end to my weed problems , and began by dispensing with tilling my soil in fact , although it may seem contrary to what many gardeners take as gospel , i now try to avoid any disruption of the natural layering that develops over time in soil i set transplants in the ground by pushing the dirt aside just enough to snuggle the roots in place spent annual flower and vegetable plants are cleared from the garden by giving their stems a sharp twist or jerk , or else by first severing the largest roots with a knife small roots are left to rot and improve the soil i even avoid disrupting the natural layering when enriching the soil rainfall and earthworms and other soil life gradually work fertilizers and organic materials into the ground after i lay them on the surface organic materials also protect the surface from pelting rain and hot summer sun , a benefit that is largely lost when these materials are dug in furthermore , fertilizers and organic materials do most good near the surface , where plant roots naturally proliferate not all weeds come from seeds within the soil they also sprout from seeds carried by wind or dropped by birds most weeds that arrive in this manner can be dealt with by covering the ground with a thin , weedfree mulch , renewed yearly or as needed the kind of mulch depends on the look i want , the plants and the soil poorer soil or more demanding plants get the most nourishing mulch compost i slather it an inch thick each fall over all my vegetable beds buckwheat hulls are adequate and attractive in flower beds paths get wood chips , straw or some other lean material free of viable weed seeds i could not , of course , just banish such words as rototill and dig from my vocabulary , throw some mulch over the ground and carry on as usual most soils need to be aerated , which tillage does however , the reason most soils need to be aerated is because they have become compacted from being driven or walked upon i avoid this problem by not walking or driving where plants grow my garden is laid out with permanent areas for plants and permanent areas for traffic planted areas in my vegetable garden consist of rectangular beds my flower gardens are more free form ground covers almost never get walked on and trees are planted in islands of mulch that also are rarely trod upon ideally , it should be possible to reach into the center of any bed especially vegetable beds , which need frequent attention for planting and harvest with feet firmly planted in a path thirtysix inches is a good width for a vegetable bed , although gardeners with longer reaches than mine could make do with 40inch wide beds flower beds can be wider , tolerating an occasional step garden paths range in width from a minimum of 18 inches for those between adjacent vegetable beds to 5 feet for a main path through the vegetable garden or a path for leisurely strolling among flower beds instead of mulch , paths could be nothing more than steppingstones among flowers , for example or even wellbehaved lawn there is little or no reason to go to the trouble of creating and maintaining raised beds except where drainage is a problem changing my watering technique was the final step i took on my road to weedless gardening not all plants need regular watering , but for those that do , i use drip irrigation drip irrigation pinpoints water right to plants , so none is wasted promoting weed growth between widely spaced plants or in paths the combination of all these techniques has brought benefits beyond fewer weeds the mulches also conserve water and keep roots cool minimal soil disturbance keeps humus levels high and maintains a network of permanent pores for draining excess water and moving capillary water around i no longer have the trouble of tilling and the delay of waiting for the soil to dry enough to till in spring and because there s no need to leave space between every row of plants for walking , more plants can be squeezed into the garden planted in beds and more vegetables and flowers reaped of course , in spite of my weedless gardening system , weeds do still appear , but weed problems do not what few weeds i find i yank out roots and all weeds with long taproots , like dandelion and burdock , may need to be coaxed out by thrusting a trowel alongside their taproot , then levering up just enough to free the root colonies of small weeds are quickly done in with a winged weeder , colinear hoe or some other hoe having a sharp blade that slides parallel to and just a fraction of an inch below the soil surface i pay special attention to the garden edges , where weeds and grasses attempt to sneak in very important in avoiding weed problems are regular weed forays young weeds not only are easiest to remove but have yet to spread by seed or creeping roots by planting in beds and not disturbing the soil , keeping the surface covered and using drip irrigation when regular watering is needed , my regular weed patrol has been pared down to a few pleasant minutes each week photos permanent paths whether through vegetables , top , or flowers mean the planting soil is n't trampled and so does n't have to be aerated \( photographs by lee reich \)
washington , dec 19 the securities and exchange commission under harvey l pitt was described today as dysfunctional by a government report examining the agency s selection of a new accounting oversight board the report found that the commissioners disagreed for weeks over the appointment process and criteria for the new board and that sec staff members never adequately communicated among themselves or with the agency s leaders the report concluded that none of the candidates were adequately examined for possible conflicts of interest , ethics or legal problems before their selection the overall process that emerged was neither consistent nor effective and changed and evolved over time , said the report by the general accounting office , an investigative arm of congress several factors contributed to the eventual breakdown of sec s selection and vetting process the report provided details and painted a bleak picture of the agency s appointment process and investigative skills it was requested by democratic lawmakers after the disclosure that william h webster had told mr pitt before his selection to be chairman of the oversight board that he had headed the audit committee of us technologies that company , an internet venture , is insolvent , has been accused by investors of fraud and is under a criminal investigation c gregory earls , the chief executive of us technologies , who recruited mr webster to the board , was charged in a criminal complaint filed today in federal court in manhattan with 10 counts of mail , wire and securities fraud the complaint said mr earls stole nearly 14 million from an investment partnership that held a significant amount of stock in us technologies a related complaint by the securities and exchange commission was also filed against mr earls a lawyer for mr earls , thomas c green , said , there are very compelling defenses that will be presented in due course the gao report portrayed an agency in chaos in one illustrative episode recounted in the report , robert k herdman , whom mr pitt assigned to supervise the selection of the oversight board , relied on his secretary to find out if the government was investigating us technologies mr herdman was the agency s chief accountant at the time in another episode that reflected the deep level of acrimony and distrust at the agency , the report said mr pitt decided not to inform any of the other commissioners of his choices for the oversight board until the morning of the vote because he was fearful of news leaks on that morning , according to the report , mr herdman learned that mr webster had dismissed the outside auditors of us technologies after the auditors complained of significant financial problems but mr herdman , a longtime friend and close adviser to mr pitt , decided that the information was not significant and did not need to be shared with the commissioners last month , mr webster , mr pitt and mr herdman announced their resignations last week , mr bush selected william h donaldson to succeed mr pitt the accounting oversight board remains steeped in budget and staff problems the commission has not named a successor to mr webster aides to republican lawmakers said that the report was a vindication of mr pitt because it found that mr herdman never told him about the details of us technologies or mr webster s role on the audit committee before he pushed the commission to approve the appointment but democratic lawmakers said that the problems the report described were symptomatic of a deeper malaise at the commission , which for years has been deeply underfinanced and short of staff it s just scandalous , said representative barney frank of massachusetts , who in january becomes the ranking democrat on the house financial services committee the place is in total shambles representative john dingell , democrat of michigan , said that the keystone kops could n't have done a better job of undermining the formation of the accounting board than the sec has done while there is plenty of blame to go around , the buck has to stop at chairman pitt s desk for failures of leadership and communication , he said mr pitt declined to respond to questions about the report his spokeswoman issued a brief statement saying that it contained useful recommendations that will help to guide this commission as it continues to fulfill its obligations in selecting board members mr herdman issued a onesentence statement saying he hoped that people will read the gao s report in its entirety so they can understand what occurred in context mr frank said that it was deplorable that although president bush recently announced his intention to seek a substantial increase in the agency s budget next year , republican leaders in congress had decided that they would not raise the budget before then but would continue at its current level for nine months claire buchan , a white house spokeswoman , said the administration planned to work with congress to make sure the securities and exchange commission has the resources it needs to get the job done

newburgh , ny , aug 6 a man was killed today when fireworks that he was trying to load into a truck exploded at a storage depot near stewart international airport here , the police said the fireworks were being stored at a world war ii munitions bunker once operated by the airport , which is a former air force base the authorities did not release the name of the victim no one else was at the storage depot when the fireworks , which the authorities described as legal , exploded about 5 pm , and no emergency workers were injured , said charles kehoe , chief of the newburgh police department the explosion destroyed two trailers and damaged one of four bunkers at the storage complex , next to lake orange there was an amazing bang , a newburgh firefighter who was at his home , four miles from the depot , said and none of us knew which way to run we thought a plane had crashed reports of a plane crash prompted the county to activate an emergencyresponse plan , calling in all emergency personnel in orange county , said james manley , a newburgh councilman we did n't know what had happened at first , mr manley said we reacted with everything we could get the cause of the explosion had not yet been determined , newburgh police officials said officials from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms and the new york state police were also investigating the blast
the violent cycle of palestinian attack and israeli reprisal grows deadlier by the day with palestinian militants increasing the frequency and effectiveness of their assaults on israeli soldiers , israel hit back yesterday with intensified air , sea and ground fire yet after a long lull , sober talk about the shape of an eventual peace is again in the air perhaps none of these discussions are more serious in their implications than the suggestion by crown prince abdullah of saudi arabia that his country is finally ready to lead the arab world to normal relations with israel in the event of a fairly negotiated peace agreement with the palestinians the crown prince should take the next step and formally present this idea to next month s arab league summit meeting in beirut no formal saudi proposal has yet been made yet the crown prince s thinking , as set forth last sunday in an interview with our colleague thomas friedman and amplified in an oped article today by henry siegman , a veteran mideast analyst , deserves serious consideration by israel , the palestinians and the united states with israel and the palestinians locked in an impasse of bitterness and distrust , outside help will be needed to revive productive peace negotiations saudi arabia , with its great prestige across the arab and islamic world and its substantial financial leverage over the palestinian leadership , is ideally placed to supply that help one important reason that the camp david peace negotiations broke down 19 months ago was saudi arabia s refusal at that time to endorse proposed compromises over jerusalem mr siegman , citing a conversation he had earlier this week with saudi officials , reports a new willingness on riyadh s part to accept israeli control over the western wall and jewish neighborhoods in east jerusalem those are two of the most critical concessions that are needed to permit an eventual compromise agreement the broad shape of the territorial settlement the crown prince envisions seems realistic it closely tracks the terms israeli and palestinian negotiators almost agreed on early last year in general , israel would withdraw to its pre1967 borders , but would be allowed to annex some settlement areas in the west bank the palestinians would be compensated by swaps of equivalent israeli land elsewhere that is considerably further than israel s prime minister , ariel sharon , has been willing to go it is unlikely to satisfy the most militant palestinians , whose violent resistance might have to be subdued by yasir arafat or some future palestinian leader yet both sides have an obligation to explore any arrangement that could end the killing and satisfy the basic national interests of israelis and palestinians crown prince abdullah s suggestion is not a blueprint for a final settlement it is an impulse worth pursuing the crown prince should lead the way by urging the 22nation arab league to unite behind his proposal next month in beirut if he is willing to do so , israel and the palestinian leadership should respond encouragingly , in deeds as well as words for the palestinian authority , that would mean a 100 percent effort to end all attacks against israeli civilians and soldiers , in the west bank and gaza strip as well as within israel s pre1967 borders for israel it would mean a matching ceasefire , a freeze on new settlement activity and an unconditional return to the bargaining table the specific details of any peace agreement will have to be negotiated directly between the israelis and palestinians themselves crown prince abdullah , by urging his fellow arab leaders to join saudi arabia in a commitment to recognize israel and guarantee its security as a jewish state , can help spur a resumption of those direct talks
jerusalem , april 13 from the moment president bush ordered secretary of state colin l powell to the middle east 10 days ago , two points were crystal clear any meeting with yasir arafat would cause deep controversy in the united states and israel , and secretary powell s peace mission would have no hope of success without one the question was never whether , but when and how tonight , after an elaborate diplomatic dance that made nods to american , israeli and palestinian sensitivities , the final decision came down secretary powell , under armed israeli escort , would see the palestinian leader in the ruins of his west bank compound in ramallah on sunday that a meeting with mr arafat could loom so large is a reflection of how much the israelipalestinian conflict has spun out of control into violence since the collapse of the clinton administration s peace talks at camp david two years ago , coupled with president bush s deep skepticism about mr arafat s trustworthiness as a negotiating partner for days , as secretary powell traveled through arab and european capitals on his way here , he and his senior aides went out of their way to leave the matter unresolved they never set ironclad public conditions , while repeating what european and arab allies told them that most of the world saw mr arafat as the designated spokesman for the palestinian cause the message , to critics in israel and skeptics in washington alike , was repeated again and again mr arafat may not be likable , or honorable , but he must be dealt with by the time secretary powell arrived in israel on thursday night , his schedule was set a meeting with prime minister ariel sharon on friday and with mr arafat today even after a palestinian militia linked to mr arafat s faction , al fatah , took responsibility for a suicide bombing here friday , and mr powell canceled today s meeting , his spokesman richard a boucher drew no lines in the sand he simply repeated longstanding american demands that mr arafat condemn that attack , and terrorism in general , while hinting that a meeting was still possible on sunday it was n't a condition , because we knew that to make this trip successful , we had to see chairman arafat on the issues , and try to move the process along , a senior american official said tonight vice president dick cheney came to grief on his trip to the region last month , when he set conditions for a meeting with mr arafat , only to declare days later that they had not been met in no small measure , that failure made secretary powell s visit all but inevitable , and his aides were determined not to get drawn into the same corner still , officials said , the american special envoy , gen anthony c zinni , made it clear in a meeting with other palestinian officials after the bombing on friday that secretary powell was expecting strong words from mr arafat the white house spokesman said the same thing in public at first , there was ominous silence from mr arafat he issued no statement friday night , and none this morning his close aide hassan abdel rahman , chief palestinian representative in washington , said a statement would have come sooner , but mr arafat , confined to a few rooms with limited communication , had been unable to consult with advisers mr arafat and the palestinians also wanted some strong words from mr powell condemning israel s raids on west bank towns and camps , especially in jenin , where palestinians have accused the israeli army of conducting a massacre of civilians in other words , the palestinian people are looking to the united states to have the same respect for civilian life on the israeli side and for the palestinian side , mr rahman said in a telephone interview that would in many ways calm palestinian and arab public opinion , because there is a great deal of resentment for this focus on israeli life , and a neglect of the suffering of the palestinians this morning , at a meeting with aid groups , mr powell called on israel to respect international humanitarian principles and to allow full and unimpeded access to humanitarian organizations , and added we are particularly concerned at the humanitarian situation in jenin at the same time , he announced that the united states was providing millions of dollars in additional relief and reconstruction aid for palestinians neither palestinian nor american officials described mr powell s comments as any kind of quid pro quo but hours later , at about 4 pm , secretary powell received a statement from mr arafat condemning the attack , recommitting himself to americandrafted negotiating proposals and noting mr powell s presence among us to stop this war secretary powell and his top aides caucused in their hotel here to review the statement in the statement , as translated by the associated press , mr arafat bitterly criticized israel , referring to israeli escalation , a tighter siege , further occupation of our people , refugee camps , cities , villages and more destruction of our infrastructure it also described the latest suicide bombing in quasimilitary terms as the recent operation in jerusalem but secretary powell and his aides chose to look past all that , just as they had looked past mr sharon s unyielding comments on friday shortly before 8 o'clock tonight , mr boucher emerged to say that the meeting with mr arafat was back on , for sunday , in an effort to help make these statements a reality asked if mr arafat s statement was substantially different from his past denunciations of terror , mr boucher said i do n't think i would characterize it one way or another there have been other statements by chairman arafat what we have always said is these need to be followed by effective action that s what we are saying in the statement today under president clinton , mr arafat was a regular visitor to the white house , though his presence rankled those who argued that he had done little to crack down on terrorists he got the frequent flier ticket without logging the miles , david ivry , israel s ambassador to washington , said recently mr bush has never met mr arafat , though secretary powell has done so at least three times , and speaks with him often on the telephone asked how a meeting , or lack of one , had become such a big deal , mr boucher insisted i do n't know that we made it a big deal but when a reporter asked whether secretary powell had any hope of progress without a meeting with mr arafat , mr boucher finished the sentence by saying that s taking place tomorrow photo secretary of state colin l powell at a meeting yesterday with greek orthodox clergymen at the american consulate in jerusalem \( agence francepresse \)
paghman , afghanistan hundreds of families with camel trains , donkeys , sheep and goats were on the move in october , trailing south and east in tireless motion across desert trails and alongside roads they were not refugees returning home or fleeing conflict , but afghan nomads , kuchi , migrating to their winter lands in a centuriesold tradition young women , with beads and metal ornaments jangling from their hair and clothing , chased after wayward animals to clear them off the road , their colorful skirts billowing as they ran women also led camels , laden with the tents and household goods , while men roamed far and high on the steep hillsides with the bulk of the herds kuchi have a special place in afghan life both feared and romanticized , they have always been powerful within the tribal system , as the country s main providers of meat , sheepskins and wool , and as wealthy moneylenders and traders but because of war and drought , their numbers have dwindled and those who survive have fallen into penury , their flocks having greatly shrunk many are now reduced to living off food handouts in refugee camps the situation the kuchi face is so bad that afghan and foreign aid officials have started a program to try to save them and their way of life barmak pazhwak , a policy adviser at the ministry of rural rehabilitation and development , said helping the kuchis survive had been identified by the government as one of its priorities for the winter , with a focus on providing water , food and employment and helping rebuild their herds nobody really knows how many kuchi there are , said frauke de weijer , a consultant from the world food program in afghanistan , who has just completed a study on the vulnerability of the nomads she estimates a population of 13 million to 15 million , down from 2 million to 25 million in the 1960 s and 70 s not all the kuchi were reached by the survey , but ms de weijer listed some stark facts of those who have recently fallen destitute , 50 percent have no livestock left , she said people who had , say , 500 sheep , now only have 100 , and they are the richest ones in the south , 75 percent have no livestock at all of the estimated 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 displaced people living in southern afghanistan , most are kuchi , she said they are one of the most vulnerable populations in afghanistan the poverty of the kuchi is only too clear even in kabul , where residents have seen kuchi come unusually close to the city with their families this year , setting up camp in deserted factory compounds in an industrial area on the eastern edge of town a group of families from the ibrahim khel tribe said they had pitched their camp for a week so the men could find casual labor in the city to pay for the journey by truck back to their winter lands in eastern afghanistan without animals , and in particular without camels to carry their tents and household belongings , the kuchi said they could not make the journey on foot as they used to the people here are those who do not have herds , said gul jan , the elder who is the leader of the group ninety percent do not have any livestock at all that s why we are working here , to pay for the journey home losing their herds has not just changed their pattern of movement , ms de weijer said , it has also endangered their very survival the kuchi have always lived by selling their young animals , dairy products , wool and sheepskins , or by bartering those goods for grain and other food movement to summer grazing lands is a necessity to keep the animals alive a family of 12 to 20 people needs at least 100 sheep and goats to survive , the kuchi say in paghman , a district on the southwestern rim of the capital , another group of kuchi live in 13 tents on a scrubby hillside a mile farther on , there are another 25 tents the children are dusty and run barefoot among the tents , which are covered with pieces of colored fabric and look like patchwork quilts these people are from the khomari khel tribe , a group of 500 families that traditionally move every year from laghman province , in eastern afghanistan , to spend the summer up in the central highlands of the hindu kush , known as hazarajat , an area mostly populated by ethnic hazaras but in the last 20 years they have made the trip only a few times , the elders of the tribe said this year they sat out the summer on the hot and dusty plains here near kabul their trouble began more than 20 years ago with the soviet invasion of afghanistan , when russian bombing raids and minefields killed many of their tribe , said malik gulbat , an elder the almost continuous fighting since then has blocked their migratory routes , and the tensions from later factional fighting and the taliban era still prevent their return to hazarajat then the drought of the last four years , the most severe in living memory , delivered the heaviest blow , depleting the kuchi s herds to such an extent that many can no longer feed their families some of them were killed in the fighting and bombardments , some died from the drought there was no grass and we sold some of them for meat , mr gulbat said of the 150 sheep and goats he once had he said that two of his sons were killed by mines as they tended their herds near bagram air base , north of kabul , once a major russian base and now the headquarters for the american military he remembered his childhood with nostalgia the economy was good our father and grandfather had good livestock we were happy , he said the best thing was that there was no fighting then , no stealing , no armed robbery we would move everywhere we were safe now we have the worst life the last few years have been so hard that many kuchi say they now want to give up the nomadic way of life , and they are asking the government for land so they can become farmers we are tired of this , we have no way to make ends meet , said chaman gul , 65 if we had the chance we would stop living like this some want help to restock their herds , but they have little faith the government will help no one has come from the government to talk to us , mr gul said no one cares about the poor people except god people who raise livestock , like the kuchi , are a necessary part of the rural system and their livelihood in normal circumstances is sustainable , ms de weijer said other kuchi say they would prefer to keep their way of life if they can it s a good life moving we do n't get tired , said pas bibi , 50 , a mother of eight , as she sat with a group on the ground in front of her tent the women around her agreed the men added that they needed schools and veterinary and medical clinics that could move with the tribe for the migration twenty years ago there were boarding schools in kabul for kuchi children , but those were closed during the soviet period and since then none of the children have been educated , they said the kuchi need , above all , political representation in the government , ms de weijer said they are not one entity , so there is not one solution , she said , but there is a humanitarian need and a need to rebuild their

san francisco , oct 24 if scouts were rating fred wilpon the way they do players , they would have to downgrade him for having bad hands now the sole owner of the mets , wilpon has adopted a more handson approach than ever , and it is a heavyhanded approach so far , he seems to have bad hands from the time last month when he said he saw no problem in the relationship between steve phillips , his general manager , and bobby valentine , then his manager , to his decision to hire art howe as the mets' new manager and not wait to see if dusty baker would have liked the job , wilpon has demonstrated an erratic behavior that does not bode well for the franchise wilpon , who usurped the general manager s usual role by taking control of the managerial hiring , appears to have panicked in his effort to find a manager to replace valentine , whom he reluctantly fired had wilpon remained calm and cool , he might have been able to lure baker to shea stadium not that there s anything wrong with howe , who is a good man , unassuming , lowkey , successful and 180 degrees from the focus of the man who previously occupied the position valentine was all i and me incredibly , he would turn reporters' questions about others into issues about himself he often hoisted himself on his own words , and the accumulation of deceptions and outrageous comments finally did him in the mets wo n't have to worry about bizarre behavior from howe he will do a workmanlike job and free the players to play but the mets could very likely have had baker , the san francisco manager , if they had waited a couple of weeks two baseball executives said so today he s not going to come out and say it , said one of the executives , who knows baker well he ca n't because he s under contract but the mets were perfect for dusty , and dusty was perfect for the mets in recent weeks , as the belief has grown that baker will not sign a new contract to manage the giants , the perception has grown that baker did not want to manage in new york who created the perception \? one of the executives said everybody has dusty not wanting to go to new york he 'd be interested in new york if they approached him he s interested in the best situation for him the executive said he believed baker s first preference would be the seattle mariners , but the mariners , according to an official familiar with their thinking , do n't want to pay baker what it would take to get him to seattle the mets would have been next on his list , the executive said baker s deal with the giants expires 10 days after the end of the world series that means the mets would have had to wait two weeks to talk to the man considered one of the best managers in the game and perhaps the best at dealing with players if wilpon wanted lou piniella because he was a good name , one of the executives said , what would baker have been \? wilpon s search was frenetic , to say the least phillips interviewed howe , the athletics' manager , after phillips s friend billy beane , the oakland general manager , gave him permission but two days later piniella became available , and the mets leapt at the chance to get piniella , a popular figure in new york the mets , however , encountered difficulties satisfying the mariners' request for compensation the mets kept objecting to all the names the mariners brought up , a baseball official said when it became obvious that the mets were not going to receive permission to speak to piniella and that piniella was inexplicably on his way to tampa bay , the mets , in a panic , went back to the athletics permission was granted again , and howe quickly became the mets' new manager but if the mets had waited to talk to baker , howe would not have gone anywhere none of the other teams seeking a manager would have asked permission to speak to howe had baker rejected the mets , howe would still have been available and eager to accept their 94 million for four years had the mets waited for baker , they would n't be in trouble , along with the tampa bay devil rays , with commissioner bud selig , facing disciplinary action for violating his edict against creating nonworld series news during the world series had the mets waited for baker and been able to hire him , it would have been a major step forward for a franchise that has never been in the forefront of minority hiring had the mets waited for baker and been able to hire him , they would have had a manager who could have reclaimed the clubhouse , which valentine lost last season he s a people person , one of the executives said managers can be overrated , especially on the strategy part but in people management , that s huge , and no one is better than dusty at people management he s the best at getting people to play together for exhibit a , see barry bonds and jeff kent if the mets had waited for baker , they could have had a threetime manager of the year , a manager who was just in the world series and maybe a manager who just won the world series maybe once the world series is over , wilpon will be free to explain why he did n't wait for baker photo art howe , oakland s manager the past seven years , has agreed to a fouryear contract with the mets \( reuters \)
anaheim , calif , oct 4 darin erstad loves all the red when the stands are packed at edison field it reminds him of his days as a punter for the university of nebraska , where he won a national championship erstad chose a baseball career and was sentenced to play for the anaheim angels , a franchise that has never won a playoff series they are on the brink of doing that now , because the yankees seem helpless to stop them with a double by erstad putting them over the top in a threerun eighth inning tonight , the angels roared back from a fiverun deficit to stomp the yankees , 96 , in game 3 of their american league division series the yankees will be eliminated if they lose the fourth game on saturday afternoon you judge how good a team is by how they respond to the negative stuff , yankees manager joe torre said it was a terrible night tonight the yankees stared down elimination in this round last year with three victories in a row against oakland they need two this time , and david wells , the biggame pitcher personally signed by their principal owner , george steinbrenner , will pitch against jarrod washburn on saturday to save their season the bottom line is , you win or go home , said derek jeter , who sparkled in the first inning but finished 1 for 5 there s really nothing else to say the yankees are having to contend with an angels team of playoff neophytes who have played the series on their terms the yankees scored six runs in the first three innings , a welcome gift from the rattled angels starter , ramon ortiz , who walked four the yankees' offense went dormant after that , and their pitchers were hopeless they let the lead slip away again that is nothing new in this series the yankees lost three leads in game 1 before coming back to win they blew an eighthinning lead in their game 2 loss tonight s 61 lead in the third inning was gone by the seventh the yankees' vaunted pitching staff is crumbling against an opponent much tougher than people believed everybody s saying they 're scrappy , the yankees' robin ventura said they 're not scrappy they 're good they have good atbats and they just played a great game they came back and turned it around in 26 innings in this series , the angels have gone down in order just five times , including three against orlando hern ndez in game 2 they then hit two homers off him angels batters flick away so many twostrike pitches , each fan must expect to catch a foul ball the yankees' hallmark is pitching , and the angels have scoffed at it yankee starters have an earned run average of 853 in the three games , and none has lasted through the sixth the starting pitching has n't been as good as we 're capable of being , torre said simple as that give the angels a lot of credit for the way they hang in there , go hard at you right now , we just have n't been able to do our job as well as they have mike mussina left after four innings tonight with tightness in his right groin muscle , and he was not sharp when he was in jeff weaver faced the next nine batters and retired five , walked two , hit one and allowed a single mussina s injury may linger if the yankees survive the first round i would guess yes , for a pitcher to have a groin problem , torre said i hope , at this juncture , that we have the ability to replace him the yankees' pitching depth is the reason torre called this staff his best in the seven years he has managed the yankees weaver is supposed to be the shining example of that depth , but the angels' first relievers , john lackey and scott schoeneweis , outpitched him in the middle innings the angels' setup man , francisco rodriguez , outdid mike stanton and steve karsay in the seventh and eighth , too rodriguez , a 20yearold who had never pitched in the majors before last month , looks more like a young mariano rivera each time he fires mid90 s fastballs and deadly cutters he s proven he has electric stuff , bernie williams said and while rivera watched from the yankees' bullpen , the anaheim closer , troy percival , retired alfonso soriano , jeter and jason giambi to end the game the yankees' offense was shut out after the third inning , but in the clubhouse , the pitching staff took the blame we rely on our pitching , and they hit our pitching , jeter said we came out , we scored runs early it was 61 in the third inning , and more often than not , the game s over but they continued to battle , got some quality atbats and scored some runs the angels always feel they can come back because they can manufacture runs and hit homers adam kennedy homered for their final run off mussina , and his sacrifice fly helped the angels manufacture one off weaver stanton had to bail out weaver for the last out of the sixth , preserving a 65 lead it was gone the next inning garret anderson , who had failed to run hard out of the box on a grounder that soriano bobbled in the third , doubled past giambi with one out in the seventh it was a twohopper that ate up giambi , who was playing close to the firstbase line and could not smother a ball to his glove hand with two outs and a full count , scott spiezio 0 for 12 in his career against stanton tied the score with a bloop single to rightcenter field , just over the glove of a backtracking soriano stanton grimaced when the ball hit the grass it was a tie game , 66 , and the angels had one more rally in them kennedy led off the eighth with a shallow fly to right that drifted toward the line as raul mondesi chased it mondesi said he thought he had it and never considered diving he reached the ball , but it glanced off the tip of glove for a double david eckstein dutifully sacrificed kennedy to third the angels led the league in sacrifice hits and erstad sizzled a double into the rightfield corner , scoring kennedy with the goahead run karsay replaced stanton , and tim salmon lofted his first pitch into the seats down the leftfield line little ball , then powerball it was a tworun homer , and the angels led by 96 they had a threerun lead to give to one of baseball s best closers , and percival did not let them down the yankees were dazed the fans at edison field , awash in heartbreak for so many years , were rocking they 've been through a lot , through the history of this organization , erstad said you would n't believe how many people come up to you , season ticketholders for 30 years , and they 're like , 'we 've been waiting for this' photos tim salmon being congratulated by his anaheim teammates after hitting a tworun homer in the eighth \( chang w lee

arlington , va , june 10 us airways filed an application today with the federal government seeking a 900 million loan guarantee for a 1 billion loan that it intends to use to revamp the company the filing came as a surprise because david n siegel , the chief executive , had said he wanted to reach an agreement with the airline s unions on deep concessions before making the filing the carrier , the nation s sixth largest , and its unions have been in talks since last month , when executives asked labor leaders for cuts to save 950 million a year the government has said it will approve only applications with business plans that demonstrate that the airline can reach profitability and repay the loan , which generally translates into widespread costcutting by the carrier the airline s largest unions said the filing would not change the continuing negotiations us airways , based in arlington , is the seventh and by far the largest airline to apply for a federal loan guarantee since congress approved a 15 million bailout package for the industry after the sept 11 attacks congress set up the air transportation stabilization board to administer a 10 billion loan guarantee program and cash payouts totaling 5 billion that were immediately given to the airlines the board has rejected two applications and approved one , giving 380 million in backing last december to america west our intent is to restructure us airways and make it a profitable and successful airline that will be a competitive force , especially on the east coast , mr siegel said yesterday in a written statement this loan guarantee is not an entitlement , and we know we must demonstrate our ability to repay the loan , keep our costs in check , and have a viable business plan betsy holahan , a spokeswoman for the stabilization board , said the threemember board had no timeline for making a decision on the application last year , the justice department blocked united airlines' proposed buyout of us airways now the federal government might come to the aid of us airways the business plan filed with the application calls for 13 billion in annual cuts , with 950 million coming from personnel costs and 350 million from suppliers , said david castelveter , a company spokesman us airways reported a 269 million loss last quarter , its seventh consecutive losing quarter , and a 2 billion loss last year it was harder hit than many of its competitors by the sept 11 attacks because its routes are concentrated on the east coast , where many business travelers have turned to cheaper methods of transportation it also has the most departures from ronald reagan washington national airport , which was closed for several weeks after the attacks when asked why the airline decided to file the application before obtaining the concessions it wants , a us airways official said that the financial house was in order by filing the formal application now , it does not preclude us from making revisions to it , said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity he added that the airline could revise its application until june 28 , the government deadline for any carrier that wants to file for a loan guarantee after that , he said , the filing can still be altered if the stabilization board requests changes whether the application succeeds will depend largely on the amount of concessions the airline is able to negotiate with its six unions none of the large unions have agreed to the numbers put forward by management , although all are in talks mr siegel had said he wants to reach agreements on concessions by june 15 , and several unions said they were working to meet that deadline right now , we are supporting us airways s efforts to get the atsb loan guarantee , said roy freundlich , a spokesman for the air line pilots association , which represents 4 , 800 active workers filing the application today is one step in that process the timing of it is mostly a minor point we basically have negotiations on the issues on hand , not on the management s timing of the application filing mr freundlich said the pilots were willing to allow 400 million in cuts from wages and benefits , although the carrier has said it wants 595 million , the most of any employee group the carrier announced yesterday that the pilots had agreed to allow psa airlines , a subsidiary of us airways , to fly regional jets , which are much cheaper to operate than larger mainline aircraft the union agreed earlier to allow us airways to double its number of regional jets , to 140 during the current negotiations , the pilots have said they will allow us airways to increase its regional jet fleet to more than 300 as part of the concessions the international association of machinists , which represents 12 , 000 active workers , said that it had offered an alternative to the 261 million in cuts that us airways wants from it , and that the carrier made a counterproposal late friday we knew that they intended to file the loan application , said joe tiberi , a spokesman for the machinists whether they filed it today , or a week from now , or two weeks from now , it really does n't change the negotiations they 're still seeking the same amount of money from the employees that they were we knew our negotiations would be one piece of their restructuring plan , and the filing with the government would be another jeff zack , a spokesman for the association of flight attendants , said that executives have been talking to the atsb , so the company knows what they need to do as far as the atsb is concerned analysts said that the amount of backing the airline is seeking seems about right , given the revamping plans mr siegel has said he wants to strengthen the carrier s three hubs , fly more regional jets and find a codeshare partner they wanted to get that filing out there , said michael j linenberg , an analyst at merrill lynch this was their way of saying , 'hey , we need to get this done , but we still need to get some things finalized' we all know that for these guys to make as strong an application as they can , they need cooperation from their labor groups photo kevin f mccarthy , a us airways pilot , at reagan national airport yesterday the pilots' union is willing to accept wage and benefits cuts \(

beirut , lebanon , jan 3 for their annual feast marking the end of ramadan , the teffaha household boldly decided to defy tradition , scratching stuffed lamb off the menu and penciling in a roast turkey the problem was how to cook it riffling through old lebanese cookbooks failed to unearth a recipe no one in their building had ever tried to cook a bird then an excited neighbor called one day at noon and yelled that they should turn on the television immediately , because chef ramzi was preparing that very thing ramzi shwayri , lebanon s first television chef , is changing the face of arab cuisine the chef tinkers with traditional recipes and introduces foods once experienced only vicariously the chef sort of said this is the american turkey you see on sitcoms , recalled ghassan teffaha , a 24yearold student , pausing to savor his family s holiday feast all over again watching so many people eating turkey , we wanted to try it my mom learned how to do it from his show , and it turned out to be a really good one starting in 1994 with just a local broadcast , the 30yearold chef has blossomed into a regional phenomenon , his live satellite broadcast on future television now considered mandatory watching from muscat to marrakesh and beyond chef ramzi , the cookbook , is in its 10th printing , with more than 160 , 000 copies in circulation \( in the middle east , marketing statistics remain anecdotal , but a book selling more than 5 , 000 copies is considered a runaway best seller \) the cookbook outsold every other book in 1998 and 1999 , according to various publishers , even surpassing vastly popular religious treatises that discuss things like the afterlife it remains in the top 10 watching chef ramzi , the television show , feels vaguely like eavesdropping in an extended arab living room chef ramzi fields calls from anybody with a food question \( the station adds two operators while he is on the air \) on one show , a bee plopped into a cream dish he scooped it out with a large spoon and proclaimed it unlikely to sully the dish a woman from saudi arabia called to complain that for the sake of hygiene , he should have tossed out the whole thing the sudanese woman who called next argued that bees were mentioned in the koran as exceptionally clean insects with their own souls , so he should have left it a syrian man then phoned , wondering if they could drop the philosophizing and just cook it s not just frying and onions and meat , chef ramzi said over a meze lunch , an everexpanding battery of small dishes containing beans , salads , dips and cold cuts i feel it s a cultural program , about food , cooking , the history of the dish , old lebanese recipes arab nations squabble about food along with everything else , so chef ramzi discovered that favoring a lebanese method would prompt a flood of calls from say , egypt , complaining of bias he makes sure to mention the alternatives he avoids dishes containing wine or pork out of respect for islamic dietary laws so many callers asked for a wine substitute , however , that he developed a recipe from vinegar even novices asking how to boil rice find a patient teacher chef ramzi , which is what everyone on beirut s streets calls him , did not set out to become a famous cook he was the third of four children born in beirut to greek orthodox parents in 1957 , the older mr shwayri started alkafaat foundation , which teaches vocational skills to troubled or handicapped youths the son , forced by the civil war to finish his education in france , studied economics and law at the university of lyon he spent summers studying cooking or working in restaurants with the idea of improving the foundation s catering department he now runs it , supplying hundreds of cooks and restaurant workers to the reemerging hotel industry the chef considers that his main job and the time involved proscribes opening a restaurant he wrote the cookbook because the lebanese , emerging from the war with a craving for varied recipes with a soup on of things foreign , could not find anything serious on the market that and questions from his show determined the contents the book falls partly into the cookingforidiots category break the egg over the frying pan , reads about a third of the recipe for a fried egg i get asked , the chef said with a shrug but the 824 recipes go on to detail everything from falafel to sushi to brownies \( because chef ramzi insists on picturing every dish , the arabiconly book runs 572 pages and weighs 5 pounds \) it also boasts 157 pages of desserts , which helps explain the 66 pounds he has gained since starting the show his wife , tanya jamous , a 25yearold dentist , has largely booted him out of their kitchen , both to get a smidgen of her own cooking credit and to make healthier meals the arabiconly show is usually broadcast three days a week one day for middle eastern dishes , one day for something foreign and one day for dessert chef ramzi s popularity spawned imitators , but none are live and they lack his verve next , chef ramzi wants to cross beyond the arab world and its diaspora a cookbook of old lebanese recipes is due out this summer in arabic , french and english he respects the basics of all middle eastern dishes , but raises some hackles with innovations like using pistachio nuts frequently instead of almonds women have become comfortable with his methods and are using them more and more , said warde fawaz , the owner of walima , a renowned lebanese restaurant he gives people ideas and he is changing the taste of lebanese food , but it is not always for the better after more than 1 , 000 shows chef ramzi says his most difficult task is to convince arabs to experiment they know how their mother used to do it , and their grandmother , so for them this is a holy recipe , they ca n't change it , he said i tell people not to be prisoners of your recipes you have to let your imagination

the first strike ever at the plum island animal disease center , the highsecurity laboratory off long island that conducts research on dangerous infectious animal diseases , has raised concerns among striking union members , workers still on the island and government officials about the center s ability to function safely and effectively the federal bureau of investigation has been called to the center to investigate allegations of sabotage after the water pressure on the island failed to generate sufficient power , according to workers and scientists on the island and government officials the insufficient water pressure meant scientists could not use the necropsy rooms , which are used to examine dead animals , according to witnesses on the island union officials said that the problem was the result of inexperienced workers' being rushed in to replace the strikers other concerns about the center , which is on an 850acre island about a mile and a half northeast of orient point on the north fork of long island , include the safety of operating the facility without a trained fire department , and that the replacement workers have not been adequately screened and do not have sufficient training to handle an emergency or even keep essential parts of the island running however , scientists and striking workers said there was very little danger of a leak that could threaten nearby communities senator hillary rodham clinton said yesterday that she was going to ask the appropriate senate committee to investigate how the strike was handled and to find out the qualifications of the replacement workers i am concerned , she said in a telephone interview we do n't know who these people are who are being put in as replacements mrs clinton also said we are in greater need of the kind of research that is done there than we have been at any time i am just bewildered at why it had to get to this point the concerns come at a time when debate is heating up in washington about the role of plum island and whether it should be included in the department of homeland security the strike at the department of agriculture facility began on aug 13 at midnight , after negotiators failed to reach an agreement on wages and benefits plum island employs about 200 people , both government workers and union members the 76 striking union workers are members of the international union of operating engineers and are employed by a government subcontractor , lbb associates , based in columbia , md the workers on strike filled key roles such as operating the wastewater treatment plant and decontamination plant , and also served as boat operators and safety technicians plum island is known to residents on long island s north fork as mystery island and has long been the subject of speculation about the dangerous germs that are studied there it was even mentioned in the film silence of the lambs as a place for the character hannibal lecter to retreat to under heavy surveillance once a year beyond the natural barrier of water , the center takes elaborate precautions to ensure that organisms do not escape from the island while people in the labs do not wear suits with selfcontained respirators , everyone who leaves the containment areas has to shower , scrubbing hair and nails and rinsing mouths nothing is permitted to leave the labs without being disinfected , even eyeglasses the only outbreak on the island occurred in 1978 , when the spread of foot and mouth disease forced officials to kill all the livestock there has never been a leak to the mainland the most serious problems on the island because of the strike appear to involve the water system the island gets its water from a series of wells that feed a central water tower according to witnesses on the island , at some point in the last week part of the pressure being generated was lost water is central to many of the activities performed on the island , especially the cleaning representative rob simmons of connecticut said he was told that the fbi had been called to the island , which is close to his congressional district , to investigate witnesses on the island also confirmed that the fbi was investigating allegations of sabotage jacob bunch , a spokesman for lbb associates , said , we are not going to comment on the fbi investigation the fbi also had no comment , and a request to visit the island was denied by the agriculture department robert borrusso , 42 , has worked at the center for six years and is licensed to operate the wastewater treatment plant he said that when he left work on the afternoon of aug 13 , before a decision had been reached about a strike , the system was operating properly when i left at 3 30 the water pressure was adequate , he said mr borrusso said that while the well system was not overly complicated , some things are not labeled , so an operator has to know his way around as long as i 've been there , none of the supervisors have operated this system , he said they were the ones operating it last week and now they have people from i do n't know where operating it
toronto , aug 29 before he left the yankees' clubhouse tonight , mike stanton searched the room for teammates he was carrying a folded stack of toronto blue jays stickers on which was written the phone number for an 11 pm players' association conference call stanton handed out a sticker to a couple of stray teammates and left to catch a cab to the team hotel stanton did not know if he would return to the clubhouse on friday or if he would fly home to wait out a strike nothing really came out of it , stanton said late tonight after the call it was just a stateoftheuniontype thing the only thing i can really say is , it s probably going to be a long night stanton did not elaborate on the specifics of the call he said the sides had finalized some of the smaller stuff , but were still negotiating on a luxury tax and revenue sharing the yankees \( 8349 \) are having another splendid season , running away with the american league east title , and the players say they do not want to strike stanton , the team s union representative , informs teammates of important developments , and several said they would join the call or at least contact stanton before they went to sleep i do n't think anybody s kept in the cold , jason giambi said i do n't think it s really played on anybody s mind other yankees felt differently nobody said the uncertainty over friday s strike date had any effect on the yankees' 74 loss to the blue jays tonight , in which roger clemens was pelted for seven runs and 10 hits in five innings but to some , there was no mistaking it tonight s game , possibly the last of a splendid season , felt different it had a little weird feeling to it , said bernie williams , who went 0 for 4 to snap his 19game hitting streak , grounding into a double play with two on and none out in the eighth it just felt weird we just tried to keep our concentration to get through it clemens \( 115 \) gave up three home runs , two to the rookie josh phelps , and was outpitched by esteban loaiza , who threw a complete game when the skydome fans started a derisive yankees chant , manager joe torre turned to the bench coach don zimmer and said the fans were right , the yankees did stink but torre was not mad , he explained , speaking in even tones and keeping an optimistic outlook torre , a national league player representative during the union s formative years , said he believed there would not be a strike i'm confident we 're going to come here tomorrow , torre said i really do n't have any hesitation in that regard , and it s not just because i'm an optimistic person they 're meeting , and usually when they get together at the 11th hour , they 're close enough to something happening jeff weaver , who will start for the yankees if they play on friday , said he would go over the blue jays hitters in his mind tonight and get his rest , just as he would before any start weaver said he would probably go to sleep not knowing if an agreement had been reached you plan on coming tomorrow , derek jeter said that s all you can do you do n't plan for the worst you plan for the best , and we 'll see what happens realistically , stanton said , the players must decide whether to strike by late friday morning , before the cubs and cardinals players report to wrigley field in chicago for their 3 20 pm \( eastern \) game you ca n't have players at a stadium and then turn around and walk out , stanton said if the players strike , they are on their own to make travel plans some yankees have already scheduled flights , others have not some are superstitious , like chris widger , the reserve catcher , who said he did not want to jinx an agreement by planning to leave town rondell white is staying through the weekend because his family is here , and torre and his family are staying put andy pettitte said he had not made plans because he was optimistic the sides would reach an agreement giambi also had not made plans , but he sounded frustrated by the drawnout pace of the negotiations it s too bad it had to come down to this , giambi said we 've had the whole year , and it has to come down to the last minute but a lot of things can get done in the last minute steve karsay dressed quickly because he wanted to make sure he was on the conference call he wanted to hear there was a new deal , but said he was prepared if not we 're optimistic , karsay said , but we understand if nothing gets done tonight or tomorrow , we 're going to do what we have to do that , of course , is a strike , which would be the sixth by the players since 1972 if the owners were trying to test the players 'resolve , stanton said , they were foolish that would be a grave mistake , stanton said major league baseball has tried to call our bluff before we have yet to bluff inside pitch left fielder rondell white \( ruptured tendon , left middle finger \) said he was considering surgery on the injured finger in the winter lefthander andy pettitte will throw on saturday somewhere , he insisted in preparation for a start on tuesday pettitte was scheduled to start on friday but was scratched with stiffness in his lower back first baseman

to the editor two and a half cheers for judith shulevitz for her thoughtful discussion of foreign policy realism \( expecting the worst , dec 16 \) but her suggestion that such realism threatens to entrap all of our politics in fatalism and determinism is unjustified true realism holds not only that politics between nations is uncorrectably anarchic but that as a result it differs fundamentally from politics within true nations and states , especially democratically governed ones precisely because such domestic systems are characterized by a common acceptance of legitimate authority , and by a broader sense of mutual obligation , a true realist would never disagree that their possibilities for trust , cooperation and growth are often encouraging it is precisely because the international system possesses none of these features that realists' expectations of achieving such advances abroad are so low in fact , by spotlighting the qualitative differences between the international and domestic spheres of politics , true realism can help prevent excessive pessimism in the former by observing that foreign policy disappointments and failures have no bearing on our chances for progress at home that contemporary american realists have not made this argument suggests that they are in fact not realists at all alan tonelson washington

sometimes it seems to jawed wassel s afghanamerican friends in new york that his ghost hovers over his unfinished film , firedancer as they struggle to complete the editing of firedancer , about the efforts of afghans to assimilate into american culture , they say they feel the presence of its murdered creator among them when there s a sudden gust of wind , an electrical short it is as if mr

on nov 20 firedancer is described by its producers as the first dramatic feature about afghanamericans , some of whom immigrated to the united states to escape from the soviet invasion and the rule of the taliban the film which does not have a distributor yet , is scheduled to be shown at the quad cinema in manhattan for one week beginning on dec 19 to make it eligible for the academy awards the film tells the story of haris \( played by baktash zaher , 26 , ms zaherkhadem s brother \) , a hip , handsome afghanamerican artist who shows his work at a downtown manhattan art gallery he seems to be an allamerican guy except that he creates strange installations of hanging ropes , and suffers from visions of himself as a child in afghanistan in traditional dress , of smoke and bombs , of his dead parents and the russian soldier who shot them during the soviet invasion haris embarks on a journey through the world of afghanamericans to learn more about their culture , and there he finds both humor and tragedy he befriends sunny , an afghan immigrant hot dog vendor , whose son is a wouldbe rapper show uncle haris what you can do , sunny tells the youth the young man raps maniacally , for my hip culture i will fight with two fists clenched tight sunny offers haris his own wry perspective on afghanistan s endless civil wars haris has nightmares , sunny tells him , because he has been away from his people but i have them , sunny says , because i'm with them 24 hours a day haris falls for laila , a fashion designer who still carries the expectations of her traditional parents laila does n't talk to afghan men , she says , because they jump from , you know , 'hello' to marriage later , in a cafe , when the two argue over what to drink , the waiter hovering over them quips , you must be afghans when haris asks how he knows , the waiter replies , because you ca n't agree on anything the afghanamerican women are still expected to marry men their parents choose , and to obey even younger brothers let me tell you something , laila s little brother , farhad , says you 're not going to date no one you 're not going to go to no clubs , and you 're not going to marry someone who is not afghan ms zaherkhadem said that some afghanamerican women who appeared in the film used stage names for fear of censure from their conservative families last month , when the producers flew to afghanistan to screen a rough cut of firedancer in kabul s soccer stadium , once the taliban s execution ground , islamic fundamentalist demonstrators disrupted the event to protest scenes of women in lowneck , sleeveless dresses to calm them , ms zaherkhadem put her hand over the lens to blot out the offending images , only to have others among the 2 , 000 people in attendance roar their disapproval mr wassel was born in kabul in 1958 his father was an army general who died of natural causes when jawed was 18 months old his greatgrandfather was a poet mr wassel went to the french lyc

had studied film at columbia and wanted to make movies eventually , mr wassel raised about 500 , 000 , ms zaherkhadem said , much of it from the afghan diaspora she said that mr powell did not put money into the film mr powell said in a telephone interview from nassau county jail where he is awaiting trial that he murdered mr wassel because i believed he had contacts with the taliban he said that mr wassel had visited afghanistan before the sept 11 attacks mr powell also said that mr wassel , threatened to kill me he dismembered mr wassel s body , he said , because it was an honor killing mr wassel s friends called talk that he was a taliban sympathizer ridiculous jawed hated the taliban , ms zaherkhadem said
to the editor re spam an escalating attack of the clones \( june 27 \) spam is n't really a technology problem it s an economic one spam has a cost to the network infrastructure and to the recipients , but virtually none of it is charged to the spammer whenever a resource is priced below cost it will be overused by some to the detriment of others typically the only penalty for sending spam is that the spammer loses a free email account when the provider is inundated with remove me replies but the spammer does n't care if sending email cost as little as onehundredth of a cent per message , there would be a lot less onetime spamming while this is easier said than done , it would start to bring the economics of spam back into balance and set the stage for a longterm solution michael j zehr cambridge , mass
uniondale , ny , oct 15 adrian aucoin said he simply did what defensemen are told and flipped a long , hard wrist shot toward the inside of the goal post and in an abrupt turnaround for the luckless islanders , the shot went in and the game was over aucoin s goal at 1 minute 50 seconds of overtime lifted the islanders to a 43 victory tonight over the nashville predators three seconds earlier , brad isbister missed a penalty shot , and goaltender chris osgood gave up a secondperiod goal on a 60foot shot none of the bad stuff mattered , and it did not even matter to the islanders that they had to rally from a twogoal deficit to beat nashville , an average team that has lost its first three games the islanders had their first victory after opening their season with two discouraging losses i think this is huge , said aleksei yashin , who scored the tying goal in the third period by redirecting a pass from raffi torres i think we 're going to lift it up a little bit the islanders said similar things after losing their opener last thursday to buffalo , but then they lost to washington in their home opener saturday , and a sellout crowd got mad until yashin s goal , the crowd of 12 , 279 at nassau coliseum was upset again the fans settled on a target osgood , who stopped 10 of 13 shots tonight nashville s third goal came on a 60foot slap shot in the second period by karlis skrastins , who was one of only three nashville skaters on the ice at the time i just did n't see it , osgood said it s still a bad goal i have to move more than just my hand for the rest of the game , osgood received mock cheers from the crowd every time he stopped a shot , no matter how easy he said he heard them osgood has allowed 10 goals in 3 games , and the islanders needed overtime to get his only victory i have n't played as good as i can , osgood said not even close coach peter laviolette decided to keep osgood in the game , and skrastins s goal , which came 21 seconds into the second period , was the last one osgood allowed the islanders caught up to the speedy predators , and osgood left with a victory you 're not going to rattle chris osgood , laviolette said he will be there for us you can mark my words laviolette shook up the roster monday , recalling torres and justin mapletoft from bridgeport and demoting right wing trent hunter and defenseman tomi pettinen that was nothing compared with the line juggling laviolette did tonight yashin was with isbister and oleg kvasha bates was a center on a line with torres and mark parrish dave scatchard centered a line that included jason blake and arron asham mapletoft , jason wiemer and claude lapointe were on a line it was as if the islanders were starting over but scatchard scored the islanders' first goal , after asham slammed a wraparound that bounced off nashville goaltender tomas vokoun yashin s line had a dominant shift late in the first period parrish scored his first goal of the season by deflecting a shot by mattias timander with the islanders on the power play , and bates , after leaving the game late in the second period with an undisclosed injury , returned soon after and won the decisive faceoff it was n't a finesse game , aucoin said it was n't lucky we battled this one out torres , a 21yearold redhead with a goatee , tracked down a loose puck and whipped it to yashin in the slot with one backhand heave yashin deflected torres s strong pass into the net to tie the score with 14 04 left in regulation good things happen when you throw the puck at the net , torres said , smiling isbister had a chance to end the game after he was tripped by nashville defenseman pascal tr panier at 1 47 of overtime after a lengthy delay that built the suspense , isbister aimed for the gap between vokoun s legs and vokoun stopped it any time there s such a big momentum shift , the puck usually goes in for one of the teams , aucoin said considering the islanders' recent run of tough luck , the puck could just as easily have gone in for the predators but aucoin scooted to his left after bates won the faceoff and blasted the islanders' gamewinner it looked sketchy for a little bit , laviolette said but we were doing the right things photo shawn bates , left , assisted on adrian aucoin s shot in overtime that got past nashville s tomas vokoun to give the islanders their first victory \( associated press \)
blue honu , named for a sea turtle that swims in hawaiian waters , has taken off at a very unturtlelike pace this new hawaiian oyster bar has hit huntington village like a tidal wave on a recent saturday night we found that the wait for a table would be two hours i would n't wait two hours for a meal at jean georges , my husband grumbled as we left he would n't have to , for jean georges takes reservations and blue honu \( pronounced hoenew \) accepts them only for groups of eight or more on weeknights , and none on weekends we returned the next night at 6 and faced a 45minute wait after about a half an hour , we noticed that there was a table that remained empty that s reserved for friends of the owner , we were told but you do n't take reservations , we replied , and received only a shrug as an explanation about half of the space at blue honu is devoted to the jumping bar scene there is the usual long bar complete with stools plus a necklace of high table seating surrounding it at the front of the restaurant is the boat lounge , a shiplike couch encircled with stools and chairs at the rear is a conversation pit with a fireplace as its focal point the rest of the d cor runs to fullsize palm trees , slowly moving ceiling fans , large red lamp shades hanging from the ceiling and a handsome exposedbrick wall behind the bar one night , after a meal that was better than we dared hope for given blue honu s emphasis on the bar , a friend , who is over 50 , remarked , i 'd never come back here on another visit a young man in his early 30 s exclaimed , i ca n't wait to return the first was reacting to the shoutsonly noise level and the overly casual , slipshod service for the other , the verve and buzz of the place had worked their magic the food was as mixed as those reactions one night i had a nearperfect meal beginning with a refreshing salad of haricots verts , cubes of marinated beets , macadamia nuts and dabs of goat cheese in a citrus vinaigrette i went on to an expertly broiled fillet of chilean sea bass and ended the dinner with a refreshing mango split starring mango sorbet and vanilla ice cream another time the starter was the blue honu chopped salad , which was n't chopped , consisted mainly of iceberg lettuce and needed more dressing a followup hamburger \( 995 \) was fastfood ordinary , not the thick juicy burger for which i was hoping seafood fared better than meats a surfandturf combination of two grilled shrimps , a lobster tail and a small filet mignon was brought down by the dry beef , which , ordered medium rare , was gray throughout the new york strip steak was more of the same but fish , usually harder for restaurants to get right , hit the target every time grilled salmon , saut ed pink snapper in a crisp taro crust and panseared bigeye tuna were all lightly turned out another surefire winner was the yummy lobster roll presented on a footlong bun along with crisp french fries an entree of three south african lobster tails also made a good showing , but its promised saffron butter was missing diners who really love seafood should try the nui honu \( 42 \) , a shavedicefilled platter topped with four raw oysters , four clams , six jumbo shrimps , a whole split lobster , three king crab legs , a bowl of flavorful tuna tartar and two sauces it would make an elegant light supper for two or a spectacular appetizer for a table of four other openers that made the grade were the lumpia \( goat cheese and spinach enclosed in a crispy wrapper \) and the deep dive , four crunchy coconut shrimps but skip the crab cakes , three pasty golf balls , and the blah , underdressed and farfromclassic caesar salad the lobster bisque was creamy and tasty , but the skimpy portion , served in a coffee cup , was overpriced at 695 desserts include crowdpleasers like banana splits , root beer floats and chocolate milkshakes other attentiongetters were the moltencentered chocolate cake , the

surucucu , brazil the yanomami indians have lived precariously in the most remote reaches of the jungle here for thousands of years , hunting with bows and arrows , and warring among themselves and with the few white intruders who have appeared in recent years but now they are facing a threat to their very existence as a people the brazilian army as part of a program to strengthen the military s presence along brazil s vast and largely undefended northern amazon border , the brazilian armed forces are building new bases and expanding old ones in territories set aside for the yanomami and other tribes as their numbers expand , soldiers are increasingly getting yanomami women pregnant , spreading venereal disease and disrupting patterns of village life that have endured largely unchanged since the stone age the destruction has already begun , roberto angametery , the village chief here , lamented in an interview in the lodge where members of his community live together the soldiers say they are here to protect us , but they have brought diseases and taken our land without asking us soon there will be more , and then what will we do \? where will we go \? initiated in the mid1980 s , the military s northern channel program was shelved during a budget crisis more than a decade ago but with the united states' decision two years ago to provide more than 15 billion in military and other assistance to neighboring colombia , brazilians fear that the conflict there will spill over into their territory indian advocates , however , argue that the logic of the military expansion is dubious here in roraima state , which borders instead on venezuela and guyana the armed forces are just seizing an opportunity to revive a program that has long been desired but long lain dormant , egon heck , executive secretary of the indigenous missionary council , a roman catholic church group , said in an interview in bras lia , the capital there is nothing to justify the construction of military bases in roraima , because no concrete guerrilla threat exists there military officials in the border region , at the headquarters of the amazon military command in manaus and at the army chief of staff office in bras lia declined to discuss the issues that yanomami leaders have raised , failing to respond to two weeks of telephone calls , faxes and email messages seeking comment in a letter , however , the minister of defense , geraldo quint o , blamed the tense situation here on what he called a systematic and reiterated campaign on the part of indians and advocacy groups against the army , which historically has always conferred a cordial treatment on the indians he acknowledged the existence of sexual relationships between soldiers and indian women but said he saw no need to intervene because they were consenting relations between adults a relationship that lasts two or three years is not sexual abuse , mr quint o maintained it is natural that these relationships occur , and to block them is to impede the fruit of human nature as perhaps the most primitive of the indigenous peoples of the amazon , the yanomami , who number about 15 , 000 in brazil and another 12 , 000 just across the border in venezuela , are especially vulnerable to the military effort in his recent book , darkness in el dorado , patrick tierney describes the yanomami as having been victimized repeatedly by miners , missionaries and anthropologists since sustained contact with the outside world began in the 1960 s the impact of the increased military presence in yanomami territory appears to have been similar according to davi kopenawa , a yanomami shaman who serves as a tribal spokesman , at least 18 children have already been born of sexual liaisons between soldiers and yanomami women 5 here and 13 in maturac , a yanomami village about 250 miles southwest of here the soldiers have women of their own , so why do n't they bring them along \? he asked they should stop messing with our wives and daughters , and respect our rights instead of abusing us tribal leaders here refused to allow interviews with the women involved , to avoid further humiliation , they said but in a videotaped deposition to the human rights commission of the brazilian congress last year , one woman about 18 years old said she had agreed to have sexual relations with a soldier after he gave her thread and food as gifts the couple had sex in the barracks at the base here , the woman testified the sergeant knew what was going on , but he did nothing , she said through an interpreter it is illegal under federal law for government employees to have sex at their workplace , but that is what these soldiers are doing , said martinho alves da silva , regional delegate for the national indian foundation , the government agency in charge of indigenous affairs they are having sex with yanomami girls in the barracks , on top of cars , in the jungle , at waterfalls mr alves da silva said he had complained to the army about such incidents , with few results they tell us they have taken measures to stop that behavior and opened an internal investigation , he said we would like for federal prosecutors to supervise that process , but they have been unable to do so
last month president bush stood before the united nations general assembly and offered to work with the security council to disarm iraq he has lived up to that promise , and last week the americans submitted a resolution to the security council that , perhaps with minor alterations , deserves the support of all 15 members the debate at the un has been over the nature of the inspections as well as over what threat of force to include if iraq fails to cooperate but the subtext has been american power how washington uses it to deal with the rest of the world that issue has preoccupied the security council members more than the risks posed by iraq s arsenal that is why earnest giveandtake has been vital the resolution warns of serious consequences from iraqi violations , less explicit than the earlier all necessary means language washington has resisted a french proposal that if the inspections fail , the council would have to pass another resolution permitting the use of force it has , however , agreed to call another meeting of the security council at that point we trust that the administration will take this second stage of consultation seriously that would reassure those who worry that all the united states wants is an excuse to go to war equally , washington needs assurance that others are not using negotiations as an excuse to sidestep confrontation with iraq both the french and russians want to tone down the resolution both want to remove a reference to iraq s being in material breach of its un obligations the russians want no mention of serious consequences , while the french would dilute that threat by linking it to the second resolution yesterday , france said it might introduce a competing proposal if it could not reach agreement with the americans none of this seems necessary the aim of the resolution is to give iraq one last chance for peaceful disarmament , and to preserve the legitimacy of the un in his speech last month , mr bush rightly challenged the un to demonstrate that it had resolve and relevance the resolution on the table helps further that cause it gives iraq 30 days to present a full declaration of all aspects of its chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs at the same time , it obliges iraq to provide immediate and unconditional access to all sites chosen by the inspectors and grants the inspectors the broadest powers to roam hans blix , the chief weapons inspector , will address the council tomorrow then wrangling over wording will continue if this resolution , or something close to it , gets the support it deserves , we will finally be in a position to deal with the iraqi threat through serious arms inspections and disarmament demands that are backed by an international commitment to make iraq comply
the redevelopment of times square has finally produced a building worth talking about the new westin hotel on eighth avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets and people are talking about it for a welcome reason the westin has raised a flag over the issue of taste translation many people find it ugly hideous the very embodiment of beauty s evil twin look up , people this is new york we live in one great ugly town not being too hung up on beauty is what makes life here possible , even thrilling in exchange for surrendering refinement , we get a kind of urban poetry that is the envy of the world sometimes it takes outsiders to see it often , outsiders introduce new rhymes the beauty resides , in some sense , in staying an outsider the westin is the consummate outsider s hotel developed and owned by tishman realty and construction company , the 800room westin is the first major new york hotel to open since the four seasons in 1993 the building is a sign a billding board , in robert venturi s phrase and the sign says welcome to nueve york latin american architecture is here ! it is the first completed new york project by arquitectonica , the miamibased firm led by bernardo fortbrescia and laurinda spear mr fortbrescia , who was born in lima , peru , and ms spear were the first architects of the baby boom generation to win largescale commissions the spear house in miami , designed in 1977 with rem koolhaas , was one of the most photographed houses of the late 20th century influenced by the mexican architect luis barragan , the design introduced the firm s carnivalesque vocabulary of crisp , brightly colored , geometric forms among the first of their largescale commissions were three residential highrises on miami s brickell avenue that were instrumental in defining a new identity for the city by then , miami had largely ceased to be a city of the south it had become a metropolis of the north , a magnet for people and capital from throughout latin america the influx of cuban refugees had been superseded by waves of vibrant cosmopolitanism to which the brickell avenue buildings gave a strong public face the latin strain is moving farther north again north americans are long accustomed to it in music , theater , film , literature and dance it has been a presence in new york architecture , too , but is seldom grasped as such we have work by latin american architects here , but not , thus far , an easily discernible latin american architecture this is changing the city s shifting demographic is one reason our architecture seems destined to become increasingly latinized in the years ahead a more important reason stems from the exhaustion of the northern european version of the western tradition that linear , 19thcentury view of history has fallen apart as a measure of urban architecture postmodernism , a movement that tried to extend that line beyond its natural span , had the opposite effect of running it into the ground one tradition does not fit all there are other routes back to the mediterranean , paths that do not take us through london , paris and berlin and the future of new york architecture may well represent the further unfolding of southern routes from the old world to the new if so , the westin hotel is a pivotal building like it or not , the building signifies an important shift in the history of taste arquitectonica has acquired two additional new york commissions since work on the hotel began a large residential project in long island city , queens , and , with the new york office of cooper robertson partners , an urban design plan for the penn yards site on the west side of midtown manhattan the hotel s 45story tower rises behind a 10story base the base , which itself appears to float above the fourstory e walk entertainment complex , is the weakest part of the design the base s corset silhouette is comely its painted surface goes flat the base is an improvement on the original design , which envisioned a vast and redundant mural of new york city tourist attractions that has been replaced by an abstract domino of punchedup masonry colors but the colors do n't hold their own with the designcontrolled signage that wraps the base along 42nd street and the abstract patterns unhappily recall the twodimensional public art projects of 30 years ago if the owners take my advice , they will redo the base with a stylized version of calvin klein billboards a folded photomural black and white pictures of pouty young people some slashes of color for accent , perhaps an homage to the street s unsanitized , john rechy , russ meyer past \( the graphic designer tibor kalman would have known how to do it \) the tower is erotic enough you might take it for a new york 21stcentury version of the victorian cupid around which picadilly circus revolves the tower is , in any case , the first of the area s new buildings to project a clear sense of place into the midtown skyline it is as if the libidinous energies driven underground by the new 42 have found momentary release
ogden , utah , feb 11 this is a workingclass town , gritty and proud , less a bedroom community for salt lake city , 35 miles south , than its own master , with an economic base of heavy industry , small businesses and government jobs now , ogden is aspiring for more with its own sliver of the winter olympics as host of the curling competition , ogden is striving to become a national center for the sport , perhaps the most arcane of the games with a profile somewhere between low and no it involves players sliding a rock down an ice sheet , using brooms to guide it to the tee in the house , and heaven help the shooter who crosses the hog line wildly popular in canada and a few european countries , curling has never caught on in the united states beyond a narrow band of coldweather towns near canada many of the best american players hail from bemidji , minn , 230 miles north of minneapolis , making bemidji the current hotbed of curling , said stacey liapis , a member of the american women s team , who is from the town but the olympic tournament has spurred so much interest in ogden , utah s sixthlargest city , with 77 , 000 people , that curling has become a civic obsession kids play old folks play ogden now has its own curling club , and as part of the city s annual winter festival , residents play in a tournament , using frozen hams instead of rocks , which cost 600 the winning team keeps the ham curling and ogden , we 're a team , said connie duran , the owner of '02 4 you , an olympic souvenir shop on 25th street , the commercial center we 're proud of curling we 're jazzed it s exciting to have the venue here it s attracting people even people who said they had never curled , had never seen curling , had known nothing about it and never intended to curl enthused over its presence for competition that began today with 10 men s teams and 10 women s teams the united states , which has one of each , is considered a longshot for a medal , even though the american men s team defeated sweden , the world champion , 105 dennis stephens , a roofing contractor who looked more like a cowboy than a curler as he ate lunch today at karen s caf , said he could not be prouder of ogden for its inclusion in the olympics not that he has plans to buy a curling ticket it s good for the town , mr stephens said even though i do n't know anything about the sport and i have n't seen it , i'm glad it s here it is difficult to measure the tournament s economic impact on ogden some hotels and motels are packed with fans who eat at places like karen s i know most of the curlers , said the owner , karen waters and hunt for pins in places like ms duran s but the emotional and psychological boost seems more important , as if civic selfesteem were improved even by a connection to one of the strangest of olympic sports ms waters said , it s definitely raised the profile of the town we 've never had that happen before i'm thrilled the curlers are here i wanted them all to stay at my house olympic banners around town , colorful pictures of rocks and curlers on storefronts and the new communal enthusiasm are helping ogden spiff up and improve upon what it has always been , a rugged , western depot with rail lines carving the valley floor and factories belching smoke to mountaintop heights not that ogden cannot find other reasons to boast john m browning , the gunsmith , was born here in 1855 the golden spike , uniting america by rail , was driven at nearby promontory summit in 1869 and the osmonds donny , marie and lots of others came from here snowbasin , site of olympic skiing events , is about 17 miles away , so skiing is not really ogden s event curling is , adding new colors to the town plumage , and many residents said they hope it has a lasting effect it is by no means a certainty along 25th street , for every new shop with pricey items , there is a boardedup storefront , and store owners like mary malen , a fourthgeneration resident who lives near a mountain that bears her family name , said the closing of a nordstrom s department store three years ago had hurt the city s efforts to improve its commercial viability mayor matthew r godfrey conceded that his city had been undergoing major changes in recent years higherincome residents have been leaving for suburbs nearer the wasatch mountains , mr godfrey said , with an influx of hispanics replacing them one of mr godfrey s priorities is recruiting new businesses , an effort that became much easier , he said , after prospects learned that ogden was to be an olympic city at one time , they would n't give us the time of day , the mayor said now , we 're a place with olympic events , and they 're interested ogden s civic leaders had envisioned staging part of the olympic hockey tournament but when an arena was planned in the early 1990 s , long before the 2002 games were awarded to salt lake city , ogden lacked the money to build one large enough for hockey so plans were scaled back and the ice sheet opened in 1993 with 2 , 200 seats , too few for olympic hockey but just right for olympic curling today the arena was filled with noisy spectators , including jim and ruth may , who said they had bought tickets because they could not escape ogden s curlmania , and they were curious as some of the best women s teams in the world took to the ice with their rocks and brooms , mr may looked on with keen interest this was all new to him we 've always been known for skiing , the mountains , snow sports and having none of the congestion of salt lake city , he said we 're still a small town , a nice town and now we have curling photos as host of olympic curling , ogden , utah s sixthlargest city , hopes to become a national center for the sport , which is not well known in this country downtown odgen is dwarfed by the surrounding mountains dennis stephens ate lunch at karen s caf , surrounded by decorations advertising the olympic curling event \(

given our tight economy , heightened national security concerns and renewed anxiety about our supply of oil , it s time that we in the northeast became serious about conserving electricity conservation is a meaningful act , just when many of us are looking for something of lasting good to do for our country investment in more efficient electrical equipment in our homes , offices and factories benefits us , individually and collectively , for the long term in fact , few individual acts could be more in our longterm national interest though oil prices have dropped 30 percent over the past several months , we all know the saving is temporary with oil prices , what goes down , goes up by contrast , the payoff for investing in more efficient lighting and in heating and cooling equipment is permanent first , let s see what investment in saving electricity does for the pocketbook let s assume that all of us from virginia to massachusetts homeowners , businesspeople and factory managers modernized our lighting and heating and cooling systems based on real experience , we each would immediately cut our electric bills an average of 25 percent at that rate we 'd recoup any investments within two years from lower electric bills or sooner still with utility and state rebates factored in for the region as a whole , the aggregate annual saving would be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars reducing electrical use by that same 25 percent in each home , office and plant would cut regional power consumption by a whopping 133 million kilowatt hours that could be enough to enable us to shut down dozens of power plants and cut our oil imports from saudi arabia by more than half greater energy selfsufficiency translates directly to greater national security and maneuvering room in global diplomacy another winner is the environment that same 25 percent regional saving in electricity would reduce sulfur and other emissions by thousands of tons a year as well , easing the global warming threat and improving the air we breathe too often we nod approvingly at new rebate programs for investing in energysaving lighting but do n't take advantage of them we perk up at news of a new more energyefficient heater or airconditioner , but we do n't pursue it it is estimated that 90 percent of the northeast corridor s homeowners and 70 percent of its businesses could very readily achieve that 25 percent saving simply by taking action rebate offers are better than ever right now , and the paperwork is simple , sometimes even nonexistent some large contractors will give a rebate up front and collect from utilities or states themselves couple state or utility rebates with the variety of deals available from responsible contractors , and modernization can wind up costing nothing municipalities and parking garages can benefit too at 8 watts apiece rather than 68 , led bulbs in traffic lights save our cities 1 , 200 a year over incandescent bulbs per intersection they 'll also last 10 times longer , reducing accidents caused by burnedout traffic signals or changing bulbs at rush hour energy harvesting controls in parking garages turn lights off during daylight and on at dusk occupancy sensors turn on the lights only when people are using the space the united states remains the biggest electricity consumer in the world , and we depend on that electricity for our prosperity and standard of living every kilowatt we conserve reduces our vulnerability to a californiatype scenario right here the atlantic corridor from virginia to massachusetts accounts for 16 percent of nation s energy consumption , and about as much as all of europe and south america combined the united states imports about 40 percent of the oil necessary to generate electricity unfortunately as we have learned recently , much of that oil comes from countries that may not be the steadfast suppliers we once believed them to be utilities or electrical contractors will gladly provide a free survey and recommendations even in the unlikely event that none of your electrical equipment needs modernizing , they can make present equipment run better longer that in itself would likely cut your energy bill by 5 percent or more when s the best time to modernize \? it s best to get it done before next summer s cooling season , when electrical demand peaks electric power conservation is the right thing to do , and the right time to do it is now drawing \( tom bloom \)
washington the motifs have all been seen before thin and fat stripes , radiating diamonds and sticklike figures , some with two heads but none are quite so compelling as those in hidden threads of peru q'ero textiles , a dazzling exhibition of 39 colorsplashed shawls , ponchos , wrapping cloths , hats and festival bags on view here at the textile museum the show , the first comprehensive review outside peru of q'ero weaving , demonstrates the q'ero indians' mastery of the craft it also shows how their images evolved over less than a century from figurative to abstract , about the same time that paintings by western artists picasso , braque and mondrian happened to be making the same journey q'ero is 100 miles east of cuzco in southern peru and 30 miles from the nearest road it takes two days by foot or horseback , up the rocky eastern slopes of the andes , to reach the six hamlets where about 400 q'ero indians still live centuries ago , the q'ero carved out a selfsufficient existence that continues today raising alpaca , llamas and sheep in pastures at 15 , 000 feet , growing potatoes and corn in fields at 6 , 000 feet , and producing their own clothing and building stone houses with thatch roofs now as then , the men knit the hats and the women weave the fabrics that they all wear but rarely allow others to acquire they work on basic , fourstake outdoor looms to create cloths distinctive for their throbbing patterns , vibrant colors , glinting surfaces and rugged textures the q'ero indians' mastery of prehispanic weaving has long been superior to the weaving of other indigenous andean groups , yet their work was rarely seen much of what is on display at the textile museum was collected over decades by john cohen , the photographer , documentary filmmaker and musician in 1956 , he was a 24yearold graduate student in art at yale university who was eager to research the textiles of the 20thcentury descendants of the ancient paracas weavers he had admired their masterworks from 300 bc at the brooklyn museum and wanted to see if the visual richness and technical excellence of the paracas embroideries had survived in the work of contemporary weavers encouraged by the painter josef albers and his wife , the weaver anni albers , as well as junius bird , who was curator of south american archaeology at the american museum of natural history in new york at the time , mr cohen went to peru he had an introductory letter from josef albers to the director of lima s archaeological museum , who gave him a map of indigenous weaving areas , which did not include the q'ero none of their weaving could be found in the stores in cuzco where tourists shopped , mr cohen said but an archaeologist there told me of a place where they weave from the left mr cohen knew that that was impossible , because weaving is done from the right and the left but the misstatement made him curious later he realized that the archaeologist had probably meant not weaving from the left but spinning from the left , which the q'ero do they spin from the left and from the right to create spin stripes in remarkable herringbone patterns mr cohen traveled up the andes and , with the help of a wealthy young man who lived in a hacienda nearby , arrived there several weeks later he found that textiles woven as early as 1900 had images of ch'unchu , a tall mythic indian man wearing a towering feather headdress that image , seen in the show in a 1900 fringed red coca bag and several early shawls , changed slowly over time shawls produced decades later , also in the show , are embellished with abstract faces , rectangular eyes and a mouth , topped by bold angled stripes , the last traces of the feathers on that trip , mr cohen acquired only a few pieces for the museum of natural history in new york and a few for himself , one of which is in the show i traded my harmonica for the beautiful red knitted hat , he said only much later , in 1977 , on the fifth of eight trips he made to q'ero to study weaving , photograph the people , record their music and make documentary films , was he able to buy a work by the most accomplished of the weavers , nicolasa quispe chura she finally agreed to let me buy one of her stunning shawls , mr cohen said it is a tour de force of design , a red , black and white pattern of 18 diamonds with rays abstract symbols of the sun that look alike but are all different the shawl is also a feat of craftsmanship like all the weaving on view , this shawl has no hems , because the edges were completed on the loom , a trick easier to achieve on textiles that have less pattern than one like this , with all its radiating diamonds nicolasa quispe chura finished her shawl by darning it so subtly that only experts can see the hand weaving , giving them one of many reasons to regard her as a master in all , mr cohen bought or bartered for dozens of woven or knitted q'ero pieces , 50 of which went to the american museum of natural history and 28 to the textile museum i 've almost always given them away and for good reason , mr cohen said these textiles are not just commodities , because they communicate the spirit of their makers as josef albers used to say , 'to distribute material things divides them to distribute spiritual things multiplies them' ann pollard rowe , the curator of western hemisphere collections at the textile museum , said that mr cohen s gifts had finally made it possible for the museum to put on a q'ero exhibition ms rowe organized the show and wrote the catalog with mr cohen , whose photographs also illustrate it \( his photos can also be found in the collections of the metropolitan museum of art and the corcoran gallery of art \) in the catalog , a photograph by steven webster captures a q'ero easter celebration although the q'ero are nominally roman catholic , many celebrations incorporate indigenous rituals and their textiles on easter sunday , before the communal feasting begins , the q'ero people sanctify their fabrics , mr cohen said they take the finest women s shawls and men s vicuna scarves produced in the previous year and raise them up on long forked poles to the top of an arch of timbers then the townspeople move in a procession through the arch bearing crosses and banners to bless the weavings , he said , marching to the music of two flutes and a drum photos a q'ero cap with fringe tassel , left , is knitted in brown , black and white alpaca and decorated with diamonds and stick figures below , a red , black and white festival bag , woven in about 1900 , depicts human figures in tall feather headdresses a q'ero shawl in red , black and white by nicolasa quisepe chura \( photographs from the textile museum \)
us naval air station , guant namo bay , cuba , march 15 an elaborate social system is evolving here between american military guards and their captives from the afghan war the system , controlled by the guards and tested repeatedly by the inmates , is largely based on privileges given mainly so they can be taken away as a way to maintain discipline and encourage cooperation the little extras here at this sweltering , dusty 25acre barbedwire camp include novels , like love stories and arab legends , with 1001 arabian nights on order the inmates regularly drink sweet tea , although though it is warm , not hot , in case they try to throw it on a guard curried chicken has been added to the dinner menu this week , prisoners who were having trouble reading were given glasses the detainees are allowed to talk with each other , and officials have grouped them by language they can call out to reporters to proclaim their innocence without being punished they apparently receive firstclass medical care a neurologist and a thoracic surgeon were recently flown in some prisoners were seen this week riding in golf carts officials said they started using the motorized carts to transport the prisoners to the interrogation huts , several hundred feet away , because it was quicker and because the prisoners' leg shackles were rubbing their ankles raw when they had to walk there brig gen michael r lehnert , the marine who commands the task force overseeing the prison camp , said the privileges were useful tools in maintaining discipline because what was given could be taken away you ca n't do much with a detainee if they have nothing , he said but since the first prisoners arrived on jan 11 , almost none of the privileges has been revoked general lehnert said he was reluctant to revoke any , even though the prisoners have been acting out , because he did not want to encourage them quite often , what the detainees want is a reaction , he said they would like to be able to demonstrate , 'look at what s happening to me ! i'm being punished' there are 300 prisoners , from at least 32 countries , being held in the camp s 8 foot by 8 foot chainlink cages some are quite young , in their early teens , but most are in their 20 s and 30 s there is at least one father and son the prisoners have closeshaved heads , but many are growing beards some have started doing pushups and situps they are let out into a small pen for 15 minutes twice a week for exercise , and many pray five times a day still , military officials say the prisoners are enormously frustrated and angry because their future is so uncertain officials here say the prisoners' fates are up to washington but the bush administration has given no indication of what it intends to do with them after they are interrogated , has set no timetable for the questioning , and has not lodged any charges against them general lehnert said most of the prisoners were either highranking taliban or suspected al qaeda terrorists , but the deputy camp commander , lt col bill cline , said some were victims of circumstance and probably innocent secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld has said that any number of things could happen to the prisoners , including their being held indefinitely in any case , the military is preparing here for the long term bulldozers are clearing ground on a cliff overlooking the caribbean , and construction is to begin this weekend on a permanent 16 million camp there that can hold up to 2 , 000 inmates the idea of being moved to a permanent camp has left many prisoners anxious , officials say , and their acting out has taken many forms they have yelled to their guards that they are going to kill them they have thrown gravel at them many of the prisoners have been on a hunger strike intermittently since feb 27 , although the number refusing food and drink has steadily dwindled we 've been on a hunger strike for 14 days , and nobody cares ! one prisoner yelled in english at a reporter who was being given a tour around the perimeter we need the world to know about us we are innocent here in this place we 've got no legal rights nothing so can somebody know about us \? can you tell the world about us \? general lehnert said that if such yelling became disruptive to the camp , he would put a stop to it , but that it had not yet reached that point he added that he considered the prisoners media savvy and shrewd in any case , he told reporters , if the yelling turned into a problem , reporters , who are kept on a very short leash here by the military , would be given even less access most likely , to tell you the truth , we may end up moving you back so that you can no longer provide the catalyst for them to do those things , he said to help ease the tension , general lehnert has taken to addressing the prisoners once a week over a loudspeaker at the camp , and did so today for the third time he told them that their move to the more permanent cells does not mean that you will remain here forever if you have done nothing wrong , leaving unsaid what would happen to them if they had done something wrong general lehnert said repeatedly that he did not have control over their future nothing you or i can do will either delay or speed the actions of those who will determine your future , he told them i cannot honestly tell you what will happen to you or how long you will be here he offered them little hope , except to say their lives would continue to improve if they followed the rules colonel cline said he did not perceive the situation as explosive , but he knows the prisoners are watching their captors and sizing them up i do n't sense a powder keg , but they 're watching us 24 7 , he said they 're watching what we do , they 're watching what time we do it , they 're watching how we do it they 're scheming one of the advantages of giving them books to read , he said , is that it takes their eyes off the guards , at least for a while there s not much that they want for here , he added , except their freedom photo an inmate is taken from the interrogation huts at the prison camp in guant namo bay , cuba officials say that despite increased privileges at the camp , many prisoners are becoming intensely anxious about their fate \( associated press \)
a record set , a trade made , a shutout pitched baseball carried out the motions of late summer , but the hazy specter of a strike hovered over the fields yesterday no one knew whether tomorrow would follow did tom glavine pitch his last game in an atlanta braves uniform \? did the montreal expos play their last game as a franchise \? would fans return , or ever want to return \? the uncertainty was unsettling and obvious i looked up in the stands and i saw people clapping and it seemed a little different , like you really did n't know if we were going to be here tomorrow or what was going to happen , cincinnati shortstop barry larkin said after the reds' 70 victory over st louis in cinergy field it was kind of a creepy feeling ten games were played yesterday while negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement continued throughout the night in new york there was some refuge , at least , in the quantifiable fine print of the box scores and transactions the cubs' mark bellhorn set a record in commissioner bud selig s ballpark , becoming the first player in national league history to homer from both sides of the plate in the same inning bellhorn s homers came in the fourth inning of the cubs' 1310 victory over milwaukee in miller park the brewers traded righthanded pitcher jamey wright to st louis for a minor league player and a player to be named wright , scheduled to start for the cardinals in wrigley field this afternoon , said he would drive to chicago last night , even if he did not know whether he would find a game when he got there as much as players tried to keep the strike in the back of their minds , there were signs both on and off the field that showed otherwise glavine seemed to be lacking his usual control in a 41 loss to the pirates in pittsburgh although he denied it , perhaps glavine , who issued three walks and hit two batters , was distracted by his duties as the nl s player representative immediately after the loss , he left for manhattan to join the negotiating his own future is in doubt , since he is in the final year of his contract along with greg maddux , with whom glavine has formed the foundation of the braves' rotation the braves have less of a concern than the expos montreal s entire roster might be free agents next year , if the expos fall victim to contraction , as major league baseball has said it wants to do on the field in philadelphia before their game , expos first baseman michael barrett tried not to dwell on whether this was the expos' last game it s one thing after another , especially with our franchise , barrett said we 've been through so much we 've been able to play through the contraction talk by playing baseball disbanding or contracting the team is by far the worstcase scenario preparing for that is a lot tougher than you can imagine the phillies were traveling to new york for their weekend series against the mets larry bowa , the philadelphia manager , recalled his days as a player before the 1981 strike when he was told he could go anywhere the reasons then were different , bowa said it was about salary and pension the salary is as good as any and the pension is second to none , so i feel good about the results i have a hard time relating to revenue sharing and luxury tax with all the money that s out there many of the fans took the same position handmade signs expressed their frustration in philadelphia \( please do n't strike during my lifetime , read one sign held by a very young ponytailed girl at veterans stadium \) , and in minneapolis came the admonishment money is replaceable , fans are not in the eighth inning of a 20 loss to seattle at the metrodome , fans shouted no strike ! to the twins' player representative , denny hocking , when he got up to bat at least hocking still had his sense of humor , turning to the umpire , larry vanover , and saying who are they talking to , me or you \? the game itself was significant in the standings seattle s jamie moyer pitched seven scoreless innings , giving the mariners their second victory in their past six games and helping them keep pace with the anaheim angels in the american league wildcard race doug wick , 54 , of st cloud , minn , has been a twins fan since the team moved from washington in 1961 but until this year , he had not attended a game since 1994 , soured by the memory of the strike that year that wiped out the end of the regular season and postseason success the twins still lead the al central by 16 games over the chicago white sox brought wick to his third game of the season he fears a long strike will ruin the twins' chances of getting a new stadium , and will ultimately spell doom for the franchise i wo n't go to any games next year , that s for sure , wick said photo cubs' mark bellhorn set an nl record yesterday by homering from both sides of the plate in the same inning \( associated press \)
how will the plans presented yesterday by some of the world s most renowned architects be translated into concrete and steel on the site of the world trade center \? that question is being debated by urban planners , local residents , developers and public officials involved in rebuilding lower manhattan with acres of vacant office space downtown , there is a consensus that five years or more will pass before the first commercial tower goes up on the 16acre parcel of land where the twin towers once stood it is also likely that whatever is built there will not resemble what was unveiled yesterday in the winter garden at the world financial center a bewildering array of crystalline towers , gardens in the sky , bedrock memorial parks 70 feet below street level , and the tallest and largest building in the world in the coming months , the lower manhattan development corporation and the port authority of new york and new jersey , which owns the trade center site , will make a plan based on the work submitted yesterday but officials say that the developer or developers who eventually build on the site will not be bound by , say , the proposal by norman foster for an oversized sixmillionsquarefoot building that s contingent on financing and the market , said joseph j seymour , executive director of the port authority whether it 'll happen exactly as it was presented this morning or not , i do n't think anybody can say at this time the architects' imaginative ideas will feed the public s desire to see what a restored skyline might look like but the demand for office space , which is remarkably weak today , and the nature of the corporations , businesses and institutions that will move into any buildings on the site will have just as great an influence on what the buildings will look like and when they are built the value of an architect s conceptual plan , said charles a gargano , chairman of the empire state development corporation , is that it will lay out a schematic plan for the size and location of the memorial and the reintroduction of the street grid it also identifies the areas of the site for commercial development the development corporation could then proceed with an international competition for a memorial design , mr gargano said , and the state could start on transportation projects office buildings will be years down the line , he added in short , the architects' plans show how a memorial to the roughly 2 , 800 people who died at the trade center could work with office towers , museums shops and housing that is all the exotic models on display at the winter garden represent , said a director of the lower manhattan development corporation who spoke on the condition of anonymity fundamentally it s a sideshow because none of these things will be built , he said but they did show a variety of ways the site could have commercial development and a memorial without looking like a mess a major downtown landlord took a harsher view they should 've stuck to urban planning , not architecture , he said a lot of it is abstract you ca n't build that stuff ultimately , the market is going to dictate what s needed and when it s needed douglas durst , a developer who built the first of four skyscrapers in times square under a statesponsored redevelopment plan for that neighborhood , said he had a pretty good idea how it would all work out , whether the developer is larry a silverstein , who currently has the lease for the trade center site , or other builders although the times square design guidelines were not the result of an international architectural competition , mr durst said he expected the process downtown to be similar to what happened on 42nd street the times square development guidelines had been discarded , he said at the trade center site , i would expect the developer will negotiate what the buildings will look like ultimately , it would resemble the conceptual plan only in spirit mr durst said that no developer could build without a tenant , and the tenant will play an important role in determining the size and shape of an office tower an investment bank usually wants huge , columnfree floors for trading , while law and accounting firms prefer smaller floors with as many windowed offices as possible many developers believe that a building taller than 60 or 65 stories is both expensive and hard to market , given the public s current fear of tall buildings with as much as 17 million square feet of vacant or available office space in lower manhattan , no developer is rushing to build a new tower soon the situation is even worse in the area surrounding the trade center , where one out of every four floors of office space is empty it 'll probably take a decade to fill the space that is currently vacant , said robert d yaro , president of the regional plan association we should spend the next decade building transportation improvements , public spaces , parks then the private sector will come because it s the most interesting and accessible business district in the world the architects' plans yesterday depicted anywhere from 6 million to 10 million square feet of office space the port authority originally wanted to replace the 11 million square feet of office space at the trade center and include 600 , 000 square feet of retail space but critics said that this was too much in a speech last week outlining his vision for downtown , mayor michael r bloomberg talked about investments in mass transit , treelined boulevards , parks and new housing , as well as a oneseat ride to the area s international airports those investments would justify the development of 10 million square feet of space in lower manhattan , he said mr bloomberg proposed the creation of a federal tax incentive zone to attract foreign multinational corporations to downtown barry gosin , vice chairman of newmark company , a real estate firm , said that he agreed with the mayor s priorities what downtown needs is a 247 environment more housing , more retail , street life and better transportation , mr gosin said the office buildings will follow photos studio daniel libeskind this plan envisions a memorial space that sinks 70 feet into ground zero , to the bedrock foundation on the footprints of the twin towers a museum will be an entrance to the memorial , and a promenade will encircle it a building 1 , 776 feet tall features gardens of the world public spaces include the park of heroes a new rail station has a concourse linking path trains , subways , hotels , a performing arts center , office towers , underground malls and streetlevel shops , restaurants and cafes , creating a dense and exhilarating affirmation of new york and a skyscraper reasserting the preeminence of freedom and beauty foster partners the footprints of the towers are envisioned as a void going down below street level to form the center of the memorial , with a green park named world square surrounding the footprints a twinned crystalline tower that would be the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world would be built , with its architecture based on triangles instead of rectangles the two halves of the twinned tower would meet at three points to create observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities treefilled spaces , described as parks in the sky , would purify the air that ventilates the building , while the multilayered facade would let the towers avoid airconditioning for up to 80 percent of the year glass elevator funiculars would run up the corners of the building the belowground transit center is marked by a glass canopy united architects this plan calls for a memorial below ground in the area around the footprints of the twin towers , surrounded by a plaza above ground , five buildings with sloping , cantilevered surfaces touch one another , rising above the memorial and partially enclosing it , to create what the designers called a cathedrallike space a sky memorial high above ground would allow viewers to look down on the footprints the tallest of the five towers would be 1 , 620 feet tall while the buildings are structurally independent , and could be built independently in five phases , the towers would join at the 60th floor , with a public space five stories high encompassing gardens , shopping , cafes , a sports center , a fitness center and a conference center peterson littenberg this plan , by a small architectural planning firm that has been under contract to the lower manhattan development corporation for planning at the site , created a whole new city district with its heart in a public garden that is dictated by the footprints of the twin towers this garden would be a quiet place , surrounded by a 35foot wall and sunken below the streets memorials could be both in the garden and elsewhere on the site the south tower s footprint would be a pool of water , and the north footprint would hold a 2 , 197seat amphitheater above a museum at the bedrock level surrounding the garden the plan envisions 17 building parcels the architects planned two 1 , 400foot towers , each with a garden at the 10th floor , flanking the transit station this plan features restoration of streets that originally ran across the site , and also a circle at liberty and west streets that stands at the head of a boulevard running to the southern tip of manhattan think three concepts were developed by this team one , the world cultural center , left , creates latticework structures enclosing buildings by different architects on a program of cultural facilities the memorial , a museum , a performing arts center , an amphitheater and others a second concept , the great room , top right , is a vast covered public plaza uniting many elements under an enormous glass ceiling a memorial covering 13 acres is the entrance to the great hall of the transit center two glass cylinders protect the footprints of the twin towers this concept includes a 2 , 100foottall building , the world s tallest , that houses offices , hotel and a transmission tower a third concept , the sky park , is a 10block , 16acre rooftop public park that floats above the street the memorial is defined by the open squares of the footprints of the twin towers and including the space above , below and around them the park also includes groves of trees , an amphitheater , cafes , a skating rink , fountains , gardens and sites for more memorials below the park are cultural facilities , retail space , a transportation center , a hotel convention center and office space on the edge of the park , three large office towers including the tallest one in the world are designed as independent buildings \(

16 acres of sky gardens and 16 acres of cultural space as well as a million square feet of retail space around the transit station the architects described this as the vertical city while there was no estimate given of the total amount of office space , the presentation showed that over time buildings emerge from the site to give more than adequate retail and commercial space a reflecting pool with bridges passing over the footprints of the former towers brings light to the station , which is situated below street level , between greenwich and church streets richard meier partners this plan focuses on a memorial square as a great public space in the tradition of rockefeller center glassbottom reflecting pools are set on the footprints of the twin towers beneath them , the shafts below the footprints become sites for memorial rooms cultural facilities include memorial museum and freedom library , a concert hall , an opera house and performing arts theaters framing the edges of the site the transit station is reminiscent of the glass shed architecture of old rail stations the square gives a potential for multiple memorial sites , with fingers extending into the surrounding streets and out into the hudson river , where a memorial park floats the east and north sides of the 12 acres of open space are bounded by hybrid buildings that rise 1 , 111 feet , with five glass towers , each joined by three interconnecting horizontal floors , and the facades forming ceremonial gateways leading into the site at ground level memorials are also placed on the tops of the

ever since joe gardella retired from his engineering job five years ago , he and his wife , cecile , have been thinking about selling their fourbedroom house in milford , mass they recently checked out the modern condominium units near their home and even considered relocating to fort myers beach , fla but they decided to stay put and to renovate we have such equity in this house that it would be foolish to try to sell it , because we would have to put that same amount of money into a much smaller condominium , said mr gardella , 70 we decided to make our existing home more modern , to keep up with all of our kids the gardellas , who paid off their mortgage 10 years ago , chose to remodel their kitchen and dining room the project , which took two months , cost about 40 , 000 a local contractor , true t davis building and remodeling , knocked down walls to make the two rooms flow together and added many extras , like recessed lighting , granite countertops , oak floors and a center island with new appliances aside from maintenance on the roof and heating system , the project was the first major renovation of the home since the couple bought it 27 years ago many homeowners around the country are undertaking similar projects , and for many economic reasons while stock prices have declined sharply , home values have remained strong in many parts of the country interest rates are low , making it cheaper to finance a renovation and , in contrast to financial assets , a home is an investment that can also be enjoyed prices for most renovations have held steady while some contractors felt only a dip in business after sept 11 , others are still trying to recover , which means that they may be willing to get to your project sooner the national association of the remodeling industry predicts that americans will spend 163 billion on renovations this year , up 35 percent from 2001 and 87 percent from 2000 much of the money is being spent by people who have moved recently \( this year alone , sales of existing homes are expected to reach 54 million units , breaking last year s record of 53 million \) renovation demand is strong in highpriced metropolitan markets like boston , san francisco and new york trading up to a larger house has become prohibitively expensive for many people in such areas , so they are deciding to make changes to their current homes instead the old days of selling a house and moving on up is not happening for some people , said true davis , the gardellas' contractor budgetminded homeowners are expanding their living space by converting basements into playrooms or media rooms , he said homeowners who are less concerned about money have installed home theaters , wine cellars and even cigar bars with builtin humidors , others say kitchen and bathroom makeovers , though , remain the most popular projects , experts say , mainly because styles are changing constantly these renovations also have the highest rate of return on average , homeowners can expect to recoup around 80 percent of their investments in major kitchen and bathroom remodeling , according to remodeling magazine , though the figures vary around the country there are also high rates of return for master bedroom , sunroom and family room additions , the magazine says finding a good contractor helps to ensure the best rate of return , not to mention the best results you 've heard you get what you pay for that s very true in remodeling , said david tyson , a designer and remodeling contractor in charlotte , nc the rule of thumb is to get at least three to five written estimates before signing a contract but the best way to narrow the pool of candidates may be to ask neighbors in fact , the remodeling association says that nearly threequarters of renovation business comes from client referrals or word of mouth mrs gardella , 69 , a retired nurse , said she saw mr davis s van outside a neighbor s house and asked her neighbor about his work the neighbor was happy to show her how mr davis had repaired water damage on the first floor you want someone who asks where to place the dumpster , whether the dog goes out or stays in , when the kids go to school , said kevin mcnulty , executive vice president of the association you want a professional of course , you 'll also want to set a realistic budget and stay within it , though some projects may give you sticker shock a major kitchen renovation runs about 40 , 000 , on average renovation experts suggest that homeowners leave a 5 to 10 percent cushion for unexpected expenses in some cases , they add , homeowners may also need to factor in the cost of temporarily renting an apartment or staying in a hotel , plus expenses for meals some contractors may provide portable minikitchen units that can be set up in a dining room or on a porch the gardellas said they were able to make do without leaving their home we have a microwave set up and a toaster , and we have a wendy s right up the corner , mr gardella said and we 've got our kids around who are fairly close , so we sponge off them
the senate is to be commended for overcoming some justifiable misgivings and approving the homeland security bill , something that both president bush and the american people plainly wanted the consolidation of 22 agencies and nearly 170 , 000 federal employees into a new domestic security department is the most ambitious piece of government reengineering since the creation of the defense department more than 50 years ago the senate also did the right thing by approving another very useful piece of legislation arising from the events of 9 11 , a terrorism insurance bill that could provide a needed boost to the economy like just about everything involving the 107th congress , none of this was easy approval of the new cabinet department came only after republican leaders promised wary senators that a bunch of mischievous , probusiness amendments that the house added to the bill at the last minute would be redone next year inevitably , there was some ambiguity about what that meant the senate thought it heard a firm promise to repeal these provisions some house members said they would merely be revised the senate should stick to its guns and make sure the offending amendments are jettisoned altogether regrettably , however , this congress is about to recede into history without crafting a decent unemployment insurance package that would give hope to the jobless now that the senate has adjourned , the responsibility for preventing this shameful outcome rests squarely on the house , which will meet tomorrow to clear up a few details on the homeland security bill , and on president bush , who needs to show the same passion for the victims of the recession that he did for homeland security at issue is the federal emergency unemployment assistance program , authorized last march as part of an economic stimulus package the program , which provides 13 weeks of temporary federal help to jobless workers whose state benefits have ended , is scheduled to expire on dec 28 both chambers passed very different bills to extend the program the senate bill would extend it through march 29 the house would keep it alive for a mere five weeks beyond the end of the year and then only for people who are already enrolled by dec 28 under this scenario , thousands of workers who are expected to exhaust their regular benefits early in the new year would get no federal help the senate rightly rejected the house version as too stingy the only hope for the unemployed , therefore , is for the house to accept the more generous senate plan tomorrow that s a long shot , but if the house does nothing , the program will stop dead on dec 28 , not only denying federal help to workers whose state benefits expire in january but robbing people already in the program of benefits that are still due house republicans argue that the 5 billion senate bill is too expensive they also promise to make everyone whole when they come back in january this is a risky scenario it s also callous , especially in view of the house s stated determination to lock in huge tax cuts for the wealthy when it returns mr bush should intervene
houston , april 9 the sales pitch to major corporations went something like this having trouble with cash flow or meeting profit forecasts \? we can help you manage the numbers , and even put a little cash in your pocket the financial expert was the enron corporation , which until its sudden collapse last year had been widely admired in financial circles for the innovative techniques like offbalancesheet partnerships that it used to enhance its performance but enron did not just find creative ways to manage its own cash flow and profits it marketed that expertise to other major corporations , including att , eli lilly company , owensillinois , lockheed martin and qwest communications , according to documents and interviews with more than a dozen former enron executives it is unclear exactly how many corporations hired enron explicitly to provide financial management services but at least six big companies signed complicated deals , intended to enhance their results with financing and accounting ploys most of the deals involved purchasing other enron services scores of smaller companies may also have participated , executives said enron and a customer might , for instance , agree to swap telecommunications services , use shell corporations or take advantage of accounting loopholes to improve each other s balance sheet or income statement , former enron officials said few of the companies that signed major deals with enron would talk about them , while some that rejected enron s proposals termed them peculiar but former enron employees who marketed the services said that their mission was clear to sell a form of structured finance that could accelerate a customer s earnings or otherwise dress up the corporate books ultimately , that was my job to help companies make earnings , said one former executive of enron s broadband services unit who insisted on not being identified for fear of being drawn into litigation this was one of the secrets of enron one internal training document for the sales staff of the enron energy services unit described the financial advantages to be offered prospective clients , including acceleration of earnings cash from outsourcing for both ees and our customer and the promise to unlock benefits from a difficult tax position that the customer may have none of this would be unusual for wall street investment banks like merrill lynch or j p morgan chase , which in recent years have used a wide range of derivatives and other structured finance products to help big corporations reduce their taxes and deliver just the right amount of profits , quarter after quarter but the enron scandal has heightened the sensitivity of regulators , investors and corporate finance experts to such efforts by underscoring the potential for fraud and deception and the discovery that enron was marketing its financial management techniques has only heightened the anxiety of some experts this is outrageous , said frank partnoy , a former wall street investment banker and now a professor at the university of san diego school of law , after reviewing some of enron s sales presentations in some ways , they were polluting the entire financial system to the extent that others were n't doing this , enron was going out on the road and showing them how to do it mark palmer , a spokesman at enron , declined to comment arthur levitt , as chairman of the securities and exchange commission during the internet stock bubble , spoke out strongly against the practice of earnings management in 1998 , a view he has reiterated many times i fear that we are witnessing an erosion in the quality of earnings , and therefore , the quality of financial reporting , he said managing may be giving way to manipulation the critical point , finance experts say , is to distinguish between altogether legal strategies taking advantage of accounting and tax rules to smooth out bumps in quarterly earnings and financial machinations that are so aggressive that the true nature of a company s finances is misrepresented if accounting is just compliance with 10 , 000 rules , then the party that s expert at gamesmanship can manipulate the rules and help you in exchange for some kind of accommodation fee , said john c coffee jr , a securities law expert at columbia university law school former executives said that a culture of earnings management permeated enron they said it went far beyond the efforts of andrew s fastow , the company s chief financial officer , who was dismissed last october after enron discovered that he had made more than 30 million from a series of offbalancesheet partnerships that did business with enron every unit was doing this , said one former energy services official we were entrepreneurial , and one thing people thought we could do better than anyone else is structured finance former employees in enron s broadband and retail energy services operations said the company s financial management strategies were first developed at enron capital and trade , a unit that prospered in the 1990 s under the leadership of jeffrey k skilling , who helped set up a gas bank to finance struggling gas producers
this week s sales of americana have several outstanding lots , but probably none are showier than the pair of charleshonor lannuier american empirestyle card tables that christie s is selling this afternoon the tables , which retain their lannuier labels and were included in the catalog for the lannuier show at the metropolitan museum of art in 1998 , have winged female caryatid supports and paw feet they have rosewood veneers , matching diestamped brass borders on their aprons and gilded brass starandeagle mounts they were made around 1815 for a philadelphia merchant , george harrison , and his wife , sofia lannuier , a master cabinetmaker from paris , worked in new york from 1803 to 1819 about 125 pieces of his furniture survive , including 28 tables with winged caryatids he is known for giving a distinctive american edge to frenchperiod styles as ulrich leben , a curator , wrote in the met catalog , honor lannuier s furniture which he himself designated as being in the french style is definitely not parisian , but , instead , his own original american expression the tables are being sold separately the estimate for each is 500 , 000 to 800 , 000 gunston hall curators constantly reinterpret collections on the basis of new research , particularly at house museums like gunston hall plantation , the virginia home of george mason mason \( 172592 \) , known as the forgotten founding father , refused to sign the constitution because it lacked a bill of rights but he was one of its chief framers and , in 1776 , the author of the virginia declaration of rights , the first public american document to call for freedom of speech and religion gunston hall , 20 miles south of washington , is owned by virginia and attracts about 45 , 000 visitors a year after a 10year study , the museum decided to auction 250 objects at sotheby s on sunday the viewing ends today the sale includes furniture , carpets , porcelain and lighting devices tom lainhoff , the museum s director , said the pieces were redundant , either too early or too late for the house , and things made in areas that rarely provided goods to the chesapeake market in 1755 mason hired an english carpenterjoiner to design the main house for his 5 , 500acre tobacco and wheat plantation on the potomac river william buckland , a 21yearold who had just completed a sevenyear apprenticeship armed with books like abraham swan s english architect , buckland sailed to america and served a fouryear indenture a fourthgeneration virginian , mason built a oneandahalfstory gabled brick structure , a form popular in virginia since the 1600 s at 7 , 200 square feet , it has four brick chimneys , stone quoins \( blocks \) on the corners and two porches the front porch resembles a columned roman temple the other is gothic with ogival arches the interior has a center hall that is 12 feet wide and two grand rooms for entertaining mason obviously wanted to make an impression with the interiors , said susan borchardt , the museum s deputy director he really embellished them the dining room is a tour de force of carved ornamental woodwork cornice , window and door frames , recessed cupboards , chair rail and baseboard are all elaborated with a fineness of detail and workmanship unsurpassed in colonial virginia , herbert a claiborne wrote in the magazine antiques in april 1953 even its flooring was extravagant the boards are even in width and beautifully finished , ms borchardt said the tongueandgroove flooring used dowels instead of nails the other grand space , the chinese room , is a confection of carving , with tentlike chinese pagodas above the windows and doors the style is an early example of american chinoiserie , a western adaptation of asian motifs it is the only extant chinese room in an american 18thcentury house , mr lainhoff said buckland and his carver , william bernard sears went on to do other houses together , but gunston hall was his masterpiece no estate inventory has surfaced , but one can surmise that mason s furnishings were equally grand he was an astute businessman , one of the wealthiest in virginia , with 90 slaves and about 20 outbuildings in the south , people tended to buy locally or from england , ms borchardt said planters had so much credit with english merchants , to whom they sold tobacco , that they tended to look to england for silver , ceramics , tea chests , clocks , clothing , books , fabric and furniture mr lainhoff said it is more likely that he bought from london , dublin or glasgow than boston or philadelphia the furniture that survives is either british or virginian the museum is selling its antiques from the other american colonies lot 1084 , for example , is a large chippendale dropleaf oval dining table , circa 1760 when open , the table is 67 inches long and seats eight it has six legs with webbed ballandclaw feet and two drawers the top and leaves are made with three single boards of dense , highly figured mahogany , said john b a nye , the director of sotheby s american furniture department sotheby s said the table was made for capt henry wick , a farmer in morris county , nj , who shared his house with maj gen arthur st clair during the revolution wick hall is part of morristown national historical park , which includes george washington s military headquarters and was the encampment for 13 , 000 soldiers during the winter of 177980 , the coldest of that century but was it wick s table \? laurel racine , the acting director of the national park service s northeast museum services center in boston , is writing a historic furnishings assessment of wick hall she said she could not confirm that the sotheby s table came from the wick house she noted that the table had been offered to the park service for wick hall twice , in 1935 and 1952 , and twice rejected i would be more willing to believe it was owned by phoebe , wick s daughter , who married dr william leddell in 1770 , she said he was a slave owner and richer than her parents , and they would have been buying furniture at that time , when the chippendale style was popular mr nye said in the field of american furniture , it is rare indeed to have such complete and thorough documentation of the history of a table from 1760 , as we have in the case of the wick table our attribution is firmly based on a provenance history , which was dictated in the 1940 s by the last living descendant of captain wick , florence mary moore , who owned the table and was able to name every owner back to wick himself we will share this documentation with any prospective buyer sotheby s has attributed the table , which is not signed , to gilbert ash , a new york cabinetmaker the knee carving , with crosshatching and flat foliage , is similar to the carving on a signed ash side chair at winterthur , mr nye said the table sold at sotheby s in 1950 for 3 , 800 today the estimate is 150 , 000 to 250

the abner louima case ended on saturday night without resolving one of the biggest questions of the fiveyear legal ordeal the identity of the second officer in the brooklyn police station bathroom where officer justin a volpe redefined police brutality on an august morning in 1997 the sentencing agreement that will send another former officer , charles schwarz , to prison , for a maximum of five years for perjury , included no admission that mr schwarz was , as prosecutors long charged , the officer who restrained mr louima while mr volpe sodomized him with a broken broomstick but it also prohibits mr schwarz from continuing to proclaim his innocence publicly the louima case always carried with it unrealistic hopes that it could expose the truth about racism in new york , police brutality and the law enforcement brotherhood that critics say fosters a blue wall of silence to some extent it succeeded mr volpe is serving a 30year prison sentence but the saturday night deal was also a reminder of how the haze of lies and faulty memories surrounding the events in the case benefited some officers who were pursued by prosecutors and how illequipped the legal system is to answer questions for history explaining the deal yesterday , the chief prosecutor , alan vinegrad , acknowledged that after the exhausting legal battle , prosecutors had worried about the chance that mr schwarz s fourth trial , which had been scheduled to begin today , could have ended in an acquittal or a hung jury there were risks of not getting the verdict that we wanted , he said in an interview so mr vinegrad accepted the deal , although he did not get what he had long sought an admission from mr schwarz that he had participated in the attack mr schwarz s chief lawyer , ronald p fischetti , failed in the goal he had set of proving that mr schwarz is innocent he settled for the conclusion that the prosecution never proved that mr schwarz was guilty of taking part in the attack so after five years of courtroom warfare , the deal represented a draw on what became the most important question of the case after mr volpe pleaded guilty was mr schwarz the second officer in the bathroom \? the law requires that prosecutors prove their cases beyond a reasonable doubt an anonymous juror from one of mr schwarz s previous trials told pacifica radio this year that some officers used that lofty concept to sabotage the investigation in the interview , the juror said that the officers wanted to throw smoke and dust in the eyes of the investigators , plant enough reasonable doubt in the record so a jury would n't be able to find anybody other than volpe guilty of anything none of the officers who were charged in the case ever acknowledged that but mr schwarz s plea agreement showed how the reasonable doubt requirement can be a wedge against prosecutors after they won reversals of two prior convictions of mr schwarz , his defense lawyers succeeded in getting a deadlock at his trial in july they persuaded at least one juror that mr schwarz was not guilty on three charges , including the two civil rights charges that would have been part of the trial that was scheduled to begin this morning in preparation for the new trial , the biggest weapon mr fischetti had in negotiating with the prosecutors was their fear that he might be able to win over just one juror both he and mr vinegrad agreed in interviews yesterday that if the new trial had led to yet another hung jury , the government would not have mounted another prosecution of mr schwarz we would not have tried him a fifth time , mr vinegrad said , because at a certain point the criminal justice system has to recognize that the system has played itself out that meant mr fischetti did not have to try for acquittal by 12 jurors what i needed to do in this trial , mr fischetti said yesterday , was convince one person out of 12 that there was a reasonable doubt , and that would end the prosecution of charles schwarz such stances are often part of negotiations , and in mr schwarz s case there were many issues that could be used as ammunition in the psychological maneuvering yesterday , mr vinegrad and mr fischetti differed , for example , on what sentence mr schwarz might have faced on the single perjury count had there been no agreement and had the prosecution failed to convict on the other three charges mr vinegrad contended that he might have gotten far less than the fiveyear sentence that would make the deal a victory for prosecutors mr fischetti asserted that mr schwarz would have received five years , which was the maximum under the deal , he said , mr schwarz may be free after less than three years that would suggest that he had outbargained mr vinegrad each side acknowledged the risks of a new trial for the defense , the possibility of a conviction on all counts would have subjected mr schwarz to a sentence of 15 years for the prosecution , the possibility of ending up without a conviction would have been an embarrassment and an invitation to supporters of mr schwarz to harshly criticize the federal prosecutors' office in brooklyn
the truth will set you free overcoming emotional blindness and finding your true adult self by alice miller 202 pp new york basic books 24 genuinely idyllic childhoods are as rare as sunny days in seattle those of us who have had goodenough childhoods should call ourselves lucky , but what s to be done with an irredeemably bad childhood \? given the requisite talent and ambition , it s always possible to spin gold out of dross and thereby convert pain into art without unhappy beginnings , we probably would n't have half the literary works we do , from samuel butler s way of all flesh to frank mccourt s angela s ashes \( edmund wilson s woundandbow theory of creativity holds true for other fields as well we would n't have ingmar bergman s fanny and alexander or louise bourgeois s sculptures , either \) most adults , however , do n't emerge from traumatic backgrounds and go on to write mesmerizing accounts of the scars inflicted they 're more likely to make do by repressing their memories and imagining that they had it easier than they did , or even by idealizing the parents at whose hands they have suffered the majority simply hobble around , scattering misery , and handing on the damage to the next generation none of them , according to alice miller , guru of wounded inner children everywhere and the author , most recently , of the truth will set you free overcoming emotional blindness and finding your true adult self , will succeed in escaping the shadow of their past miller , a swiss psychoanalyst , burst into public awareness in 1981 with a slim treatise called the drama of the gifted child \( first called prisoners of childhood , the book was cannily retitled by the author , presumably to flatter its readers \) i still remember the passionate response evoked by miller s account of the childhood trauma that was inevitable in even the most wellmeaning of families it seemed there was almost no one who could n't identify with the notion of having once been a lonely or tormented captive in the hands of inattentive , neglectful or outright abusive parents friends i considered to be paragons of mental health , or i knew to have had overindulgent mothers and fathers , treated as nothing short of revelatory the book s plainspoken insights into the unwittingly brutal behavior that miller claimed is regularly shown the tender , budding self of the average child in retrospect , the book s impact it has sold more than 800 , 000 copies can be accounted for in part by its accessible rendition of basic but often murky psychoanalytic concepts like repetition compulsion , maternal mirroring , splitting and the false self the book s audience in waiting those desperate overachievers who compensated for early sorrow by fixating on the intoxication of success rather than facing up to their unmet childhood needs did n't hurt either what selfrespecting narcissist of a reader would n't want to be a member of a club predicated on a rarefied sort of victim status , in which underlying depression was warded off by increased displays of brilliance \? but by far the largest reason for the book s effect was its timing much of what miller was getting at which is that battered or deprived children grow up into enraged or disaffected adults who frequently become monsters themselves is now , at least in theory , an accepted part of the cultural dialogue twenty years ago , though , the unsettling implications of her message about the unrestrained use of power that is accorded caregiving adults had not yet become a commonplace the drama of the gifted child must be credited with providing a way in those faroff days before all families were deemed dysfunctional until proved otherwise for the general public to borrow from the calibrated language of professionals in order to describe the hidden realm of their feelings indeed , miller could be said to be the missing link between freud and oprah , bringing news of the inner life , and especially the subtle hazards of emotional development , out of the cloistered offices of therapists and into a wider , userfriendly context from the start , miller s work met with resistance as well as admiration , particularly from those who carried the banner of biological determinism in the neverending naturenurture debate nor did it help that some of her assertions seemed questionable or that her case histories , even taking into account the general malleability of this genre , were loosely adduced and suspiciously contoured to fit her theories there were also some who resisted the implacable monocausality of an outlook in which everything from alphonse daudet s manner of death to the rise of nazism can be traced back to childhood suffering there is precious little resilience in the world according to miller next to no possibility of rising heroically above desolate circumstances and there is scant allowance made for the ordinary imposition of parental influence referred to disapprovingly in the drama as value selection in which one sort of behavior \( sharing toys , say \) is encouraged and another \( grabbing someone else s toy \) is frowned upon and which of necessity favors the adult view over the young child s
you can think of last orders as a road movie , one of those small , dutiful journeys that somehow come to reflect all our silly hopes , crushed regrets , recurring compromises and odd sunbursts of good luck on the road from bermondsey \( in southeast london \) to the seaside town of margate are four men ray \( bob hoskins \) , vic \( tom courtenay \) , lenny \( david hemmings \) and vince \( ray winstone \) and they 're traveling out of respect for an old pal , jack \( michael caine \) , gone now , packed in the fancy urn they carry with awkward tenderness jack had a last request , like a last order at their favorite pub , the coach and horses , that they would take his ashes and toss them in the sea off margate pier an american audience may not need to know that the coach is somewhere in that drab suburban density of south london , off the old kent road , in parts where everything has been razed and rebuilt but where the names of the pubs linger on , reminders of a history that few can recollect the coach and horses \( which never moves that s the forlorn local joke \) , the thomas becket , the lord nelson the comparison is not forced in graham swift s 1996 novel , but the four men s journey begins in a pub with an old clock made in southwark and goes through and beyond canterbury itself this was once the path taken by chaucer s pilgrims and last orders is now a movie , opening on friday , in which the screenwriter and director , fred schepisi , has used mr swift s novel to compose a mosaic of tales celebrating the english lower middle class and its wry talent for surviving so much commonplace reality and hard luck , yet staying as cocky as cockney jack was a butcher , vic an undertaker they had shops on the same street , steaks and stiffs lenny was once a boxer , and ray plays the horses vince is jack s adopted son , bitter about so many things , including jack s wish that vince would meekly take over the butcher shop instead , vince has moved up socially he has a garage where he trades classy cars he volunteers to get out his nice mercedes to drive the others to margate mr swift came to his novel as something of a vince himself at one level , he said by telephone from london , these characters in the book are n't quite my people i do n't like class , but i suppose i'm lower middle class these people are n't of that class , or formal education i went to dulwich college on a scholarship , and then cambridge but these people have their own way of talking they 're not articulate still , i'm from their south london , born in catford , the same area , and i grew up with their voices all around me i do n't know the full history , but my father came from very humble origins and worked his way up and i realize now how england has changed i set the book in 1989 , and today it s actually quite hard to find these people in a south london pub so in a way it s a book about the end of a group of people again , an american audience may not recognize that shift and may not need to for these men link up in our minds with the workingclass characters in dickens , say , or the ordinary soldiers in henry v above all , they seem like perfect extensions of workingclass english actors like michael caine , bob hoskins and ray winstone yet no one has done more to show the real people beneath workingclass stereotypes than michael caine sir michael , as he now is the novel won the booker prize in britain , and it has been translated into something like 20 languages mr schepisi , an australian , was drawn to it i loved the cumulative effect , the linkage in so many lives , and the disappointments , he said recently in new york born in melbourne in december 1939 , of italian descent , mr schepisi had spent time in britain in the 60 s , then had lived a year in the english countryside while directing meryl streep in the 1985 film of david hare s play plenty besides grasping a lot about englishness , that film had an unorthodox narrative structure mr swift , who had seen plenty and liked it , felt that mr schepisi could avoid the potential tangle of filming a novel composed in short chapters from the standpoint of nearly a dozen characters the two men talked , and the producer elisabeth robinson , who had first called the novel to mr schepisi s attention , took an option on what had to be a lowbudget picture before tackling it himself , mr schepisi wondered whether mr swift might want to try writing the script it took me 10 seconds to say no , mr swift said i'm not a scriptwriter i'm a prose fiction writer and if you 've done it once , you do n't want to go over the same ground but i was shown every draft , and i offered written comments all the way through as so often happens on films undertaken without the least thought of their being blockbusters , the shooting went like a dream mr swift was always welcome on the set , but he was happy to take a back seat the unit , determined to stay close to the social and geographical realities of the novel , found an unused factory in peckham , very near bermondsey in time , following the novel , they went to chatham , canterbury and margate , none of which exactly looked their best in the designated winter setting
santiago , chile carmen calder n walked into a mcdonald s restaurant here late last year to complain that her son had come down with food poisoning after eating one if its hamburgers hoping for an apology , she is instead facing a 125 million lawsuit the whole dispute might have been avoided had not a mcdonald s employee initially brushed her off , telling her , this restaurant is cleaner than your house furious , ms calder n steamed off to the municipal public health agency and repeated her complaint before long , inspectors were at the restaurant and mcdonald s was subjected to loads of publicity , none of it to its liking because one of the icons of globalization is involved , the dispute has become a cause c l bre in chile mcdonald s says it is merely trying to defend its reputation against a slander , but consumer advocates see sinister motives at work mcdonald s does n't have a prayer of collecting this money , so it is clear that what they really want is to send a message to every consumer in chile , said luis j rez , legal director of the national consumer service , a government agency what they are saying to consumers is this watch your step , be careful , think twice before you criticize us , because you 'll get in trouble with the law because of the pending legal action , neither ms calder n , a 44yearold employee of a mutual fund , nor her son , nicol s abarz a , were willing to speak for themselves she referred all questions to her lawyer , juan carlos yanine , who described his client as the innocent victim of a big company that wants to throw its weight around executives of mcdonald s de chile declined requests for an interview , referring all questions to the company s latin american headquarters in s o paulo , brazil a spokesman there , ronaldo marques , said ms calder n does not have a case to sustain her allegations the company will withdraw its complaint if she will sign a letter endorsing mcdonald s position that something else must have caused her son s ailment , he said she provoked a situation that we wish to correct , he said , adding that her complaint had encouraged a wave of blackmail attempts you ca n't have a person make an accusation like this and then not present documents or proof to back it up , he said in january , the municipal public health agency here fined mcdonald s 650 after an inspection found abovenormal levels of bacteria at the restaurant where nicol s ate mcdonald s is seeking to have that ruling overturned and the fine returned more than any country in latin america , chile has embraced the notion of open markets and deregulation , and it has been rewarded with growth rates consistently among the highest in the region however , a citizen consumer movement to counterbalance the government s reliance on market forces has been slow to develop and faces strong opposition from corporations happy to have a free hand the business class in this country put up enormous resistance to the 1996 consumer protection law , and even now has a backward concept of what consumer rights are , mr j rez said we are pioneers here in many areas of social and economic policy , but in the area of defending the consumer , far from being in the vanguard , we lag behind places like paraguay and ecuador in a horrifying incident here in december , a 51yearold man died after setting himself on fire in front of the presidential palace to protest the weak regulation of asbestos chile banned the substance in july , long after other countries did in his suicide note , the man , eduardo mino , accused the government of ignoring consumer protection groups , supporting manufacturers and lying to asbestos victims my soul overflows with humanity and can no longer support such injustice , he wrote consumer groups are often inhibited by the chilean legal code gen augusto pinochet left power more than a decade ago , but rights organizations argue that many of the legal foundations of authoritarian rule remain intact although chile is a stable representative democracy , it retains more legal restrictions on freedom of expression than any other country on the continent , human rights watch noted in a report last year in particular , it is a common view here that the right to honor takes precedence over the right to freedom of expression and access to information , the report said during an earlier controversy involving mcdonald s , officials here were quick to support the company s position after health inspectors detected e coli bacteria and briefly closed a mcdonald s restaurant last year , senior officials from the ministries of labor and health made a point of going there to eat hamburgers , with television cameras in tow the political pressures and the influence that these large corporations can exert is tremendous , said ernesto medina , director of the citizens' movement against abuses , a nascent consumer protection group our

washington in their eagerness to move production offshore , the national association of manufacturers , the united states chamber of commerce and the national federation of independent business all join in a chant of free trade , fast track the retailers who make a bigger profit on imported goods cry free trade , fast track , and newspapers , who make money from retail advertising , editorialize for free trade but these cries are not really for making trade free they are for transferring power over trade to the executive branch and favored corporate interests this should not be the way economic policy works in a democracy the bush administration contends that trade agreements are passing us by because the president does n't have fasttrack authority this is baloney during the 90 s we entered into nearly 200 international commercial agreements without fast track , including the caribbean basin initiative and agreements with subsaharan africa , jordan and vietnam under article i , section 8 of the constitution , it is not the president but congress that shall regulate commerce with foreign nations but the fix is in the fasttrack bill will be called in the senate only when the white house knows it has the 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture debate will therefore be limited no one will listen to it anyway because they 'll know the vote is fixed fast track will be passed , and the united states will continue to lose business this failure to protect american workers is of relatively recent vintage since american independence , controls on trade gave government a way to shelter industries from foreign competition so they could grow or restructure tariffs were also an important source of government revenue \( there was no income tax until 1913 \) president lincoln protected steel , president franklin roosevelt instituted protectionism for agriculture and president eisenhower for oil the industrial giant of america was built on careful protectionism this changed after world war ii we were the world s leading industrial power devastated countries in europe and asia were given aid , equipment and expertise to rebuild and the cold war was won fundamental to this victory was the american treatment of foreign trade as foreign aid we set an example by opening up the american market but our competition refused to follow suit instead , they protected their manufacturers as our competitors began to prosper , american managers were learning a different lesson from their experiences with overseas rebuilding they learned that moving work overseas could save money labor costs in manufacturing can be 30 percent of sales a company that retains its executive offices in america but moves its production to a lowwage area could save as much as 20 percent in sales volume thus , a corporation with 500 million in sales could increase its pretax profits by 100 million accordingly , manufacturers have been leaving the united states in droves little south carolina has lost 53 , 900 textile jobs since the free trade agreement with mexico since the 1979 tokyo round agreements in which fasttrack authority took on its current form america has lost more than four million manufacturing jobs , or 20 percent of our manufacturing work force giving fasttrack authority to president bush will only worsen this problem since the fall of the berlin wall , hundreds of millions of people have entered the world s work force ready to accept a minimal standard of living in contrast , america continues to protect or raise its standard of living with requirements for a minimum wage , social security , medicare , medicaid , safe workplaces and machinery , clean air and water , plant closing notice and unpaid parental leave a plant can move to mexico and find a work force with none of these requirements and an average individual wage that is 11 percent of the american equivalent today , more than half of what we consume as a nation is imported recently i rode acela , the fast train from washington to new york that was made in canada advanced technology , which was supposed to be the motor of domestic growth , is now imported we have a deficit in the balance of trade in semiconductors , according to the international trade commission my insurance policy is administered in dublin , my light bill in bangalore , india t his mantra of free trade , fast track must not keep us from seeing the drawbacks of simply allowing merchants and whoever is president determine the shape of our nation we have done very well for more than two centuries by having substantial democratic control of commercial relations there is every reason to continue with it years ago , akio morita of sony admonished third world nations that they had to develop strong manufacturing sectors to become nationstates turning to me , he said , senator , the world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power
when i was a small child , father s day was an exercise in longing and a gantlet of shame i can still feel the scald of embarrassment as i sat motionless at my desk at school while the other children crayoned their father s day cards i had been named for my father \( laura for larry \) , but i never knew him i lived with my single mother the initial tale , told by my mother , was that my father was an aviator flying missions in a faraway war when i was 4 , my mother told me his plane had been shot down in combat at that time , in the 1950 s , this country was not at war somewhere , still , in a file marked personal , crucial , i have a snapshot of a pale blond soldier , smoking , who was said to be my father but now i question its veracity like the aging snapshot itself , the legend has cracked today i know many fatherless children , and none are without a fantasy there is a father on father s day , if only in their fictions my dad had to go overseas or my dad is coming back the stories i hear from children in my volunteer program for children 8 to 16 , writing your autobiography , are not so different from those of the fatherless girl i used to be , so many decades ago the difference is that when i was a fatherless child , i was an exception today the fatherless may have plenty of company there is a fair chance that the child at the next desk is also scribbling an alternative father s day message the smarting shame of illegitimacy has been soothed by legitimizing the decision not to marry many children now grow up , as i did , in the maternal home until age 8 , i lived in the world of women my mother and i stayed with her aunt , then her sister my mother , rose , was 35 and unmarried when i was born she died at 43 had she lived until i was grown , i am sure she would have given me a truer version of my paternity my fatherlessness reversed when , at my mother s death , her female relatives were unable to raise me and my care was taken over by her two bachelor brothers , my uncles len and gabe i was now firmly installed in an allmale world my uncles charmed the neighborhood and me with their take on fatherhood an abundance of love and an ineptness in all domains then decreed female they were not versed in such domestic details as separating laundry , and all our white shirts soon turned pink from being washed with my runaway red blouse the uncles filed my clothes in stout metal file cabinets and cooked battalionstyle pressure cooker stews to last the week i was hoisted onto shoulders , i was tossed in waves at the beach , and masculine hands pushed me on the playground swing i fit , finally , the father s day picture with the spectacular alteration that there were two dads the calendar date for grieving had switched to mother s day , and there would never be a crayoned card to cover that occasion but my uncles succeeded in their version of a pair of parents i was fond of bragging , i do n't have just one uncle taking care of me i have two for many children men like my uncles never materialize they remain fatherless forever in this season i think of these children , but i also celebrate the women who raise them and those men who , like my uncles or my childless friend who escorts fatherless children to every known kiddie venue , elect to love and take care of boys and girls they did not father
a woman and two men whose hands had been bound at their backs were found slashed to death yesterday in a ransacked , gasreeking apartment in the bronx , the police said the motive was unclear , but there were no signs of forced entry investigators said the killers , apparently searching for money or contraband , had overturned furniture , turned out drawers and closets and left a shambles of the onebedroom , secondfloor apartment at 690 gerard avenue , near east 157th street , just around the corner from river avenue and yankee stadium before departing , the killers also opened gas taps on a kitchen stove and left votive candles burning , apparently trying to blow up the apartment and destroy evidence neighbors smelled the gas and alerted officials , though before a con edison crew turned off the gas , it had begun to pervade the sixstory , 79apartment building , and scores of residents might have been endangered they left a very precarious situation , said deputy chief joseph j reznick , the commander of detectives in the bronx an explosion would have been deadly to a lot of people little was known of the victims , who were not immediately identified chief reznick quoted neighbors as saying the woman , who appeared to be in her early 20 s , was believed to be from jamaica , had moved into the apartment , 2j , about eight months ago and might have been housesitting for someone else the two men , white or hispanic , appeared to be in their 30 s one neighbor said they had been staying in the apartment only for the past week the police said the building had no history of drug dealing or other illegal activity , and there were no noise complaints sunday night or early yesterday that might have indicated a struggle but the condition of the bodies and of halfburned 24hour votive candles at a religious shrine in the flat suggested that the killings occurred between midnight and 3 am , officials said joseph petta , a con edison spokesman , said that neighbors reported a strong odor of gas at 11 am , and a utility crew arrived at the tanbrick building at 11 25 the odor was traced to 2j , and the police were summoned after edwin henriquez , the superintendent , unlocked the door and saw a body the police found one slain man face down in the foyer he was clad only in checkered boxer shorts and had been stabbed repeatedly in the torso , they said one wrist was wrapped with telephone cord in a manner that suggested he had been bound incompletely or had been able to free one hand before he died a second man was found face up on the floor of the living room to the right of the entry his hands were bound behind him , and he , too , had been stabbed repeatedly and his throat had been cut , investigators said in the bedroom , the woman , her throat cut , was found face up on the floor investigators said her hands were bound at her back , a towel was draped over her face and she was naked below the waist none of the victims appeared to have been gagged , nor were their legs bound police officials said three bloody knives , the apparent murder weapons , were found in the apartment mr henriquez , the superintendent , said the woman , whom he called louise , had spoken of having a child in jamaica and of longing to leave new york he said the apartment was leased by another woman who lived elsewhere photo workers from the city medical examiner s office bringing out one of the bodies found slain early yesterday at 690 gerard avenue , the bronx \( william c lopez for the new york times \)
sepon base camp , laos the earth here is suffused with metal millions of ounces of gold , millions of tons of copper and thousands of pounds of very old , very live american bombs left over from the vietnam war you factor it into everything you do , said michael wilkes , project manager for oxiana resources , a small australian company that is developing a mine here before you go anywhere , you have to have it cleared long before miners ever heard of the sepon camp , american pilots knew the area as the head of the ho chi minh trail and a transit point for troops and supplies heading from north vietnam through laos and cambodia to south vietnam in a vain effort to stem that flow in the late 1960 s and early 70 s , united states forces subjected laos to the heaviest aerial bombardment in history more american bombs were dropped on this stretch of territory than on vietnam or on europe in world war ii now , oxiana is helping to turn this bombriddled patch of jungle into part of laos s first special economic zone oxiana s project , about 250 miles southeast of the capital , vientiane , is the first significant foreign mining investment in laos when the mine is opened later this year , workers will begin to extract what the company projects is roughly 1 billion in gold and almost 2 billion in copper the laotian government is counting on oxiana s mine to provide desperately needed tax revenue and to help end a drought in foreign investment that has left laos , an impoverished communist backwater , more dependent than ever on aid investments like oxiana s could turn things in the opposite direction , said paul v turner , the resident representative for the asian development bank in vientiane this country s more than five million people live in conditions more typical of africa than southeast asia illiterate children survive on less than 90 cents a day in remote villages many venture to cities only to end up across the mekong river , in thailand , working in sweatshops or as prostitutes laos wants to rise from the ranks of the world s poorest nations by 2020 , something the international monetary fund estimates will require annual economic growth of at least 7 percent last year , the economy grew 55 percent to reach 7 percent , laos must create an economy that is more investor friendly , the imf and others say that may seem as if it would be anathema to laos formally , the lao people s democratic republic but the country s communist leaders , since taking power in 1975 , have not been particularly dogmatic when collectivization failed a quartercentury ago , the government took a pragmatic approach and in 1986 approved a new economic mechanism aimed at creating a marketbased economy in 1991 , laos adopted a constitution enshrining private property and free enterprise the hammer and sickle disappeared from the flag , and three years later laos adopted one of southeast asia s most permissive foreign investment laws investors flooded in , but the onset of the asian financial crisis in mid1997 put an end to the boom in 1999 , foreign investment in laos fell to 515 million from 3797 million in 1997 to try to make up for that , the government began an expensive irrigation program , with the central bank alone putting up 24 million though it succeeded in making laos selfsufficient in rice , the program sent the nation s debt spiraling the inflation rate soared to more than 120 percent , and the laotian currency , the kip , lost nearly 90 percent of its value laos has since brought inflation back to single digits , but its banks remain burdened with many bad loans , depriving fledgling private business of cash to fill that gap , the government is courting foreign investors the vice chairwoman of the state planning and cooperation committee , khempeng pholsena , told an investment seminar in singapore recently that foreign investors should come to laos simply because it offers very attractive conditions she and other officials declined to be interviewed for this article beyond hydroelectric power and other natural resources , laos lacks just about everything its domestic market is small , and paved roads and electricity are rare worse for many investors , few officials speak english or understand business red tape , though , is in ready supply the government only recently lifted a rule requiring every foreign investment , no matter how small , to be approved by the prime minister still , government approvals typically take more than a year the authorities are candid about these problems and say they are trying to overcome them , whether by educating officials or issuing decrees eliminating bureaucratic obstacles it helps to have a local guide for oxiana , that is saman aneka , who grew up not far from sepon now 47 , he remembers as a teenager watching american bombers drop their payloads mr saman studied geology in the soviet union and after a brief stint in government joined an australian mining company , cra , to explore sepon in 1990
los angeles the tag line for revolution studios' stuntpacked action flick , xxx , refers to its tattooed , thrilladdicted hero , played by vin diesel , as a new breed of secret agent in ads for this summer s successful thriller the bourne identity , universal pictures alerts audiences that in matt damon , the film s star , a new action hero is bourne ! and there is a lot of hollywood gossip these days about just who the director wolfgang petersen will choose to play his battling heroes in batman vs superman , warner brothers' attempt to breathe life into two dormant film franchises by peopling them with action stars of a more contemporary hue here s the deal charles bronson is out of the game clint eastwood is slaughtering at a slower pace chuck norris is on television and most of the superstars who helped transform the bigbudget action flick of the late 1980 s and 90 s into a lucrative summer staple arnold schwarzenegger , bruce willis , harrison ford , steven seagal , jeanclaude van damme have either seen their recent action efforts falter at the box office or gone on extended hiatuses between projects and yet not since will smith in independence day , a full six years ago , has a new male actor emerged who exhibits the star charisma , audience appeal and staying power to carry the action torch forward since rambo first strapped on his bandoliers two decades ago , the action genre has become so important to the bottom line of the mainstream studios that hollywood seems , at the moment , to be casting about with unparalleled zeal for a new generation of action stars to keep the cash cow mooing some might even detect the whiff of desperation but others contend that all of this fretting about who the next arnold will be simply misses the point that it is not the action stars but the genre itself that is changing it s true that there is an older generation of action stars , said tom rothman , cochairman of fox filmed entertainment , which includes the 20th century fox movie studio but it s just part of the evolution that s always there in the movie business every new generation gets their own screen personalities and , without a doubt , we are in the midst of one of these transition periods \( female action stars , a relatively recent phenomenon driven by sigourney weaver in the alien series and linda hamilton in the terminator films , form a category and a story of their own \) the question has come to the fore this year simply because of the appearance of so many new stars in big summer vehicles from a pureaction star like the rock in scorpion king to seriousactorsturnedhemen like tobey maguire in spiderman and ben affleck in the sum of all fears and because there are so many movies currently in production for future summers that promise to feature newer , younger action faces the next year alone will see heath ledger in a remake of the swashbuckling four feathers , a relative newcomer , owen wilson , pairing with a veteran eddie murphy in a bigscreen version of television s i spy mr affleck as redcostumed superhero daredevil eric bana morphing into the hulk and colin farrell joining the swat team and that does n't even count batman , superman and about a dozen other highprofile projects still on the drawing boards if most of the attention has focused on mr diesel and xxx , it is only because that film s producers have admitted that they hope to spawn a new franchise series with it , and because it is such a selfconscious attempt to change the audience s image of what an action star can be like mr diesel \( born mark vincent \) , its brash and extravagantly confident star , xxx is demanding the attention xander cage , the hero of xxx , is an alienated , tattoocovered misanthrope whose disdainful view of life has made him a thrillseeking expert in extreme sports when he is recruited by the united states government as a secret agent , cage is able to use his skateboarding and bungeejumping skills to thwart america s enemies the idea here is that young people especially young males who make up the bulk of the summer movie audience are finding it increasingly difficult to relate to the kind of blacktie , martinisipping superspy who has dominated the genre since sean connery first cocked an eyebrow xander cage not only reflects the young audience s romantic image of itself general indifference to authority mixed with contempt for conformity but even personifies the multiethnic , multicultural face of current youth culture he is a guy who every culture has adopted as its own , said todd garner , a partner in revolution studios who was responsible for developing the film you look at him on the screen and you listen to him and you cannot pin down what cultural group he fits in best with is he italian \? is he black \? is he hispanic \? is he a mix of so many cultural strains that he belongs to none in particular \? \( mr diesel refers to himself as multicultural \) he is the everyman , mr garner said similar claims were made for dwayne johnson , the professional wrestler who fights and acts as the rock and starred in this summer s first big action film , the scorpion king
sometimes you 're reading the newspaper and a quote just jumps out at you i had that experience last week while reading an associated press story from iran about the mounting student protests against iran s hardline clerical leaders deep in the story , i came upon this sentence on sunday , more than 2 , 000 protesting students chanted 'death to dictatorship' and condemned anew the death sentence against a prominent university professor i had to rub my eyes did i read that right \? the iranian students who had practically invented the chants death to america and death to the great satan had on their own changed the tape now they are chanting death to dictatorship and because they are , there is hope for the post9 11 world no , i am not getting carried away by one chant iran s hardline clerics have the power to crush the studentled democracy movement anytime they please yes , iran s bad guys have all the power to do that but none of the legitimacy to do it and that is why they are hesitating the hardline clerics have lost their legitimacy with a wide swath of iranians , particularly the young , who have concluded that it s their own hardliners not america who are to blame for iran s economic woes , political paralysis and isolation the iranian students chanting death to dictatorship may not be able to do anything about it , but the fact that they 've identified their real problem as their own bad mullahs , not outsiders and their real solution as true democracy , not some rigged islamic version is a big change when arab muslims on the other side of the gulf draw the same conclusion that it is their own autocrats , religious fanatics and education systems that are holding them back , not america we will be on the road to curing the madness of 9 11 what are the chances of that \? some days they feel very low look at the shameful comments just made by saudi arabia s interior minister , nayef bin abdel aziz , who told a saudi weekly that the zionists are behind these events of 9 11 yes , yes , there were 15 saudi hijackers , but the jews did it how pathetic it is that sort of escapism death to the other guy that has retarded arab development for decades but here s the good news the events of 9 11 have had a bigger impact than you might think they have intensified something i would call the conversation among arabs and muslims it has been going on in private for years , but lately some courageous voices are taking it public shouting in their own press , death to the old lies consider a strong piece that just ran in okaz , a major saudi daily , by the columnist abdullah abu sameh , who decries the fact that muslim extremists have stuffed the minds of some of our youth with a fanatic ideology and a faulty interpretation of jihad that it is a tool to oppress and dominate others he quotes an essay in the saudi daily asharq alawsat by the gutsy abdul rahman alrashed , who said that while saudis were shocked to find so many of their youth involved in 9 11 , it is better to confront the fact than make excuses the cause of the radicalization of our youth was the culture of violence that has infiltrated religious education , deviating from the traditions of the conservative saudi society to regain peace and reconciliation with the world , mr abu sameh said , our youths must be reeducated and violence a concept alien to our society must be discarded translation by memri or consider a fine piece in al ahram , the main egyptian paper , by usama ghazali harb , who says the muslim world s predicament today is not the result of some external plot but the fact that while the vast majority of muslims keep silent , an extremist minority has hijacked the faith and is steering it into a confrontation with the world these extremists are supported by conservative forces that fear progress and modernity what the muslim world desperately needs , mr harb says , is a progressive model that works a role egypt could play even better than iran but , he asks , is egypt ready to assume such a role \? we should not exaggerate the influence of these writers or ignore it we should understand that they are there , that 9 11 has emboldened them to emerge and that the quicker we get this iraq thing over , and the more we can quiet the israelipalestinian conflict , the more their conversation will gain momentum wish them well they 're our best hope for change from within which is the only change that matters

hollywood studios seeking to impose electronic controls on digital television broadcasts suffered a setback yesterday as a coalition of technology and consumer electronics companies supporting their efforts crumbled in a crossindustry power struggle a longawaited report that the studios hoped would provide the consensus necessary for antipiracy legislation and that members of congress hoped would jumpstart the stalled rollout of digital television instead disclosed a host of dissenting opinions hollywood executives have long maintained that they will not release their most valuable programming in digital format until they can ensure that viewers cannot copy those programs to the internet makers of digital television sets blame the shortage of programming for slow sales of the devices , which are in fewer than a million homes the broadcast protection discussion group was formed last november to try to arrive at a proposal for a technological standard that consumer electronics and computer makers could build into their machines to protect digital broadcasts and if there was general agreement on one point at the end of the monthslong process , it was that such protection remained a worthwhile goal the key agreement was that digital television should be protected from unauthorized redistribution , said andrew g setos , president of engineering for the news corporation s fox group and cochairman of the group hopefully work will now start on getting it memorialized as a federal mandate the studios and their trade group , the motion picture association , sought to portray the report as a positive step forward that could still quickly result in legislation , or a congressional directive to the federal communications commission to supervise the regulation but technology and consumer electronics executives said it was far too soon to think about adopting a voluntary standard , much less legislating one may i say quickly that there is no consensus embodied in that report , said tom patton , vice president for government relations at royal philips electronics none philips , along with several other consumer electronics companies , complained that the studios' proposal would prevent consumers who use an updated device to record a program from watching it on one of the 30 million dvd players that are in homes today because the program would be scrambled the dissenters in the consumer electronics industry were also joined by microsoft in objecting to the degree of control that the studios wanted to exert over which technologies would be deemed to meet their copyprotection standards they were proposing criteria that were largely subjective , said andy moss , director of technical policy for microsoft the basic idea is that broadcasters would include a digital flag in each broadcast , which would be detected by the technology in the devices and scrambled upon receipt digital programs that include the flag could be moved electronically between devices in the home , but not transmitted to the internet some device makers and computer manufacturers have been lukewarm to the concept , arguing that the expense and effort it requires would not prevent hollywood s material appearing on the internet and the electronic frontier foundation , a civil liberties group that participated in the discussions , argued that preventing consumers from emailing an excerpt of a show over the internet violated fair use rights under copyright law but the central stumbling block to arriving at a broad agreement on the proposal may simply have been a bid by the studios for too much control over carrying it out microsoft , philips and zenith all have copyprotection plans of their own that they would like to market to device makers the studios , however , appear to favor one system developed by a group of companies that include intel , toshiba and matsushita zenith is a subsidiary of lg electronics disenchanted by the informal discussion process , which did not involve clear procedures for resolving disputes or voting rules , several representatives from technology and consumer electronics companies said they would prefer any future discussions to take place in a forum sanctioned by the government that will almost certainly be one subject of debate when the house energy and commerce committee holds an industry discussion on digital television next week frankly we 're surprised , said ken johnson , a spokesman for representative billy tauzin , the louisiana republican who leads the committee when we looked at the report we said , 'boy , we 've got a lot of work to do'
linda m gilbert works as a millwright at the daimlerchrysler jefferson north assembly plant in detroit a millwright is a sort of troubleshooter the work is hard , it pays well , and it is unusual to see a woman doing it in 1999 , a jury in detroit found that ms gilbert s male colleagues had harassed her for years with pornographic messages , vulgar talk and insults it awarded her 21 million the award is the largest affirmed for an individual sexual harassment plaintiff in united states history none of that money was for punitive damages , which are meant to punish and deter the defendant rather than compensate the plaintiff punitive damages are often said to be the main reason for outsized jury awards indeed , michigan , like a handful of other states , prohibits punitive damages in most cases instead , the jury awarded ms gilbert 1 million for potential lost earnings and medical expenses and 20 million for pain and suffering as all sorts of limitations have recently been placed on punitive damages , creative lawyers have shifted their attention to pain and suffering , a littlescrutinized form of compensation for psychic harm plaintiffs' lawyers are repackaging their punitivedamages claims to put the money load into painandsuffering damages , said victor e schwartz , coauthor of the leading law school textbook on torts the two sorts of damages are meant to be conceptually distinct pain and suffering focuses on the harm done to the plaintiff , said catherine m sharkey , a fellow at columbia law school punitive damages looks to the conduct of the defendant it s a separate question whether juries in practice have in mind a certain number and will get there no matter what in its appeal to the michigan supreme court , daimlerchrysler argues that the verdict was a disguised punitivedamages award there is absolutely no correlation between 21 million and the impact that cartoons and verbal comments have had on this woman , said elizabeth hardy , a company lawyer ms gilbert s lawyer , geoffrey n fieger , who had asked the jury for 140 million , says the award merely compensates his client for the effect of the abuse ms gilbert still works at the plant and has not received any of the awarded money at daimlerchrysler , she has made as much as 100 , 000 a year , with overtime recent united states supreme court decisions have encouraged judges to scrutinize punitive awards , while damages for pain and suffering , and other awards that compensate plaintiffs for losses , are treated with deference in addition , punitive damages have recently become subject to the federal income tax , while painandsuffering awards are not many states that do allow punitive damages have enacted fixed caps or have limited the permissible ratio between compensatory and punitive damages florida does both in most cases it limits punitive damages to 500 , 000 or three times the compensatory award , whichever is greater other states have diverted some punitive awards to their treasuries oregon allocates 60 percent of them to a state fund for crime victims these limitations and others , mr schwartz said , have driven hundreds of millions of dollars into painandsuffering awards he cited recent verdicts for tens of millions in california , mississippi and new york , in cases involving injuries in automobile accidents , medical malpractice , asbestos and a heartburn drug david a schkade , a business professor at the university of texas and a coauthor of a recent book on punitive damages , said there had been no systematic study of the trend there is evidence that there is leakage between different kinds of damages , he added it s like willie sutton you go where the money is david w leebron , the dean of columbia law school , agreed when you cut down on one kind of award , you 'll see a shift in investment to another kind of award or a shift to other kinds of cases , he said there are certainly fewer limitations on painandsuffering awards , and less judicial scrutiny the law provides no guidance , in terms of any benchmark , standard figure , or method of analysis , to aid the jury in the process of determining an appropriate award , dean leebron wrote in the new york university law review in 1989 the only judicially articulated standard of review requires that the award 'not shock the judicial conscience' but the concept of pain and suffering has its own critics in a 1990 study , peter w huber , a senior fellow at the conservative manhattan institute for policy research , wrote that it is easy for plaintiffs to feign or exaggerate psychic injury and that even if fear or pain can be proved , they are impossible to price that makes such claims attractive to lawyers even without the pressure on punitive damages mr fieger , who represents ms gilbert , said the award to her was justified by years of crushing abuse they brutalized her , he said the abuse , while not physical , caused her to be hospitalized several times and to attempt suicide , he said ms gilbert reported six incidents to her managers , including a picture of male genitalia taped to her toolbox , a copy of penthouse magazine left on top of it and a ribald poem posted in a nearby carpenters' shop daimlerchrysler told the court that shop talk and similar vulgar activities are the norm in the plant setting it emphasized that ms gilbert alleged no physical contact , propositioning for sex or retaliation the award , it said , was 70 times the size of the largest affirmed sexualharassment verdict in michigan history , and 70 times the maximum award for such claims for compensatory and punitive damages combined under federal harassment law mr fieger s closing argument to the jury , according to daimlerchrysler , was laced with impermissible appeals to punish the company never again , he had said that is a line used by the sabras in israel , the land of israel , to mean that the unspeakable horrors that were perpetrated on the people of israel , on the jews , must never be forgotten and must never happen again he later added , and i can assure you that the verdict will be heard from the floor of that plant on jefferson to the boardroom in auburn hills or stuttgart , referring to daimlerchrysler s two headquarters the company said this argument was a plea to punish it the appeals court disagreed , noting that mr fieger never drew any explicit connection between the nazis and the german corporation the court added that jurors awarded less than the 140 million ms gilbert asked for , proving that they were exercising their independent abilities to reason it said the jury was entitled to believe testimony that the harassment made her life joyless , changing the fundamental chemistry in her brain mr fieger said had punitive damages been available , i would have gotten one of those billiondollar verdicts photo a jury awarded linda m gilbert 21 million in a harassment case

london artists who earn a permanent place in the public imagination usually do so through the instant recognizability of their work familiarity is reassuring originality becomes mundane in that sense , paul klee is no different from a dozen other leading 20thcentury artists early in his career , he produced the semiabstract patchwork paintings colored squares with hints at figuration for which he is best remembered today , they are sold as postcards and posters but as illustrated by paul klee the nature of creation , a new exhibition at the hayward gallery in london through april 1 , there were many klees the square paintings , as they are known , were just one step in his quest for perfect spatial equilibrium here was a man whose intellectual fervor matched his artistic energy when he died in 1940 at age 60 , he left no fewer than 4 , 000 pages of analytical texts along with some 10 , 000 paintings , drawings and etchings unavoidably , with just 90 works on display , the hayward show is fiercely selective yet its two curators , the british painter bridget riley and the berlinbased art historian robert kudielka , succeed in conveying the variety and complexity of klee s oeuvre the catalog , with an introduction by ms riley and seven essays by mr kudielka , then goes beyond the images to underscore how , for all its multiple expressions , klee s vision of art was unchanging indeed , if klee skirted several 20thcentury art movements but fitted into none , it was because his work was neither abstract nor figurative but contained elements of both in fact , he found the distinction uninteresting he did not start with an idea and see how it could be translated into art for him , the idea should be born of the act of creation logically , therefore , his works often acquired titles only after they were completed visual art never begins with a poetic mood or idea , he once explained , but with building one or several figures , with harmonizing a few colors or tones , or with calculating spatial relationships whether an idea then joins in is completely irrelevant it may do , it does n't have to klee was not shy about discussing his work both the exhibition and the catalog quote a good many of his more pithy remarks about his art and art in general , although some need further explaining he was interested in the mechanics of painting , but his theoretical reflections can be a tad obscure to a layman happily , mr kudielka provides one essential key to understanding the artist klee viewed art through the prism of music klee was born in 1879 in bern , switzerland , and his upbringing and early adulthood were dominated equally by art and music his german father was a music teacher , and klee became a proficient violinist , but in 1899 he moved to munich to study art , not music returning to bern in 1902 , he kept himself alive as a violinist in an orchestra and as a music critic for a local newspaper , but he also continued to etch and draw in 1906 , he moved back to munich with his new wife , lily stumpf , a concert pianist in 1912 , he joined the blue rider group of artists founded by wassily kandinsky and franz marc , but he had still not found his vocation the turning point came in 1914 he was already 35 when he traveled to tunisia and discovered color color has taken hold of me , he declared upon his return to munich i do n't have to try to capture it it will possess me always that is the meaning of this happy hour i know it color and i are one i am a painter the outcome was his square paintings , which began literally as squares of sunsplashed colors some were then accompanied by triangles that suggest roofs \( as with picture of a city \) and by semicircles that hint at the cupolas of moorish homes or mosques \( red and white domes \) but these images were not , he insisted , abstractions of what he saw or imagined , because art does not reproduce the visible , but makes visible ms riley notes that klee s seminal importance to her was that through him she came to understand abstraction klee was the first artist to point out that for the painter the meaning of abstraction lay in the opposite direction to the intellectual effort of abstracting , she writes in the catalog it is not an end , but the beginning every painter starts with elements lines , colors , forms which are essentially abstract in relation to the pictorial experience that can be created with them this becomes clearer in the line drawings that followed , starting around 1920 some of them , like bird drama , appear figurative in a satirical , cartoonish or enchanted way others resemble what the surrealists were beginning to do through automatic drawing \( klee called his process psychic transformation \) yet while klee was a humorous and irreverent sort , his approach remained intellectual his interest was the line itself the original movement , the agent , is a point that sets itself in motion \( genesis of form \) , he wrote a line comes into being it goes out for a walk , so to speak , aimlessly for the sake of the walk
london , aug 25 remember that old sweetheart called twelfth night \? no , not the overdecorated , overeager stage productions that have been going under that name recently , all dressed up in the latest fashions and academic theories what i'm talking about is the simple and complicated comedy that was first performed four centuries ago and remains one of the most engaging romances ever written well , that play is on view again here at the globe , the openair theater that seeks to approximate the experience of watching shakespearean plays as they appeared originally for twelfth night the globe has made its most literal bid yet for authenticity , with a production that features elizabethan costumes , music and props , not to mention the period convention of an allmale cast yet there is none of the mustiness of the museum , none of the touristcourting quaintness of which the globe has periodically been accused since it opened in 1997 in frankly admitting its age , which is just over 400 years , twelfth night has never looked younger and in a staging that consistently calls attention to its artificiality , this play has rarely felt so real the backtobasics movement in contemporary culture has somehow bypassed highprofile productions of shakespeare , which tend to bear the relationship to their sources that a cosmopolitan does to the classic martini the consensus seems to be that if you 're going to sell shakespeare , you need to spike it with novelty , by setting troilus and cressida during the vietnam war , say , or presenting prince hal as a punk rocker sometimes the approach is illuminating but there is often the suggestion that weary old shakespeare needs a headtotoe makeover to appear attractive , and all the highconcept camouflage can start to smother the substance beneath after sitting through too many such interpretations of twelfth night \( including this summer s starstudded version in central park from the new york shakespeare festival \) , i had started to think that the work i 'd fallen in love with as a youth did n't really exist now here is the globe production , gleaming like a newly restored painting by an old master the distinctive and complex virtues of twelfth night , under the easygoing but steady direction of tim carroll , are allowed to emerge unvarnished and unannotated like its heroine , the crossdressing viola , the play speaks in many sorts of music , not all of them sweet and it is to this production s credit that while the audience members laugh heartily throughout , there are moments when they fall into grave and wondering silences led by mark rylance , the globe s artistic director , who also plays olivia , the actors create stylized portraits that wind up going deeper than most naturalistic performances this is altogether fitting because twelfth night is about disguises there are , on one hand , the actual disguises adopted by the characters for expediency or in jest , starting with viola s dressing up as a boy but the play is also acutely aware of the forms of selfdisguise the cast members bring out the actor in each of the characters the poses that reflect their distorted ideas of themselves they also do not let you forget that these actorly creatures are being portrayed by actors , whose exaggerated and mannered styles are pitched directly to their audiences as a simulacrum of its elizabethan prototype , with an open pit in which most viewers \( the groundlings \) stand , the globe makes theatergoing a very public experience the performers address their soliloquies in a complicitous spirit to the audience you 're a part of this , you know , they seem to suggest this means that you feel especially implicated when the play changes tone you may experience vicarious guilt , for example , when the baiting of the steward malvolio \( timothy walker \) slips into sadism , or when the hedonistic sir toby belch \( bill stewart \) turns nastily on his best friend , sir andrew aguecheek \( albie woodington \) even the burlesque of the play s sexual confusions may at moments become personal for those watching it there is the scene in the second act when it becomes embarrassingly obvious that the duke orsino \( a defiantly macho liam brennan \) has a yen for his page , cesario feste the clown \( peter hamilton dyer \) has been summoned to provide mood music , while orsino rambles on about the noble nature of men s love for women yet he keeps casting furtive glances at his shy young minion and brushing against him , as if by accident the other courtiers pretend nothing is going on the audience of course knows that cesario is really a woman , viola on the other hand , the woman is being played by a man mr carroll stretches the scene to the breaking point , so that different levels of perception swim in and out of focus it is sexy , uncomfortable and highly disorienting \( remember the movie the crying game \? \) when feste says to orsino , as he departs , that pleasure will be paid , one time or another , it takes on a newly sharpened edge so does the play s subtitle , what you will the men playing women , who also include paul chahidi as maria , are not effeminate they pitch their voices higher , but there is little mincing or swishing and while the interpretations are funny , they always seem fully thought out , grounded not only in their characters' psychology but also as social archetypes who would have been familiar to elizabethan audiences all the actors are terrific , walking a fine line between emotional truth and comic caricature but mr rylance , whom i last saw as a convincingly clownish hamlet , is a marvel his olivia is hilarious in her highborn delicacy , which can assume a monty pythonish surrealism she seems less to walk than to glide beneath her floorlength skirt there is also , however , a sobering sense that olivia , who only recently lost her father and brother , has been thrust into a role for which she is unready wielding a quill pen over parchment documents , she wears her authority like battle gear but when she speaks , there is a slight stammer in her voice this olivia is afraid of the world she is hiding behind that veil of mourning of course she would be drawn to the gentle cesario instead of the blustering , firmly masculine orsino the miracle is that as olivia sheds her defenses in pursuit of cesario , mr rylance makes her as touching as she is silly most wonderful ! coos olivia in the play s final scene , sliding her gaze between the erstwhile cesario , now revealed as viola , and viola s twin brother , sebastian \( rhys meredith \) that the twins , for once , do indeed look almost identical makes the moment pay off as it seldom does they truly embody , as orsino puts it , a natural perspective that is and is not that s what twelfth night is about come to think of it , that s what theater is about how satisfying it is to have that natural , doublefaced perspective brought back into focus photos mixedup identities , the oldfashioned way in a scene from twelfth night , mark rylance , center , with other cast members , dress for authenticity at the globe theater below , a recreation in london of the elizabethan theater where many of shakespeare s plays were originally staged \( alastair muir \) \( jonathan player \) \( pg e1 \) mark rylance as olivia in a london production of twelfth night at the globe theater , where he is also the artistic director \( alastair muirh \) \( pg e10 \)
verona , nj a sense of serenity has settled over new jersey because at this very moment , right this second , there is no one running for the united states senate who is under investigation for corruption robert g torricelli , the democratic incumbent , was under investigation for accepting illegal gifts and campaign contributions , but federal prosecutors said in january that they would not prosecute him that affirmation of virtue was viewed skeptically by republicans who said the state deserved better frankly , they were licking their chops at the prospect of bouncing mr torricelli in november their leading candidate was james w treffinger , the essex county executive who entered office seven years ago as a reformer after the previous executive , a democrat , was convicted of federal bribery and extortion charges fbi agents do n't exactly need mapquest to find offices of new jersey public officials , and last week they returned to the essex county office building with search warrants for records related to contracting and employment practices in mr treffinger s administration mr treffinger , who has not been charged , proclaimed his innocence and exited the race on monday his campaign manager emerged from mr treffinger s house here , saying , it s a tough day tough , but familiar there s a longrunning barroom argument in new jersey over whether republicans or democrats are more to blame for the state s reputation for corruption it always sounds like some sorry scene between parents of a juvenile delinquent but there is no argument that republicans have been much worse than democrats at the choreography of scandals timing is everything and republicans have gotten it wrong two years in a row last spring it was donald t difrancesco , the acting governor who was hoping to succeed christie whitman with the republican primary approaching , ethical questions emerged about his conduct as township attorney in scotch plains he left the race , ultimately handing the governor s office to the democrats now republicans are facing a june primary and the candidate backed by a majority of party leaders is exiting under a cloud in a headtohead race with a clean candidate , we do stand a good chance , one republican consultant said it would be a shame if the republicans screwed it up competition for cleanliness is under way there are three republican primary candidates left in the race and their supporters are trotting out all of the clich s of purity squeaky clean , clean as a whistle bonnie watson coleman , the state democratic chairwoman , is presenting mr torricelli s investigationwithoutcharges as a reassuring round of exploratory surgery he has gone through more scrutiny than any of us would want to undergo , she said he s emerged stronger he s been vindicated \( a review by the senate ethics committee is pending , but why quibble \? \) forget surgery , new jersey needs a full body scan for politicians strap them to a gurney and run them through a dirt detector any hidden campaign donations \? free suits \? questionable contracts \? brothersinlawinneed \? an fbi supervisor in newark who oversees public corruption cases calls it a way of life if you want a job or a contract , often you have to do things that are illegal , aaron ford said none of it is even fancy or intriguing one recent spate of investigations of local officials allegedly involves illegal payments made by a wastewater and paving contractor we 're talking sewer repair it was inevitable in the current atmosphere that a prosecutor would try to launch a political career in new jersey robert ray , the former whitewater special counsel and a new jersey resident , entered the republican primary for senate last month some democrats accused him of preparing to run while still special counsel , thereby mixing politics with the investigation of president clinton a mindboggling charge mr ray , a political neophyte , thought he would make a good contrast to mr torricelli but he left the race after 18 days saying he had entered too late with little organization party leaders had already found their mr clean in jim treffinger besides , people in new jersey have seen so much of prosecutors and their political prey that they 're not easily impressed william dowd , the monmouth county republican chairman , said that when mr ray called him this year seeking support , the prosecutor s first question was do you know who i am \? of course , mr dowd did i said , 'you 're the guy who let clinton off the hook'
it is a bit like the neiman marcus christmas catalog , though this particular folio was created in paris in the 1820 s like department stores today , french merchants used to publish ravishingly beautiful lifesize drawings of expensive luxury goods in the latest style that customers could order shepherd derom , a gallery at 58 east 79th street in manhattan , is selling a series of such early19thcentury neoclassical design drawings , all of which depict gilt bronzes they were intended to wow the audience and seduce them into buying the object , said charles plante , a london dealer who organized the show this was stuff for a very selective group the objects the drawings depict are like couture for the home they include stylish gilt bronze clocks with literary portrait busts , candelabra with allegorical figures and crystal chandeliers the drawings were made to appeal to french nobles , wealthy european patrons , even francophile americans in 1817 , while refurbishing the white house after the british burned it in the war of 1812 , president james monroe ordered a suite of neoclassical french furniture and a group of similar gilt bronze objects , some of which still survive in the white house there are 56 images at the gallery , some original drawings , the others handcolored lithographs there has never been a collection like this on one subject , said mr plante , who is showing it in new york through jan 25 ornamental design drawings for objects are extremely rare outside of public institutions even rarer are complete collections mr plante , who specializes in the neoclassical period from 1760 to 1840 , showed the collection earlier in london and has published a 146page catalog on it with essays by the british architectural historian john harris and richard garnier , a british expert on antique clocks i brought the show to new york to revive interest in design drawings on the market , mr plante said he found the folio in a remote country auction in england two years ago the drawings were in bad shape , he recalled i had them cleaned and pressed almost none were signed , but the lithographs were marked motte , after a famous paris printer , draftsman , etcher and publisher named charles tienne pierre motte presumably paris bronziers of the time , like choiselatgallien and g rardjean galle , commissioned such drawings to update their stock the designs are elaborate the clocks are encased in cut crystal or rare colored marble candelabra stand on alabaster bases with goddesses and floral wreaths aplenty , the pieces look to modern eyes almost excessively opulent for example , no 33 is a cupid playing a lyre atop a clock , his bow and quiver by his side behind him is a flambeau adorned with his laurel crown the plinth has a frieze adorned with swans , urns , cornucopias and flowers there s a whole symphony going on here , mr plante said it s almost camp such designs are variations of the bronzes created under napoleon , but they emphasize peaceful themes instead of military ones the drawings date from the restoration period , when louis xviii was brought back as king of france \( 181424 \) after the french revolution , the republic and the empire returning to a france torn asunder by 25 years of internal strife , civil war , terror , repression and lastly militaristic despotism under napoleon , louis s first and main task was to reunify the nation , mr garnier writes extraordinary as it might seem , the collective populace , despite its disparate political inclinations , was ready in 1814 for the return of the bourbons he observes that louis xviii on his return to paris from england in 1814 was hailed as le desire by the crowds along the route in paris bronziers naturally chose new designs to reflect the new political realities there is a drawing of a fourlight candelabrum that has the figure of a winged victory as its central support her arms are raised to hold a circlet of four cornucopias she is a messenger of the gods who has descended to earth to bring nature s bounty the restored louis xviii undoubtedly was a man with a mission who had a point to prove his political legitimacy , mr garnier writes louis xviii cleverly equated himself with henri iv , the founder of the bourbon dynasty , who reigned from 1589 to 1610 he went down in history as france s most popular king , a true friend of his people , positions that louis wanted to emulate , he continues evidently the paris bronziers took their cue from the king one lithograph embellished with watercolor and gouache is of a clock with a large bust of henri iv , complete with the french chivalric order of st michael henri iv has a kindly mien as the bourbons' founding father , he was a natural symbol of legitimacy for the restoration of the bourbons after the defeat of napoleon in 181415 , and his cult was rekindled , mr plante writes additionally , st michael with his imagery of vanquishing the devil could serve as a useful allegory for the then recent expulsion of the english from france in addition to the drawings mr plante sought out the bronzes they inspired many are in the spanish royal collection , so they were easy to identify , he said he also searched museums , galleries and auction houses for other examples he found one at sotheby s as he writes , a clock exactly modeled on this design , and of the same height , executed completely in patinated bronze except for the order of st michael in gilt bronze , the dial signed blanc fils , palais royal , sold at sotheby s amsterdam , february 21 , 1995 he borrowed a few antique bronzes from dealers to display alongside the drawings the best match is probably the handsome gilt bronze inkstand , circa 1820 , on loan from the hoffmangampetro gallery , at 1050 second avenue , at 55th street , in manhattan it is cylindrical with the sides etched in a trellis pattern , and it has a separate top adorned with a kneeling cupid ronald hoffman , the owner , said that not only the decoration but also the cavities for ink , sand and quills are identical to those on the drawing even the candle holder behind the cupid is the same , he added prices for the drawings range from 4 , 000 to 18 , 000 the prints are less designers , take note while the iconography of such drawings is fascinating , they are also wonderfully decorative , and most are in period

washington , may 16 foreboding grew in the months before the sept 11 attacks , as president bush and his national security aides studied intelligence reports hinting that terrorists could be plotting a major attack , mr bush s national security adviser , condoleezza rice , said today ms rice described a hazy , jumbled mosaic of threat signals , none of them precise or clear i do n't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the world trade center , take another one and slam it into the pentagon , that they would try to use an airplane as a missile , ms rice said excerpts , page a22 but mr bush and his aides did not have all the threat information that was circulating through lower levels of the government in july and august , some of it more specific bits and pieces of intelligence began to be picked up american counterterrorism officials , but they were never coherently assembled because agencies did not share or act on the information before the sept 11 attacks even when information did reach the president , its possible relevance to the plot seems evident only in hindsight for example , the report provided to the president on aug 6 , which warned him that mr bin laden s followers might hijack airplanes , was based on 1998 intelligence data drawn from a single british source , government officials said today that source said al qaeda had an interest in hijacking airplanes in order to obtain hostages who could be used as bargaining chips so the terrorist organization could demand the freedom of sheik omar abdel rahman , a muslim cleric who was convicted in 1995 for his role in the failed plot to blow up landmarks in the new york area mr bush was told , the officials said , that neither the central intelligence agency nor the federal bureau of investigation had confirmed the information even as president bush asked for more information about the threats posed by al qaeda , ms rice said , the white house was not informed about several developments that , in hindsight , might have provided early warnings she said mr bush had not been told before sept 11 about a memo written in july by an fbi agent in phoenix who warned that groups like al qaeda might be sending students to american flight schools to train for terror operations the white house was also not told that the fbi had arrested zacarias moussaoui in minneapolis after a flight school there reported that he had wanted to train on a 747 flight simulator , even though he had little experience as a pilot as you might imagine , ms rice said , a lot of things are prepared within agencies they 're distributed internally , they 're worked internally it s unusual that anything like that would get to the president he does n't recall seeing anything i do n't recall seeing anything of this kind beginning in december 2000 , ms rice said , the white house received warning signs that continued into the spring and summer of 2001 that indicated that al qaeda was planning an attack in the united states , but intelligence and law enforcement officials said they were not certain where or when in may and june , american intelligence began to intercept communications between al qaeda members discussing an attack , one that could be larger than any previous al qaeda operation other officials have said that at least one message included a reference to the organization s desire to wage a devastating attack and used the word hiroshima to describe its possible scope the communications prompted deep concern in counterterrorism units at the cia , fbi and the white house , and the bureau issued threat warnings in june and july about a possible terrorist attack around the fourth of july the federal aviation administration also issued warnings to airlines on july 5 , the threat reporting had become sufficiently robust , though not , again , very specific , but sufficiently robust there was a lot of chatter in the system that in his morning meeting , the president asked me to go back and to see what was being done about all of the chatter that was there , ms rice said ms rice said she met that afternoon with richard a clarke , a white house counterterrorism coordinator , to discuss the increase in threat information mr clarke convened two meetings that day on possible attacks , including one in which domestic agencies like the transportation department were included on july 6 , the government was so concerned about threats in turkey , france and italy that counterterrorism officials were ordered to avoid traveling contingency planning was done on how to deal with multiple simultaneous attacks around the world , ms rice said no attack occurred over the holiday even so , american counterterrorism experts still believed that a largescale operation could be coming , officials said ms rice said intelligence analysts had long believed that terrorists and al qaeda in particular might resort to hijackings as a weapon against the united states the authorities in the philippines had warned in 1995 of a possible plot to hijack commercial jets for use in terrorist actions ms rice said , that terrorism and hijacking might be associated is not rocket science , she said
williamsburg , va the word came back from the future , as it were , to the africanamerican character interpreters who portray slaves anguishing over freedom in the year 1774 here in the busy , historysteeped tourist mecca of modern colonial williamsburg descendants of thomas jefferson , meeting in may of the year 2002 , have once more rebuffed any admission of kinship with descendants of sally hemings , a slave who quite likely bore jefferson at least one child , according to the latest dna evidence now accepted by the scholars at his monticello plantation when the jefferson fight comes around each year i just get an extra edge , said richard josey , who portrays a gardener enslaved in this picturesque village he shook his head in dismay at how some things never seem to change in his real life as a modern black professional engrossed by the precise details of history , mr josey , like the other slave portrayers here , is more inspired than depressed by the annual rebuff of hemings kin by white jefferson descendants organized as the monticello association in recent years , the association members have been meeting each spring in charlottesville , 120 miles west , and firmly voting down all proposals for accepting the hemings descendants , let alone granting them permission to be buried at monticello i just hope those folks come down here and see slavery for what it really is , said mr josey , brandishing a tone of resistance that is part and parcel of his character , a countryborn but urbanwise slave chafing under the ownership of his white master , lord dunmore the slavery aspects of colonial life have been gradually introduced here in increasing detail across the last 20 years as options now stand , summer tourists can visit the idealized world of jefferson s monticello with its white graveyard , or head here for an even more historical inkling of slavery in the tableaus that dapple the larger world of dominant colonial whites some of the words echoing from the latest standoff at monticello make williamsburg seem more relevant for at least attempting glimpses at the deep roots of lasting national enmity our intent was to kill this forever , a member of the monticello association said after the latest vote against the hemings descendants a hemings family member , requesting acknowledgment of the dna evidence , observed , none of us have any interest in invading your cemetery and making any of you less white in the shifting repertoire of williamsburg , the dedicated slave portrayers are now depicting the mundane life of 1774 that was a heady year for whites and a perplexing one for blacks as the masters' talk was all about freedom and the right to revolt against english , not american , injustice i hear the words that they 're saying , but i do not think that they mean freedom for us in the same way they mean it for themselves , moses , a house slave of peyton randolph , the first president of the continental congress , confided in his colleague , mingo the two slaves , charged with stealing a sheep and some corn , were waiting in the courthouse for the dispensation of colonial justice ignoring the tourist minicameras of 2002 , the two evinced no great optimism for acquittal or future freedom from bondage \( character portrayers are not tied to precise scripts but adlib situations with close attention required to the real events they study \) that mr jefferson , he says slavery is an abomination , said moses , delivering the observation with an easy tidewater drawl mingo , squinting at his friend , shot back but jefferson still got his slaves the timeless craving for freedom may be one explanation for the difficulty that williamsburg administrators report in finding people interested in careers in bondage roles that can prove stressful and controversial in the eyes of black friends and family members i always hear about it , mr josey said i ask them 'would you really rather your child heard only about jefferson and washington and the great things and not know anything about where your ancestors came from \? ' harvey bakari , the developer of the africanamerican program , said it is a challenge recruiting people willing to play slaves it takes a lot of commitment to put on the costume of a slave and have the strength to wear it as a badge of honor to our ancestors , mr bakari said this year williamsburg is emphasizing the urban aspects of slavery highlights include some charming kitchen gossip by the slaves , some heated debates over whether they should support the antislavery british if revolution comes , the poignant dilemma of a woman impregnated by the master , and the most wrenching issue of how to tell a young slave child about the suffocating world of bondage hope smith , who plays rose , a house slave , has portrayed characters here for 18 of her 26 years , even as she studied at jefferson s alma mater , william and mary college my mom thought it was an opportunity for me to get over what was a painful shyness when i was young , ms smith explained i grew to love this history it makes you value and treasure the freedoms you do have , and more keen to injustice slaves represented half of historic williamsburg , but the 10 slave portrayers are only about a fifth of the interpreters corps tourists see , ms smith said in hoping for a truer balance even more , the black interpreters yearn for far more human interaction between master and slave i 'd like to see thomas jefferson come up in front of the raleigh tavern here with his man jupiter pulling the horse , because those are the pictures sure to stick in someone s mind , said mr josey , who has encyclopedic knowledge of jefferson the master and jupiter the slave did you know jefferson admitted he owed jupiter money \? mr josey asked , grinning at the possibilities of not denying history jefferson wrote that in his diary photos at colonial williamsburg , actors have been increasingly depicting scenes from the lives of slaves among those portraying slaves are hope smith , far left above , with harriott lomax and richard josey , bottom \( photographs by paul hosefros the new york times \)
for months , aventis pasteur , a major vaccine maker , has been quietly testing the effectiveness of tens of millions of doses of smallpox vaccine , which had been made in one of its factories more than 40 years ago and then stored in freezers , executives said yesterday aventis told the government of the existence of the vaccine years ago , but the government did not become interested in testing the vaccine until after the anthrax attacks began last fall , according to richard j markham , chief executive of aventis s american operations the company is based in france only in the last month did it become clear that the vaccine still worked , mr markham said today the company plans to announce at a news conference with health and human services secretary tommy g thompson that it has agreed to deliver the vaccine more than 85 million doses to the government , he said the vaccine will greatly expand the supply available to the public in case of a bioterrorist attack at a news conference yesterday , mr thompson confirmed that the government had been talking to aventis for some time about whether the old vaccine was still effective and about how the government could obtain it we 're nearing conclusions on those discussions , he said the company will not be paid for the vaccine , mr markham said but the government will reimburse it for some of the expenses it incurred in thawing the vaccine , testing it and putting it into vials the government has also agreed to protect aventis from any liability if the vaccine harms some patients , he said it has lost some potency but it is still a useful vaccine , mr markham said hopefully we will never have to use it the smallpox vaccine is known to have had serious side effects , including some deaths , in people with weakened immune systems mr markham said the company and the government had agreed last fall not to tell the public about aventis s stock of smallpox vaccine none of us wanted to get people s hopes up and then find out that we could not use it , he said the vaccine was made in the 1950 s at a swiftwater , penn , factory that aventis later acquired for the last several years , mr markham said , the company has been talking to the government about whether it should destroy the vaccine but he said the company never got a definitive answer in midoctober , after a florida man died from an anthraxlaced letter , aventis reminded the government of the vaccine s existence and they began discussing what tests needed to be done to determine that the vaccine was still effective , mr markham said suddenly this stockpile of 40yearold vaccine suddenly became a lot more important , he said mr markham said studies would soon begin to determine whether the 85 million doses could be diluted aventis s vaccine is similar to the 154 million doses of vaccine that the government already has a study released yesterday by the new england journal of medicine said the vaccine the government has could be diluted five times and remain potent both aventis s vaccine and the vaccine now held by the government were made decades ago , using manufacturing practices that would not be used today the government has signed two contracts with another company , acambis , to make more than 200 million doses of vaccine using more modern and sanitary manufacturing techniques the company has agreed to deliver that vaccine by the end of the year acambis is progressing nicely , mr thompson said yesterday they are on schedule aventis and several other companies are now working on a thirdgeneration smallpox vaccine that would be safer than either the old vaccine or the one made by acambis but that vaccine is many years away , mr markham said
the national magazine awards ceremony , held yesterday at the waldorfastoria , has become the place where the traditional measures of publishing success size and profitability defer to editorial excellence which is why the atlantic monthly and the new yorker , two magazines that require millions of dollars from their owners to stay alive , end up as the belles of the ball the atlantic , which the editor michael kelly took over a little more than two years ago , was nominated for five awards and took home three the new yorker s success ratio was lower it was nominated for nine awards and won three but still substantial editors of hugely popular magazines like people and cosmopolitan were left to poke at their salmon lunches and be spectators as mr kelly and david remnick made short , tasteful victory speeches they say you cannot eat prestige , but mr kelly looked pretty well satiated after the awards i think it is a sign of momentum , said mr kelly , adding that david bradley , the owner of the atlantic , has put millions of dollars , personal energy and enormous resources into funding great work at this magazine newsstand sales are up , renewal rates are up and now this , makes us feel like we are on the right track nonetheless , ad pages do not flow to award winners the way that an oscar bolsters a movie s boxoffice take the triumph of two magazines built on narrative was not a shock , but the day had its moments michael wolff , who has found much joy and attention in skewering the publishing industry in the column this media life for new york magazine tina brown , the creator of talk , now defunct , has been a perennial target won an award for columns and commentary awards mean nothing until you are the winner , mr wolff said then they become richly deserved and full of meaning the meaning plays out over a limited demographic after a few hours at the awards , the new hampshire primary comes to mind the stakes are high , but only for people involved in the contest , and the winners and losers madly spin with the best of them the fact that the award can put a career on steroids adds significant crackle to the proceedings nonetheless , decorum ruled there were no halle berry meltdowns , no james cameron selfcrownings , but behind all the polite applause , there was a palpable lust to get one s mitts on an ellie , the alexander calder elephant stabile that looks more like a space age weapon they may look impressive , but they do not have the value in the advertising marketplace that winners would like to think i think of it as more an insider event , said george fertitta , president of the ad agency margeotes fertitta partners i think in order for it to have relevance and meaning beyond the people in that industry , it has to be actively promoted now that he is out of the hunt and busy writing a book , daniel okrent , a former senior editorial executive at time inc , is willing to voice an unpopular opinion as a twotime winner , i can tell you that they mean nothing , he said maybe the individual story awards matter , but the generalexcellence categories are absolutely arbitrary you have magazines that win one year and the next year they are not even nominated , even though it is the exact same magazine put out by the same staff and the same editors it s kind of silly by its very nature , the contest for general excellence the best picture oscar of the event puts apples and oranges in the same basket because the determining factor is circulation size that means that vibe , an urban music magazine , and the new yorker , two magazines that probably do not have a lot of crossreadership , both competed in the generalexcellence category for magazines with circulations of 500 , 000 to a million vibe won and vibe s victory was not the only splash of color in a very white professional milieu susan l taylor , editorial director of essence , received a hall of fame award for her years at essence , a magazine whose brand of empowerment has found a large audience among black women some tweaks occurred this year , including the addition of another generalexcellence category and a recalibration of the circulation ranges the changes benefited entertainment weekly , which won a general excellence award in the reconfigured milliontotwomillion group but no amount of rejiggering will change the embedded bias of the screeners , who generally consign women s magazines to the less prestigious margins of the competition narrative is king , and a magazine is generally out of luck if it does not go long and glorious stephen colvin , president of dennis publishing usa , was not at the waldorf although dennis s magazines maxim , stuff and blender are successes in a very tough market , none were nominated the key barometers of magazine success are circulation , advertising and profitability , mr colvin said , adding that awards are beside the point other magazine executives , especially those who head publications that are struggling for visibility in competitive niches , say an award can be a tipping point every magazine in the world is out there telling advertisers how great they are , but this makes it official it s not your word against everyone else s , said john rasmus , editor of the threeyearold magazine national geographic adventure it won awards for personal service and general excellence \( in the 200 , 000to500 , 000circulation category \) michael r levy , publisher of texas monthly , acknowledges that the awards can be subjective but even given that , you never walk away and say , 'why in the hell did they win \? ' the judging may be subjective , but this is not figure skating the awards are not nearly as exciting , for one thing , though the folks from vibe made a tall and mighty noise when the magazine won its general excellence award as a species , we are just not that demonstrative , said david granger , editor in chief of esquire we are editors , what do you want \? we 're boring photo among the editors whose magazines won the awards for general excellence yesterday were , from left , emil wilbekin of vibe , john rasmus of national geographic adventure , david remnick of the new yorker , james w seymore jr of entertainment weekly and mark whitaker of newsweek \( nancy siesel the new york times \) chart 2002 national magazine award winners for general excellence circulation over 2 , 000 , 000 newsweek 1 , 000 , 000 to 2 , 000 , 000 entertainment weekly 500 , 000 to 1 , 000 , 000 vibe 200 , 000 to 500 , 000 national geographic adventure under 200 , 000 print personal service national geographic adventure leisure interests vogue reporting the atlantic monthly public interest the atlantic monthly feature writing the atlantic monthly columns and commentary new york essays the new yorker reviews and criticism harper s profile writing the new yorker singletopic issue time design details photography vanity fair fiction the new yorker general excellence online national geographic
santa rosa , calif , april 4 in the only sexual abuse trial of a priest now before an american jury , the rev don kimball stands accused of raping a 14yearold girl near the altar of a roman catholic church 25 years ago , when he was a youth minister who mixed massage therapy and rock music with bible readings legal scholars said it appeared that father kimball could not be tried in any other state , because the statute of limitations had run out for the charges against him in california , however , a 1993 law that is unique in the nation effectively eliminated statutes of limitation for sex abuse in sonoma county , the district attorney , j michael mullins , has pursued priestly abusers with unusual determination god intends me to do my duty under the law , mr mullins , who is catholic , said but if the california law and mr mullins s tough stance have made father kimball s trial unique for now , that may be changing prosecutors in several regions said they were seeking new ways to interpret laws that could allow them to press criminal charges against abusive priests even when statutes of limitation would seem to block them other law enforcement actions from maine to los angeles in recent days suggest that prosecutors across the nation are shedding longheld concerns of taking on a powerful institution like the roman catholic church and adopting a more aggressive posture toward reports of sexual abuse by the clergy in detroit and cincinnati , prosecutors served subpoenas on a bishop and an archdiocese last week , demanding information about priests accused of sexual misconduct in both cases , the prosecutors called their actions unprecedented for their cities michael k allen , the hamilton county prosecuting attorney who issued the subpoena on the cincinnati archdiocese , said scores of citizens called his office to urge a tough stance people are saying , 'hey , mr prosecutor , these abuses are terrible , go after them ! ' mr allen , who is catholic , said in st louis , the prosecutor collected dozens of previously unreported sexual accusations against priests after inviting citizens to report abuses , allowing her to open new criminal investigations against more than a dozen current or former priests , a spokesman said in maine , eight district attorneys asked the portland diocese to release records of accusations of sexual abuse dating back 75 years and said even cases for which statutes of limitations had expired could yield information leading to new prosecutions in los angeles , the district attorney and police chief insisted that the archdiocese comply with statutes requiring the clergy to report sexual abuse to law enforcement agencies , thus prying loose enough new information to begin several criminal investigations just this week the archdiocese of new york , after weeks of resistance , complied with the request of the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , turning over personnel files on priests who had been accused of sexual abuse in the past four decades i 've watched law enforcement deal with church authorities for decades , and a monumental change has swept the country in the last few months , said a w richard sipe , a retired psychologist who has appeared as an expert witness in more than 50 sexual abuse trials prosecutors are not acting as timidly in the face of the church as they once did bill ryan , a spokesman for the united states conference of catholic bishops , said he was aware that sometimes prosecutors had not filed charges against priests accused of abuse , often because statutes of limitation had expired or because victims did not want to be publicly identified sometimes prosecutors felt there was nothing they could do with these things , mr ryan said i certainly would n't say it was because prosecutors were afraid of the catholic church , because i do n't know that to be true obviously there s a different attitude now , mr ryan added authorities in some places are saying , 'give us names , we do n't care how far back they go' some prosecutors interviewed this week disputed the notion that they and their colleagues across the nation had ever been reluctant to prosecute members of the clergy but several lawyers , law professors and advocates for abuse victims said prosecutors had rarely acted with as much vigor as the plaintiffs' lawyers who have collected huge civil settlements from the church on behalf of abuse victims sylvia demarest , a dallas lawyer , used statistics to support that argument from among the 46 , 000 american priests , ms demarest said , she has collected 1 , 200 names of priests accused of sex crimes against minors of those , only about 120 ever had criminal charges lodged against them , and fewer than 80 served time in prison , she said a clear sign of change was the subpoenas issued last week by the two midwestern district attorneys in detroit , the wayne county prosecutor , mike duggan , issued a subpoena to bishop kevin britt , who handles sexual abuse issues for the archdiocese of detroit , to give sworn testimony this week
suwon , south korea never mind the horse race forget about the tyson fight bag the hockey finals and the basketball finals , while you 're at it kiss off interleague baseball the big event is happening monday south korea versus the united states , baby this game between these two allies was supposed to be the occasion for one of those two soccer thirdworld nations to get off the floor , maybe win a game , perhaps clutch the temporary thrill of mediocrity and maybe even encourage the illusion of sneaking into the next round of the world cup finals instead , the game on monday has become their super bowl , their heavyweight fight , their triple crown , high atop the new group of death the entire stadium in taegu , way down the korean peninsula , is going to be rocking with redclad south korean fans within 24 hours , the united states shocked portugal , 32 , here last night after the south koreans had run poland into the ground , 20 , in pusan on tuesday the bad news bears of south korea and the charlie brown americans are undefeated , untied and maybe even unconscious this may have been the greatest moment in the history of american soccer the yanks actually beat england , 10 , in brazil in 1950 , although many fans in england and elsewhere still do not believe or acknowledge it then there was the 21 upset over colombia in the 1994 world cup at home , and the game that many people overlook , which was paul caligiuri s goal over trinidad and tobago in 1989 in the final qualifying game , which sent the united states to the 1990 world cup in italy , the first time in the finals since 1950 but last night s game is most recent , so it feels like the greatest game the adept and poised way the united states moved the ball was a tribute to major league soccer , which nurtured many of the players , as well as to the youth leagues and the schools and the soccer moms and dads , and the players who went overseas to pursue this odd notion that americans , too , can play this game portugal knows that now so does any american who got up early to watch this one live this one cleared the air of the most recent world cup in france in 1998 , when the americans bickered and bumbled , got mugged by germany , stunned by iran , dispatched by yugoslavia , and generally seemed to set back soccer 1 , 000 years in the united states but as america suddenly loves soccer , at least for the next four days , south korea is even more abuzz in previous world cups , the south koreans were always the earnest strivers , tumbling and running and never backing down , but in 14 games they had lost 10 and tied 4 the confrontation on monday will be between two squads that suddenly have a legitimate chance to win the group , possibly avoid italy in the next round , and generally banish a lot of past failures and frustrations this should be right up there with the lakers and the nets and the stanley cup finals , said damarcus beasley , who keeps track of what is going on back home while bringing his fresh legs and fresh attitude to the american team beasley was just one of the 14 americans who contributed something to this victory , but he was the youngest and maybe the most impertinent the portuguese do not have a wonderful world cup history but they do export sensational players to the spanish and italian leagues they came in with the body language that indicated they ought to win this game , perhaps easily , yet they fell behind in the fourth minute at that point , the portuguese began to gear up their considerable skills and bigtime wiles sergio concei o , age 27 , who plays for inter milan in italy s serie a , performed a classic european flop in the general vicinity of beasley , just turned 20 , who plays for the chicago fire of mls beasley was having none of that he wagged his finger at sergio concei o , saying that this kind of connivance was unacceptable i do n't know if they respected us or not , beasley said he was crying , and then he got in my face the kid was not going to be jived by some oldworld pecking order , and neither were his teammates they took a 30 lead and hung on in a tense second half it may very well be that portugal s stars are worn down from the long european season it may also be that they are fancy dans , like their iberian neighbors from spain , and prone to upsets in the world cup finals it may also be that the polish players blew all of their luck in qualifying and are really as thicklegged and unimaginative as the south koreans made them look suddenly , there is a new world order to this group the rest of the americans , including the coach , were as brash as beasley bruce arena knew that his captain , claudio reyna , was hurt again but arena also had the audacity not to use clint mathis , that potent but inconsistent force , whom he judged not to be ready for 90 minutes that decision had the potential for looking like classic overcoaching , until arena s selected team came out and played as good a 30 minutes as any united states team has ever played there is a subplot this is how the united states looks with the spunky john o'brien taking over for reyna this is how the united states looks with beasley busting moves with speed no american player has ever had this is how the united states looks with landon donovan using his new layer of muscle this is a new united states team and a new day meeting a host nation with its own charming momentum it s going to be a great game , beasley said people in the us should pay attention south koreaunited states , baby photo

john l jackson jr university of chicago press \( 30 , hardcover \) many of the harlem residents i met argued that they did n't have serious social contacts across class lines even when people may initially say otherwise , they sometimes do have such interactions class differences within one s social circle can mean you celebrate with two separate parties for two very , very different and seemingly separable parts of your social network or it can mean that you designate your everyday interactions with poorer african americans as other than clear friendships even when they might seem to have all the trappings thereof some harlemites have people they work with , as in zelda s case , whom they know pretty well people they hang out with at nightclubs but who never , say , invite them over to their suburban home in new jersey other harlemites seem to know that they have friends who could use their help but approach that fact very carefully either because they do n't want to offend by appearing superior \( not wanting to preach \) or because they ca n't justify risking such assistance when the person is n't ready to receive it if friendships are difficult to hold onto amid class differences , familial ties can be just as hard some people live fairly close to relatives of different classes or status positions and purposefully avoid them maybe the person who has achieved a bit of socioeconomic success does n't want to feel the guilt of that success juxtaposed against other people s failure or maybe they feel a potential danger in mingling too closely with the disillusionment and cynicism that sometimes burdens the lives of the poor on the other hand , some people who have made it try to stay around specifically and selfconsciously to model behaviors for the less successful sometimes a fleeting moment or a brief encounter with a stranger or a series of short interactions with acquaintances can have tremendous significance in terms of how people think

levels of homocysteine in the blood promoted as the new cholesterol as a harbinger of coronary disease may not be very helpful in predicting heart attacks and strokes in healthy people , a new study finds the study , being published today in the journal of the american medical association , says homocysteine levels are less strongly related to the risk of heart attack and stroke than has been suggested doctors who contend that the measurements are useful said the study supported that position , if not as strongly as some might have hoped they argued that the importance of homocysteine was oversold by researchers and medical writers in the mid90 s , when studies found high levels of it in the blood of people who had heart attacks and strokes why not test for it \? asked dr kilmer mccully , who in 1969 was the first to propose that the chemical might somehow cause arteries to clog dr mccully said he had no major quarrel with the study s finding , but added even if the test method is n't perfect , it does give some information and it does show some connection between homocysteine levels and risk homocysteine is an amino acid that builds up in the blood of people who consume large quantities of animal protein and few leafy vegetables researchers suspect that it is not just a marker , but may also damage the arterial walls itself , encouraging plaques to form it can be quickly and safely lowered by reducing proteins , especially red meat , and taking b vitamins and folic acid , which are found in leafy vegetables , whole grains and virtually all multivitamin tablets the study , by a team based at oxford university and led by dr robert clarke , was a metaanalysis , blending data from 30 studies it encompassed almost 17 , 000 people who collectively suffered 5 , 073 heart attacks and 1 , 113 strokes after allowing for other risk factors like high blood pressure and smoking , dr clarke s team found that a person who lowered his homocysteine level 25 percent cut the heartattack risk 11 percent and the stroke risk 19 percent that s still a significant association , said dr paul f jacques , chief of nutritional epidemiology for the human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university , part of the agriculture department it s a modest predictor but it s all in how you define modest the earliest studies , in the 70 s on patients who had a heart attack or stroke , found an extremely high correlation with homocysteine levels one found that the 5 percent of patients with the highest levels had more than three times the risk of the others later studies that measured levels in healthy men and women and waited five or more years to see who developed heart problems , found smaller correlations , and sometimes none it s amazing how one or two studies can kill the party , dr jacques said he and other researchers and biostatisticians agreed that the 30 studies that dr clarke analyzed included all the important ones other metaanalyses like those that review the ability of mammograms to detect breast cancer have provoked debate when the researchers threw out major studies , saying their information was inadequate dr meir j stampfer , a leader of the physicians' health study at the harvard school of public health , who made early associations between homocysteine levels and heart disease , found dr clarke s findings more pessimistic than the reality might be dr stampfer cited a study in the journal of the medical association in august in it , half of 553 heart patients in switzerland who had operations to reopen clogged arteries were randomly assigned to receive six months of vitamin b therapy those who took the therapy had significantly fewer deaths and heart attacks in the group that took the vitamins , 26 percent had nonfatal heart attacks versus 43 percent in the control group dr mccully , who is sometimes called the father of homocysteine , said tests for it were as crude as cholesterol tests were 50 years ago he said refinements the equivalent of hdl and ldl levels with cholesterol would improve the prediction rates for heart disease or strokes a better test of the homocysteineheart disease connection , he added , would emerge when about 20 new worldwide studies under way finished all involve administering vitamins b6 and b12 , as well as folic acid , to healthy patients and waiting at least five years to see how many develop cardiovascular disease the first of those studies is reaching the fiveyear mark in the united states , homocysteine levels have been dropping since 1998 that year , the food and drug administration required all makers of bread and pasta flour to add b vitamins and folic acid to their products the goal was to eliminate spina bifida among babies born to mothers with vitamin deficiencies but it may have had a beneficial effect on heart disease , as well
sometimes , success can be as obvious as an allstar or as subtle as a smile in their recordbreaking season , the nets have thrived on both , enjoying an extraordinary chemistry based on trust and unselfish talent chemistry is only a concept , however , without a catalyst and that is where jason kidd , with his unassuming demeanor and his uncompromising competitiveness , comes into play he predicted 41 victories when he was traded to the nets before the season the nets have 51 with 3 games remaining he said he loved his work because of his teammates the feeling is reciprocal this is probably the most fun team , by far the best team , i 've ever played on , kidd , the team captain , said the youth of the team and the way everybody is getting along is something you do n't see in professional sports it is rare you always hear stories about different teammates not getting along but this is something you dream about you might pinch yourself and say you do n't want it to stop , you want it to keep going the nets \( 5128 \) are charging toward the playoffs for the first time since 1998 , having secured the best record in the eastern conference and having claimed their first atlantic division championship in the franchise s 26year nba history the reasons for the nets' success run deep , and , literally with kidd s direction , they all run together i just try to fit in , he said i do n't want to be the head of the ship and i do n't want to be the back of the ship i want to be the middle of the ship i want to be able to hold up both ends if i'm in the middle of the ship fitting in , i can hold up the bow and the stern on the floor he always seems to be in the middle of everything he is the catalyst , said rod thorn , the nets' president , who traded stephon marbury to phoenix for kidd he does all things , digging back defensively , the rebounding , the passing when your best player is unselfish , it filters down it s hard to be selfish on our team because that guy is n't kidd , second in the league with 10 assists per game , began the season as one of seven new nets players amid just two returning starters , an overhaul from determined behindthescenes activity ed stefanski , director of scouting , recommended that the nets draft richard jefferson and jason collins in a trade the nets agreed to pay the free agent center todd macculloch 34 million and then cleaned the locker room of any lingering apathy by buying out center jim mcilvaine in the fall , the secondyear head coach , byron scott , relayed a tough defense and his lakers experience to a new crop of eager listeners his assistant eddie jordan taught them a new offense with kenyon martin , kerry kittles and keith van horn returning healthy , the winning elements were all there , thrown into the beaker at the start but ultimately , chemistry is such an unknown it s a fragile thing , a team , thorn said you can have injury , and people can get out of sorts with each other so many little things can happen that will get you off line instead , it is the little things no devastating injuries , unselfishness and sacrifice , depth and good humor that have kept the nets on a fairly consistent line all season long since they were taking trips to the mall together in training camp , the players have all been able to joke easily with each other while victories beget laughter , it prompts a chickenandegg discussion first of all , thorn said , we have good people , we do n't have egos that get out of joint if things do n't go well individually the intricate offense of backdoor cuts and reads seems to suit the players' personalities , work ethic and athleticism kidd , martin and van horn each average 15 points per game kittles averages 135 points and the next three players average 95 points each on their best nights , the nets overwhelm their opponents with the unstoppable sum of their parts i think chemistry is maybe more important where you do n't have someone scoring 30 , said macculloch , who witnessed allen iverson s dominance in philadelphia last year as a teammate in order to get those points , it s got to come from everybody none of the nets has regularly explosive nights \( only three times in 79 games this season has one player scored more than 30 points \) and yet , the flip side of that could cause the team problems in the playoffs they have no defined goto guy even though he shoots 39 percent , kidd is the clutch player for the nets , scott said orlando coach doc rivers called kidd a giveto guy last week washington coach doug collins agreed he s the guy to make it happen , not necessarily the guy to make the shot , collins said he added that any of the players' ability to take a final shot could be an advantage because it keeps the defense guessing for the nets , it is instinct by now for us to be so new , to see how the pieces fit , they all connected since day 1 , kidd said and yet , there have been a few jagged edges martin s flagrant fouls have been the most piquant subject of debate , from within the league office to the nets front office and locker room martin , the secondyear forward , has been suspended for seven games this season for six flagrant fouls , crossing the line of unnecessary contact while he brought a toughness to the nets they had never had , he drew unwanted attention because of it his teammates have been both concerned and supportive while martin grows and figures out how to use and control his talent the nets were 52 in the games martin did not play when the rookie richard jefferson started for him those two players were involved in a brief locker room fight this season in the midst of a fourgame losing streak in portland their teammates considered it a brotherly thing , a family matter , and the two hugged on court two games later it helps the cohesion when broken bones are kept to a minimum , of course last season , the nets lost 345 playergames due to injury , including all 82 games kittles missed and the first 32 van horn sat out with a broken leg this season , macculloch missed the most games of any player 17 due to plantar fasciitis and harris missed five in a row because of a broken bone on the side of his head neither player appears to have regained his early season form yet , though neither is complaining perhaps the most worrisome trend heading into the playoffs is the nets' inexplicable troubles on the road in the second half of the season , where they won just 5 of 16 they have offset that with a franchiserecord 337 mark at continental arena , the secondbest home record in the league behind sacramento at home , the nets have displayed their deliriously creative fastbreak , tenacious defense and unspoken pursuit of a common goal we play great as a team and part of that is because of jason , van horn said we 've learned from him and we 've fed off him we 've all seemed to become better passers and played more unselfishly he s not the only reason why we 're here , but he s the biggest photo kenyon martin and jason kidd after the nets clinched the division title coach byron scott

newark two stern and stately men watch over dr victor parsonnet in his office at beth israel medical center the paintings , nearly a century old , are portraits of his russianborn grandfathers , medical pioneers who helped establish the city s first and only jewish hospital , a place born of institutional discrimination , but one that grew to become the state s preeminent incubator of medical innovation and a haven for colorblind health care they look over my shoulder and make me behave , said dr parsonnet , a titan in the field of cardiovascular surgery whose credits include the first nuclearpowered pacemaker and the first heart and kidney transplants in new jersey as recently as last week , the 77yearold dr parsonnet affixed the world s first wireless cellular pacemaker to the heart of elizabeth conyers , a newark resident , allowing doctors to remotely monitor the beat of her 79yearold heart indeed , dr parsonnet , who is now the director of surgical research at beth israel , has tackled so many firsts that they fill nearly a page of his biography but the gaze of dr parsonnet s grandfathers invariably follow him when he travels down lyons avenue to another of his frequent destinations , the new jersey performing arts center , and to the boardroom that serves the new jersey symphony orchestra his forbears , all of them passionate musicians and newark boosters , would undoubtedly be proud of dr parsonnet , the orchestra s longtime chairman , and a patron saint of the arts center victor has enriched the cultural landscape of new jersey like no one else , said alan lowenstein , 88 , a lawyer and zealous benefactor of this city who has come to know four generations of parsonnets this is a family that has always been committed to newark in a city that has lost so much , the parsonnet clan stands out for civic devotion when scores of talented doctors were chasing their patients to the new frontier of suburban essex county , dr parsonnet stayed put , clinging to the notion that community service should always come before personal ambition or institutional profits and at a time when new jersey s longsuffering symphony was crippled by financial distress and internecine strife , dr parsonnet saw the potential for greatness and rolled up his sleeves for a lot of us here , he saved the orchestra , said darryl kubian , a violinist who represents the company s 75 players there s a real reverence for him here the nadir came in 1981 , when the labor strife led to a lockout and a lost season until recently , the 80yearold orchestra traveled between suburban high schools and newark symphony hall , a former shriners palace known for its picturesque architecture and dreadful acoustics dr parsonnet s wife , mia , a physician and skilled pianist , recalls those days with bittersweet nostalgia at the old mosque , said mrs parsonnet , using its former nickname , whenever the wind blew , all the shutters would rattle and you would constantly hear the sirens from outside people from the suburbs were afraid to come to performances of course , the fear of downtown has largely faded and the symphony now revels in a 187 million arts center that opened in 1997 to rave reviews the orchestra , which won a grammy award last year , is now considered among the best in the nation orchestra members singlehandedly credit dr parsonnet for quelling the historic distrust between musicians and symphony board members unlike so many before him , he treats the artists like professionals , said larry tamburri , the symphony s executive director like so many oldtimers nurtured on the streets of newark s weequahic section , dr parsonnet overflows with memories of a vanished world , before places like maplewood , summit and the short hills became the new promised land the old ymha on high street , where his mother , rose , organized a chamber music series , is still there so is the house on keer avenue that was often filled with beethoven sonatas and marqueename pianists rose parsonnet , now 102 , was a piano teacher her husband eugene , a harvard graduate and a renowned cardiologist at the beth , was a violinist he was very enthusiastic but a terrible player , dr parsonnet says in the bleak years of the depression , his father and three friends would play chamber music at the house every weekend they called themselves the hafton quartet because the four of them together weighed a half ton , he said with a wistful grin i was saturated with music constantly we lived it and breathed it it was , and still is , part of our soul in those days , the jews of weequahic were mostly firstgeneration strivers or tentative members of an emerging middleclass in this urban shtetl , the parsonnets , all of them doctors or musicians , represented a sort of new world royalty you could say they were the intellectual elite , said marvin moser , 78 , a cardiologist who went to grammar school , high school and college with dr parsonnet none of the parsonnets lack the musical gene anne lieberson , dr parsonnet s sister , is a professional violinist and sometimes joins her brother and his wife for private recitals the couple s three children , two of whom are doctors , are also avid musicians and indeed , the musical tradition lives on in their grandchildren as well rose parsonnet s chamber music legacy also survives , although like most everything else from that era , the series flourishes further west , at the jewish community center of metropolitan new jersey
on dec 4 , gov john g rowland called for a new income tax on millionaires , raising their rate to 55 percent , a percentage point higher than almost everyone else earlier this year , he was strongly opposed to the tax , saying it would instigate class warfare the state budget gap changed his mind connecticut residents overwhelmingly support the new tax on those who earn more than 1 million a year nearly nine out of 10 favor the tax as the best way to help close the spending gap , according to a university of connecticut poll but some of those who will be affected are , not surprisingly , unhappy about it they said tax rates should be the same for everyone and that forcing them to pay more , even by 1 percentage point , makes for an inequitable tax system they said they were being unfairly singled out , but realized there was not much they can do to stop it i ca n't say i like the idea , but what do you do \? said a westport resident who makes more than 1 million a year in the financial business am i going to go out and picket \? no none of the residents affected by the millionaires' tax interviewed for this article wanted their names used , some saying it was extremely poor manners to talk about their wealth and those who admitted to at least being wealthy would n't say if the tax would apply to them still , all of them said they resented the tax russell s reynolds jr , whose family has been in greenwich for 11 generations and who was the founder of russell reynolds associates , a headhunting firm that he has sold his interest in , would not say if he would be affected by the tax , except to say , i'm not poor he did say , though , that the wealthy should n't be treated differently than anyone else any tax that is discriminatory is a mistake , said mr reynolds , now the chief executive of the directorship search group , a headhunting firm in greenwich wealthy people are willing to do their share , more than their share i do n't think they like being singled out as scapegoats one fairfield county money manager who often earns more than 1 million a year said governor rowland was taxing millionaires because , politically , he could get away with it with about 6 , 500 residents earning more than 1 million a year , he said the governor does n't have to worry about losing many votes it s very easy to tax the wealthy , the money manager said there are 32 million people in the state and 02 percent of them would be unhappy with a millionaires' tax mr reynolds said it would be a big mistake to treat millionaires unfairly because of how they contribute to the state s wellbeing they 're the people who are taking care of people , employing people , supporting charities , museums , contributing to the nonprofit world , he said the most wealthy people tend to be generous both millionaires and other business people said for all the debate , the tax does n't go very far to solve the state s fiscal crisis members of our board are not happy campers , said joe mcgee , vice president , public policy for the southwestern area commerce and industry association , a stamfordbased chamber of commerce they think it s unfair let s be real we all know the size of the budget deficit according to the legislative office of fiscal analysis , a 1 percentage point increase from 45 to 55 percent on incomes of more than 1 million would raise about 100 million in the seven months ending june 30 , and another 170 million the next fiscal year all together , the state has to come up with 500 million in the current fiscal year and 15 billion next fiscal year mr mcgee worried that the tax will exacerbate the economic fault lines in the state when you separate one group from the pack , it is never good , he said it plays on class and wealth differences and it is not good public policy the biggest danger many people expressed is that by singling out millionaires , the state will kill the golden goose if millionaires are being singled out , they could simply go live somewhere else and maybe take their companies with them state representative lile gibbons , a republican of greenwich , said that s a real concern it s a very elastic group , she said they have second homes and they will vote with their feet and move i do n't know if we can afford to lose any of them actually , there are already far fewer millionaires in the state than a few years ago while there were about 10 , 000 people earning more than 1 million a year in 2000 , the state estimated there are only 6 , 500 now , said robert wysock , an economic analyst with the state office of fiscal analysis he said it s the stock marketthat in large part determines the number of millionaires in the state there s not a huge identifiable group that are consistently millionaires , mr wysock said there are a lot who come in and come out due to capital gains or sales of property russ mitchell , the copresident of mitchell s , a highend , family owned clothing retailer with stores in westport and greenwich , said that many of his customers are in the financial industry and they could easily move somewhere else the financial services business today , pieces of it , you can do from anywhere , he said over time , they will decide , 'why do n't i do it in florida or nevada \? ' losing those people does n't help the state a greenwich man who earns more than 1 million a year in his job on wall street said the tax affected decision makers and what may only be a 1 percentage point increase today , could go higher tomorrow hedge fund managers say 'i do n't have to do this here , i can go to florida , ' he said these businesses are highly portable they wo n't move for 1 percent , but they will move for a 5 percent increase what if you 're a ceo living in greenwich who can move to texas \? he asked these are people who have the ability to move the company why do companies change their headquarters \? it comes down to economic lifestyle the cost of living and marginal tax rates and never mind florida or texas what about westchester county , where taxes have been traditionally higher \? taxes are a lot of the reason that people are living in greenwich as opposed to rye , he said it s taxes that affect your economic well being it s not reason no 1 but it is no 2 or no 3 greenwich is a great place if suddenly it becomes a high tax place , you think twice it only affects a handful of people , but these are the economic decision makers that are driving the state economy mr mcgee predicted that the state will ultimately raise taxes for every income group , including business connecticut has had historic advantage in taxes vs new york city , westchester , and new jersey , mr mcgee said this pretty much levels it off photo russell s reynolds jr , chief executive of a headhunting firm in greenwich , said the rich should not be singled out as scapegoats \( douglas healey for the new york times \)
tuss , the socalled matriarch of the elephants at the bronx zoo , passed away last week , and given her 26year history of welcoming generations of visitors , and what all agree was a gentle and generous nature , it would be callous to lead off with the question that nonetheless looms large how do you dispose of a 10 , 000pound dead elephant \? no , far better , when sitting down with dr robert a cook , chief veterinarian of the wildlife conservation society , to first spend some time chatting about the life and last days of tuss tuss \( rhymes with puss \) was , after all , the elephant face of the zoo offered up for photo ops , seen for years in a sesame street film clip having a bath dr cook , however , is a scientist and investigator in the arena of feelings and letting them run wild , he appears , at first , to prefer a contained approach the death of tuss , he says somewhat stiffly , was a tremendous loss she was a fine ambassador for her species he discusses , in clinical detail , the way the elephant went off her food a week ago monday , and the efforts of the veterinary team to treat her \( her keeper asked her to please stand and give her an ear , and i took a syringe and needle for a blood sample there are good veins in the ear \) he talks about making the difficult decision the following thursday that tuss was suffering and would have to be euthanized they administered the drugs outside tuss s home , the elephant house , first giving her a sedative , then , when she was asleep , the euthanizing agent it s a gentle way to go , dr cook said but do not confuse a stiff upper lip with an indifferent heart the day of this discussion is dr cook s graduation from columbia university , a triumphant day in which he will receive a master s degree in public administration after two years of weekend study , but he has removed all the congratulatory cards from his office walls in anticipation of this interview it would n't be right to keep them there , he says this is about tuss he also speaks , after a visit to the forested area where tuss was buried , of tuss s last hours , in which the people who worked with her had a chance to say goodbye it takes prompting for him to discuss his own farewell i went and stood in front of her her third eyelid it s in the inner corner of the eye , you can see it in dogs was shut , but she recognized me and opened her eye and i just stood with her a few minutes and looked into her eye and then , after tuss was dead \? they lifted her on to a truck with a forklift and moved her to the burial area , where we did a complete necropsy this was done when the zoo was closed was there ever a consideration of using tuss s remains as a source of meat \? the slightest tremble of outrage , although this , it turns out , has to do with health concerns none of our animals would ever be consumed by other animals , dr cook says there would be the concern of disease spiral if someone dies of illness , you want to be certain what the illness was all day friday we had 10 people , including the head of pathology , doing the necropsy we would not let her die in vain biographical notes , now , on tuss the elephant and the man who was one of her many health providers for at the wildlife conservation society , which runs the bronx zoo , there are 18 veterinarians on staff the elephant , 50 , was born in the wild in assam , india the zoo s title of matriarch was strictly an honorarium tuss never reproduced the herd at the zoo is entirely female she was , however , an affectionate companion to younger elephants , like 10yearold samuel r ii , who despite the name is female and lived with tuss in the elephant house compound dr cook , 47 , was born in emerson , nj his father , an electrical engineer , had as a boy come to the united states from germany , narrowly escaping the holocaust , and this , dr cook says , brought a sense of reverence for life to the household he was also affected by the annual camping summer trips the family made to montana and the animals in the wild married to an actress , he came to the bronx zoo 17 years ago and has two children , ages 7 and 10 at the zoo , dr cook has performed surgery on animals as small as an eightinch fish , the lake victoria cichlid , and as large as a female rhinoceros the surgery on the fish , to remove an ovarian tumor , was performed on a sponge , as anesthetized water suffused with oxygen ran over the fish s gills it was successful the surgery on the rhino , to remove a uterine tumor , was done with specially made large sutures and carpet needles that had been sterilized the rhino suffered postoperative complications and was buried in the same unmarked wooded area as tuss why is n't the elephant s graveyard open to the public \? we call it a burial ground , says dr cook , still the scientist then it never crossed my mind that is something we would do it s more for their bodies to go back into nature everyone s view of life and death is different my memories are still when i close my eyes i see tuss looking at me , and standing in front of that site would n't enrich that photo dr robert a cook \( frances roberts for the new york times \)
when nancy temple decided to take a job at arthur andersen two years ago , she sat down with a good friend , holly harrison , to explain her reasons ms harrison recalled that her friend had seen it as a way to get a balanced life nancy found herself in a situation where she had never really taken time for herself , ms harrison said she was incapable of giving it any less than 105 percent i think she was thinking it would be something of a lifestyle change for her the lifestyle certainly changed , but not for the better today , arthur andersen stands devastated by a guilty verdict in a houston trial that focused not on the firm s accounting work for enron , not on its destruction of documents related to enron , but on ms temple s lawyering in a trial of almost six weeks , prosecutors hammered at ms temple s memorandums and telephone conversations especially an october email message in which she reminded andersen employees of the company s policy on document retention prosecutors and lawmakers who have investigated andersen s role in the collapse of enron said that ms temple was in fact sending subtle signals to begin the widespread destruction of documents that followed but the jurors did not focus on any of that in reaching their verdict instead , they found that ms temple s editing suggestion to david b duncan , the lead partner in the enron account , on a single memorandum obstructed justice ms temple , 38 , recommended that mr duncan remove a passage that described a disagreement with an enron executive over whether the wording of a news release on the company s finances was misleading ms temple s lawyer , mark c hansen , said that his client had taken the verdict well she s not tearful she s not angry she s just basically stoic , he said she has a faith that she did nothing wrong and that this is what s going to come out at the end of the day mr hansen said that ms temple , who invoked her fifth amendment rights against self incrimination during the andersen trial , would not comment ms temple s friends insist that the work she did in her relatively short time on the enron account could not have made her the corrupt persuader of mr duncan , a 20year member of the firm lawyers who knew ms temple at sidley austin brown wood , the firm she joined after graduating from harvard law school and where she rose to partner before leaving for andersen , said that the bright , generous lawyer they knew bore no resemblance to the corporate iago portrayed by the prosecution nancy is the most conscientious and ethical person that you could possibly want to meet , said gerard d kelly , a sidley austin partner what s happened to her has just been a travesty the prosecutors in their presentation were trying to suggest that nancy wrote an email that said one thing and meant something , else with a wink and a nod , mr kelly said that s not nancy ms harrison called ms temple scrupulously honest , and said that nancy cutting any corners on ethical matters is simply inconsistent with everything i know about her she was so straightforward that she could sometimes seem almost na ve , recalled nate eimer , who worked with ms temple as a litigator at sidley austin and later left to form his own firm when somebody lies to her , she s particularly puzzled by it she just does n't understand why somebody does n't tell the truth , he said but this seeming na vet had no hint of weakness , he added , explaining that in court , if they did n't tell the truth , they 'd pay the price for it mr eimer said , i have no doubt in my mind that she would n't have directed the destruction of documents none prosecutors took a different view , painting a portrait of a corporate lawyer who saw trouble ahead from the securities and exchange commission and subtly alerted the firm to take evasive action in his opening statement , matthew friedrich , a prosecutor , told jurors that ms temple and andersen management knew not only that the sec was coming , but they knew what that could mean to the firm after the verdict was announced on saturday , the head of the justice department s enron task force , leslie caldwell , suggested that further trials including criminal trials against andersen executives could be ahead we 're still looking at everything we 're not finished with arthur andersen , she said ms temple s friends at sidley austin , however , considered her such a good example of the qualities they valued that they placed her on the committee that plans summer programs for clerks and new lawyers , and on the committee that recruited harvard law students everybody recognized that if you wanted a role model for young law students and young associates , nancy is perfect , mr kelly said ms temple , an expert litigator who specialized in issues like accounting liability in corporate lawsuits , was a natural for andersen it had faced litigation over highlevel fiascoes with several clients , including waste management and sunbeam but enron s tangled accounting presented an even greater threat mr hansen , the lawyer for ms temple , said that jurors had balanced their entire verdict on an innocuous event the change that she recommended , he said , was a factual correction the edit was appropriate to correct the memo , he said , not to illegally conceal wrongdoing other people were working on this memo and not a single person had trouble with that , he said that kind of editing of business people s memos is carried on every day by lawyers in america and it was perfectly appropriate ms temple will eventually be vindicated , he said as far as we 're concerned , the facts are good for nancy , he said throughout this whole series of events , she tried to do the right thing in the meantime , ms temple continues to go to the office every day even under the pressures of investigations and lawsuits , she has tried to retain a positive outlook , said friends when she testified before congress in january , she told mr kelly , she had particularly enjoyed the opportunity to take her daily run among the city s monuments mr kelly said that the case has engendered an element of disbelief , in him , in each step kind of expecting that now somebody is going to get it right in describing her now i'm losing faith that it s ever going to happen , he said photo nancy temple s handling of an enronrelated memo was critical \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
among the pleasant surprises for internet retailers early in this holiday shopping season , perhaps none have been as surprising as the showing among online jewelers according to comscore networks , which measures web traffic , sales for online jewelry sites in november exceeded 80 million , nearly 70 percent above the level for november 2001 we 're really starting to see some good growth there , said shawn milne , an analyst with soundview technology group , an investment firm customers are getting over any issues they might have had with buying something of that price online the idea of selling jewelry online always sounded enticing since it involved highmargin goods that could be stored in small warehouses and be shipped more easily than a couch , say , or a cantaloupe mr milne said shipping costs for online jewelers could be as low as 5 percent of sales , compared with 10 percent on average for web sites that sell other goods even so , jewelrycom , miadoracom and many other failed online jewelers found that no matter how much they spent on marketing , consumers were simply not ready to trust them with a 5 , 000 sale that tide is starting to turn , as comscore s statistics show analysts said that more experienced online shoppers were growing bolder about highpriced purchases as they graduated from buying books and cd s to computers and other electronics items , and that they were now making the next step , to cars and diamond bracelets online retailers deserve some credit as well online jewelers that did not spend their way to oblivion during the internet boom years are creating a track record of trustworthiness take blue nile , which rolled out in 1999 , and which analysts agree is the market leader the company , privately held , is on pace to reach about 70 million in sales this year , according to its chief executive , mark vadon the company achieved outright profitability in the third quarter , he said , after 12 straight quarters of operating profits unlike some other online jewelers and luxury goods sites , blue nile caters mostly to men the bulk of its sales come from custommade engagement rings and since , as mr vadon said , there s a large segment of men who really do n't understand what they 're buying when it comes to engagement rings , the site puts a premium on education , with extensive tutorials on evaluating diamonds and designing rings such guidance is paying off , mr vadon said , with rings selling for an average price of 5 , 200 , versus the national average of about 2 , 200 , and carrying an operating profit margin of about 8 percent blue nile s customers do have their limits most will order online even for more expensive rings , mr vadon said , but once they get above 20 , 000 or 30 , 000 , they 'll call in to complete the sale a human voice on the phone still makes a difference during life s crucial moments , apparently mr vadon said blue nile could sell rings for at least 20 percent less than retail stores largely because it is the exclusive internet retailer for 11 of the world s largest diamond manufacturers so while they 're out trying to sell to all the retailers out there , we 're selling their diamonds directly to consumers , he said since we 're their largest customer , we get compensated with lower prices if blue nile finds continued success with its engagement ring strategy , it can also thank the forbearance of tiffany , the largest marketer of premiumprice diamonds for now , at least , tiffany is not an online competitor to blue nile according to mark aaron , a tiffany spokesman , the tiffanycom web site sells more than 2 , 400 products , but it will not sell diamond engagement rings rather , tiffanycom introduces customers to several different ring styles and lists a range of prices if users are interested in buying , the site encourages them to visit a tiffany retail location , of which there are 47 in the united states mr aaron said that strategy was meant both to protect tiffany s brand reputation and to ensure that tiffany attracted customers to its stores , where , he said , they spent more money over time at the core of tiffany s brand , mr aaron said , is the notion that the company provides better service than its peers in the jewelry industry the level of service an engagement ring customer can receive in a tiffany store cannot be matched online , he said and if they come to the store , he said , hopefully we can establish a longterm relationship with that customer mr aaron said that web sales of any sort accounted for only a few percent of tiffany s overall revenue of 366 million last quarter there are people who spend many thousands on jewelry on the site , but they come to the store and spend hundreds of thousands , he said for socalled pureplay online jewelry merchants other than blue nile , business is also becoming more steady icecom , which was formerly part of the freespending internet incubator idealab , is now independently owned and has achieved net profits for the last year and expects total sales of about 15 million in 2002 , said shmuel gniwisch , the site s chief executive mr gniwisch , who founded the company , said november s sales were triple those of a year earlier , and expenses have n't gone up more than 10 percent money was apparently less of an object in 2000 , when idealab merged ice with another of its internet properties , the online cosmetics site evecom mr gniwisch said idealab had planned to roll out the combined sites under the bigcom domain name , for which it paid 3 million then they did a poll and found that 80 percent of the women thought bigcom was a porno site , mr gniwisch said i told them to open a porno site at least you 'll have one business that makes money coming from a rabbi , they did n't think it was a great idea now out from the idealab umbrella , icecom is in expansion mode , but with more modest ambitions earlier this year the site acquired the inventory and name of service merchandise , the failed combination storecatalog operation that had been in business for 41 years icecom opened servicemerchandisecom last week it will rely mostly on inventory from icecom , which will continue to operate as a separate site mr gniwisch said he originally thought service merchandise would be valuable only for its customer list but we looked into it deeper and knew we could do something more with it , he said everybody i 've ever spoken to has been a shopper at service merchandise , and jewelry was more than half of their business mr milne , the soundview analyst , said that he was not sure how much value could be squeezed from the service merchandise brand but that the emerging success of the online jewelry category in general showed that consumer ecommerce had staying power the old internet models are long gone , but those who are left , and have found niche businesses that do n't compete with amazon or ebay , are working well , mr milne said we continue to sift through the rubble to see if there are any interesting names because the consumer internet trends are very strong photos an example of a finished round stone diamond

washington , jan 6 soldiers from domestic american military bases began arriving today at the united states naval base at guant namo bay in cuba to help build maximumsecurity jails for prisoners from afghanistan the united states is holding more than 300 prisoners jails being built to accommodate an initial group of about 100 prisoners could be finished within two weeks , said capt tom crosson , a spokesman for the united states southern command , which oversees guant namo he said the detainees would be flown there from afghanistan shortly after that defense secretary donald h rumsfeld indicated last week that troops would be escorting the prisoners on the flights to cuba eventually , an anticipated 1 , 500 troops are to build facilities on guantanamo to house up to 2 , 000 prisoners president bush has asked the pentagon , the justice department and his national security office write guidelines for how to sort out the detainees and determine which ones might be eligible for military tribunals and which ones might be tried in federal court officials said the pentagon was close to completing the rules on how to conduct the tribunals so far , however , none of the detainees have been charged with specific crimes captain crosson said the prisoners are classified at the moment as maximumsecurity detainees among them is john walker , the 20yearold californian who joined al qaeda , who is being held with eight others on the aircraft carrier bataan in the arabian sea administration officials said they expected the military to turn mr walker over to federal custody for prosecution by the justice department , but it is not clear when or what he might be charged with officials are continuing to examine installations within the united states as possible sites for the tribunals , although mr rumsfeld said he had not ruled out holding such tribunals at guant namo bay aides to senator ernest f hollings , democrat of south carolina , said the pentagon alerted them that the charleston naval weapons station in south carolina was on standby status to hold prisoners who might be tried in a tribunal andy davis , staff director for senator hollings , said his office was told that no prisoners would be brought to charleston directly from afghanistan but that this facility could potentially house any suspects detained within the united states and tried in military tribunals as opposed to the federal courts the charleston brig , which can hold up to 280 inmates , is a mediumsecurity prison the american soldiers being sent to cuba will be helping to construct maximumsecurity detention centers for the suspected terrorists , maj james cassella , a pentagon spokesman , said the pentagon is sending 1 , 500 troops , including military police units , engineers , medical personnel , and specialists in transportation and communications , to help design and build the detention centers , he said the facilities are to be overseen by brig gen michael lehnert of the marines from camp lejeune in north carolina officials said the jails could cost 5 million to 10 million , though other estimates have been higher the pentagon is also working on arranging trips for reporters to visit the guant namo base , but it is not clear if the news media will be allowed on the base once the prisoners arrive from afghanistan the detainees are not prisoners of war , one official said , but they are being afforded the protections of the geneva convention guidelines , so we have to abide by certain restrictions with regards to media access the prisoners are expected to have access to the international red cross most of the troops who began being deployed today were military police from fort hood in texas in the coming days , others will be sent from the charleston air force base , camp lejeune , fort campbell in kentucky , the naval station roosevelt roads in puerto rico and the norfolk naval station in virginia
increasingly desperate to woo customers away from an internet music piracy party that shows no signs of abating , several major record labels have resolved to make more music legally available for less money online even if it means sacrificing lucrative cd sales for the music industry , it is a turning point for consumers , it means the advent of new ways to buy music , including the closest approximation so far of a celestial jukebox , where they can search for and listen to a vast range of recorded music at low cost three years after napster unleashed the first wave of musictrading over the internet and a full year after the company was shut down by a court order the labels are coming to terms with the notion that internet filesharing is reshaping their business , and they must compete with piracy or risk losing a generation of customers the universal music group plans to announce today that it has licensed its catalog to listencom , making listencom the first to provide customers access to the catalogs of all five major labels over the internet for under 10 a month other services are making individual songs cheaper to get and easier to burn to cd s legally we could be 100 percent correct morally and legally that it is wrong to trade copyrighted files , but from a business standpoint it does n't matter , said larry kenswil , president of the elabs division of universal we need to construct legal alternatives a justice department investigation into whether the five major recording companies are trying to control electronic music distribution may have spurred universal s agreement with listencom , which took 16 months to negotiate two separate groups of music companies control the two leading online services , musicnet and pressplay , but they have stumbled in part because neither of them has licenses for each others' complete catalogs but the chief driver of the music labels' new willingness to take more risks online is the 5 percent decline in worldwide sales last year and a continuing slump this year , which they attribute in large part to digital piracy as the successors to napster multiply and filesharing gains cultural acceptance , the record labels are beginning to fear that music will be permanently devalued recorded music will be used to promote the artist , and the labels will need to find other sources of revenue , predicted starling d hunter iii , an assistant professor at mit , who studies the impact of technology on established industries it was in part to avoid that from happening that the labels have kept a tight grip on the legitimate distribution of their music online they have also been determined not to cede potential profits to aspiring internet distributors as they did to mtv in the early 1980 s in establishing a licensing model that many music executives view as the costliest error in the industry s history as a result , they have been slow to license their catalogs to online subscription services they have charged upwards of 2 for an individual song through their own download services they have experimented with copyprotection on cd s , imposed strict limits on recording songs to blank cd s and almost unanimously declined to license music for transfer to mp3 players but now , industry executives are considering the paradox that in order to control music distribution more tightly in the long term , they may have to loosen their hold over it in the near term this really represents a turning point in the approach and attitude of the major music companies toward digital distribution , said chris c gladwin , chief executive of fullaudio , which plans to announce today that warner music has agreed to let it sell its songs for cd burning for around 99 cents a download they 're beginning to see it as a big part of their future in the last few weeks , warner has quietly agreed to allow the musicnet subscription service it coowns with the bmg division of bertelsmann the emi group and realnetworks to let customers record the tracks they download onto cd s warner is also selling songs from artists like the red hot chili peppers , brandy and others for 99 cents through a digital singles pilot on america online those songs are in mp3 format , which means they can be copied to portable players or over the internet universal , the biggest of the labels , said it planned to offer its catalog for download later this summer at 99 cents a song , or 999 an album and sony recently lowered the price of its copyprotected downloads to 149 from 199 still , critics argue that the recent steps are too little and that it may soon be too late for the labels to rescue their position as the gatekeepers of popular music if they refuse to more aggressively embrace online distribution selling songs for 99 cents online gives the labels about the same profit they make per track on a cd , industry executives said but many believe the price must drop to 25 cents to persuade customers to pay for music instead of stealing it some executives who run online music services say all of the labels need to make their catalogs more broadly available , with fewer security restrictions to judge from the online discussion boards at pressplay , that is what customers think too
east rutherford , nj the nets' byron scott said monday that he deserved to win the coach of the year award yesterday he called tim duncan s winning the most valuable player award over his captain , jason kidd , a disgrace he also had time to tweak the charlotte hornets by insisting the nets would have total control of the series if they won game 2 thank you , mr auerbach , for your basketball insight and knowledge i do n't think scott is on the periphery of egomania in fact , i love his team i'm on the bandwagon they should win all of the league s postseason awards brian scalabrine was my 12th man of the year but in a span of 48 hours , the nets' coach has said bombastically whatever came to his mind you wait for some humbling loss to pipe him down , to make him take stock of his words but over the past week , it has not happened he gets bolder and more cocksure by the victory among the things pat riley , his mentor , taught him there is a method to being mouthy they know i'm so rileyesque it s not even funny , scott said before the nets took a twogamestonone lead in the eastern conference semifinals last night before a loud sellout crowd at continental arena they know i say so many things to them that are total clich s from riley that s ok all of them are right scott spoke before he cleared his bench in the final minute , after his role players grabbed game 2 from the hornets , 10288 two guys off the bench put the nets over the top lucious harris dropped in 10 of 11 shots , closing the door on a charlotte rally in the final minutes todd macculloch put together a nice stretch of play in the third quarter , and this team that is so much more than merely kidd is suddenly two victories from the eastern conference finals scott s team sent the masses shuffling out of the building in good spirits for the third game in a row and the nets to charlotte in , you have to admit , total control of the series riley , who coached scott when they won championships with the lakers , had this way of deflecting pressure from his players by giving the news media something provocative to write every day his thinking stemmed from making sure his players focused on the task at hand , rather than the hot topic of the day yesterday , before the game , it was mvp , why kidd did not win it it s ridiculous , scott said i do n't understand san antonio wins 53 , 54 , 55 games every season what jason has done with our team , from where we 've come from , i do n't understand it headlines yesterday read , kidd loses mvp to duncan not kidd no 2 in voting some of those misguided talkradio souls were outraged by the mvp vote , which will be announced tomorrow i just do n't think it s right , scott said there are some things in this league that are right and there are some things that are n't in my mind , this is not right part of you is wondering , when did it become wrong to finish runnerup \? was it after nike came out with its olympic ad campaign , you do n't win silver , you lose gold \? another part of you is amused , as is paul silas , the charlotte coach silas worked under riley , too , with the knicks , another team that was always ratcheting up the mental and emotional ante until there was nothing left i should have been coach of the year , silas said , laughing i had to weather this storm and pull it together players hurt relocation hey , why not \? he 'll be all right , silas added of kidd when you look at what j did for this club , clearly he should have won but it s sort of like when i thought baron davis should have made the allstar team straight up , outright he has a lot of years left to play you have to look at it philosophically , because there s nothing you can really do about it in j s case , he s still got a lot of time to be most valuable player scott was asked yesterday whether detroit s rick carlisle deserved the coach of the year award he said a few nice things did you ever drop 35 on him \? someone asked he was never in the game , scott replied cute humorous would n't it be just as funny if carlisle , whose playing career was not as long or storied as scott s , talked about the dues he paid in new jersey , portland and indiana before the pacers passed him over for isiah thomas and he finally ended up in detroit \? or the dues scott barely paid as an assistant for two years in sacramento before he got the nets job \? scott has had a great season he was willing to go toe to toe with karl malone during a tense game with utah if kenyon martin has given this team a serrated edge on the floor , scott has given them one off it scott says what he feels like saying and pays the consequences one of his more telling moments came after indiana s reggie miller sank the 39foot heave at the buzzer that forced the first overtime last thursday rather than go ballistic , scott calmly sat his players down and told them they were still going to the next round , it was just going to take five more minutes in hindsight , all the fuss he made over kidd s not winning is not as bad as some coaches who cover for their players when they know they have done wrong every coach wants to show he has a player s back , and he will say anything in support to achieve that goal if scott feels he needs to keep pushing the edge of civility , talking up a storm , so that this team can go further in the postseason , so be it for better or for worse , through insight and through embarrassment , it s what riley taught him it s all he knows photo the nets' lucious harris working for a shot against charlotte s stacey augmon in the fourth quarter \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
istanbul , june 24 sakip sabanci is a billionaire with , he says , a mission first , he wants turks to have a museum that meets international standards then he intends to reverse the flow of cultural masterpieces departing turkey for the last couple of centuries finally , he is dead set on instilling a sense of philanthropy in the country s business elite i want to better turkey , and art is a very important part of that effort , mr sabanci \( pronounced sahbahnja \) said the other day , shaking both fists for emphasis mr sabanci certainly has the wherewithal to finance his dreams he is chairman of sabanci holding sa , one of turkey s largest industrial conglomerates the family foundation spent 40 million building what quickly became one of turkey s most respected private universities and financed a string of other cultural and educational projects with the grand opening of the sakip sabanci museum in a hilltop park overlooking the bosporus in istanbul on june 8 , mr sabanci , a diminutive man of outsize achievements in the business world , accomplished his goal of bringing an internationalquality museum to turkey istanbul is blessed with wonderful museums , from the ottoman palace of topkapi to archaeological and religious treasure houses but none meet international standards for fire safety , earthquake resistance and other factors that would allow them to act as hosts to major traveling exhibitions mr sabanci and an advisory board , which included makrukh tarapor from the metropolitan museum of art and glenn lowry , director of the museum of modern art in new york , put together a plan to remedy that omission the result is a stunner the stately sabanci family villa was transformed into a stateoftheart home for mr sabanci s renowned calligraphy collection along with furniture and decorative arts attached to the villa by a covered walkway is an allnew contemporary , 15 , 000squarefoot , glasswalled pavilion for temporary exhibitions both buildings meet the standards required by curators and insurers for traveling shows for the museum s gala opening , which drew the country s political , business and social a list , the pavilion displayed 140 paintings from mr sabanci s collection the exhibition contains works by the most famous turkish painters like osman hamdi and ibrahim calli but the museum s centerpiece is the calligraphy , acknowledged as the premier private collection in turkey and one of the world s best the current display features the 70 illuminated books , scrolls and wall plaques that were shown at the metropolitan in new york in 1999 and at the louvre in 2000 the twostory villa s galleries are atmospherically lighted , with deep blue walls that create the feel of a jewel box on those walls are koranic manuscripts and verses rendered in exquisite script on marbled paper that trace 500 years of unbroken ottoman rule the idea for the museum , mr sabanci said , grew out of his visit to the united states several years ago mr sabanci s father was a cotton sharecropper in turkey who built a conglomerate that today has 30 , 000 employees and 65 companies , with interests ranging from auto manufacture and banking to hypermarkets and chemical plants one of the company s strategies has been to form joint ventures with leading foreign corporations like toyota , bridgestone , philip morris and dupont the idea was to learn from one another , and it rubbed off on the cultural side mr sabanci said the inspiration to create a museum sprang from a visit with the dupont family in wilmington , del they turned the family house into a wonderful museum , mr sabanci said i realized that an institution s success and contribution cannot be solely judged on economic criteria mr sabanci was living in the mansion overlooking the bosporus , which his father had bought in 1951 as a summer home when mr sabanci described his plan , friends told him he was crazy to open his house and treasures to the public while he was still alive they told me to wait until i died , but i wanted to do it now , when i am strong and in control , said mr sabanci who , at 69 , shows no sign of relinquishing control anytime soon as in france , culture is the province of the government in turkey and there are few private cultural institutions likewise , charity is traditionally dispensed from the mosques and private philanthropy is a largely untested concept to direct the museum , mr sabanci turned to emin balcioglu , a turkish architect who ran a turkish cultural center in new york along with overseeing the 65 million renovation of the villa and construction of the new gallery , mr balcioglu consulted experts to upgrade mr sabanci s collections a private collector buys for his taste or because he got a good deal , mr balcioglu said there were gaps we needed to fill to provide a sequence for instance , 123 paintings were acquired , bringing the collection to 318 , probably the largest private or public holding of quality contemporary turkish paintings the calligraphy needed few additions , because mr sabanci had been a major and careful collector for years the museum will also run education and training programs through its affiliation with sabanci university chief among them will be a laboratory to conserve and restore paper of the 130 , 000 historic manuscripts in istanbul , mr balcioglu estimated , 30 , 000 need restoration as for mr sabanci s other goals , he said that he had seen progress in building a domestic market for turkish art and cultural artifacts and that turkish buyers were repatriating works bought years ago by americans and europeans he is optimistic , too , that private philanthropy will expand among other rich turks toward that end , he happily ushered a number of them through his museum on a recent saturday evening , laughing as he joked about leaving the house , with its art and furnishings , three years ago , taking with him only his pajamas photo sakip sabanci in the pavilion of the istanbul art museum that bears his name the idea to create it was inspired by a visit to the dupont family \( douglas frantz the new york times \)
help wanted chief security officer ominously , vaguely , federal officials are again warning americans to be on alert for some sort of terrorist attack will corporate america be ready \? in the months since the sept 11 attack on new york destroyed the world trade center towers , killed thousands of workers and disrupted dozens of companies , businesses have been forced to review their notions of corporate security and with those assessments has come realization that the job calls for a new kind of corporate security executive one with breadth of experience , analytic skills , business acumen and leadership qualities the job , in other words , calls for a chief security officer , or cso , as the emerging term of art would have it the security field s leading professional organization is drawing up a detailed description of the skills and responsibilities of the job the elusive ideal is an executive not only familiar with the physical security of people and property , but also fluent in the digital security of computers and information roughly equal parts top cop , business manager and computer geek executive headhunters are recruiting people who fit the description and , with their talents suddenly much in demand , chief security officers can earn more than 400 , 000 a year a new magazine , called cso , is scheduled to begin publication in september and yet , for all the activity , the truly broadbased candidates are relatively rare , said lance wright , a vice president of boyden global executive search , a recruiter despite the talent scouting by headhunters , companies are apparently taking their time in hiring senior security executives a survey of 390 large companies last month by christian timbers , a search firm , found that while 95 percent said they needed to hire a chief security officer , only 8 percent said they had begun the recruiting and a separate study , the changing nature of the chief security officer , from the giga information group , a research firm , found that while large corporations were increasing their security budgets and that some senior security executives' salaries were well into six figures others were making as little as 70 , 000 with its eye on criminality and terrorism , the security field is a different world and an unfamiliar world to a lot of mainstream businesspeople , said timothy williams , a former cincinnati policeman with an mba who directs corporate and systems security for nortel networks , the big communications equipment maker but different though it may be , mr williams said , security is a business process a matter of setting priorities and strategy , establishing processes and measuring their effectiveness the cso title is meant to suggest that security matters are becoming a more important and integral part of corporate life roughly 15 years ago , another threeletter corporate title started to surface , cio , or chief information officer it was initially greeted with skepticism , even derision but cio was more than a name it was a recognition that information technology was not just electronic plumbing or a narrow specialty , but something that could affect the mainstream business , strategy and competitiveness the cio is now an established and respected executive job at most major corporations it is too early to tell whether the cso will eventually reach comparable stature but even before sept 11 , the corporate security field had been steadily evolving in response to the major business and technological developments of the last two decades globalization , deregulation , outsourcing , justintime inventory practices , the embrace of information technology and the rise of the internet have all brought greater openness and efficiency , along with new vulnerabilities the people managing security at large corporations have also changed with the times , well beyond the guns and badges days of mainly overseeing building security guards and investigations of the who stole the petty cash variety in today s open economy , a point of access in security terms is not just a headquarters office or a factory gate , but also a computer network connection that could be a gateway to a company s customer databases or product designs the senior security manager has gone from a corporate cop guy to a real business position , said grant crabtree , vice president for corporate security at the alltel corporation , a provider of wireless phone service and other telecommunications services , based in little rock , ark senior security officers have typically climbed the corporate ranks through one of two distinct paths , as experts in either physical security or data security the physical security people usually are former police officers , military officers or federal agents , while the data security people tend to be former computer scientists , engineers and programmers mr williams , 50 , of nortel is no newcomer to the

washington , may 3 an fbi agent in phoenix told counterterrorism officials at the bureau s headquarters last july that he had detected an alarming pattern of arab men with possible ties to terrorism taking aviationrelated training , and urged a nationwide review of the trend , according to fbi officials the agent s recommendation was not acted upon before sept 11 , however bureau officials foresaw difficulties in scrutinizing the hundreds of middle eastern men who regularly attended flight schools and underwent aviation training in the united states after the sept 11 attacks , though , the fbi agent s memorandum took on a new urgency within the bureau , as investigators hunted for possible links to the 19 hijackers who aimed jets at the world trade center and the pentagon the memorandum also gained attention as officials began to check whether they had missed warning signs of the attacks a review determined that none of the seven or eight arab men identified by the agent in phoenix had any connection to the sept 11 attacks or other terrorist activities , officials said a few were detained on immigration violations , however , fbi officials said none of the people identified by phoenix are connected to the 9 11 attacks , the fbi said today in a statement the phoenix communication went to the appropriate operational agents and analysts at headquarters , but it did not lead to uncovering the impending attacks some in congress expressed concern about the memorandum today after seeing reports about it us news and world report first wrote about the memorandum in december , but the associated press distributed a report today with new details about it it is imperative that we learn exactly what information was contained in the fbi report , to whom it was sent and what actions were taken in response , senator patrick j leahy , a vermont democrat and chairman of the senate judiciary committee , said in a statement senator charles e grassley , republican of iowa , added , the fbi has to do a better job of connecting the dots when it comes to intelligence about terrorists as congress gears up for its first comprehensive investigation into the government s performance leading up to sept 11 , the memorandum offers another tantalizing glimpse of what american experts in counterterrorism knew about the threat to the united states the joint housesenate committee conducting the sept 11 investigation has already been briefed on the fbi memorandum , officials said officials at the federal bureau of investigation emphasized that the phoenix agent did not predict the attacks the agent s report did not focus on arab men seeking pilot training , but instead raised questions about individuals being trained in airport management the agent wondered whether they might be getting training that could help them get jobs that would allow them to skirt airport security procedures but some fbi officials acknowledged that the agent s report was as close to the mark as anyone came before sept 11 he was n't saying , 'hey , i know there are guys out there who are going to hijack planes and fly them into buildings , ' one official said but he did have the right industry fbi officials would not make the phoenix agent available for an interview but they said the agent first became suspicious after noticing a pattern among several arabs being monitored for possible terrorist ties , as well as others thought to be associates of individuals suspected of having those connections the agent noticed that several of the men were attending embryriddle aeronautical university in prescott , ariz the agent thought he might have stumbled onto a larger pattern of arabs coming to the united states to get aviation training for use in terrorist activities in july , he sent a memorandum to counterterrorism officials at fbi headquarters recommending a study of the issue phoenix believes that the fbi should accumulate a listing of civil aviation universities colleges around the country , the memorandum stated fbi field offices with these types of schools in their area should establish appropriate liaison fbi hq should discuss this matter with other elements of the us intelligence community and task the community for any information that supports phoenix s suspicions it also recommended that the fbi ask the state department to provide visa data on flight school students from middle eastern countries so the bureau could track them more easily after the agent s memorandum arrived at headquarters , it was sent to the bureau s new york field office , which then had the lead in international terrorist investigations fbi officials identified 600 schools involved in flight or other aviation training in the united states , and determined that as many as 600 students from middle eastern countries attended them each year most middle east countries send pilots from their commercial airlines and their military to train in the united states at the time , fbi officials believed that a study of the arab presence at american flight schools could be done as only a longterm project taking one to two years no action had been taken on the issue by sept 11 fbi officials said there was reluctance at the time to mount such a major review because of a concern that the bureau would be criticized for ethnic profiling of foreigners bureau officials were also aware of the obstacles in asking colleges and universities to cooperate on such a sweeping review of students without specific evidence that they were guilty of any crimes you had to ask , was there valid intelligence pushing you in the direction of doing this \? and the answer at the time was no , one fbi official said
bagram air base , afghanistan , may 31 american special forces troops mistakenly fired on a group of friendly afghan soldiers in a predawn firefight today in eastern afghanistan , killing three men and wounding two other people they mistook for qaeda fighters , american military officials said the brief but deadly battle occurred near gardez in the mountainous region straddling pakistan , where more than 300 british marines and scores of coalition special operations forces are hunting for bands of qaeda and taliban fighters who seem to move with impunity across the loosely guarded border gardez has also been the site of clashes between local leaders feuding for control of the provincial government but military officials here said they had no evidence that the american troops had been tricked into attacking the compound by one faction seeking to bloody a rival this would probably fall within the realm of what you would consider friendly fire , said col roger king , a spokesman for the coalition forces in afghanistan the two wounded afghan soldiers were flown by helicopter to bagram , the headquarters for coalition forces in afghanistan , and were being treated tonight at a base hospital cmdr frank merriman , a spokesman for central command in tampa , fla , said further details on what precisely happened would be determined by a report from the field a review is under way , he said , not an investigation it s a review that always takes place after an operation has concluded the accident marred the first official day on the job for the new head of coalition forces , lt gen dan k mcneill , commander of the 18th airborne corps from fort bragg , nc in april , an american fighter pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on a group of canadian soldiers who were training near kandahar , killing four american officials acknowledged earlier this year that 16 afghan fighters killed in two raids by american troops north of kandahar were not members of the taliban or al qaeda , as had been suspected last year , three american soldiers were killed when a ground spotter gave his own coordinates to the bombardier aboard a b52 bomber colonel king said the american forces had been led to the compound , in khomar kalay village , by a variety of intelligence sources who indicated that a group of taliban and qaeda leaders were planning to meet there thursday night in the early morning , about 20 american special forces troops , accompanied by about 80 afghan soldiers from the gardez area , drove up to the walled compound in trucks and sport utility vehicles , colonel king said their plan was to surround the compound and apprehend the suspects as they departed but as the vehicles approached , men started running from the compound carrying weapons , including ak47 rifles and at least one rocketpropelled grenade launcher , officials said one group of those armed men took what the americans thought were flanking positions behind a wall , then appeared to aim a grenade launcher at the american convoy at that point , the american commander ordered his men to open fire , colonel king said the shooting was over within minutes seventeen others inside the compound laid down their weapons none of the americans or the afghan soldiers with them were wounded colonel king described the afghan victims as loyal to the interim government of hamid karzai and said they appeared to have come from nearby logar province he said they , too , might have received a tip that qaeda leaders were going to meet at the compound also early this morning , american f a18 fighter jets and a10 attack planes bombed suspected enemy positions near the town of lwara in eastern afghanistan after four rockets were fired at coalition forces , officials said no coalition troops were wounded , and american officials said they did not know whether there had been any enemy casualties american attacks have also been blamed for civilian deaths last week , an elder in bandi temur village , west of kandahar , was killed in a raid , enraging villagers afghan women and children were among 14 people killed in march when american fighter aircraft attacked a vehicle traveling from a suspected qaeda sanctuary in eastern afghanistan on dec 20 , american warplanes attacked a convoy in paktia province , killing as many as 50 to 60 people on the road and in surrounding villages the pentagon said taliban leaders were in the vehicles , but survivors said the convoy was carrying tribal elders early in the campaign in afghanistan , an errant bomb struck the kabul office of an operation to remove land mines , killing four people , and a bomb hit a group of houses near kabul , also killing four people map of afghanistan highlighting gardez afghans mistaken for qaeda soldiers were attacked near gardez
boston the yankees were still two days away from arriving at fenway park to play the red sox for the first of 19 times this season , but the sight of a new york reporter here was enough to cause some local reporters to script the gloom and doom that have become so inevitable with that storied , cursed franchise uhoh , here come the yankees so , are the yankees going to win 110 games \? the first red sox reporter said maybe it would be a phenomenal season , but anything is possible if the yankees' starting rotation stays healthy and remains superb the yankees will also benefit greatly from feasting on the brutal baltimore orioles , the tampa bay devil rays and , despite losing twice to them , the toronto blue jays still , other than the dream season of 1998 , when the yankees won 114 games , they have not won as many as 110 since 1927 is a babe ruth reference necessary here \? a second reporter offered his unsolicited assessment of the yankees a few minutes later , and he was not as impressed as the first he did not envision a whopping 110 victories and gave a more modest appraisal of a team that is one of the favorites to snatch another world series title the yankees , he surmised , look like they 'll win about 105 games it is impossible to criticize anyone in boston for fearing the yankees and feeling inferior to the yankees sure , the fans have an intense rivalry , exchanging insults , debating derek and nomar while forgetting that arod even exists , and even swapping david cone on weekends but the rivalry on the field is so lopsided that it is laughable the yankees have 26 world series titles and have won four in the last six seasons the red sox have won five titles , but none since 1918 all of those spoiled 19yearold yankee fans should ponder those statistics those who adore the red sox and are younger than 84 have never seen their team win it all the red sox rewarded their fans by stopping the yankees , 32 , last night as darren oliver held them scoreless into the sixth inning the yankees had no hits in their first nine atbats with runners in scoring position , and those lost chances caused them to fizzle in the first game still , the red sox could sweep all four games this weekend and yankee fans should sleep well on monday night actually , the yankees could lose all 19 games to the red sox , which is about as probable as david wells finishing the boston marathon on monday , and the most ardent yankee fans could not be incredibly disappointed they could satiate themselves by reflecting on history that was what chuck knoblauch , the former yankee , did when knoblauch was here with the kansas city royals this week , he was lambasted the fans booed him mercilessly because he has a connection to the yankees so what if knoblauch is a royal now \? the fans could not muster animosity toward joe randa or neifi perez , but knoblauch \? he was the fragile second baseman who never tagged jose offerman but who got the call on a pivotal play in game 4 of the 1999 american league championship series to bostonians , knoblauch has pinstripes in his blood you 're with the royals now , one fan bellowed to knoblauch you 're not going to win any more rings knoblauch grew weary of the abuse and said , how many rings do you have \? it elicited silence , total silence knoblauch s handy response was as effective as a muzzle this season should be another example of the red sox futilely chasing the yankees the yankees have a superior rotation with five starters who have won 15 or more games 29 times the red sox' projected rotation has achieved that five times , with pedro mart nez accounting for four of them but if his shoulder crumbles , the red sox will lose one of the most irreplaceable players in baseball and hear more about their ignominious past there are some demons they have to deal with over there , yankees manager joe torre said when we come in there , we do n't feel we have an edge they 've played us tough and we take them seriously it all comes down to pitching beyond the vast difference in rotations , the yankees have a better bullpen if you call the shortstop debate a draw to save a few days of ranting , where are the red sox better the yankees \? manny ramirez is a more productive left fielder than rondell white and trot nixon is better than shane spencer in right other than that , the yankees prevail at every position no doubt in my mind , every time you play the yankees this year you better be ready to play , red sox manager grady little said but what we 're trying to do in boston is get a lot of clubs to feel the same way about the red sox and we got enough talent on the field to think we can do that not everyone is so certain there was a third red sox reporter who offered his prediction about the yankees he was blunter than his colleagues and might as well have been asking for milk and sugar with his coffee as he said , if the yankees play like they can , they should win 115 games
art is about control at a basic level , the control is physical an artist puts certain materials together in a certain way to create a new form more or less simultaneously , conceptual control is at play the new form is intended to communicate ideas or elicit emotions all of this is part of the public side of art , the side geared to reception , the side art schools teach but control is also , to varying degrees , private and internal art can give its maker and by extension , its viewer psychological mastery over potentially disruptive thoughts and feelings , a reassurance that life is basically ok , even in the face of evidence to the contrary children exercise this control when they play makebelieve adults exercise it through civic rituals , domestic routines , personal obsessions this impulse to control impulse animates , even generates , some of the most interesting art of our time , from jasper johns s paintings to consuelo amezcua s drawings to tom friedman s sculptures and it runs like an electric current through the spare , intense retrospective of sculpture by the american artist charles ledray at the institute of contemporary art at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia mr ledray s art is miniaturist in scale but naturalistic in proportions the combination of smallness and rightness is what make it tick painstakingly crafted , the work includes twofoottall tailored suits , books the size of matchboxes and carved furniture that would fit in a dollhouse none of these objects seem precious or cute instead , they feel dense with compressed energy and , perhaps for that reason , seem to command monumental stretches of surrounding space mr ledray s art is largely selftaught or hometaught born in seattle in 1960 , he went to art school there only briefly he learned one of his primary formal skills , sewing , from his mother when he was 4 others , like carving and ceramic making , he picked up later on his own by its very nature , his art is a oneperson and somewhat hermetic pursuit it is also indebted to particular developments in recent art history one of these is the women s art movement , which in the 1970 s broke down cultural hierarchies and gave media like sewing and weaving , long dismissed as women s work , a fineart cachet related changes in aesthetic attitudes came with the gay liberation movement , which made femaleidentified art forms fully available to men , often as a means for expanding conventional definitions of gender to this inherited context , mr ledray brought his own talent and experiences as a selfeducated gay artist and the exhibition , organized by claudia gould , director of the institute , is a selective record of the formally ambitious , personally complex career he has shaped before deciding on art as a profession , he considered being a toymaker one of the show s earliest entries dating from 1989 , when he moved to new york is a homemade teddy bear but he was already making art on an intimate scale , notably the elaborate workworkworkworkwork completed in the same year the piece is modeled after the sidewalk sales of recycled material organized by the homeless in the east village in this case , though , all of the nearly 600 objects magazines , clothes and dishes , along with the blankets to display them are handwrought miniatures the piece , which the artist first exhibited on a sidewalk in cooper square , is astonishing not only are its contents fantastically well made you have to get down on your hands and knees to appreciate them fully but they also constitute a smart , sardonic time capsule of late80 s pop culture from this point on , mr ledray turned his attention completely to art , and his 1990 king of the road is a kind of celebratory gesture of commitment to create the piece , he laid a found quilt on the floor and started to dance on it while removing his underwear and socks , and scattering handfuls of white buttons around him later , he sewed down each item exactly where it had fallen , to preserve the traces of an orgiastic disrobing clothing became a central image in his art , often associated with the conflicted notion of family his mother , a devotee of the 60 s counterculture , died in the 80 s in a sense , all of his sewn work is an indirect tribute to her , though she is also the subject of a specific homage titled come together , after a beatles song , it s a small blue denim workshirt embroidered with peace signs , flowers , doves arching over it like a rainbow is a wardrobe of tiny blouses , skirts and sweaters , lined up sleeve to sleeve as if holding hands in midair in his work , masculinity has a far more ambivalent presence , evident in several selfportrait pieces one is a replica of the uniform he wore when he worked as a security guard at the seattle art museum , where he studied art firsthand on the job its gray flannel pants , white shirt and navy jacket emblazoned with the museum s seal are emblems of institutional authority , but basically anonymouslooking and neutral
seven teams of architects from around the world unveiled new designs for the world trade center site yesterday , giving a remarkable civic tutorial on architecture and contemporary urban design aimed at mending the hole left in lower manhattan by the sept 11 attack the designs , the subject of secrecy and speculation since the teams began work 12 weeks ago , include a broad array of elements quiet memorial gardens and scenic plazas in the sky , soaring towers of bare scaffolding and sprawling canopies of glass four include what would be the tallest building in the world , and all set aside an area for a memorial to the victims of 9 11 the architects have responded with great depth to the question , 'what does sept 11 represent \? ' said john c whitehead , the chairman of the lower manhattan development corporation , the joint citystate agency that is overseeing the rebuilding project their responses vary , just as our own reactions to the trauma , the aftermath and recovery were so very personal and so very different the main point of the exercise , as for a similar one in july that resulted in six scrapped designs , was not to design buildings but to create a landuse plan for the site , setting the location of office buildings , a train station , a memorial and new streets that landuse plan is to be released by jan 31 left unspoken during the threehour presentation in the gleaming glass atrium of the winter garden at the world financial center was that none of these designs might ever appear on the skyline for all the highminded talk of the allegory and repose in the designs , commercial considerations will be large and perhaps the leading factors in determining what is built and when some of the designs , like a crystalline tower by foster partners , the british firm led by norman foster , are directly reminiscent of the twin towers , a single tower whose two halves , according to the architect , split and kiss at three points others center their most striking elements on the footprints of the destroyed towers , as in the plan by daniel libeskind , the german architect whose design takes visitors on a deliberate procession 70 feet down into ground zero , to the bedrock of the excavated site a design by a team led by architects frederic schwartz and rafael vi oly encloses 13 acres of the 16acre site under an enormous glass ceiling , with two glass cylinders protecting the footprints of the towers another , by a group called united architects , creates a similarly large public space 800 feet in the air , where a skyway connects five towers with gardens , shopping , cafes and a conference center another team s towers , connected with three horizontal floors , inevitably drew comparisons to a giant ticktacktoe board each design presented yesterday included office buildings , a train station , a memorial and more , and while it is the more that sets the designs apart , that is also the most provisional part of the effort none of that dampened the enthusiasm of many people who saw the designs yesterday at the conclusion of the first presentation , by mr libeskind , a round of applause from the assembled audience of government officials , family members of sept 11 victims and residents of lower manhattan rose to a roar i think it signaled a sort of release , said c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president , who was in the audience , as people realized that these plans were not at all like the other six we saw last summer those other plans , released in july , were derided as unimaginative and ugly even before they were released to the public , as government officials and members of civic groups interested in the rebuilding process were given a preview of the plans and gave vent to their disappointment at a public hearing of 4 , 500 people that month , the resoundingly negative response to the plans led rebuilding officials to declare that they would essentially start over the planning for the site the plans that have resulted from this new round were forged in a democratic process , said louis r tomson , the president of the development corporation as rebuilding officials and some of the architects themselves said , the designs also spoke of a spirit of pride and patriotism that swept the country after the events of sept 11 , 2001 , one that brought hundreds of professional designers and amateur architects from around the country to submit ideas , thoughts and plans now , officials from lower manhattan development the port authority of new york and new jersey , which owns the site and other city , state and federal representatives will work to decide on a master plan for the site by the end of next month as part of that effort , the plans will be on display at the winter garden from tomorrow through feb 3 comments can be submitted to rebuilding officials at the exhibition or through the corporation s internet site , www renewnyc org the plans can also be viewed on that site and at www lowermanhattan info
cambridge , mass anyone who thinks the current round of corporate scandal could have been prevented with new rules and regulations simply does not understand american capitalism the enrons , worldcoms and tycos are not abnormalities in a basically sound system scandals are endemic to capitalism the best any government can do is contain the damage , and the best any individual investor can do is get out of harm s way yesterday s wide fluctuations in the market , when the dow jones industrial average veered from loss to gain and back again , closing down 235 points , are the latest evidence of investor distrust of corporate accounting procedures it is also shows that investors are worried about the market s ability to recover from , or respond to , scandal we did not arrive at this point by accident at the end of a boom , the pressures to keep the good times going just a little bit longer are enormous all companies want to hit their numbers \( that is , ensure that their revenues and profits match those predicted by wall street analysts \) this imperative cascades up and down the corporate pyramid and it infects not just the organization itself but the individuals within it sales representatives , for instance , can get fired if they do n't hit their numbers they do n't want to get fired so they make adjustments sooner or later , small adjustments become large adjustments and then no one wants to look too closely at the numbers and be the one who announces that the good times are over in this way whole companies , even entire industries , convince themselves that good times are about to return it is just a temporary dip , they tell themselves altering the numbers now will not matter when the good times do return in fact , the good times will make the false numbers into true numbers some of the booming revenues and profits of next quarter can be backdated into this quarter to make this quarter s reported numbers true it is na ve to think that changing the rules governing the accounting profession is going to alter this culture politicians calling for new sets of rules to prevent financial scandals from recurring are like generals fighting the last war by the time they demand change , it s already too late new laws and regulations adopted in the aftermath of scandal are almost always useless in preventing future wrongdoing , especially in financial matters the last great wave of regulatory lawmaking , designed to prevent systemic fraud and abuse among savings and loans in the 1980 s , proved largely irrelevant to preventing systemic fraud and abuse among accounting firms today so what can be done about the inevitable scandals of capitalism \? the first and best solution is to warn all small investors that the game is rigged no individual investor , no matter how well informed , can play on the same level as the major institutional investors , wall street firms and corporate executives , who receive more accurate information more quickly than the average viewer of cnbc the major players talk all the time , and very little of what they learn becomes known to the general public that is what the investment banker herbert allen s annual summer gettogether of media moguls in idaho is all about of course , such meetings are not illegal but neither do they inspire confidence in the openness and honesty of the system none of this is to say that the government cannot , and should not , penalize executives , bankers , analysts or others when their behavior gets out of control that is , in fact , what we mean by a basically sound system one in which actions are rapidly taken to restore order and punish those who have transgressed the rules but no government can ever guarantee that the small investor has an equal chance of winning it is beyond dishonest to pretend that rules can be written to prevent future financial scandals it is fraudulent no set of regulations can ensure fairness and transparency in the markets to pretend otherwise is to set up the government as the system s ultimate liar

i am outraged that the new york times would so blatantly distort the jewish ritual of bar mitzvah by prominently featuring putting together a big bar mitzvah in the feb 24 long island section the author is not reporting in the journalistic sense , but retelling anecdotal stories with no effort at substantiation perhaps the height of absurdity is the quote about the average cost of a bar mitzvah on the island being 35 , 000 who is the authority quoted here \? none other than a caterer and owner of one of these extravaganza production companies ! how objective he must be ! your reporter might have uncovered a recent popular trend with families of bar and bat mitzvah candidates they are eschewing parties altogether and going to israel even in the face of the palestinian conflict some are opting for very modest parties and providing a list of charities to which they encourage a donation rather than a gift for themselves steven m walk great neck photo children at a party planning event \( katrina hajagos for the new york times \)
on page 4 of the june issue of esquire magazine , there is an advertisement for a new calvin klein men s fragrance bearing the uniquely contrived name truth the man in the ad looks as if he might think a 401 \( k \) is something swallowed late at night on a dance floor with a margarita his nose is long and straight , his lips are pneumatic and his chest is so glistening and unmarred it calls to mind a hockey rink that has just been smoothed over by a zamboni the model , whoever he may be , is one of the few to be found in esquire , whose fashion pages have been given over to images of men who do not pose in front of a tripod for a living in this issue , for example , a threebutton armani suit is modeled by lyor cohen , the chief executive of the island def jam music group such pairings are conceived by esquire s fashion creative director , stefano tonchi , who arrived in 1998 with a mandate to phase out anonymous male bodies altogether i have n't looked at a model card in four years , mr tonchi said if the esquire guy sees someone like george clooney in a good suit , he s going to say , 'i can do that , ' mr tonchi explained if he sees the same suit on matthew avedon , he is not going to be interested mr avedon , a model whom the fashion industry became infatuated with two years ago , is reedish and curlyhaired in the manner of someone who might restring his guitar on a bench in washington square the cultural viability of the male model was born in the late 1970 s and early 80 s , and it is safe to assert that it has diminished to the point of near evaporation for a fall ad campaign , tommy hilfiger will feature an athlete for the first time , the mogul skier jeremy bloom for a few years now , donna karan campaigns have forgone male models for actors like jeremy irons this season , the gap is using men like dennis hopper and orlando bloom to resurrect itself companies are looking to people with some level of accomplishment , said donny deutsch , chief executive of the deutsch advertising agency , which has mr hilfiger as a client they want someone who is going to be more than a pretty face not a single model appears in the barneys new york spring men s catalog , where the professionally goodlooking have been replaced by a restaurateur , an executive at hickeyfreeman and a number of barneys employees the fall catalog will have a firefighter and a heart surgeon populating the cast of real people a new magazine called sepp , which will make its debut next week in boutiques like colette in paris , combines soccer and fashion , using images of players like ariel ortega of argentina in response to the shifting mood , modeling agencies are making a more concerted effort to attract men whose gifts do not begin and end with genetic makeup this week , elite , which recently signed maxim belotserkovsky , a principal dancer with the american ballet theater , will enter a final round of discussions with executives at madison square garden to explore fashion opportunities for various members of the knicks and rangers , said nathalie bernier , the director of the elite men s division for someone like latrell sprewell , ms bernier speculated , something like sean john could be right two weeks ago , img models signed tim henman , the british tennis star mr henman , 28 , is 6foot1 and has the appearance of someone who could find regular work on one life to live six months ago , the agency added the american tennis player james blake to its roster of male models although modeling agencies complain that athletes and other celebrities often have to turn down work because they do not have the time , there are obvious advantages to promoting the wellknown the pay scale is such that a celebrity might receive up to 200 , 000 for an important advertising campaign , while a male model is likely to make less than a tenth of that you do one booking with one of these people , ms bernier said , referring to the category of the famous , and you think 'ok , i can relax for a while' it s hard to make money with models in the time of a recession for women who support themselves walking down runways , vulnerability to changing economic realities is never quite as pronounced despite four decades of feminist influence , women are still easily seduced by images of preternatural female beauty but if women fantasize about what it would be like to possess nothing more than ethereal good looks , the daydreams of men generally follow different plotlines male models do n't communicate to the customer at all , explained simon doonan , the creative director of barneys people think they are funny and goofy the basic premise is absurd men are supposed to embody power and decisionmaking , and what could embody passivity more than modeling \? it is bruce weber on whom critics have pinned blame for objectifying the male form and prompting in men the kind of physical insecurities that for so long afflicted women twenty years ago , mr weber s early photographs for versace and calvin klein made minor celebrities of models like jeff aquilon his hulky men , jumping in and out of swimming pools , suggested for some the hyperbolic masculinity of fascist propaganda at a moment when large numbers of women were entering the labor force , mr weber s lens seemed intent on reminding the world that men still ruled the hemispheres women could become partners at law firms and work one desk away from the hathaway shirt man , but men could still benchpress the chrysler building in the mid1990 s , though , as a seinfeldian nihilism coursed through popular culture , fashion grew reliant on images of men who appeared to be capable of virtually nothing the trend went from guys in their 30 s to skinny boys in grungy suits , said david soloff , who booked male models at click for eight years mr soloff , who recently founded the model agency , specializing in recognizable personalities , noted that male models of the 80 s used to look like intelligent human beings the skinny young kids , he said , none of them have an identity and the fashion industry has produced far too many of them the market is flooded , said chris forberg , a director of the men s division at img there s not enough work to go around elayne hearns , director of the men s division at next , put the number of men working regularly as models in new york at about 30 as for the trend toward celebrity , semicelebrity and a semblance of the real , ms hearns said simply , it hurts a lot of clients are going in that direction , and it s not as if it s going the other way , she added it s not as if there is a great demand for models to star in movies photos in the barneys catalog an actor , a barneys executive , a restaurateur and a magazine editorial director on the runway andrei shevchenko , a ukrainian soccer star , in an armani show tim henman , tennis star and newly signed img model , on the court and in british vogue the mogul skier jeremy bloom will be featured in a fall advertising campaign by tommy hilfiger maxim belotserkovsky , a principal dancer with the american ballet theater , has recently signed a modeling contract with the elite agency \( agence francepresse \) \( matthew stockman allsport \) \( chester higgins jr the new york times \)
vero beach , fla , march 21 mo vaughn will return from a strained hamstring on friday , completing the mets' lineup a winter s worth of renovation will be on view yet the new faces in the everyday lineup will not be enough to guide the mets back to the postseason if their pitching falls short as spring training comes to a close camp breaks a week from today the concern keeps growing the mets announced today that john franco would begin the season on the disabled list , making official what had been expected franco felt pain while throwing batting practice tuesday , and when the pain did not subside , the team decided to shut him down for five to seven days the mets have no idea when the 41yearold franco will return at full strength , leaving an already questionable bullpen even shakier manager bobby valentine said it would be exciting not a word a manager normally wants to use when he discusses his bullpen to see his relievers pitch in key lateinning situations we have some guys that need to settle into doing jobs that they maybe have n't done a lot in the past , valentine said that uncertainty is why the mets rejected a trade proposal from the rangers this week that would have sent jay payton and bruce chen to texas for center fielder gabe kapler and the lefthanded reliever luis vizcaino the rangers wanted a third player , and asked for either the minor league outfielder robert stratton or the lefthanded reliever bobby jones the trade appears dead because the mets cannot afford to deal chen , who is being shifted to the bullpen without addressing the proposed trade with texas , general manager steve phillips said he did not anticipate trading a starting position player before opening day will there be a lesser deal \? possibly , but i could n't say probably , phillips said franco is eligible to be activated april 7 , but valentine said that may 1 was more of a possibility if franco could overcome the tendinitis and torn scar tissue in his elbow phillips said franco might have to pitch with the tendinitis all season i still do n't feel any need to go out and replace john for the year , phillips said i think there are ways to upgrade our bullpen we 'll look at them , but we do suspect that he s going to be back whether it s april 15 or 25 or may 1 , i do n't know that chen has emerged as a key figure only 24 and relatively inexpensive at 300 , 000 this season , he can start or relieve and provides the mets longerterm security because all five pitchers in the projected rotation could be free agents after the season payton will make 362 , 500 this season , and with kapler due to earn 18 million this season and 325 million the next , the mets would rather increase their payroll \( now at 102 million \) to help their pitching , not take away from it for now , chen provides insurance for an aging and injuryprone rotation and an inexperienced bullpen the mets will carry 12 pitchers to start the season of the seven bullpen spots , closer armando benitez , the righthander david weathers and the lefthander mark guthrie hold secure spots the other jobs will be filled by four of the following five pitchers chen , grant roberts , kane davis , satoru komiyama and pete walker chen is the only lefthander roberts was converted to relief last season after struggling as a starter davis has good velocity , but is with his fifth organization walker is a 32yearold journeyman who has pitched at class aaa for four teams and can opt for free agency if he is not on the opening day roster chen has relieved in 31 games in his career , but none since the first half of 2000 , and he has said he cannot warm up quickly komiyama relieved in 15 games during a 12year career in japan , but just twice since 1992 , the last time in september 2000 he said he needed only 15 to 20 pitches to be ready to enter a game , but had no idea how he would react to relieving valentine used chen and komiyama in the middle innings today in a 126 victory over the dodgers and said each appeared comfortable chen walked one batter and struck out two in one inning komiyama retired all four batters he faced asked who among his relievers was most experienced in pitching the eighth inning , valentine named komiyama , when he pitched a complete game weathers served as a setup man for the brewers and the cubs last season phillips seemed less concerned about an inexperienced bullpen not everybody has to be proven on opening day , he said some guys earn their stripes as the season goes on inside pitch the mets announced their rotation to start the season al leiter , steve trachsel , shawn estes , pedro astacio and jeff d'amico astacio is scheduled to open a threegame series april 5 at atlanta he is 213 with a 461 earned run average in his career against the braves edgardo alfonzo homered twice and mark johnson and jason phillips each added homers in thursday s victory over the dodgers photo satoru komiyama retired all four batters he faced in the mets' victory over the dodgers komiyama , a starter in japan , will most likely pitch out of the bullpen \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \)
winston smith , the protagonist of george orwell s nineteen eightyfour , was a rewrite man his job was to destroy documents that could undermine the government s pretense of infallibility , and replace them with altered versions lately , winston smith has gone to washington i'm sure that lots of history is being falsified as you read this there are several threeletter agencies i do n't trust at all but two cases involving the federal budget caught my eye first is the chicago line shortly after sept 11 , george w bush told his budget director that the only valid reasons to break his pledge not to run budget deficits would be if the country experienced recession , war or national emergency lucky me , he said i hit the trifecta when i first reported this remark , angry readers accused me of inventing it mr bush , they said , is a decent man who would never imply that the nation s woes had taken him off the hook , let alone make a joke out of it soon afterward , the trifecta story became part of mr bush s standard stump speech it always gets a roar of appreciative laughter from republican audiences so what s the chicago line \? in his speeches , mr bush claims to have laid out the criteria for running a deficit when visiting chicago during the 2000 campaign but there s no evidence that he said anything of the sort during the campaign , in chicago or anywhere else certainly none of the reporters who were with him can remember it \( the new republic , which has tracked the claim , titled one of its pieces stop him before he lies again \) in fact , during the campaign his budget promises were unqualified , for good reason if he had conceded that future surpluses were not guaranteed , voters might have wondered whether it was wise to lock in a 10year tax cut about that 10year tax cut it basically takes place in two phases phase i , which has mainly happened already , is a smallish tax cut for the middle class phase ii , which wo n't be completed until 2010 , is a considerably larger cut that goes mostly to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers that twophase structure offers substantial opportunities for misdirection if someone suggests reconsidering future tax cuts , the administration can accuse him of wanting to raise taxes in a recession implying , falsely , that he wants to reverse phase i rather than simply call off phase ii on the other hand , if someone says that tax cuts have worsened the budget picture , the administration can say that tax cuts explain only 15 percent of the move into deficit this sounds definitive , but in fact it refers only to the impact of phase i on this year s budget by the administration s own estimates , 40 percent of the 4 trillion deterioration in the 10year outlook is due to tax cuts there is , however , an art to this sort of deception you have to imply the falsehood without actually saying it outright last month the office of management and budget got sloppy it issued a press release stating flatly that tax cuts were responsible for only 15 percent of the 10year deterioration the center on budget and policy priorities noticed , and i reported it here now for the fun part the omb reacted angrily , and published a letter in the times attacking me it attributed the misstatement to error , and declared that it had been retracted was it \? it depends on what you mean by the word retract as far as anyone knows , omb did n't issue a revised statement conceding that it had misinformed reporters and giving the right numbers it simply threw the embarrassing document down the memory hole as brendan nyhan pointed out in salon , if you go to the omb s web site now you find a press release dated july 12 that is not the release actually handed out on that date there is no indication that anything has been changed , but the bullet point on sources of the deficit is gone every government tries to make excuses for its past errors , but i do n't think any previous us administration has been this brazen about rewriting history to make itself look good for this kind of thing to happen you have to have politicians who have no qualms about playing big brother officials whose partisan loyalty trumps their professional scruples and a press corps that , with some honorable exceptions , lets the people in power get away with it lucky us we hit the trifecta
uniondale , ny , april 21 in a move orchestrated to take the focus away from his team s scoring struggles in its first two playoff games and to call into question the officiating in those two losses , islanders general manager mike milbury held a video session complete with a running monologue for reporters today at nassau coliseum we 've got rules in this game and we have to call them the way they are written , said an angry milbury , whose team trails its fourofsevengame eastern conference series with the toronto maple leafs , 20 milbury was infuriated that leafs defenseman bryan mccabe , a former islanders captain , was not penalized despite repeatedly placing his stick between the legs of the islanders skaters and driving them to the ice during saturday s 20 game at air canada center it s his signature move , the 'can opener' i call it , milbury said he did it when he was here and he still does it it s obstruction tripping and it s a penalty milbury then tweaked mccabe by adding , he ca n't pivot that well and that s why he uses that move milbury showed videotaped examples of what he said were unpenalized instances of obstruction , hooking and crosschecking by the maple leafs , and contrasted that with what he said were penalties unfairly called on the islanders much to the displeasure of milbury and the rest of the team , the islanders had three power plays saturday while toronto had a manadvantage six times milbury said he complained about the work of referees dave jackson and don koharski to the nhl supervisor of officials , john d'amico , after the game john felt they called a good game , milbury said i beg to differ the more emphasis placed on the officiating , the less focus there is on the islanders' struggling offense one goal , none at evenstrength in the first 120 minutes of this series though they have received superb goaltending from chris osgood and solid team defense , the islanders managed only a powerplay goal by kenny jonsson early in game 1 on 45 shots against toronto goaltender curtis joseph joseph is a great goaltender and he s come up with some unbelievable saves , jonsson said today we just need to create more chances , get more shots on goal and create traffic in front of him and the puck will start going in islanders coach peter laviolette said some people say that defense wins games some people would have to argue that we 're down 20 because we 're not scoring goals as for his take on the officiating , laviolette noted that the league had said before the playoffs that games would be officiated with the same crackdown on rule violations as had taken place during the regular season what they said would happen is n't happening , he said milbury advanced that thought a step further when he said , we 're getting jobbed here he also said the officials had been affected by complaints before the series by toronto s coach and general manager , pat quinn we go into toronto and they ca n't make the calls they 're supposed to make because they are under duress after pat quinn moaned for three days before the series started , milbury said if they do n't have the courage to call it , there is something wrong , he said slap shots sunday was take care of your body day , said defenseman kenny jonsson , who along with aleksei yashin and adrian aucoin were the only players at the coliseum as coach peter laviolette had given the team the day off laviolette described his team s attitude as disappointed , but not beat up after dropping the first two games in toronto
los angeles , july 12 not so long ago , when the dotcom bubble was holding firm and the word synergy still had a fresh ring , hot magazines like talk boasted about how they would seek out stories that virtually demanded to become feature films and then , they would not merely allow the writer to sell off the rights to some hollywood fasttalker , but become active partners in the project coproducers players ! now , of course , the bubble is long burst the word synergy sounds only slightly less anachronistic than 23 skidoo talk magazine has been laid to rest in the graveyard of seemedlikeagoodideaatthetime and which magazine , does it turn out , has actually done it become active as developer and coproducer of major hollywood films based on its own original work \? stuffy , tweedy , yellowbordered national geographic about as old media as you can get without going all the way back to illuminated manuscripts i think it s the nature of the thing that we cover , said tim kelly , president of national geographic television and film we really are kind of the real deal when it comes to adventure we were hiring indiana joneses before anybody knew who indiana jones was audiences who go to the nation s multiplexes to watch harrison ford play the captain of a crippled soviet nuclear submarine in k19 the widowmaker , opening july 19 , may be surprised to see on the screen , following the paramount pictures and intermedia films logos , yet another logo for national geographic films k19 will mark the first time that it has appeared at the beginning of a mainstream feature film , but if national geographic has its way it will become an increasingly familiar sight k19 is based on the true story of a russian sub whose nuclear reactor malfunctioned in the north atlantic in 1961 more specifically , the film was developed from a 1996 national geographic documentary about the littleknown incident it was developed not by a hollywood studio , but by national geographic s fledgling motionpicture division in hollywood , headed by christine whitaker , a former imagine entertainment executive and if you want to talk about synergy national geographic s television unit also has a new documentary featuring the k19 incident called lost subs disasters at sea , to be seen on msnbc a book from national geographic s publishing division , k19 the widowmaker the secret story of the soviet nuclear submarine , recently hit bookstores , featuring a glowering picture of mr ford as the sub s commander and national geographic s web site has an extensive k19 section www nationalgeographic com k19 that includes a 3d animated journey through the vessel , a clickable map of other submarine disasters , a timeline explaining the evolution of submarine design , and a link to sites where tickets to the movie can be purchased this is one of the major things that we bring to the table the extensive resources of national geographic s research departments , which can provide a much deeper and more detailed exploration of the story behind the movie , said rick allen , president of national geographic ventures , a taxable subsidiary of the nonprofit national geographic society whose holdings include the national geographic channel , a maps division , retail products , catalog sales , consumer merchandising and the film unit other projects that national geographic feature films has in development include shackleton , an epic version of the explorer ernest shackleton s nearimpossible struggle to save his icebound antarctic crew , and undaunted courage , based on the historian stephen e ambrose s best seller about the lewis and clark expedition shackleton , which the director wolfgang petersen hopes to make , is based on a national geographic magazine article , among other sources and undaunted courage became a project for the unit because mr ambrose served as one of the society s eight explorers in residence the director of k19 , kathryn bigelow , was also involved from the outset in developing the film when the first production company to which the script was attached , working title films , decided to pass on the project , the ambitious and cashrich intermedia films stepped in nigel sinclair , intermedia s cofounder , said he was gripped by the script and intrigued by the idea of a partnership with national geographic feature films , which he saw as a guarantee of the science and history in the story in the end , intermedia financed the entire production and was responsible for bringing mr ford into the film only much later did paramount come aboard to handle the marketing and distribution in north america and a few european territories mr sinclair says he believes that the national geographic formula is one that will work adventures and the outdoors make for great stories and great stories make for great movies , he said national geographic is sitting on what is , potentially , an almost bottomless fund of adventure stories it s a specific area it s finite but it s definitely a significant part of the tradition of filmmaking
nhwali , zimbabwe , sept 7 in ordinary times , more than 450 teenagers crowd into the shabby high school here , giggling over tattered notebooks and precious dreams but since hunger began spreading through this country , the students have been dropping out one by one since january , more than 50 students have abandoned their studies to scrounge for food in the dry , desolate fields , school officials say absenteeism is soaring and teenagers have been fainting and sleeping in class because they sometimes go without food for two or three days if all was well , we would share our food with the students , said mchasisi gasela , a history teacher here at nhwali secondary school he was standing with hundreds of hungry people who were waiting to receive free food from the united nations or to buy cheap grain from the government but it s very difficult these days , mr gasela said teachers are hungry , too severe food shortages have been sweeping southern africa , but no country has been hit harder than zimbabwe the country s farm production has been devastated by a severe drought and president robert mugabe s decision to order thousands of white farmers off the land so it can be distributed to black farmers half of the country s 12 million people now need emergency food aid , the united nations says , and malnutrition levels have begun to rise , particularly among women and children a national survey conducted in may indicated that the percentage of women with low nutrition levels had increased to 9 percent from 5 percent in 2000 here , in this village , nearly 50 percent of households rely on emergency food aid from the united nations in this province , matabeleland , malnutrition levels among children under age 5 have increased to 8 percent , from about 3 percent , health officials say these are striking figures for zimbabwe , which was once one of africa s most prosperous and promising countries eight percent is quite high , said jabulani ndlovu , the provincial medical director , who was visiting a local clinic here there really is nothing to eat officials say , though , that there is still time to avert famine none of the haunting images of starvation are visible here people are not emaciated , and goats and donkeys are still healthy families are scraping by with help from neighbors , relatives and emergency food aid but most households have watched their crops wither , and officials say they may starve in coming months if other nations and aid groups do not come up with the money for the needed food the united nations says it needs 11 million tons of food to prevent poor people from starving here so far , donors have pledged enough money to cover about 60 percent of the need the world food program is desperately trying to raise money for the remaining food unlike zambia , another southern country that is struggling to feed its people , zimbabwe has agreed to accept genetically modified food from the united states that decision was praised by united nations officials , who said it would allow them to move food in quickly once the donors contributed it s incredibly important that the world knows the severity of this issue , said james t morris , director of the world food program and the the united nations' special envoy on the crisis , who was visiting this village today we 'll be able to avert a terrible crisis if we have the resources to move forward , he said mr mugabe s land redistribution program is intended to undo the legacy of british colonialism , which left a tiny white minority with more than half of the fertile soil he denies that it has contributed to the widespread hunger , even though the united nations says it contributed to a 70 percent drop in corn production in zimbabwe over the past year that is nonsense , mr mugabe said this week in an interview with foreign journalists he blames the region s severe drought for his country s troubles but the dispute over the causes of the food shortages means little to ordinary people here they are too busy searching for food the need is visible in the worried faces of the wrinkled women who wait here for hours for a sack of cornmeal , beans and cooking oil from the united nations they hobble to the food distribution site in tattered shoes , pushing rusty wheelbarrows over a stretch of land that is so dry there is little grass in the soil alipheli dube , who has seven children , came here for emergency rations today after going without food for three days my children , they 're seriously affected , she said when there s no food , they cannot go to school , otherwise they faint at nhwali secondary school , which is only a short walk from the food distribution site , a handful of girls were studying history in a classroom with broken windows none of them had eaten today and many described going without food for a week in recent months the teenagers said they often subsisted on tea and dried vegetables several said they ate twice a day instead of three times a day the severe food shortages have made items like bread , rice and eggs unattainable luxuries i used to eat three times a day , said nontokozo moyo , 16 these days , it s twice or once students are leaving school because of hunger in most homes , there s no food school officials said that teachers were also affected by the food shortages , spending time in long lines for scarce commodities when they would normally be preparing for the next day s lessons they are chasing food , soneni dube , the deputy headmaster of the high school , said of his teachers the morale is very , very low we have the money , but there is no grain to buy photos a woman with cornmeal donated by the united states aid agencies say that up to six million zimbabweans will need

los angeles , oct 10 hollywood executives have made sport since early summer predicting which studio miramax films or dreamworks would back down and change the christmas day release of its blockbuster contender , preventing a duel between films starring leonardo dicaprio harvey weinstein , the cochairman of miramax , finally gave way today gangs of new york , the highly anticipated epic about precivil war manhattan from martin scorsese , will reach theaters in early december instead of dec 25 , when it would have gone headtohead with catch me if you can by the director steven spielberg matthew hiltzik , a spokesman for mr weinstein , said the company had not decided what day in early december that gangs of new york would be released but added , this is a competitive film , and we are confident that this and other quality projects will succeed during this season but agreeing to change the release from christmas day , a date mr hiltzik maintained adamantly last week that mr weinstein was sticking by , shows just how concerned the studio was about whether gangs , which also stars daniel daylewis , would prevail in the allimportant opening day for weeks , three people involved in the film said , several executives at miramax have been urging mr weinstein privately to cede christmas day to catch me if you can , a lighthearted story about a con artist who impersonates people it also stars tom hanks the decision to change the date , one of these people said , came after a miramax meeting this week when several executives pleaded with mr weinstein to reconsider even mr dicaprio was not pleased at having two movies released on the same day because he did not want to have to choose which to promote at the expense of the other , his publicist said and several people involved with the film were concerned that gangs , with its violent content , would be hard pressed to attract families on christmas day we 've been waiting six months for dreamworks to change the date , and they were n't going to do it , said one person involved in gangs everyone talked some sense into harvey we said , 'we 're not going up against their movie because they will win' miramax has a lot riding on a profitable christmas season it has three other big movies opening on or near christmas day , including pinocchio , starring roberto benigni chicago , which is based on the broadway musical and confessions of a dangerous mind , the movie directed by george clooney about the gong show creator , chuck barris , who claimed to be a spy jeffrey katzenberg , a dreamworks founder who is also a friend of mr weinstein , said in an interview today that he had breakfast with mr weinstein last week in new york to discuss their respective movies' release dates and joked that they settled their differences after the two ate waffles , and later stayed up late telling manly stories all kidding aside , he agreed that the decision was based more on economics than breakfast food and bonding he and i had many conversations about why releasing the movies on the same day was in none of our interests , mr katzenberg said it was an uncomfortable situation as both companies have a big investment in leo dicaprio miramax executives are emphasizing that gangs had a 50 percent overall awareness with the audiences it has tested and 64 percent among the muchcoveted males older than 18 such awareness is not surprising given a barrage of international media coverage about the movie some miramax executives are still stinging from a spate of articles this year chronicling the problems gangs had getting from the script phase to the screen it has been more than three years since mr weinstein and mr scorsese embarked on the movie , which is based on a 1927 book by herbert asbury mr weinstein hoped the movie would be released last year in time for the 2001 academy awards at times , mr scorsese and mr weinstein sparred during the film s production over both its length and the time it was taking to make it last friday , mr scorsese was still tinkering with the movie s sound at a production studio near times square when asked at the studio then about how long it was taking to finish gangs , mr scorsese offered with a sigh , i was saying this morning , 'we need to end this' any weekend that miramax chooses to release the film will be a challenge on dec 13 , one date that many executives within miramax favored , star trek nemesis is scheduled to be released the second installment of the lord of the rings trilogy is set for a dec 18 release photos leonardo dicaprio and steven spielberg on the set of catch me if you can , which will be the only dicaprio movie opening on christmas day \( andrew cooper dreamworks \) \( pg c2 \) leonardo dicaprio with martin scorsese on the set of gangs of new york the movie will be released in early december \( mario tursi miramax films \) \( pg c1 \)
the state health department has asked a long island heart surgeon with hepatitis c to obtain signed consent before performing any more operations the recommendation comes after several patients complained that he had ignored a previous directive to inform them the doctor , michael hall , is a highly rated cardiac surgeon who has performed thousands of delicate operations at north shore university hospital in manhasset the survival rate for his patients ranks among the 10 best statewide but in august , health investigators found that dr hall was infected with hepatitis c , a virus that can cause a potentially fatal liver illness years later the bloodborne virus is spread through needles shared for illicit drugs and was transmitted in blood transfusions before the supply was screened for hepatitis the virus could also be transmitted through accidental cuts or punctures during surgery the investigators focused on dr hall because several of his former patients contracted hepatitis , although none have died genetic testing matched his virus with the viruses of three patients , and results are pending in other cases state health officials recommended recently that other patients dr hall has treated be contacted and urged to be tested the hospital is compiling a list of about 3 , 800 people dating back to 1991 since the doctor s infection was revealed , about 700 patients have called the hospital about half have been tested , but the results have not been reported since august , dr hall has agreed to take new precautions , such as wearing two sets of gloves and avoiding sharp objects during surgery he has operated on about 250 patients since then , and tests show no new infections , the hospital says the state said it had also recommended that dr hall inform new patients of his infection and have an impartial witness record their informed consent but newsday reported on monday that six of his patients had complained that they had not been informed three said that relatives who attended their consultations confirmed that there had been no warning a woman who called the new york times said her father was a patient who had not been notified a spokesman for dr hall and the hospital , terry lynam , said he was reluctant to get involved in a he said she said dispute with the patients he said records of the two patients whose names were published in newsday indicated that the surgeon had informed them of the hepatitis risk when patients and relatives are focused on the lifeanddeath risks of heart ailments and of surgery , mr lynam said , it s not surprising that they might not remember about hearing about the relatively insignificant chance of hepatitis transmission state directives sent to the hospital last year did not specify that a witness was required , but officials may have recommended that procedure in telephone calls , mr lynam said he said witnesses attended consultations with dr hall sometimes a state health department spokeswoman , kristine smith , said her agency had recommended witnesses just to avoid these kinds of questions to resolve the issue , the health agency s executive deputy commissioner , dennis p whalen , sent a letter to the hospital on april 10 directing that patients receive written notice of the doctor s hepatitis and sign a consent form before surgery asked whether the state will review the patients' complaints , ms smith said the agency was obligated to investigate allegations of conduct that may endanger patients , but that confidentiality rules prevented public disclosure of any specific inquiry
washington the sweeping changes announced by the fbi director , robert s mueller iii , last week constitute one of the most farreaching organizational transformations in the long history of the bureau , which began in 1908 unfortunately , creating new units , hiring new people and announcing a new focus on fighting terrorism are destined to fail unless mr mueller can also transform the insular culture of the agency in that sense , mr mueller s treatment of coleen rowley , the agent who called attention to the fbi s failures in the zacarias moussaoui investigation , is encouraging he thanked her for her courage in coming forward and assured her that her job is not in jeopardy as the result of her criticism but one act of candor and contrition by the director does not remake a culture the bureau will succeed in its new mission only if it can learn to value analysis as much as traditional criminal investigation there s little doubt that the reorganization is necessary the shift in priorities from crimefighting the pursuit of bank robbers , kidnappers , mobsters and other highprofile criminals to counterterrorism reflects the change in our national priorities some critics say the reorganization is a thinly veiled attempt to divert attention from all the recent negative publicity about the fbi , but they 're wrong a shift in policies was inevitable after sept 11 those attacks proved the bureau and our other intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been illequipped and too poorly organized to address the threats we face others question whether the policy changes are wise should the fbi be allowed to take on expanded duties involving the gathering of domestic intelligence \? there are legitimate concerns about the lifting of justice department restrictions on domestic spying , given the abuses committed against religious and political groups during the j edgar hoover era but for better or worse the fbi is the agency that has to take the lead in domestic security not necessarily because it has shown striking success in the past , but because no institutional alternative presents itself regardless of one s view of the wisdom of mr mueller s changes , or the motivation behind them , the main obstacles to carrying them out are features of institutional life within the fbi intelligence collection and analysis have long been undervalued in a culture that has celebrated the myth of the fbi agentcrimefighter analysts assigned to cases have been the lowest people on the totem pole counterintelligence agents have been secondclass citizens compared to those in criminal investigation units virtually all of the powerful bosses of the fbi field offices around the country the special agents in charge come from investigative backgrounds elevating the status of analysis capabilities in an agency that has devalued that work will not be easy nor will the shift of the bureau s mission be easy for the staff men and women who have chosen careers with the fbi have done so because , to put it bluntly , they want to lock up criminals agents have expected successful investigations to lead to prosecutions , not to prevention of terrorist acts although the fbi will be hiring hundreds of new analysts , turning the fbi around in the next few years will depend upon its current staff giving lip service to the bureau s new mission will not be the problem the problem will be changing on the most practical level what the fbi does and what agents do on a daily basis the key question is whether and to what extent the fbi will become more open to ideas and criticism from within the agency and from the outside world the free and unfettered exchange of ideas and the willingness to challenge and question the way business is done are fundamental to a culture in which analysis is prized none of these qualities have been encouraged in the bureau s history the fbi has not been an institution that accepts dissent its initial response to ms rowley s bold letter was not to follow up on it but to classify it its standard approach to criticism was on display when , over the course of many years , the fbi ignored and denigrated frederic whitehurst , the former fbi chemist , when he made very serious charges of unscientific and deficient practices at the fbi crime lab , many of which turned out to be accurate when i was inspector general of the justice department , i was charged with investigating the bureau s handling of the aldrich ames affair not only did the fbi oppose this review some fbi officials actually told members of the congressional staff that i was uninterested in conducting it and preferred to let the agency perform its own internal review the fbi ultimately cooperated with my office , but only after desperate efforts to avoid the investigation the individuals who assisted on the investigation declined to have their names on the report that was viewed as a potential careerender when the report on the ames case was issued , it was either dismissed or ignored by senior fbi officials one official said publicly that the report contained nothing new a comment that raised the question of whether the agency s leaders had even read it mr mueller showed he is willing to change the approach when he quickly referred ms rowley s complaints to the justice department s inspector general , an act that would have been considered extraordinary under his predecessors his good example is certainly important but altering the bureau s culture will require a turnabout in the attitude of the entire fbi leadership , one that permeates the whole agency creating new organizational boxes , shifting manpower and expanding the size of the fbi will not make the public safer until this change is made
a group of international investors who say they were swindled out of more than 15 million by a currency trading firm that was based in the world trade center say that j p morgan chase bears some responsibility for their losses , which they discovered after the trading firm s offices were destroyed on sept 11 and several of its executives disappeared scores of clients of the trading firm , evergreen international spot trading , now defunct , sent money by wire to associated accounts at j p morgan chase the transfers came with instructions that the funds were to be credited to the clients , in sub accounts , but that did not happen , according to lawyers for the investors , who have obtained some of the transfer documents when the terror attacks of sept 11 destroyed the world trade center , evergreen ceased to function in november , federal prosecutors indicted the owner of the firm , andrei koudachev , on charges of wire and mail fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy they also charged gary farberov , president of first equity enterprises , evergreen s trading arm , with money laundering mr farberov pleaded guilty in december and began cooperating with prosecutors mr koudachev is believed to have fled to russia , and his lawyers have denied the charges in all , according to prosecutors , more than 1 , 400 evergreen clients in more than a dozen countries many from australia and new zealand were cheated of 110 million from 1998 to september 2001 mr farberov forfeited 51 million as part of his plea agreement mark van leewarden , a lawyer from auckland , new zealand , representing the group of investors who say they lost more than 15 million , said he was preparing to sue chase this month his suit will probably join one already filed against the bank and evergreen executives and brokers by christos tzaras , a greek shipping executive who lives in monaco mr tzaras s suit , filed in federal court in manhattan on dec 20 , says he lost 17 million in the affair last week , j p morgan chase filed a motion to dismiss the tzaras lawsuit catherine keary , a j p morgan chase spokeswoman , said the bank had no liability in the matter and that the allegations are without merit she said the bank would not comment on the similar allegations raised by mr van leewarden s clients because they had not yet filed suit most of evergreen s clients were not from the united states , apparently because its brokers thought that nonamericans would be more receptive to its sales pitch among the company s promises were annual returns of 25 to 30 percent from currency trading , prosecutors have said according to documents assembled by mr van leewarden , when clients were ready to invest , evergreen executives had many of them wire funds to an account at chase in the name of first equity , a company that they were told acted as evergreen s clearing agent this was done , the clients say they were told , so the money could be pooled and used for large , profitable trades but , they say , evergreen brokers told them that their money would be kept securely at chase in separate sub accounts in their names wire transfer documents on evergreen stationery from several customers including some of mr van leewarden s clients as well as mr tzaras list first equity enterprises as the beneficiary and then say for further credit to the client mr van leewarden and bryan c skarlatos , a new york lawyer representing mr tzaras , say that j p morgan chase never tried to follow the full instructions , because if it had done so , it would have been apparent that no subaccounts existed chase had a duty to the client to act with reasonable care , mr skarlatos said , and it should not have disregarded the further credit part of the wire instructions instead , he said , the bank should have sent the money back he said j p morgan chase should also have noticed that first equity was regularly transferring the arriving money into other bank accounts overseas , a process that he called a classic money laundering pattern in its motion to dismiss mr tzaras s suit , j p morgan chase says it properly credited funds to the bank account of first equity , whose name and account numbers are on the wire transfer documents after identifying a beneficiary , like first equity , by an existing account number , the bank is permitted to credit the bank account identified by number without regard to any additional information on the transfer instructions , the motion said mr tzaras cannot complain that the bank breached a duty to him the bank says , because , simply , none was owed according to several banking and legal experts , the further credit instructions on the wire transfer documents are significant , but details of the way the main account was set up would determine whether it was the bank s responsibility to carry them out , or first equity s according to mr tzaras s suit , chase closed two accounts in evergreen s name in september 2000 when it was concerned about certain suspicious transactions in these accounts but wire transfer documents show that chase did not close the affiliated first equity accounts at least until august 2001 the chase spokeswoman , citing client confidentiality , said the bank could not discuss the accounts
the university of missouri has received a patent that some lawyers say could cover human cloning , potentially violating a longstanding taboo against the patenting of humans the patent covers a way of turning unfertilized eggs into embryos , and the production of cloned mammals using that technique but unlike some other patents on animal cloning , this one does not specifically exclude human from the definition of mammals indeed , it specifically mentions the use of human eggs those opposed to cloning and to patenting living things say the patent is a further sign that human life is being turned into a commodity it is horrendous that we would define all of human life as biological machines that can be cloned , manufactured and patented , said andrew kimbrell , executive director of the international center for technology assessment , a washington group that has long opposed patenting of living things and also wants to ban all human cloning the patent was issued in april 2001 , but attracted no attention until mr kimbrell s group ran across it recently senator sam brownback , the kansas republican who has been a leading opponent of human cloning , said he intended to introduce a bill to prohibit patents on human beings and human embryos , which he said were akin to slavery i think the patent office will appreciate having that clarity , given the applications that are coming into the patent office , mr brownback said that bill would be separate from a bill the senator is already sponsoring that would prohibit all human cloning the senate is debating how extensively to ban human cloning , but none of the bills it is considering deal with the patent issues the patent also illustrates the tricky legal and ethical issues the united states patent and trademark office is confronting as scientists race to develop cloning and to grow human tissues to treat disease mr kimbrell said he had found a few other patents that had been applied for but not granted that might cover human cloning the united states has been more liberal than most other countries in granting patents on living things , ever since a supreme court decision in 1980 that allowed the patenting of a microbe genetically engineered to consume oil spills there are patents on complete animals , like a mouse genetically engineered to be prone to cancer there are patents on human genes and human cells the university of wisconsin has a patent on human embryonic stem cells , which are cells taken from human embryos that have the ability to turn into any other type of tissue but the patent office has drawn the line on patenting of humans or human embryos themselves , saying it would not be constitutional many experts say this is because such patents would violate the 13th amendment ban on slavery brigid quinn , a spokeswoman for the patent office , said the agency was not using the 13th amendment argument anymore but was not granting patents on humans because it had not received any guidance from congress or the courts saying it should do so the result has been that many patents that conceivably could cover humans like on cloning animals or on genetically engineering animals to produce drugs in their milk specifically exclude humans a spokesman for the university of missouri , christian basi , said it believed its patent covered human cloning because it applied to all mammals the university has licensed the patent to biotransplant , a massachusetts biotechnology company that is working on creating pigs that can be used as human organ donors but the license , mr basi said , covers only the use in pigs we have absolutely no interest in using this to research humans and we will not license this technology to anyone for use in humans , mr basi said , suggesting that the patent could actually help stop human cloning this gives us control of this particular technology so we will know that this technology will not be used in humans ms quinn said the patent office did not comment on individual patents but had not changed its policy of not issuing patents drawn to humans randall s prather , a professor of reproductive technology at missouri whose work was the basis for the patent , said the mention of human eggs was put there by the attorneys and they wanted to cover all mammals charles cohen , who wrote the patent when he was a lawyer at a st louis law firm , declined to comment some lawyers who have looked at the patent , no 6 , 211 , 429 , say it is not clear that it covers human cloning and that interpreting patents requires careful analysis of the patent s history that the patent office did not appear to have problems with it could be a sign that the agency believes that the patent does not cover humans you 'd have to go through line by line , word by word , said gerald p dodson , a lawyer with morrison foerster in palo alto , calif , who read the patent and said he could not reach an immediate conclusion mr dodson and others noted that the specifications and examples of how the patent could be used dealt with pigs and cows even if the patent does cover human cloning , some lawyers say , it would be a stretch to say it covers humans themselves , although the abstract of the patent says it covers the cloned products but even a patent on the process of cloning humans could give the patent holder some rights over people , some lawyers said conceivably , for instance , the university could bar people created overseas by its cloning process from entering the country it definitely is a patent for cloning a human , and under the laws we have right now , it might actually cover the human , said richard warburg , a patent lawyer at foley lardner in san diego who represents infigen , an animal cloning company dr rochelle seide , a new york patent lawyer who heads the biotechnology practice at the law firm of baker botts , said the lack of the nonhuman disclaimer in the missouri patent was surprising looking at it , ms seide said , i can see where people who are against cloning would have a big problem with it advanced cell technology , a company that wants to clone human embryos to obtain stem cells for disease treatments , licensed a patent from the university of massachusetts on its method of cloning but the patent is on only nonhuman embryos produced by the process , though it does seem to cover human cells it might be difficult to draw the line on what constitutes a human george j annas , professor of health law at boston university school of public health , said it was unclear whether the antislavery amendment would be a basis for denying patents on human embryos because courts , in cases like those involving custody of frozen embryos , have said an embryo is not a person
last september , visions of green grass dancing in his head , charlie mckenna spent 1 , 700 on an underground sprinkler system six months later , jim mcgreevy declared a drought emergency , making lawn watering underground or otherwise a highly suspect activity not to mention illegal at least in millburn , where mr mckenna lives just my luck , he groaned lawabiding citizen that he is , mr mckenna has n't turned his new system on even once not even under cover of night , when one might be tempted you could turn it on at 2 o'clock in the morning , he said a lot of people are of course , outwitting the neighbors is one thing it s quite another to try to get one past the millburn police , who have a 24houraday manhunt going for surreptitious sprinklers our officers are diligent about driving around at night , said sgt pete eakley , deputy emergency coordinator for millburn township , one of the leafier locales in essex county plus , he added , neighbors are ratting each other out better to stay on your neighbor s good side illegal watering carries a fine of up to 1 , 000 and a jail sentence of up to six months first there were the salem witch hunts in the 1950 s , redbaiting now , it s greenlining obviously , if your lawn is green , you 're breaking the law , said mr mckenna , his voice containing but a hint of sarcasm it used to be that scorched and withered lawns were a breach of suburban etiquette , a sign that you were a slacker in the grass department now it s the opposite the scorched and withered lawn shows you 're a good ecocitizen and team player one gardener i know , who has a showcase garden on a showcase street in my town , says she s been feeling a little exposed lately as if the profusion of roses on her front fence proves she s been up to no good hand watering your roses is actually legal but since the state s drought rules are so complicated , running to 13 pages , your neighbors might think you 're pulling a fast one the fact is , 12 , 000 people have called the state s drought hot line \( 18004itsdry \) since the emergency was declared in march 3 , 000 more have sent emails , and 600 have submitted official requests asking for an exemption the rules are more convoluted than an english boxwood maze in colt s neck , for example , you can put your lawn sprinkler out with impunity every other day but in teaneck , you can water only new grass seed or sod , and you can do that only if the new grass is there because you had some construction done that ripped up the lawn dennis hart , the state s drought czar , explained it this way if you put in a private swimming pool last year , and trucks came in and ripped up the lawn , it would be ok with the state of new jersey if you put grass seed in now and watered it but if , like me , you spent 4 , 000 last summer to remove a gigantic , dangerous oak tree and your backyard was ripped up by trucks in the process , putting in seed and watering it would be somewhat iffy what mr hart calls a gray area perhaps if you installed your own private water theme park , you 'd get an award \? then there s the question of exemptions the drought czar has granted permission for local carnivals to have dunk tanks those contraptions where you throw a softball and the local police chief plops in the water as long as the water is reused but requests to allow charity car washes have been denied , leading one to theorize that if you have a waterguzzling fundraiser in mind , it better be good for a guffaw of course , none of these drought rules have any real effect on water use in the state , as anyone with a teenage daughter knows dutiful citizen that i am , i have been known to bang on the bathroom door while a certain person is showering and shout , there s a drought ! to which the only known teenage response is , i hate you ! still , my hat is off to all those good souls who are emptying their dehumidifiers , collecting their bath water and buying expensive rain buckets from smith hawken to protect the groundwater in the southern part of the state my uncle irving , an avid belleville gardener , had the most elegant solution of all on my tomatoes , he said , i put strictly club soda drawing \( nancy doniger \)
tomorrow was supposed to be a shining moment for gay men and lesbians in the state for the first time since a gay rights bill first surfaced in albany 31 years ago , the state senate plans to bring the measure to a vote , and the bill stands a chance of passing matt foreman , the executive director of the empire state pride agenda , called the longawaited event simply extraordinary for our community but at the 11th hour , dissent over the bill has caused some to question exactly who mr foreman means when he says our community the bill , which forbids discrimination in employment , housing , credit and public accommodations based on sexual orientation , and which has consistently been opposed by rightwing groups like the conservative party , is now under siege by those who feel that it does not go far enough because it does not explicitly protect transgendered people those critics blame the pride agenda , the statewide lobbying group that has made passing the bill its top priority , for what they see as an inexcusable omission by failing to work to amend the bill , they say , the pride agenda is marginalizing transgendered people just as society at large has marginalized homosexuals in response , transgender groups have picketed the pride agenda s manhattan office , and the dispute has led to open warfare between the pride agenda and state senator thomas k duane , the state s highest ranking openly gay politician this is one of the most divisive things i 've seen in my 30 years in the movement , said allen roskoff , who worked for mayor david n dinkins s human rights commission and as a liaison to gay men , lesbians and transgendered people for mark green when mr green was the public advocate there s an entire segment of the community that really feels that what espa is doing is really shameful they have collected millions of dollars from within the community if they 're going to maintain that they are a civil rights organization , they 're going to have to do more than pass a bareessence bill that is 31 years overdue housing works , a major service provider for people with aids , is running radio commercials in albany urging an amendment to the bill , which senator duane has vowed to introduce , and plans to send busloads of protesters to albany tomorrow from new york city groups like the new york transgender coalition and the metropolitan gender network , a transgender political club , have gone so far as to say that the bill , the sexual orientation nondiscrimination act , or sonda , should not be passed without barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression as well but some said they were torn i 've been thinking about this over and over for weeks , said diana montford , a maletofemale transsexual who is active in the democratic party and is the host of a political talk show on a cable access channel is half a loaf better than none \? you see , i'm afraid that if it passes , they 'll forget about us mr foreman takes a pragmatic view , saying his organization has done the nearimpossible by steering a gay rights bill any gay rights bill to the floor of the conservative senate no one s denying that transgendered people need protection we 're certainly not , he said we 're a political advocacy group for us this is n't a morality play this is about winning rights for people as quickly as we can but , he said , it was too late to change the bill , largely because senator joseph l bruno , the majority leader , had committed only to allow the existing version of the bill to go to the floor , and has suggested that even that is a onetime offer the assembly has repeatedly approved the bill in its current form if the senate passes sonda tomorrow , gov george e pataki has said he will sign it into law the notion that you just suddenly and quickly and easily insert a whole new protected category , and that the state senate that has clearly been reluctant to act on this would just accept it blindly , is beyond na ve , mr foreman said but others who have lobbied on the issue say that many lawmakers are surprised to learn that the bill does not cover the transgendered and some argue that anything short of inclusion is unacceptable in an angry letter dated dec 10 , mr duane accused the pride agenda of a string of missteps that led to a failure to include transgendered people and complained that he had been excluded from lobbying meetings with mr bruno this sends a horrible message to new yorkers and is personally offensive to me , particularly since senator bruno expressed openness to transgender inclusion when i last spoke with him , mr duane wrote but sonda s supporters see mr duane s stance as jeopardizing the gay rights bill in recent weeks , he has refused to say whether he would vote for a bill that did not include the transgendered , and he enlisted the new senate minority leader , david a paterson , in his cause mr duane broke his silence only last friday , when he acknowledged that his refusal to commit had been a bargaining tactic that would enable him to pressure the senate to include transgendered people , and that he would vote for the bill regardless he said that the pride agenda was aware of his support , but that it had still waged a campaign against him a charge mr foreman denies
washington has the nailbiter election become a way of life \? with control of the house of representatives and the senate up for grabs and a serious chance of a tie in both , it seems that it has what people forget their view obscured , perhaps , by the ultraclose 2000 presidential election and the most balanced congress in 70 years is that this dynamic is exceedingly rare in american politics except for brief periods of transition in the late 1890 s and just after world war ii , one party or another has tended to dominate the electoral scene , winning congressional control \( and usually the white house \) in most elections the majority dominance worked in cycles , shifting roughly every 40 years , after a dramatic event like a depression or a major war in the most recent cycle , democrats had a hammerlock on congress for the 40 years from 1954 to 1994 , winning every election in the house and 13 straight in the senate before a sixyear lapse with the election of ronald reagan we could be in the midst of another brief transition but it does n't look that way what the 2000 election signaled , and the 2002 elections will probably reinforce , is that we are in an age of parity , perhaps unique in american history and likely to be with us for some time to come at all levels of american politics , democrats and republicans are dead even beyond the number of seats in congress , if one adds up all the votes cast in 2000 for the house of representatives across 435 individual districts , they are virtually even between the parties control of the machinery of state governments \? democrats control 18 states , republicans , 17 fourteen are split \( nebraska is unicameral and nonpartisan \) total number of state legislators across 50 states and 99 chambers \? an advantage of about 2 percent for democrats voters \? most polls show neareven party identification , and a tie on party preferences for congress in the next election despite terrorist attacks , a sagging economy and the possibility of a war in iraq , none of these fundamental indicators has changed a whit it is , of course , possible that a dramatic development will break the impasse at the last minute , leading to an emerging majority party but it is far more likely that the majorities in both houses will stay extremely close , leaving their control up for grabs again in 2004 given the nature of redistricting , which has narrowed the number of genuinely contestable seats in the house to less than 10 percent of the total , and of modern campaigning and fundraising , which discourage the emergence of attractive and capable challengers , there is little chance of the shift of 50 or 60 seats in the house , or 10 or 12 in the senate , that would create a new , robust and enduring majority close elections and an even balance are like manna from heaven for the press on the surface , they seem healthy for democracy who can argue with tight , tough competition \? but the age of parity has a giant downside that does n't exist when there are more certain majorities when control of congress is not an overriding issue , lawmakers can turn from an election to policy making without lifeanddeath political considerations looming over every issue and every decision bipartisan compromise can best be reached in an atmosphere free of intense partisan overtones but if control hangs in the balance , every word uttered or vote taken has larger implications politics is always part of the legislative process but in these periods of parity , political considerations and focus on the next election tend to outweigh everything else legislation is turned into a tool to put the other party on the defensive or to insulate one s own party from attack thus , democrats have tried relentlessly to make social security privatization an issue against republicans republicans have worked with equal vigor to inoculate themselves against the charge by pledging to maintain current and future benefits yet neither side has worked to craft a social security reform bill that could actually make it into law and when bipartisanship does take place , it can have dangerous consequences in the effort to outdo each other , republicans and democrats bid up prescription drug benefits to fiscally irresponsible levels whichever party comes out on top on tuesday , the failure this fall to make progress on a host of issues from pension and accounting reform to homeland security and terrorism bodes ill for the next congress , when manic concern about the next tossup congressional elections will be inflamed by the 2004 presidential contest look on tuesday night and wednesday morning for the election winners after that , look hard for legislative breakthroughs they 'll be tough to find
kinshasa , congo , april 21 the trial so far has shed no light on who was behind the murder of laurent d kabila , the former president who was gunned down last year as he sat in his white leather armchair in his marble palace office the gunman was a young bodyguard , who himself was shot dead on the spot that much is known but who gave him the orders \? why was he executed immediately \? who else in the marble palace was in on the killing that changed the course of congo s history \? these questions and many others are proving elusive a month after the government started the trial , in military court , of 135 suspects including some civilians , though mostly soldiers and their wives and girlfriends a rare look into a military trial here has revealed kafkaesque proceedings that , given the court s disorder and the congolese weakness for verbiage , might last months if not years journalists who had been given surprisingly free rein in covering the military trial in what is , after all , a dictatorship were finally barred from the court on april 22 , apparently because of the prosecutor s displeasure at the coverage avoid asking vague and useless questions , the chief judge , gen nawele mukongo , told the prosecutor and defense lawyers recently , after a morning of vague and useless questions mixed with epic digressions and ad hominem attacks we have a lot of work ahead when he was killed on jan 16 last year , mr kabila had become increasingly isolated seen as the main obstacle to the resolution of a war that had drawn in six african nations , mr kabila had even lost the favor of one of his two backers , the angolans because of his deep unpopularity here in the capital , the motives were plenty an inquiry by the government concluded that its enemies rwanda and uganda and the rebels they support had conspired in the assassination , though it offered no evidence with the political situation improving under mr kabila s successor , his son , joseph , the government would have perhaps been happy to forget about the murder but there was the nettlesome issue of the 135 suspects , most of whom had been arrested days after the assassination for more than a year , they had been imprisoned without charges some had reportedly been tortured and so the trial began on march 15 at kinshasa s central prison until then , none of the suspects knew that they had been charged with being the authors or coauthors of the assassination not surprising since they were assigned lawyers only on that day the court seemed unprepared in several other ways there were not enough white plastic lawn chairs at first , so dozens of suspects and lawyers had to stand for several hours every day eventually , enough chairs were found , and the trial settled into a predictable routine lawyers and journalists arrived each morning at the prison , where soldiers insisted , feebly , that any money had to be left with them , or begged for change to buy cigarettes or a coke prisoners dressed in blue and yellow uniforms , held for crimes unrelated to the murder , performed various functions , acting , for instance , as ushers one prisoner , who said he was an architect held for a crime he did not commit , had painted a mural in front of which sat the judges , the prosecutor and the suspects it depicts a bucolic scene of a picnic next to a pond , replete with grapes , mangos , bananas , bottles of wine and brandy , a violin and a bouquet of red roses during the proceedings , some of the women prisoners suckle their infants the audience cheers or jeers at witnesses during the noon breaks , prisoners , soldiers , lawyers and family and friends mix freely against the backdrop of the picnic sometimes cheerful congolese music comes from the loudspeakers despite the disorder , there have been some revelations on the day he was killed , mr kabila had been meeting with his economic adviser and had been scheduled to see his health minister the president had been feeling under the weather , it was revealed annoyed that there was no decent health facility here where he could be treated , he had summoned the health minister to plan the construction of a clinic , for himself the economic adviser , mile mota , testified that he had been seated in an armchair next to the president s desk when the young bodyguard , rashidi muzele , entered the office rashidi fired three times on president kabila while fleeing , mr mota testified the testimony did not differ from accounts he had given in the past but somehow it displeased the chief judge , general mukongo , who ordered him arrested and so on a recent morning , mr mota sat slumped in a chair in the courtroom , dressed in the blue and yellow garb of all prisoners , looking very grim the main point of contention has been what happened after the shooting one bodyguard said he had shot mr muzele in the leg , after which mr kabila s chief of staff , col eddy kapend , arrived and fired several shots that killed him but colonel kapend said that mr muzele was already dead and that he had emptied his bullets in anger colonel kapend , who was also mr kabila s cousin and appeared on television on the night of the killing to announce a state of emergency , is considered the government s lead suspect many suspect that he killed mr muzele to silence him on a recent afternoon , when the chief judge warned against vague and useless questions , colonel kapend was unexpectedly called to testify col charles alamba the chief prosecutor , now famous for launching into wild digressions and speeches asked colonel kapend about some phone calls he made on the day of the murder , and then , in the most theatrical of voices , said who is christine kapalanga \? that is my private life , colonel kapend said ordered to give an answer , he said she is one of the mothers of my children that means you have several wives ! the prosecutor said the audience sighed , aware perhaps that the prosecutor wanted to exploit colonel kapend s widely known fondness for women that s enough , said the chief judge , who had warned against useless questions just minutes earlier but it was too late another digression was coming we practice monogamy here we do n't recognize polygamy , said the prosecutor responsible for uncovering the truth behind the president s murder photos in kinshasa central prison , the kabila murder trial unfolds before a prisoner s mural and an affirmation of judgment by peers col eddy kapend , the president s chief of staff , is considered the lead suspect \(

newark as the formalclad guests trooped into a hotel ballroom last week for the annual fundraiser of the boys and girls clubs of newark , the glitter was dimmed somewhat by a dispute over the suspension of the charity s executive director last month some say the suspension of simone joye venning has thrown the nonprofit organization s board into turmoil , baring the delicate fault lines in the relationship between the largely white and corporateoriented board and benefactors and the largely minority staff that directs the group s programming but others , including the lawyers representing the organization s board , insist that what some perceive as turmoil is simply healthy debate they insist that race is not a factor although they will not publicly discuss the issues that led up to the suspension with pay of ms venning , who is black that suspension could become a termination when the board meets tomorrow to discuss the future of ms venning , who was brought in from a bronx nonprofit group with much fanfare barely a year ago she replaced myles farley , who spent five years at the head of the 64yearold program , which serves an estimated 4 , 000 children at three locations in newark there are no villains here , said one board member who asked not to be named it s just that when there are limited resources , people start feeding on each other race is not even what this is all about however , elizabeth mcgrady , president of the neighborhood advisory board of the broadway boys and girls club and a strong supporter of ms venning s , said many parents and minority board members disagreed there is more to this than they are telling us , and it seems that they just ca n't deal with a strong , black woman , ms mcgrady said ms venning , through her lawyer , donald f schneider , has refused to be interviewed she became the subject of an investigation by the board s executive committee more than three months ago when an administrative staff member accused her of reverse discrimination according to ms mcgrady and others on the charity s board who heard the results of the investigation , the conclusion was that she was innocent of those charges but during that inquiry , board members turned up an allegation that ms venning had transferred some 550 in a restricted budget account to an unrestricted account in violation of the group s rules even that transfer of funds , which allowed a group of children in the club to travel to westfield and participate in a table tennis tournament , was viewed by many of ms venning s supporters as benign all heads of nonprofits occasionally rob peter to pay paul , said one board member who spoke on the condition of anonymity furthermore , there was no suggestion that the money had gone for improper , personal use angelo genova , the attorney for the board and its president , thomas dillon , refused to discuss the details of any of the charges , citing the confidentiality of personnel matters he insisted that the board had followed proper procedure in all its actions richard roper , a board member for 17 years , disagrees , and two weeks ago he resigned from the board in protest he said in an interview that ms venning had been held to a higher standard than previous directors , to justify a clash of styles between her and many board members and contributors she is direct , forthright and blunt , said mr roper , a management consultant , and while she could be engaging , she could also be offputting other board members , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said ms venning had run afoul of some key contributors , prickly corporate types who were used to getting their way she had run into a subtle gender and racial discrimination that would not have resulted from similar behavior by an assertive white executive director , they said none of what the investigation found was actionable as far as we were concerned , said this board member , describing what he said were his views and those of a number of others among the 41member board simone s problem was that she was prickly , and sometimes prickly people ca n't deal with prickly people prickly , perhaps , said ms mcgrady and mr roper , but competent as well among her accomplishments in her short time as executive director , they said , was to give a face to the boys and girls club for parents of the children she had met with them , said ms mcgrady , solicited their views on priorities and programs and begun an expansion of the club s efforts to once again focus on teenagers as well as preteens the advisory board president conceded that in doing some of this , ms venning had standardized procedures and cut into the independence of the organization s three club directors some staff felt that she was too harsh and maybe yelled at them , said ms mcgrady but that s not something you deal with by suspending someone after less than a year we wanted them to set some corrective action and set some benchmarks for improvement and additional review
a 24yearold bronx man shot and killed his girlfriend yesterday and then turned his gun on himself , the police said the gunshots inside the woman s secondfloor apartment at 1231 ward avenue in the soundview section awakened the couple s 5yearold son and the woman s 16yearold cousin , who were sleeping in another room , according to the police they found the couple s bodies on the kitchen floor and called the police shortly after 10 am the police identified the woman as takisha elms , 25 , and the man as radford williams ms elms had complained about mr williams in the past according to police records , officers had been called to quell domestic disturbances on four occasions , but none of the incidents had risen to the level of a crime , and mr williams was never arrested hector pantoja , 43 , the superintendent of the building , said ms elms had lived there for about three months and mostly kept to herself , although he had seen her and her boyfriend in church mr pantoja , who lives on the ground floor , said he heard the shots about 10 am when he was in the shower he said he then heard the sound of a large object dropping on the floor and a scream when he came outside the building , the police had already arrived , he said this really shocked me , mr pantoja said she s such a nice girl , and they seemed like a nice couple maybe he was the jealous type the police said they had found a note on the kitchen table , apparently written by mr williams , indicating that he believed that ms elms had not been faithful
heading into an audition , any actress , even one with almost half a century in the business , will latch onto omens so when she came to new york to try out for oklahoma ! last year , patty duke was understandably optimistic when she saw where the audition was to be the duke building on 42nd street i said , 'oh , my god , this part is mine , ' ms duke recalled the other day in an interview in the midtown offices of the show s publicist i left there on a high but lots of good feelings were swept away the next day , sept 11 , 2001 , and then came those confusing weeks when new york s theater world tried to figure out whether and how to continue it took a long time to hear anything , ms duke said finally , i got a fax from trevor nunn exquisite compliments in the first paragraph , but the words that jumped off the page were , 'but , alas' mr nunn , the director , had chosen andrea martin over ms duke for the part of aunt eller , the musical s comically crusty matriarch nevertheless , back home in northern idaho , ms duke kept the script on her nightstand for six months finally , she tossed it a bit prematurely as it turned out recently the phone rang with the news that ms martin was leaving the cast they asked , 'would you be insulted if offered the replacement role \? ' ms duke said i said , 'i hope to be insulted like this time and time again' so it was that on dec 14 , her 56th birthday , ms duke took the stage at the gershwin theater , completing a circle more than four decades in the drawing oklahoma ! does n't give a lot of back story for aunt eller , but she comes across as tough yet funloving , someone who has seen difficult times but not lost her laugh or compassion which more or less describes ms duke professionally , she has managed the difficult trick of being revered for serious stage work , for a kitschy television show and for an even kitschier film personally , she has had to struggle throughout with manic depression the first career highlight , of course , came preposterously early , when she won wide acclaim as a 12yearold in 1959 for her portrayal of helen keller in the miracle worker with anne bancroft on broadway \( and , later , an oscar for the same role in arthur penn s 1962 film \) from 1963 to 1966 there was the patty duke show on abc , with its identical cousins and annoyingly unforgettable theme song in 1967 she turned up in valley of the dolls , a film regarded as a classic for all the wrong reasons that is , a camp classic since then much of her work has been in television movies , none of them rising to the recognition level of the early days so when she meets fans , which of her milestone moments do they focus on \? i would say there s more for helen keller they do n't remember the title , 'the miracle worker , ' they remember helen keller , she said the television show , though , is n't far behind there s a goodly amount who come up and sing the entire theme song , she said and in recent years there s another category , and that is , 'thank you for talking about your mental illness' i would say that s actually more of what i 've gotten in the last few years there are a lot of people out there suffering the reference is to her two books , call me anna \( 1987 \) and a brilliant madness \( 1992 \) , the first \( written with kenneth turan \) an autobiography that revealed the misery and instability behind her early successes , the second \( written with gloria hochman , a medical journalist \) alternately describing ms duke s battles as a manicdepressive and explaining the condition and its treatment the first book the title refers to her real name , anna marie duke shattered any illusions fans might have had that the sunny teenager of the television show was the real patty duke i equate those times with what was going on in my life , ms duke said , which was horrific she wrote of how her childhood was rigidly controlled by john and ethel ross , a couple who managed child actors she was born in new york to john and frances duke , and her early home life was unstable her father left when she was 6 , and her mother struggled with depression by age 12 she was living with the rosses full time she likened their approach to basic training in the military the idea , she wrote , was the same taking away individuality , breaking the will in order to have control the rosses , who died in the 1970 s , would not even let her watch the patty duke show , she said , because they did n't want her to get a swelled head they severely limited her social life and contact with family members , she recounted in both her books , gave her alcohol and unauthorized prescription drugs , and apparently went through most of the money she was earning she has estimated that she made half a million to a million dollars in her childhood , but at 18 found that her trust fund contained 84 , 000 as a result of her experience , she said , my antenna is always up when i walk onto any set where there are child actors she said that she had been impressed with the way the children working in oklahoma ! are being treated , with the show s managers working closely with the parents in my day , she said , it was , 'get the mother out of here , and get the kid on its mark or we 'll kill its dog' she has navigated the treacherous waters of stage parenthood herself her sons sean and mackenzie astin , from her marriage to the actor john astin , are both actors , sean appearing most recently in the two towers , the new lord of the rings movie the film a beautiful mind , about a nobel prize winner with mental illness , has brought plenty of awareness to manic depression recently , but ms duke s books were well ahead of that curve before her illness was diagnosed in 1982 , there were suicide attempts , spending sprees and other erratic behavior , all starkly described in the two volumes the portrait is so grim that ms duke thought the books might end her acting career , but she said she had a commitment to keep in the depressions , the months and months of depression , i remember making kind of halfbaked promises to god or the fates that if i could ever get out of this , i would help other people , she said when i philosophize , she added , which is n't often , i strongly feel that i thought my job here on the planet was to perform and to move people and hopefully educate them somehow , but now i think that was just a tool , a conduit , for this other work her fourth husband , a firefighter named michael pearce , whom she married in 1985 , has taken a leave of absence to , as she put it , come be my baby sitter \( along with their teenage son , kevin \) while she is in oklahoma ! lithium will also play a vital role , as she bluntly acknowledges what it does , she said , is take those chemicals that are out of whack and help to balance them , so i can certainly go from one extreme to another in emotion , but i'm not going to go spinning off into nevernever land in the days before her opening , ms duke was fretting about the dancing and singing demanded by oklahoma ! , skills she has not needed much until now perhaps , too , there is a lingering nervousness traceable to the fact that her most recent broadway appearance was not in the miracle worker , which ran for more than 700 performances at the playhouse theater , but in isle of children , which ran for fewer than a dozen at the cort in 1962 those earlier broadway days might seem like a different lifetime , but , ms duke said , the connection is much stronger than i ever realized sure , the theater district has changed , but the broadway instinct endured i 've been to new york through these 40 years , so i knew that the playhouse theater was gone , she said but i did walk down that street and this is embarrassing yes , i have stood on times square and , very quietly , said , 'i'm back' oklahoma !

it s over ! she said to her son i love you , baby mr perkins said the men did not appear in court because they wanted to get on with their lives and did not want to be featured in the news the judge s action was a once unimaginable uturn in a case that had stoked the fears about crime that were so rampant in new york in the late 1980 s the two jogger trials were racially charged , as the black and hispanic youths stood accused of gangraping a white professional woman during a series of assaults and robberies in the park few investigators doubt that some or all of the five were involved in other crimes in the park one was said to have called it a night of wilding , a term the police had never heard before justice tejada told the courtroom after careful consideration of all the papers and all the arguments made in the papers presented by all parties , and for the reasons in my written statement , the motions are granted as to all the convictions later in the day , mr morgenthau released a statement no purpose would have been served by a retrial of the defendants on any of the charges in the original indictment accordingly , judge tejada has also dismissed the indictments in their entirety at our request after the ruling , relatives of the men appeared at a news conference in the office of mr perkins except for mr santana s father , also raymond , they were all women , and formed a kind of grim sisterhood i would n't call it friendship exactly , but we have grown to know each other and to give strength to each other , said aisha salaam , yusef s sister michael warren and roger wareham , lawyers for three of the men , spoke of justice denied for so long , justice granted yesterday , and demands of reparations civil suits would come , they said they contend that the confessions were coerced by the police we must first obtain justice on behalf of these young men , on behalf of their families who have been put through a terrible ordeal , mr warren said their youth was stolen from them , was snatched away from them , they were not able to enjoy the fruits of a childhood simply because they existed behind the cold prison bars for crimes they did not commit but mr kelly rejected any sense of police misconduct the judge s ruling has neither exonerated the defendants nor found any collusion or coercion on the part of the police some family members seethed with rage at the police , the original prosecutors and the news media others said they were simply relieved that their struggle was over we won , and it ai n't because someone is doing us a favor , said mr wise s mother , deloris we won because we were innocent from day 1 the elder mr santana said that his son s conviction had broken his family apart , but now i do n't have to hide my face anyplace
the first four times that right to life party candidates ran for governor in new york , from 1978 through 1990 , they averaged 113 , 000 votes , 25 percent of the total very respectable numbers for a minor party then the slide began the party s nominees got 68 , 000 votes in 1994 , 57 , 000 in 1998 , and on nov 5 of this year , 43 , 000 , less than 1 percent of the total it was the first time in the party s history that it failed to reach the threshold of 50 , 000 votes that under new york law guarantees a party a row on the ballot in every election for the next four years failure to reach 50 , 000 votes has often been a death blow to small parties it forces them to gather signatures for each and every race they hope to enter , an extremely laborintensive and difficult process so what do the decline and possible demise of the right to life party say about abortion politics in new york state \? they fell apart because the center has shifted in this state , and it s now seen as the moderate position to be prochoice , said kelli conlin , executive director of the national abortion and reproductive rights action league of new york even people who agree with them know it s politically radioactive to be associated with them nonsense , said kenneth c diem , state chairman of the right to life party and one of its founders the support for the prolife movement is certainly still there , as big and enthusiastic as when we started , he said the truth probably lies somewhere between those two views public opinion polls show that new yorkers' attitudes on abortion have not changed much over the last two decades the great majority of new yorkers say abortion should be legal , although many of them have deep reservations about it and say it should be more restricted only about one in seven says it should not be permitted there are signs , like the declining right to life vote , that fewer abortion opponents insist on giving their votes only to the most strictly antiabortion candidates what that suggests , many people in politics say , is that antiabortion voters have largely accepted that the battle is not over the central question should abortion be legal \? but around the margins look , new york is predominantly prochoice , and we understand that , said michael long , state chairman of the conservative party there are basically no elected officials who talk about the issue from our side any more the number of abortions has decreased dramatically , so maybe that has taken some of the potency out of the issue but when you get down to issues like partialbirth abortion and parental notification and medicaid financing of abortions , he said , those are battles that still get people motivated , and that we can win if the right to life party is finished and its leaders insist it is not the conservatives would be the only remaining party with an antiabortion plank in its platform unlike right to life , the conservative party frequently endorses majorparty candidates \( like gov george e pataki \) who support abortion rights politicians have become less willing to run on the right to life line , and the party has become stricter about giving them that line assemblyman john j faso , the republican nominee for state comptroller this year , probably could have had the right to life line , as well , but he declined former attorney general dennis c vacco , also a republican , did the same in 1994 and 1998 both felt compelled to state publicly that their views on abortion had nothing to do with the jobs they were seeking , and that they would uphold even the laws they disagreed with in 1984 , 21 members of the state assembly and 4 state senators were elected with the right to life line in this year s election , 7 assembly members and no senators on the line won a dozen legislators who once ran with the right to life line no longer do in part , that is because in the last decade , the right to life party has refused to endorse any lawmaker who votes for the state budget , which includes medicaid financing for abortion some candidates have also concluded that they are better off without the party to have those words next to your name , 'right to life , ' it s a lightning rod , it can be a liability , said a suburban republican lawmaker , who spoke on the condition of anonymity you can be prolife and run and win , but not if you make it your central issue this year , voters chose three new state senators who oppose abortion john j flanagan of suffolk county , martin j golden of brooklyn , and joseph robach from the rochester area and all three replace senators who supported abortion rights i do n't think you can look at results like that and say our view is on the decline , said kathleen m gallagher , director of antiabortion activities for the new york state catholic conference , headed by cardinal edward m egan none of the three emphasized abortion , though , and none sought the right to life line mr diem argued that right to life and other small parties were hurt this year by tom golisano , the independence party candidate who attracted much of the protest vote that often goes to the smaller parties mr golisano mailed a flier to right to life voters in the days before the election , presenting himself as the candidate most opposed to abortion , a claim at odds with his usual public stance of favoring abortion rights right to life will not go away , mr diem said , even if it means filing petitions every time one of its candidates runs for office but ms conlin said her group would be there every time , looking for a chance to challenge those petitions we are absolutely committed to keeping them off the ballot , she said

caracas , venezuela , april 19 many of the national elite were gathered at the luncheon to welcome the new american ambassador here , charles shapiro , at the mansion of the media magnate gustavo cisneros the talk among the guests quickly turned to frustration with the leftist president , hugo ch vez , and ideas on how to get rid of him suddenly , cellphones began to ring , one by one family and friends of the country s most powerful businessmen and politicians were calling to report that a general strike had turned deadly as shots rang out during a huge demonstration that afternoon , april 11 , to call for mr ch vez to step down ambassador shapiro had been telling the lunch guests , many of whom were openly eager to see mr ch vez ousted , that the united states would not support a coup but events in the street moved ahead of the american envoy within hours , many of the business and media leaders at the gathering threw their support behind a military uprising , incited by the popular protest , that quickly toppled the president the united states , caught off guard , precipitously endorsed the shortlived ouster mr ch vez s 48hour fall from power was so sudden and surprising that many details have remained unclear but interviews with military and police officers and others directly involved revealed that discontented military officers had been meeting among themselves and with business leaders for almost a year to discuss ways to oust mr ch vez people involved in the discussions said military officers , some retired and some still on active duty , held meetings to discuss an alternative program of government to be put in place if mr ch vez s government were debilitated , a word understood to mean the president s removal preferably , but not only , by constitutional means they said they would pick the leader , a senior military officer recalled of discussions that were held when a first general strike against mr ch vez proved successful in december they did not want to be called a military junta , but they wanted to make sure that at least one military person was on the transitional board supporters of mr ch vez were among the gunmen who fired on the april 11 march against him , at which at least 17 people were killed , according to videotapes broadcast on television and a senior police official , iv n simonovis among them was richard penalver , a city councilman allied with a leader of the bolivarian circles , community associations set up by mr ch vez to support what he has styled his social revolution another was rafael cobrices , who has since been apprehended with a card identifying him as a member of one of mr ch vez s revolutionary movements he is said by the police to have a criminal record that includes arrests for burglary and assault leaders of the demonstration said that most of the dead were antich vez demonstrators , but they also included a member of the caracas metropolitan police and an intelligence operative from miraflores palace , the offices of mr ch vez that day , as crowds responded to the shootings by surging toward the presidential palace , the highest commanders of the armed forces disobeyed an order from mr ch vez to call out tanks and troops to repress the demonstrators however , errors by the group that seized power , and a swift move by presidential guard troops loyal to mr ch vez , rescued the president and restored him to power the killings at the antich vez demonstration rocked the country , reviving memories of the violent events in 1989 , known as the caracazo , in which hundreds were killed by government forces venezuelans across the political spectrum swore that such violence would never take place again according to witnesses , shots were fired from several buildings as well as from a bridge one block from the presidential palace , which overlooks the route of the march one of the buildings that witnesses identified as a source of gunfire contains the offices of freddy bernal , the mayor of the borough that includes downtown caracas and one of the leaders of the bolivarian circles eddie ram rez , an executive with the state oil company , was in a part of the march that came close to the presidential palace shots were fired from a building , he said i think there were people there waiting for us , and some crazy person started to shoot none of the snipers who fired from rooftops \( as opposed to the bridge \) have been identified , with proch vez forces arguing that much of the gunfire was directed at miraflores palace and that some antich vez demonstrators were also armed since mr ch vez s return to power last sunday , his followers have sought to place the blame for the killings on the metropolitan police , which reports to one of his main political adversaries , alfredo pe a , the mayor of caracas however , after an independent investigation , the country s two main human rights groups concluded that the shootings took place to minimize the action of the opposition with the acquiescence of organisms of the state
sometime today in washington , mike jarvis hopes to hold his first grandchild tomorrow , marcus hatten will attend his grandmother s funeral , and on friday , st john s will play wisconsin for jarvis , the st john s coach , and his wife , connie , this is a warm homecoming to a city where they spent eight years while he coached at george washington their daughter , dana shaiyen , was in labor yesterday at a washingtonarea hospital for hatten , st john s star guard , this is a chance to say goodbye to letha berry , who helped raise him , and be embraced by the more than 25 family members and friends who will drive to the mci center from his hometown , baltimore , to see him play in the first round of the ncaa tournament berry was 91 for the red storm , the game is a reward for a group of overachievers , an opportunity to extend the season for who knows how many days along with hatten and his teammates , jarvis says the red storm will approach this emotional weekend the same way it took on a 31game schedule headon and together hatten went to baltimore last weekend to be with his family , missing the announcement on sunday that the team he had carried to a 2011 record had made the tournament he returned to the team yesterday but was initially kept out of practice by jarvis to work through his grief and decide what he wanted to do there s always going to be that feeling that you lost someone in your family there s just a big hole in me right now , said hatten , a junior i ca n't throw away what we did in the season i do n't think she would have wanted that anyway he practiced yesterday , buoyed by his teammates' support and comforted by the fact that he would see his paternal grandmother , louise hatten , another powerful influence in his life she is also experiencing health problems but intends to see him play for the first time since he was in 10th grade donald emanuel says hatten knows his teammates are there for him as well we 're going to lift him up like he s lifted us all year , said emanuel , a senior this will be jarvis s ninth trip to the ncaa tournament and his third in four years as the coach of st john s he has had far better teams in 1999 the red storm lost to ohio state , 7774 , in the south regional final but jarvis says none of his teams have worked harder and have been more gratifying to coach than this one he starts a walkon , andre stanley , and a freshman , eric king , and the team shoots horribly , 40 percent for the season the last two times we went , i knew we were going and i knew what we had three potential nba players the first time and a couple the next , jarvis said this time , we have one potential nba player , he said , referring to hatten it only works because of marcus most guys that good have an attitude , 'i'm the star , and you guys support me' not him early this season , jarvis felt hatten was not shooting enough in an attempt to fit in jarvis corrected that on another occasion , hatten came to jarvis and asked him why he did not kick him out of practice after poor efforts a tactic that hatten s coach at tallahassee community college in florida had used the previous two years last friday , the morning after notre dame eliminated st john s from the big east tournament , hatten showed up in jarvis s office depressed because he did not take the red storm beyond the quarterfinals he was disappointed in his own performance jarvis told hatten that without his 199point scoring average and leadership , the red storm would not have won 20 games we would n't be talking about the tournament , jarvis said yesterday he did n't do it alone , but he carried the load in the badgers \( 1812 \) , st john s meets another defensiveminded team that clawed its way into the tournament by winning its last six regularseason games to earn a share of the big ten title we 're not mirror images because they can shoot , jarvis said they come off a screen and knock down a shot we come off a screen and look for an offensive rebound but wisconsin coach bo ryan said that description did not apply to hatten ryan complimented hatten s quick hands , quick feet and passing ability before stating the badgers' game plan for shutting down st john s you try to stop him from getting his shot , ryan said yesterday by telephone but you say contain because it s difficult to stop him jarvis , who talks often about his spiritual beliefs , is convinced that a higher power had a hand in sending the red storm to washington for the birth of a grandchild , the funeral of a grandmother and a basketball game he told hatten that winning or losing on friday is not important what matters is what hatten and his teammates have already accomplished , and what they do in life away from the court it has been written , and now we wait for the ending , jarvis said i 've tried to tell marcus how fortunate she was to live until 90 and how his grandmother did n't take care of him to be anything but

two international health and safety organizations said yesterday that they were still a long way from solving the riddle of why a potential carcinogen appears in staples like french fries , bread and potato chips , and how much of a risk , if any , its presence may pose the organizations , the world health organization and the united nations food and agriculture organization , convened an emergency meeting of scientists from around the world this week in response to separate studies conducted by the national food agencies of sweden , britain and norway all three concluded that unexpectedly high levels of acrylamide , a known carcinogen in rats , appears in certain carbohydrates after frying or baking them at high temperatures , though none of the agencies seemed to know why the findings have set off a wideranging debate about food safety , both here and abroad , offering ammunition to consumer groups calling for an overhaul of eating habits and rattling a food industry that largely depends on their staying the same as the threeday gathering came to a close , the two international organizations neither confirmed nor refuted the validity of the studies , saying only that the number of samples tested , totaling no more than a few hundred , was too small to provide any certainty on the issue even some of the most basic questions , like how acrylamide , previously known as an industrial chemical , could form in the cooking process , remained something of a mystery after reviewing all the available data , we have concluded that the new findings constitute a serious problem , dr dieter arnold , the chairman of the meeting , said in a statement but our current limited knowledge does not allow us to answer all the questions which have been asked by consumers , regulators and other interested parties among the most pressing issues raised at the meeting was whether consumers should temper their reliance on starchy foods , particularly potato chips , which had the highest concentration of acrylamide in the studies the groups had hoped to answer that question , if possible , but without more evidence they merely reiterated the standard recommendations of governments and health organizations across the globe eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables that s what we have always said , said susan ferenc , senior scientific adviser to the grocery manufacturers of america , a trade group , adding that food companies have begun conducting acrylamide tests of their own the food and drug administration announced several weeks ago that it would do the same the specter of a more stringent advisory , one that would warn consumers away from starchy foods , has been looming over the food industry ever since the swedish study was first released in april potatoes , for example , are by far america s largest vegetable crop bringing farmers roughly 27 billion in 2000 , compared with about 18 billion for lettuce or tomatoes and nearly half of the harvest in the united states ends up being fried mcdonald s alone goes through about 32 billion pounds of potatoes each year , about 7 percent of what the nation grows , almost all of which plunge into the deep fryer , according to salomon smith barney when the rest of the fastfood chains are factored in , americans consume about 600 million helpings of french fries every month as for potato chips , nearly 27 billion worth of bags were sold in supermarkets and drugstores over the last year , according to information resources , a market research firm one survey by the department of agriculture found that the average american snacker eats 33 pounds of potato chips a year , although the snack food industry insists the figure is closer to 65 pounds even if acrylamide , often used to help remove solids from drinking water , is proved to reside in starchy foods , the threat of cancer is far from certain while large doses of the chemical , are known to cause nerve damage in people , acrylamide is deemed a probable human carcinogen by the environmental protection agency because only rodents have been shown to develop tumors from exposure to it moreover , some scientists point out , there are many natural substances in food that breed tumors in rats or mice roasted coffee , for one , contains more than 1 , 000 chemicals , according to the carcinogenic potency project at the university of california of the 30 that have been tested , 21 are rodent carcinogens the many plants that people eat also contain thousands of natural pesticides , produced to repel insects and other predators seventyone of them have been tested , and 37 have been shown to cause cancer in rodents , the potency project says but while chemicals naturally abound in food , it is the amount of acrylamide people are likely to consume that the international organizations found so striking the substance itself is probably no more potent than the carcinogenic aromatic hydrocarbons formed by grilling or frying meat , the organizations said , but because starchy foods are such a prevalent part of most diets , the intake levels for acrylamide are likely to be higher in the swedish study , researchers concluded that the average daily intake of acrylamide , gleaned from french fries , biscuits , bread , breakfast cereals and other foods , comes to as much as 40 micrograms , about 80 times what the epa allows in a liter of water other sources of acrylamide , like cosmetics , drinking water and possibly even the human body itself , could bring that number up

chaska , minn , aug 17 before every round of golf , rich beem takes a swallow from a bottle of peptobismol perhaps that should be the drink of choice for sunday s conclusion of the pga championship there will be many nervous stomachs , although justin leonard emerged today as the player to beat by building a threestroke lead with a sensational thirdround 69 , the only round of the day in the 60 s at hazeltine national golf club the field averaged 7587 , the highestscoring third round in the tournament s history with the wind gusting from 20 to 35 miles an hour , the contenders were tested in conditions in which any stray shot could lead to painful consequences yet there were many sensational shots none was better than the one struck by tiger woods in the morning , when he hit a 200yard , 3iron bunker shot over trees to within 15 feet of the cup , leading to a birdie at no 18 to conclude his second round it s one of the alltime best shots i 've made , said woods , which said a lot woods ended the day five strokes off the lead , however not because he played poorly , but because leonard played so well leonard won the 1997 british open in blustery conditions , and he looked determined to win another major at age 30 leonard had three birdies and no bogeys on hazeltine s difficult back nine , providing a cushion that may be crucial during the final round leonard s birdie at the par5 15th gave him sole possession of the lead , and a brilliant shot at no 16 led to another birdie that gave him even more breathing room leonard held a threestroke lead at nineunderpar 207 , three strokes ahead of rich beem \( 72 \) , who will play with leonard in sunday s final group fred funk \( 73 \) was four strokes behind leonard at 211 , while mark calcavecchia \( 74 \) and woods \( 72 \) were tied for fourth at 212 for leonard , having the lead meant being in the best possible position , but he knows his work is not done i feel like i 've got to go out and play a great round of golf , said leonard , who had 21 oneputt greens through three rounds and no threeputts i need to get off to a good start it will hopefully eliminate some guys' chances despite winning eight majors , including 7 of the last 12 , woods has never won a major when trailing after 54 holes to win this time , woods will have to track down leonard , a native texan who grew up playing in the wind and who looked as comfortable as a man sitting on his favorite couch while acknowledging that leonard had the advantage , woods was hardly ready to concede all i have to do is play well , make putts , woods said it s really no big secret justin is a great player if you look at his r sum , he s won some pretty big tournaments on tough courses this is a tough track , he hits the ball pretty flat naturally , and it kind of suits him he s a fighter he s a beautiful putter that s one of the reasons he s on top of that board starting the third round in a fiveway tie for first with calcavecchia , beem , funk and retief goosen , leonard seized the lead with three birdies on the back nine , hitting his best shots on some of the most difficult holes at the treacherous par4 , 402yard no 16 , leonard hit a superb 1iron tee shot and a sensational approach shot that stopped 2 feet from the cup for an easy birdie putt leonard said friday that he hoped the wind would blow , because the tougher the conditions , the better his chances leonard backed up those words with splendid shotmaking and admirable composure though he has seven career victories , including the british open and the 1998 players championship , leonard made swing changes during the past year that he hoped would lead to moments like this i feel like i 've got the best chance to play the best golf of my career , said leonard , who earlier this year won the worldcom classic the reason i made changes was to play better week in and week out , and compete in major championships it took a lot for leonard to stay ahead of woods , who hit several shots that were hard to believe finishing his suspended second round this morning , woods pulled his tee shot at no 18 into a bunker , and then worked some magic the ball rested near the lip of the bunker , the wind was howling left to right , and trees about 75 feet high were about 30 yards in front of him using a 3iron from 202 yards , woods made perfect contact , lifting the ball over the trees and somehow hitting a forceful draw that held its line against the wind the ball floated onto the green and stopped 10 feet from the flag , and woods made the putt for birdie in the afternoon s third round , woods never made a bogey until the final hole , making parsaving putts like someone in a trance woods made an 8footer to save par at no 9 , a 6footer to save par at no 10 and a spectacular 35footer at no 16 to save par again , pumping his fist with authority but woods s bogey on the final hole was costly he hit a terrible tee shot to the right , into the trees after getting a free drop because the ball was lodged next to a tent , woods hit a terrific shot over the trees that landed just short of the green , but from there , woods hit his chip 10 feet past the hole and he missed the comeback putt for par other contenders made costly bogeys on the back nine beem reached the 14th tee holding a onestroke lead over leonard , but beem hit a bad drive on no 14 that led to a bogey and a bad tee shot at the par3 no 17 that led to another bogey then he made a parsaving eightfooter at no 18 calcavecchia also bogeyed no 16 , funk threeputted for bogey at no 17 , and goosen fell out of contention with a 79 but leonard was the man to beat , and he is a proven frontrunner who will be chased by woods leonard passed one test today and if he passes another one sunday , when the wind is not expected to be as severe , his second major championship will be the prize asked if a fiveshot lead over woods was safe , leonard said i 'd like to say that , but i came back from five shots to win a major so it s safe , depending upon how i play if i struggle or stumble , especially in the beginning , i think guys are going to feel they have a chance i need to play good golf photo justin leonard shot a 69 yesterday and has a threeshot lead entering today s final round of the pga championship rich beem is second and fred funk is third \( craig jones getty

tallahassee , fla , jan 11 a florida jail inmate told the authorities that there was a plot to bomb gov jeb bush today , but law enforcement officials said none of the inmate s information had been substantiated the inmate told of the plot in a letter to governor bush late last month , officials said the state department of law enforcement , the secret service and the federal bureau of investigation investigated but found no proof of the threat , tim moore , the state law enforcement commissioner , said today in a news conference here mr moore refused to give specifics on the investigation , which was first reported by the miami herald today during the investigation , two people were taken into custody on immigration violations , mr moore said the herald reported that the inmate told the authorities that at least four men with arab names were trying to get someone to drive a truckload of explosives to tallahassee to kill mr bush the newspaper said investigators had been skeptical about the threat the man had failed five polygraph tests but on thursday bombsniffing dogs detected the presence of something suspicious in a van that the inmate had told them about no explosives were found in the van , the herald reported mr bush , who said he first learned of the threat last week , went about his workday as usual , even joking about the appearance of extra television cameras at a previously scheduled news conference where he announced an administration appointment these things do n't happen regularly to governors , but sometimes they do , mr bush said there s nothing out of ordinary in this regard we have no evidence to suggest that anything is going to happen here mr bush said he not changed his daily routine , nor did he plan to limit public access to the governor s mansion , which periodically allows visitors he noted an increased number of law enforcement officers guarding him today , but he said he remained at ease i have total confidence in their abilities and do not feel threatened , mr bush said mr bush said , however , that he warned his wife , columba , and their three children on thursday night that news about the threat would soon become public he said he recalled that he had learned on television that his father , former president george bush , had a heart murmur
londonderry , northern ireland , jan 25 on jan 30 , 1972 , the day known since as bloody sunday , british paratroopers fatally shot 14 unarmed roman catholic civil rights marchers in the streets of this city now , 30 years later and just blocks from the scene , the event is being painstakingly recreated in the longest legal inquiry in british history the gothic guildhall s main chamber , with its pipe organ , stainedglass windows and flowing burgundy draperies , has been converted into a vast hightechnology courtroom there are wooden carrels and lecterns for the 60 lawyers involved three for each victim and a group for the government representing the paratroopers a presiding table for the threejudge panel , and large television screens suspended from the oakbeamed ceiling around the hall panoramic color videos , computer reconstructions , highlighted text passages , grainy blackandwhite contemporary photographs and accompanying charts and graphs are displayed as witnesses grippingly describe how they fled the gunfire , took cover behind low walls and telephone booths and saw friends die the key to determining who fired the fatal shots is the direction the rounds came from , and a recent witness tracked the trajectory with the kind of gruesome detail that regularly intrudes on the decorous formal proceedings he pointed out the spot on the computergenerated picture of a wall where he remembered having seen the embedded eyelid and lashes of a victim lying nearby who had been shot in the head the dead were participants in a march called to protest britain s policy of internment without trial the most generous interpretation of what happened when the marchers reached the boundary of the catholic bogside neighborhood as they headed downtown is that british paratroopers were whipped into a vengeful panic by overzealous commanders and ended up firing recklessly at the civilians , who scattered at the troops' approach at least five of the victims were shot in the back , and a sixth was cut down while waving a white handkerchief as he went to comfort a fallen friend a more damning view is holding dramatic sway this week because of two new featurelength films broadcast on television to mark the anniversary the films portray the soldiers deliberately killing catholics they knew to be unarmed , planting nail bombs on their bodies to justify the killings and then holding boisterous celebrations in pubs afterward bloody sunday was an event that , overnight , radicalized catholic youth , prompting largescale enlistments in the irish republican army and setting off three decades of organized sectarian violence that has cost more than 3 , 600 lives four years ago , prime minister tony blair reopened the hasty and widely disparaged investigation carried out in 1972 by the lord chief justice , lord widgery , which exonerated the heavily armed paratroopers and faulted the civilian protesters the widgery tribunal accepted without any corroborating evidence the soldiers' claims that they had been fired upon first and said that there was a strong suspicion the marchers were carrying bombs and weapons , though none were ever found and there been no accounts of any from witnesses so far for the legal teams at the reopened inquiry , the daily depictions of the fury and panic of that day are matters to record on laptops and in notebooks for the strickenlooking people in the families' gallery , who are often hearing for the first time the details of how loved ones died , they are cause for sighs , comforting gasps and sorrowful nods it s very painful , very hard to take on board , said john mckinney , 38 , whose brother gerald , a 35yearold roller skating rink operator , was a victim but as long as the truth is coming out , it can only help to heal tony docherty , 39 , a longtime campaigner for the inquiry who lost his father , patrick , then 31 , said , nobody said it would be easy , but we 're absolutely determined to get the truth out the proceedings here actually got under way in march 2000 and are not expected to end until 2004 the cost is projected to end up at more than 200 million the case has engaged some of britain s most famous lawyers , and some of them have individually made more than 1 million british conservatives have criticized the proceeding as too lengthy and expensive it is a craven act of appeasement by the government to the terrorists , and it should have been stopped long ago , nick hawkins , a tory legal affairs spokesman , said in the house of commons this month northern ireland protestant politicians have been opposed to the inquiry from the start , seeing it as another concession to catholics , who the protestants contend have benefited disproportionately from the province s continuing peace negotiations gregory campbell , a member of parliament who is the city s most prominent protestant public figure , said we have had hundreds of people slaughtered without a single inquiry , and here the nationalists are getting a second one the unionist community is absolutely outraged that they have to get this dripdrip news every day of every month for what will be four years unionists , most of them protestant , want northern ireland to remain part of the united kingdom nationalists , most of whom are catholic , want the province to become part of ireland family members gather each day in the bloody sunday center , in a former bank building across the street from the guildhall they generally express confidence in the british judge , lord saville , who is joined by judges from canada and australia , but they say the true test of whether the hearings will address their longheld hurt turns on the testimony of the soldiers lord saville has lost court actions to compel the soldiers to come here , and this week he announced that the inquiry would move to england this summer to take their testimony there i want to look in their faces and hear what they have to say , said jean hegarty , 53 , whose brother , kevin mcelhinney , then 17 , was shot dead as he tried to crawl to safety in the stairwell of an apartment building i want to

washington the nation s capital may be the single biggest political power generator on earth , but its grip on reality can seem mighty relaxed never mind the government , just look at the city so rich but so poor so monumental but so run down does anyone ever know what s really going on \? anyway , it makes sense that reality , or maybe realism , is the underlying theme of exhibitions at three of the city s major museums the biggest attraction is deceptions and illusions five centuries of trompe l'oeil painting , devoted to tricking the eye it opens on sunday at the national gallery of art it s a blast and should be a hit at the phillips collection pierre bonnard early and late revisits a modern artist who scrupulously charted the emotional verities of his own life in flickering paint finally george catlin and his indian gallery at the renwick gallery of the smithsonian american art museum with the least familiar and in some ways most fascinating material is a study in the politics of recorded history , where truth and fiction meet as a genre , trompe l'oeil art is a natural crowd pleaser , and its mechanics work like this you walk into a gallery and you see something a vase of flowers behind a curtain , a violin hanging on the wall that does n't look quite right for a splitsecond you wonder , is that real \? it s a painting , and you 're in the trompe l'oeil game , the main purpose of which is pleasurable confusion your perceptions are gently tickled you see art do a magical thing organized by a guest curator , sybille ebertschifferer , the show covers a chronological spectrum of work , from a pompeian fresco of gleaming fruit in a clear glass bowl , to a painting of gruy re cheese by magritte and despite the emphasis on painting , there is sculpture andy warhol s brillo boxes are here so are duane hanson s spooky replicas of real people the work is arranged by visual motif one section , for example , focuses on images of curtains in a portrait by titian , a church dignitary sits half obscured by a gauzy one , raising questions both about what that might mean and about how the artist managed to render sheer fabric so convincingly in paint in a little gerrit dou , on loan from the rijksmuseum in amsterdam , a painted green silk curtain is pulled aside to reveal a man leaning on a window sill smoking a pipe other curtains hang in the dark room behind him the more you look , the more layers of illusionistic space you discover , though layer 1 is now missing the painting was probably originally fitted with a real cloth curtain to protect its surface in raphaelle peale s venus rising from the sea a deception \( after the bath \) , the issue is scale at first glance we see venus , or any rate a woman a bare foot , a lifted arm concealed behind a crisp white hanging sheet as she dries her hair look again the image is really of a pocket handkerchief pinned across a painting of venus with this doubletake , a classical subject is amusingly domesticated , and we learn how slow we are to see what s right before our eyes and there are other sorts of illusions one gallery is filled entirely with bugs painted in inappropriate places who knew that this was a whole aesthetic subgenre \? and in another , particularly dynamic gallery , the people depicted behave in ways not usually associated with posing in a 17thcentury painting by bartolom esteban murillo , two women look at us enticingly or is it mockingly \? from a window one is in stitches the other seems to be suppressing a laugh as she leans on the sill , which is also the frame and in a picture by the 19thcentury spanish artist pere borrell del caso , an alarmedlooking boy climbs straight out of the picture frame as if escaping from a whole tradition of pictorial realism where is he headed \? toward the 3d wizardry of digital imaging is my guess when this picture appeared in 1874 , trompe l'oeil was hugely popular in the united states , where its images of everyday people and material things were challenging the spiritualized landscapes of an earlier time the genre s bestknown american exponent was william m harnett , a coolhanded virtuoso its most exacting practitioner was john haberle , who specialized in painting money its poet was john f peto peto had neither harnett s polish nor haberle s mimetic flair but he brought a personal touch to an art form that too often was reduced to a stunt , which you feel by the end of the show his painting for the track \( 1895 \) , with its torn racing posters , wornout horseshoe and rosecolored jockey s cap hung on a weathered wall , is an elegy to chances lost , an emblem of fleeting time passing and a hint of painterly realism s more sober , speculative side phillips collection untruth is cutting out a piece of nature and copying it so wrote the french artist pierre bonnard \( 18671947 \) his career was just revving up around the time harnett died in 1892 and trompe l'oeil held no interest for this young heir of impressionism who was developing an intensely decorative and subjective art

tim howard of the metrostars is close to signing a contract extension with major league soccer that would make him the league s highestpaid goalkeeper the league has been good to me , but nothing has been finalized and it may go down to the last minute , howard , 23 , said there s no guarantee i'm going to sign right now , my no 1 priority is to be in goal for the us in 2006 in germany howard , a native of north brunswick , nj , has one year left on his current mls contract and is looking to supplant kansas city s tony meola as the bestpaid keeper in the league meola makes about 250 , 000 , people familiar with the league s salary structure said howard has had nibbles from overseas he recently trained in the netherlands with feyenoord and has made no secret of his desire to prove himself in europe , particularly in england england fits my style it s the best league in the world , he said i'm an athletic keeper i can kick , make saves and grab crosses it sounds simple what will make it simpler for howard to play in europe is the hungarian passport he will soon carry \( his mother is from hungary \) it would make him eligible to play in any european union country without first obtaining a work permit hungary is scheduled to become an eu member in 2004 howard played in 27 matches last season for the underachieving metrostars and had a 161 goals against average playing behind a shaky defense as a young american , he has been perfect for mls an inexpensive talent who is also a good citizen the league has evolved , and now there s more of a feeling that we should be giving better salaries to our young americans and try to keep them here , trey fitzgerald , a league spokesman , said if we take care of them , they will be more inclined to stay and howard is savvy enough to know that he has to play regularly to stay in the plans of coach bruce arena for the 2006 world cup he will have stiff competition from adin brown and the incumbents , brad friedel and kasey keller wherever i go , i have to be able to play , howard said of course finances matter anyone who says differently is lying i work hard , and i believe anyone who works hard is underpaid mls major league soccer is expected to announce later this week the renewal of its loan agreement with bayer leverkusen , which will keep landon donovan in the united states for the next couple of years donovan is

science , truth , and democracy by philip kitcher 219 pp new york oxford university press 2995 philip kitcher is a distinguished philosopher of science who is well known for several books , including vaulting ambition sociobiology and the quest for human nature \( 1985 \) , the advancement of science \( 1993 \) and the lives to come the genetic revolution and human possibilities \( 1996 \) his goal in science , truth , and democracy is to equip the philosophy of science with the ethical dimension it still largely lacks we need to rebuild the great house of science so that the views of the people can guide decisions about the goals , and the financing , of research the issue is not new , but it has a new urgency and visibility as the human genome project gathers speed \( kitcher prefers to call it the genomes project , because we should not forget that it works on a bundle of dna fragments drawn from a number of distinct individuals \) kitcher s central thesis can be put in a sentence democracy should guide science in its search for truth and his principal concern is with the should with the moral constraints on science with how science should be run but before he can take this up , in the second half of the book , and make explicit policy recommendations , he has to moderate an old argument about truth and objectivity that still rumbles on inside philosophy of science , just as it does throughout the humanities on one side we find the relativists , the subjectivists , the antirealists , the postmodernists they say the strangest things they say that there is no such thing as the way the world is , considered as it is in itself ie , independent of ourselves and our concepts they say that the idea of objectivity , the idea that science aims at and sometimes attains the truth about how things are , is incoherent a foolish bauble left over from the babyhood of thought they say that all we really do , when we do science , is spin a great system of sentences , and although we like to think these sentences state how things are , we are wrong the sentences play only with one another , they do n't connect to reality , they 're not made true or false by the way the world is according to richard rorty , one of the high priests of this church , only a sentence can be relevant to the truth of another sentence so do n't appeal to the way the world is , for there is no such thing this , or something like it , is still the dominant view in vast areas of the humanities but when rorty says \( so blithely \) that only a sentence can be relevant to the truth of another sentence , a sentence like millions of human beings were murdered in the 20th century comes to mind for what makes this sentence true , and is therefore relevant to its truth , is not other sentences in a web of sentences , but the strictly nonlinguistic fact that millions of human beings were murdered in the 20th century twenty million people have died of aids the sea is salty the world trade center has been destroyed might the nonsense be less bad if it did n't build in such an astonishing contempt for the reality of human suffering \? i think it would be just as bad , but kitcher does n't get as cross as i do he is , in his own phrase , a modest realist , a gentle , ingenious debater , brilliant at taking over the fragments of good sense in the excesses of his opponents and finding mild , true uses for their slogans , thereby voiding their rhetoric he fully endorses their insistence that the practice of science is penetrated by human interests , and shaped by moral and cultural values he wholly agrees with them that scientific progress is not a rarefied , autonomous accumulation of truth , but is grounded in particular social contexts , contingent on the accidents and biases of past preoccupations , successes and failures he even coopts the chic claim that we make the world rather than confronting a world independent of us it is quite true , he says , that we profoundly transform our natural and cultural environment by our scientific discoveries and by the technologies and worldviews to which they give rise in this sense we do make our world , and have always done so all the way from stone axes to quantum computers but none of this puts in question the realist notions of truth and objectivity , or science s claim to represent the way the world is with his modest realism unassailably in place , kitcher moves on to the ethics and politics of science he quickly dispatches what he calls the theology of science with its myth of purity , according to which the pursuit of knowledge is an absolute good , to be curbed only by a ban on inhumane methods \( here he cites the wickednesses of the nazi doctors and the 193272 tuskegee syphilis experiments , in which black men in alabama were left untreated for the sake of science \) there is , as he says , no overriding right to pursue knowledge for its own sake , quite independently of the consequences still less is there a duty to do so there must be constraints on the aims and targets of scientific inquiry , and not just on its methods kitcher quotes tom lehrer s famous lines 'once the rockets are up , who cares where they come down \? that s not my department , ' says wernher von braun
anaheim , calif , oct 5 in harrowing times this season this promising season now emphatically over people would remind derek jeter of the wondrous things the yankees had accomplished some of us have , jeter would reply softly he was not being snide or selfaggrandizing , merely pointing out that this year s yankees team was different from last year s yankees team considerably so maybe jeter saw it coming down the pike , the 95 thumping by the onrushing anaheim angels , who outplayed the yankees for the third straight game and clinched the american league division series this afternoon at edison field no team has played better against us , jeter said graciously , referring to the seven fat years in which he had played shortstop and joe torre had managed and the yankees had won four world series the walloping means there will be no fifth straight pennant that would have tied the major league record but on a much more visceral level , it also means that anaheim played solid baseball and showed no trace of fear , not even of the gray road uniforms with new york across the chest we won the first game and they came back in every game , jeter said , sitting at his locker while anaheim celebrated winning its first postseason series in the 42 years of the franchise the last time the yankees were stunned like this was in 1995 , when seattle polished them off in its old domed stadium that defeat cost buck showalter his job the yankees also lost a firstround series to cleveland in 1997 , but they had not yet become the great american dynasty at the millennium yes , arizona smoked the yankees , 152 , in the sixth game of the world series last year , then edged them on a flare single off mariano rivera in the last inning of a very long season but that shock came after the yankees had staged two marvelous rallies in new york jeter smoldered after that game 7 loss and did not even want to be consoled by torre today jeter seemed weary and resigned , like a man who had seen it coming a loss is a loss , he said the season s a failure maybe these angels would have stood up to some of those other grand yankees teams of recent memory we will never know there is no way to compare because every year is different but the yankees know how to come back the reporters kept feeding jeter this substantial chunk of hope after the angels whacked the yankees late friday night jeter agreed that , in the big picture , the yankees had come back many times , most noticeably last year when they were down by two games to none in oakland last year jeter found a way to make that marvelous defensive save on a loose ball to retire jeremy giambi and turn the fortunes of the series that play came from the same inspired intellect that produced jeter s dash to an empty third base on friday night , when the angels' infielders were all deployed toward the right side jeter is the ultimate constant on this yankee team , but he played down the past exploits i keep saying that experience does n't mean anything once you start playing the yankees were drastically altered after last year s world series scott brosius and paul o'neill retired , and tino martinez and chuck knoblauch moved on that is a lot of change , even for the yankees this is a new group , jeter said friday night we 'll find out he was not indulging in footballcoach blather that every game is a test of character , if you want it badly enough , blahblahblah he was just being realistic in the longseason baseball sense no two seasons are ever the same even dynasties have subtle or major changes from one season to the next the old boston celtics won championships with bob cousy and without him the old montreal canadiens retooled the boys of summer in brooklyn shuffled third basemen and left fielders and kept on winning pennants and sometimes the minor things suddenly matter after a glorious season of personal and team accomplishments , the yankees looked distracted and insufficient against the angels their pitching stunk , too alfonso soriano butchered a potential doubleplay grounder and a high pop fly into the sun today jason giambi is no tino martinez around first base hard as it is for fans to accept , even the rich yankees were not entitled to win jeter played today with a stressed right arm and he took a hard foul off his leg , but he managed two singles to give him 101 career hits in the postseason that is the most in majorleague history , accomplished , of course , in this age of tripletier playoffs but his 500 average for this series was not enough the mounted police were waiting behind the outfield walls , just as they were when the angels squandered their big lead in the 1986 league championship series this time the horses finally served their purpose in the days to come , george steinbrenner will surely ponder a purge of this team how could the angels , with a payroll of only 77 million , be so much better than his yankees , with their payroll of 171 million based on his cable riches \? the owner will have plenty of time to ponder and purge this yankee team this very different yankee team is now history photos derek jeter , manager joe torre and other members of the yankees watching the angels celebrate yesterday \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) the yankees' jason giambi after striking out in the third inning giambi , a freeagent acquisition during the offseason , hit 357 in the series against the angels \( barton silverman the new york times \) david wells after giving up a solo home run to shawn wooten in the fifth inning \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 43 \)
republic of dreams greenwich village the american bohemia , 19101960 by ross wetzsteon 617 pp new york simon schuster 35 probably the most famous neighborhood in america , greenwich village came to symbolize the bohemian life the way paris s left bank stood for postwar existentialism for decades the village legend served as a beacon for bored adolescents who felt stifled by the constraints of smalltown america what harlem meant for many young blacks in the 1920 s and 30 s , what the beats embodied for those growing up in the 50 s , the village represented for the restless generation of 1910 to midwestern protestants , children of immigrant jews , closeted gays , clandestine readers , thwarted artists and gifted young women longing for independence , it offered a tantalizing promise of creative and sexual freedom to be found nowhere else on this continent the peak years of the village came between 1912 and 1917 , before america s entry into the european war led to a crackdown on dissent the war killed off the highspirited little magazine that best spoke for the village spirit , the masses , an exuberant collaboration of radical intellectuals like max eastman , floyd dell and john reed with talented young artists like john sloan , art young and stuart davis at the time when the armory show of 1913 brought the shock of european modernism to american art , reed , lincoln steffens and walter lippmann held court in mabel dodge s famous salon at 23 fifth avenue , where they brought in speakers like emma goldman , the notorious anarchist , and big bill haywood , the wobbly leader ross wetzsteon , a warmly admired editor of the village voice for more than three decades until his death in 1998 , is only the latest of many writers and filmmakers who have been drawn to this period because of its ferment of utopian ideas and colorful , unconventional personalities at least initially , their uninhibited sex lives and pioneering feminism were part of a larger dream of political change this was nonconformity before it became a performance , a freewheeling american radicalism before the commissars took it over where christine stansell s american moderns bohemian new york and the creation of a new century highlights the social outlook of the village radicals , particularly the birth pangs of modernity and the role of the new women , wetzsteon is drawn to the paradoxes of middleclass bohemianism , including downward mobility , selfpromotion , voluntary poverty and sexual adventure he seems to identify with the villagers' liberated relationships , which he describes in greater detail than their books or their political work but he also shows how the open marriage of couples like max eastman and ida rauh \( which did not last \) or the writers hutchins hapgood and neith boyce \( which somehow did \) worked to men s advantage while women s right to sexual fulfillment was acknowledged , wetzsteon says , liberation simply made women more available he wonders , are n't our goals of more autonomy and more intimacy fundamentally irreconcilable \? is free love the basis for female sexual emancipation or merely a way to legitimize male promiscuity \? but he also describes the exceptions , women who took control of their destinies mabel dodge abandoned the life of a wealthy expatriate in florence to preside over her village salon with a regal inscrutability later she decamped for new mexico , where she married a native american , tony luhan , and enticed d h lawrence across the ocean into a titanic contest of imperious wills wetzsteon sketches the lives of max s older sister , crystal eastman , whose lucid feminist essays have lost none of their bite more than 80 years later the indomitable anarchist emma goldman , whose sexual voracity matched her political courage margaret sanger , tireless campaigner for birth control , who , unlike other villagers , organized a movement that actually changed american life \( as margaret s support across the country increased , her stature in the village diminished she became too effective to continue as a focus of rebellion \) margaret anderson , a ponderous visionary \( i demand that life be inspired every moment \) , who edited the little review , which serialized much of joyce s banned ulysses over 23 installments and , above all , the bewitching edna st vincent millay , who was poet laureate of the village as dawn powell would become its wittiest chronicler with her erotic abandon , millay drove men wild by claiming a male sexual license , lending herself to many , possessed by none though regarded as a poet of sexual freedom , wetzsteon says , she actually celebrated spiritual independence which meant not only the freedom to love but the freedom to forsake love for a higher calling her aloofness was not sexual but emotional for sexual rapture , even ecstatic love , was a diversion from the deeper dedication of her life , the pursuit of poetry yet wetzsteon also takes her measure as a poet of love , criticizing her candor without confrontation , audacity without challenge , confession without revelation
cairo , april 6 arab foreign ministers issued a rebuke to the bush administration today , saying the 22nation arab league stood behind the palestinian leader yasir arafat as a freedom fighter whose struggle against israeli occupation is legitimate national resistance and could not be equated with terrorism the ministers welcomed the intifada , or palestinian uprising , and asserted that the continuation of israeli occupation necessitated the continuation of the resistance by courageous palestinians they offered none of the condemnations of palestinian terrorism that mr bush had been pressing them to make in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the united states on sept 11 indeed , the message from the arab world , as it crystallized here today , was that the palestinian struggle for a homeland over the last 50 years , which mr bush now says he supports in principle , did not fit the sept 11 template the oneday meeting here was held without syria and lebanon , whose governments wanted an even tougher stand jordan s minister , who was in washington on friday to deliver a message to president bush from king abdullah ii , also stayed away without them , the league s ministers issued a series of warnings directed at the united states and called on the bush administration to return to the role of the fair mediator and to reconsider its bias to the israeli side , an act that is encouraging israel to continue its aggression and its military occupation of arab lands the most urgent item on their agenda , they said , was a call for the united nations security council to reconvene to discuss the deteriorating situation in the west bank city of nablus and the jenin refugee camp as more than 100 martyrs have been killed today they used some of their harshest language in years in speaking across the gulf that has opened between them and president bush since a wave of palestinian suicide bombings set off the israeli military incursion into palestinian territories but the arab ministers emphasized that they were neither abandoning their strategic commitment to peace nor the peace initiative they extended to israel at the summit meeting in beirut , lebanon , 10 days ago the arab governments agreed that they would immediately send 55 million to put at mr arafat s disposal asked whether mr arafat could use those funds to purchase weapons , the arab league general secretary , amr moussa , avoided a direct answer and said , fiftyfive million is not even enough to buy food , how could they buy weapons \? despite their commitment to a peace strategy , the arab ministers made two decisions indicating they were considering stronger collective action they agreed to activate the office of the arab boycott for israel until israel responds to the implementation of security council resolutions demanding an israeli withdrawal from the west bank this followed a decision announced in beirut to carry out an economic boycott of israel , which has yet to materialize the most vaguely worded item agreed on today was a plan for the arab mobilization with these resolutions , the arab governments set the stage for what was expected to be a blunt set of encounters with secretary of state colin l powell , who will visit the region next week for meetings with crown prince abdullah of saudi arabia , author of the beirut peace initiative president hosni mubarak of egypt king abdullah of jordan prime minister ariel sharon of israel and , perhaps , mr arafat during their consultations , the ministers deleted any direct praise for the speech that president bush , with secretary powell standing silently at his side , delivered on thursday , in which he insisted that palestinian suicide bombers were not martyrs but murderers in assessing the speech , they simply agreed with the importance of what mr bush also stated about the need to end the israeli occupation , the need to establish a palestinian state and to stop settlement building on palestinian land palestinian leaders at the meeting asked arab foreign ministers to press secretary powell to meet mr arafat as an unambiguous signal that the united states still considered him the legitimate leader of the palestinian people mr moussa , speaking to reporters this evening , said he hoped that the americans could consider yasir arafat as the representative of the palestinians concern about mr arafat s safety continued after a tense night in which communications between mr arafat and his aides went silent for hours arab officials fear that mr arafat will be harmed or expelled from the west bank as a final act by mr sharon when he orders the withdrawal of israeli military forces a senior member of the palestinian authority , nabil shaath , said at a news briefing here that palestinian leaders had told american officials that we wo n't meet with powell and not a single palestinian would meet with him if he refused to meet with arafat and we call upon all arab leaders to take a similar position and treat powell the same way mr shaath added that secretary powell must not be received in any other arab capital if he did not meet with arafat it appeared unlikely that the palestinian demand would be met , however arab leaders , like mr mubarak and king abdullah , have welcomed president bush s decision to dispatch secretary powell to the middle east in an effort to quell the violence and restart security and political negotiations between israeli and palestinian leaders at the same time , however , both mr mubarak and king abdullah are expected to forcefully tell secretary powell that the bush administration will make a significant miscalculation if it seeks to discredit mr arafat before his people and tries to work with other political figures in the palestinian movement mr mubarak recently told an israeli television audience , listen , without arafat there will be no solution jordan s foreign minister , marwan muasher , also emphasized this point in remarks to the news media in washington friday evening secretary powell , in comments at the state department on friday , avoided using the word immediately in describing the administration s message to israeli leaders about how soon the bush administration expects the withdrawal to begin instead , he used the words as soon as possible or without delay the parsing of words over the question of how rapidly the international community wants an israeli withdrawal has fueled resentment in the arab world , where there is broad belief that the bush administration is giving mr sharon additional days to complete sweeps through the west bank in search of terrorist bases and suspects photo nabil shaath of the palestinian authority at yesterday s meeting \( agence francepresse \)
in a world brimming with bad news , here s one of the happiest trends instead of preying on people of different races , young americans are falling in love with them whites and blacks can be found strolling together as couples even at the university of mississippi , once the symbol of racial confrontation i will say that they are always given a second glance , acknowledges c j rhodes , a black student at ole miss he adds that there are still misgivings about interracial dating , particularly among black women and a formidable number of white southerners who view this racemixing as abnormal , frozen by fear to see sara beth bring home a brotha mixedrace marriages in the us now number 15 million and are roughly doubling each decade about 40 percent of asianamericans and 6 percent of blacks have married whites in recent years still more striking , one survey found that 40 percent of americans had dated someone of another race in a country where racial divisions remain deep , all this love is an enormously hopeful sign of progress in bridging barriers scientists who study the human genome say that race is mostly a bogus distinction reflecting very little genetic difference , perhaps onehundredth of 1 percent of our dna skin color differences are recent , arising over only the last 100 , 000 years or so , a twinkling of an evolutionary eye that s too short a period for substantial genetic differences to emerge , and so there is perhaps 10 times more genetic difference within a race than there is between races thus we should welcome any trend that makes a superficial issue like color less central to how we categorize each other the rise in interracial marriage reflects a revolution in attitudes as recently as 1958 a white mother in monroe , nc , called the police after her little girl kissed a black playmate on the cheek the boy , hanover thompson , 9 , was then sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempted rape \( his appeals failed , but he was released later after an outcry \) in 1963 , 59 percent of americans believed that marriage between blacks and whites should be illegal at one time or another 42 states banned intermarriage , although the supreme court finally invalidated these laws in 1967 typically , the miscegenation laws voided any interracial marriages , making the children illegitimate , and some states included penalties such as enslavement , life imprisonment and whippings my wife is chineseamerican , and our relationship would once have been felonious at every juncture from the 19th century on , the segregationists warned that granting rights to blacks would mean the start of a slippery slope , ending up with black men marrying white women the racists were prophetic they were absolutely right , notes randall kennedy , the harvard law school professor and author of a dazzling new book , interracial intimacies , to be published next month i do think interracial marriage is a good thing it s a welcome sign of thoroughgoing desegregation we talk about desegregation in the public sphere here s desegregation in the most intimate sphere these days , interracial romance can be seen on the big screen , on tv shows and in the lives of some prominent americans former defense secretary william cohen has a black wife , as does peter norton , the software guru the supreme court justice clarence thomas has a white wife i find the surge in intermarriage to be one of the most positive fronts in american race relations today , building bridges and empathy but it s still in its infancy i was excited to track down interracial couples at ole miss , thinking they would be perfect to make my point about this hopeful trend but none were willing to talk about the issue on the record even if people wanted to marry interracially , i think they 'd keep it kind of quiet , explained a minister on campus for centuries , racists warned that racial equality would lead to the mongrelization of america perhaps they were right in a sense , for we 're increasingly going to see a blurring of racial distinctions but these distinctions acquired enormous social resonance without ever having much basis in biology
in an effort to come up with drugs and vaccines to protect people against biological , chemical or nuclear attacks , the food and drug administration adopted new rules last week that will allow it to approve some medicines without requiring clinical trials to determine their efficacy in humans the agency will rely instead on animal tests and other measures to determine if the substance is likely to be effective that could leave the american public in an uncomfortable position should a devastating attack occur or be imminent , people could be betting their lives on unproven remedies , with no assurance that they will really work in humans even so , the new policy seems the best way to proceed in an age of terrorism there is simply no ethical way to conduct the clinical trials that are traditionally required to prove a drug s efficacy the problem is not that the drugs or vaccines themselves cannot be taken they can be and will be given to human volunteers in the traditional tests that are designed to demonstrate that a substance is safe for human consumption rather , the problem arises at the next step , when the effectiveness of the medicines would have to be tested by exposing human volunteers to lethal agents like smallpox , nerve gas or intense radiation in a practical sense , it would be hard to find many volunteers eager to test an experimental vaccine against , say , the ebola virus , by potentially subjecting themselves to a gruesome death should the vaccine fail but practicalities aside , the fda has concluded that it would be unethical and unsafe to conduct such trials the risks to the volunteer would be very high , and the possible benefit , in the absence of a terrorist attack , would be nonexistent the agency will rely instead on animal testing buttressed by whatever supporting data is available the agency expects that potential drugs and vaccines would be tested in more than one animal species unless there is a single species deemed especially good for predicting human effectiveness the agency s carefully drawn rules also require that the pathways by which a drug and a germ operate in the body are understood well enough that reasonable predictions can be made but none of this is foolproof as the fda acknowledges , there are countless examples of treatments with favorable effects in animals that did not prove effective in humans even consumer advocates who serve as watchdogs over the fda agree that the new rules make sense they simply urged that the rules be sparingly applied and not become a loophole to weaken the drug approval process the fda swears it will move cautiously and estimates that the new rules might be invoked only once every three years if that proves the case , the real problem might not be too many approvals , but too few new medicines to cope with terrorist attacks

albany , april 11 gov george e pataki plans to begin a sweeping program to sharpen security at new york city s area airports , going beyond some new federal restrictions by requiring criminal background checks of workers in airport shops , the governor s senior aides said today he also wants to install fingerprint scanners quickly for all airport employees and do away with simple plastic passes under mr pataki s plan , the states of new york and new jersey would also install more sophisticated cameras , motion detectors and other devices around the perimeters of the region s three major international airports kennedy , la guardia and newark gov james e mcgreevey of new jersey fully supports the plan and has pledged to use his influence in his state legislature to pass elements of it , his aides said today the improvements contemplated under the plan would put the three airports at the forefront of efforts to bolster security after the sept 11 terrorist attacks , national safety experts said the measures would go beyond those passed by congress last november in the aviation and transportation security act , which required background checks for security guards and people working on the aircraft or handling baggage but not for other vendors james k kallstrom , the state director of public security for new york state , said the proposed state laws , if enacted , would close a loophole in the federal regulations at kennedy international airport alone , there are more than 1 , 000 cashiers , restaurant employees , vendors and other workers who work inside the cavernous halls and gates beyond security checkpoints all have passes allowing them through the security checkpoints , and none have been checked for a criminal past that may be good for the bottom line of the airport , but not knowing who those people are is really a security weakness , mr kallstrom said today we have no idea who these people are the port authority of new york and new jersey , which operates the airports , will also begin installing new scanners that use sonic imaging to record the fingerprints of employees , mr kallstrom said the aim is to do away eventually with plastic passes , which could be handed off to a terrorist , and to use an employee s fingerprints instead he said the new fingerprint scanners could be in place in some places within six months of action by the two state legislatures all told , the cost of the new devices would near 100 million , mr pataki s administration said , but all of that would come from port authority bonds and other revenue it would not affect the budgets of the two states , aides to both governors said many of the new security devices can be installed without legislative approval , but lawmakers must act to give the port authority the ability to conduct investigations into the history of all workers at the airports and to allow the use of fingerprint scans for identification , mr kallstrom said governor pataki and governor mcgreevey were scheduled to unveil the plan friday morning in a joint news conference in jfk airport s terminal 4 their announcement would coincide with the appointment of a federal official , william hall , who will oversee security at kennedy the joint plan envisions the use of groundbased radar and sophisticated motion detectors to detect breakins around the airfields , as well as a new array of lowlight and infrared closedcircuit cameras to monitor intruders better the program would also provide counterterrorism training for the state and local police who , under a federal directive , are supposed to take over airport security checkpoints from the national guard by the end of may but the most important piece of the plan in the eyes of state security officials is investigating the backgrounds of people working in shops and restaurants a terrorist might not be able to smuggle explosives through a checkpoint , but a confederate at one of the shops could do so easily , state officials said even a knife used to cut meat at a restaurant might be passed on to a potential hijacker the lack of legal grounds to investigate the backgrounds of these employees , many of whom do not work for the airport , but for a contractor , has frustrated many airport managers across the country , said todd hauptli , a spokesman for the american association of airport executives so far , however , the federal regulations have left out such workers and the states have not passed laws requiring them to undergo the same scrutiny as pilots , mechanics , baggage handlers , ticket agents and other workers more directly involved with flights , he said there are a bunch of airport people who would like to be able to do background checks on virtually any employee at their facility but the authority does n't currently exist , mr hauptli said in november , congress passed legislation requiring the federal government to take over the screening of passengers from private security companies the legislation provided for a federal security director at each airport and the training of 28 , 000 screeners it also required the hiring of marshals to ride on commercial flights , the screening of all bags for bombs and fortified cockpit doors congress did call for background checks for all employees who had unfettered access to secured areas of the airport , which were defined through regulations as the tarmac , ramps , baggagehandling areas and hangars later , mr mineta made a regulation adding ticket agents and skycaps to the list of people that can be investigated by airport officials the federal law also encouraged airport operators to invest in new screening technologies to keep unauthorized intruders out , like scanners and locks that read fingerprints or retinas but the program envisioned by mr pataki and mr mcgreevey would put the three major new york area airports at the forefront of security the scanners have already been developed they use a mechanism similar to a medical sonogram to read fingerprints even through gloves or some other substance , he said a test project could begin in a matter of months , mr kallstrom said , and mr pataki s aides said that he would like to see the program go into effect within a year we are going to be deploying a fingerprint reader that we think is the state of the art , mr kallstrom said the employees are going to register you are not going to be able to pass an id to someone else and get him into the airport
for serious enthusiasts of 19thcentury municipal street crime , these are heady times indeed the longdelayed release of martin scorsese s gangs of new york , in and of itself , is a cause for celebration among aficionados of manhattanbased violence , for at long last the story of the dead rabbits , the daybreak boys , the patsy conroys and the roach guards can be told coming on the heels of the reissue of herbert asbury s magisterial gangs of new york an informal history of the underworld , and renewed interest in luc sante s splendid 1991 book , low life , mr scorsese s film , which opens friday , is sure to rekindle america s love affair with its longforgotten irishamerican street gangs and their nativist enemies even if leonardo dicaprio s casting as an irish immigrant still seems a bit capricious yet it would be a great misfortune if the narrow socioeconomic focus of the gangs of new york on irish immigrants and their vicious nativeborn nemeses obscured the important role played by other , less famous criminal enterprises , some of them from less visible ethnic groups though mr scorsese can be forgiven for concentrating on highprofile outfits with colorful names like the plug uglies , the swamp angels and the slaughter housers , history records that many other gangs played an equally important role in the evolution of gotham s underworld it is our purpose here to commemorate these forgotten criminal organizations , whose epic malfeasance now risks being eclipsed by the intense scorsesian sun of the mid19thcentury gangs that dominated the streets of new york , none wielded greater power or manifested a greater capacity for violence than the louche knickerbockers ruling the meatpacking district with an iron fist throughout the 1840 s and 1850 s , these impoverished descendants of manhattan s original dutch settlers waged vicious wars with competing gangs like the knights of the tappan zee , the naked amstels and the van eck boys ultimately swept under by the engulfing tides of irish , italian and eastern european immigration in the second half of the 19th century , the louche knickerbockers remain a vital link with new york s criminal past , and will soon be the subject of a 36part ken burns documentary , the america nobody knows , least of all me from 1820 until the dawn of the gilded age , most violent street gangs were concentrated in the poorer districts of manhattan s lower east side , because poor people are easier to kill \( poor people do n't act as surprised about the whole thing as the middle class , and are less likely to cry out , murder ! or why me \? \) but there were a number of important exceptions the flippant goths , a shadowy network of german immigrants based in yorkville , controlled the profitable schnitzel trade on the upper east side , ceaselessly warring with their counterparts in such enterprises as the gramercy park untermenschen and the kips bay kindert tenlieders to their numbers can be added such longforgotten austrianamerican gangs as the gutter anschlusses , the waltzing orchids , the sinister vermin and fritzi s deadly magpies some observers insist to this day that a praguebased network of czechoslovak street gangs may have briefly flourished in this period the myth is the subject of a forthcoming film , my big fat czech criminal enterprise however , since czechoslovakia did not actually come into being until after world war i , there is reason to believe that this project may be yet another case of cynical ethnic pandering after the civil war , as street violence became more socially acceptable in new york , the first middleclass gangs came into existence most of them were concentrated in midtown , where they preyed on wellheeled patrons of the new york public library , often killing them for their bejeweled snuffboxes it is now believed that manhattan literacy rates remained at a shockingly low level throughout this period because of the dangers inherent in visiting the public library as many as 3 , 000 book borrowers may have been murdered in 1873 alone not until chester a arthur struck a deal with tammany hall to put these bloodthirsty middleclass gangsters on the civil service rolls did the violence abate recruiting heavily in such prosperous hudson river villages as dobbs ferry , larchmont and tarrytown , these criminal enterprises used seemingly innocuous names like the varlets , the fussbudgets , the foolish scoundrels and hell s ne'erdowells yet this effete image camouflaged a sanguinary reality , for the gangs were as sadistic and dangerous as any that ever populated the streets of new york led by such psychopaths as fred \( rat face \) pettigrew and serge \( the human hail fellow well met \) dauphinpoitiers , hell s ne'erdowells etched their names in blood in the annals of new york history surprisingly legibly , in fact by and large , membership in 19thcentury street gangs was circumscribed by one s ethnic background if you were irish , you would not be welcome in a nativist gang , and if you were black , you would be ill advised to seek membership in an italian gang but as time went along , and the various ethnic groups began to blend in the melting pot , street gangs gradually loosened their membership requirements first came la chose n tre , the gallic prototype of the far more successful italian mafia , which admitted both french and belgian cutthroats , effectively ending the reign of the cruel walloons , who wreaked havoc in manhattan s little antwerp during the 1860 s next came los hermanos de taipei , the city s first sinolatino gang , which later introduced a chain of highly successful yet inexpensive restaurants characterized by imaginative menus last but not least came the labrador kings , a onesizefitsall gang admitting anyone from the canadian maritimes who was handy with a meat cleaver by the end of the 19th century , street gangs had begun to fade into the pages of history this was partly because politics paid better than crime , and because being a policeman entitled you to a pension , but also because as immigrants adjusted to american life , they preferred to move their violence indoors where it was warmer and direct it at their families at the same time , the simultaneous rise of american football and vaudeville helped sublimate a great deal of male pathological violence over the years , as the city has become more dainty , more genteel , more prissy , it has largely forgotten or deliberately denied its savage , primordial past yet the sleeping beast is there and , if disturbed , it will one day rise from its slumber and slink into the streets , seeking fresh victims perhaps as early as this weekend maybe in queens or brooklyn auteur of one of the most mesmerizingly gruesome films in recent memory , martin scorsese is to be congratulated for reminding us all of our hideously violent roots and such a change of pace for the director drawing \( gary hovland \)

washington , feb 23 after weeks of uncertainty over the fate of osama bin laden , senior administration officials now say they have fresh indications that he survived the bombing assault on tora bora and other afghan mountain regions , and that he is probably still in the remote terrain that straddles the border between afghanistan and pakistan the administration is not claiming to have mr bin laden cornered rather , some senior administration officials say the evidence suggests that the search has bounded his whereabouts , as one put it , casting doubt on earlier theories that he had been killed in the war , died of kidney disease or fled to iran or yemen but capturing or killing mr bin laden looks like a longterm proposition , the official said and defense officials noted that none of the recent information has been specific enough to mount new attacks on suspected hideouts like the bombardment of tora bora in and november and december , and around the city of khost , about 70 miles further south , in january the administration officials said their new assessment of mr bin laden is based on information obtained within the last month , but they declined to describe it further some officials cautioned that the new evidence is far from definitive the administration now claims some success in disrupting the rest of al qaeda a senior official said that a comprehensive review of the american military action in afghanistan has concluded that , in the words of one of them , that we 've probably gotten about a third of the core leadership of the group the white house now defines the scope of that leadership as between 20 and 25 key terrorists the administration released the names of six leaders they believe are dead , four of whom have previously been reported killed the administration s contention that it is making progress in searching for mr bin laden and in dismantling al qaeda s hierarchy is politically important to president bush and his military team the elusiveness of the qaeda leader and his lieutenants has gnawed at officials and the administration has been confronted with new reports from afghanistan indicating that the military actions in areas where mr bin laden may have been living have caused scores of deaths and injuries among afghan civilians , and flattened whole villages , as well as mosques and residential compounds from the start , flawed intelligence about fugitive al qaeda leaders , especially when provided by afghan warlords working with american forces , has undercut the hunt for mr bin laden and his associates the senior administration official said the new evidence on mr bin laden was very fragile and could be jeopardized if further details were disclosed but he added we are quite certain he is alive and we think he is somewhere between afghanistan and pakistan it may be that he moves back and forth between the two other officials said the area in question was in southeastern afghanistan and adjacent tribal areas of the pakistani provinces of the northwest frontier and baluchistan that have been strongholds of islamic militancy and deeply suspicious of outside interference since the hunt for mr bin laden and other qaeda leaders began in earnest , after taliban power began collapsing across afghanistan in midnovember , american officials seemed confident that they would track him down in the 10 , 000feet mountains that run down the country s eastern frontier but that confidence evaporated when the tora bora bombing ended as recently as last month officials said they had not had a fix on his location since early december , when intelligence agents believed they heard him directing troops by radio in tora bora with so many leads in the search for mr bin laden having crumbled , the reliability of the latest information is a subject of debate among military and intelligence officials some of them warn that the information may be overly optimistic , or colored by the administration s deep desire to show progress a senior defense official had a similar view of the intelligence , but noted that gen tommy r franks , who commands the american mission in afghanistan , is operating under the assumption that mr bin laden is still in afghanistan in interviews conducted in washington and in afghanistan , a picture has emerged of a search hampered by inconclusive , and sometimes deliberately misleading , reports from afghans , many of them eager to win american favor or a piece of the 25 million reward offer for mr bin laden in many villages destroyed by bombing , survivors have said that al qaeda leaders were never there , or fled before american bombs and missiles struck american officials have countered by saying that every attack has been mounted on the basis of the best intelligence available at the time , but afghan villagers and local leaders say many attacks seem to have been carried out without any detectable american scouting on the ground , or any american probe afterward to determine who was killed
paterson , nj , jan 30 this much can be said of this bleak but battling community , hard by the passaic river , that was forged by the industrial age , ruined by its demise and is still reeling from a century of labor strife , racial tensions , high crime rates and joblessness at least there was no plague of locusts it might seem , however , that longsuffering paterson has been visited by just about every other adversity the state s thirdlargest city ushered in the last century with a devastating fire in 1902 that laid waste to more than a quarter of the buildings in the city less than four weeks later , disaster struck again when a flood washed out virtually everything else the next year , there was a tornado in july and then another flood in october and those were just the natural calamities there would be decades more of social and economic calamities to come there is a sadness here because there is so much potential and it just goes unrealized , said flavia alaya , a cultural historian at ramapo college and a paterson resident for more than 30 years and the longer its potential goes unrealized , the sadder it gets you have these almost biblical events you stop waiting for good things to happen and so it goes in paterson , the job of new jersey cities , which is entering another hundred years of waiting for good things to happen the city s first major crisis of the new century might seem to pale next to those of the one just past last week , mayor martin g barnes was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with accepting cash , vacations , home renovations and paid female companionship in exchange for granting city contracts on monday , mr barnes pleaded not guilty to the charges , which were outlined in a 40count indictment prepared by the united states attorney s office in newark the product of a twoyear investigation of a local contractor , the indictment says that mr barnes accepted thousands of dollars' worth of trips and gifts , filed false tax returns and defrauded the department of housing and urban development of 29 , 000 mr barnes , 53 , was released on 100 , 000 bail pending a hearing next month into the admissibility of tape recordings that prosecutors may use as evidence in the case if convicted , the mayor could face up to 20 years in prison the allegations against mr barnes have been the talk of this slice of northcentral new jersey , and they have also cast renewed attention on this largely anonymous town of 149 , 000 on passaic county s eastern edge paterson has long been one of the state s most impoverished communities it is new jersey s third poorest city as well as its third largest and today s blackened , punchedout , abandoned warehouses are a far cry from its turnofthecentury heyday as the silk city , when its 85 square miles were crammed with as many as 400 mills and factories today , city officials say , there are only four its history of high crime rates , brought into stark relief by the beating death of a homeless man by 13 high school students in june , fueled an exodus of businesses and residents from the city through the 1980 s and 90 s the silk city has become so unseemly that the neighboring , affluent community of west paterson has held elections three times over the past dozen years to consider changing its name to avoid any affiliation with it \( the efforts , including one in november , have all failed \) but during the past five years , the city has inched closer to the makings of a renaissance of sorts unemployment here , over 12 percent in the late 1990 s , has fallen by 5 percent since 1997 property values are up as much as 40 percent in parts of the city paterson s police force has returned to staffing levels not seen for nearly three decades and , in what could be viewed as a different kind of civic cachet , paterson has frequently been used as a location for the filming of the hbo series the sopranos but some fear that the indictment of mr barnes may slow whatever tenuous momentum the city may have gained with regard to the activities in the city , there s still a lot of buzz in the city itself , said councilman william kline , a frequent critic of the mayor s i hope that developers wo n't be discouraged by the mayor s problems , but there is great promise in paterson , and we have a vision i 'd hate to see those visions and those hopes and dreams ruined because of this bob grant , the mayor s spokesman , said that any momentum in the city would not be slowed by mr barnes s indictment fiscally the city is on a sound footing for the first time in 25 , 30 years , mr grant said as for the mayor s problems , we think he will eventually be vindicated as for the resurgence of paterson , many here are hopeful but realistic it s a city looking for itself we 're kind of meandering along , said giacomo de stefano , a native of the city and director of the paterson museum sometimes , i say to myself , 'man , what happened to paterson \?

beijing , sept 11 truelife stories of battles with drug addiction , when they do n't end in death , have a predictable arc the hero s fall into degradation , his touchandgo struggle for a cure , then redemption as a witness for the clean and sober quitting , by the young beijing director zhang yang , which is presented by sony picture classics and opens in new york on friday , does feature a fallen actor and his parents they all play themselves , reenacting the raw story of the son s nearobliteration and the parents' sacrificial devotion but there ends any similarity with convention the movie , which illuminates the subculture of excess that hit chinese artistic circles in the late 1980 s and early 90 s , spins out a painful family drama , but it does n't end with any neatly tied knots the star , jia hongsheng , had earned fame in the early 90 s in a series of grade b gangster films then his career tanked as he began smoking heroin and cocaine , withdrew into a dark bedroom with rock music and became convinced that john lennon was his real father his parents , lifelong troupe actors from northeast china , retired early to move in with their son in a desperate , unwelcome effort to rescue him as the film closes , mr jia is released from the psychiatric hospital where his despairing parents finally had him committed for safety and evaluation the doctors apparently cleared him of psychosis , but in the movie , as he did in life , he leaves the hospital still defending his hallucinatory encounters with dragons it s not apparent whether he will become more functional or even whether he has really forsworn drugs mr zhang , 35 , who directed quitting and is one of the film s two screenwriters , had known and liked mr jia when they went to drama school together in beijing he had used him in a 1992 production of the play kiss of the spider woman , which mr zhang directed soon after graduating from the beijing academy of drama the director is best known abroad for his 1999 film shower , a lyrical study of passing generations in beijing that won prizes at several international festivals he said he had noticed mr jia s disappearance from the scene several years ago , then inquired and heard harrowing tales from his parents as quitting acknowledges , it was on the spider woman theater set that mr jia first sampled marijuana , introduced to it , in fact , by the man who is now art director of quitting already known as unpredictable and overly introspective , mr jia immediately revealed himself as the guy who ca n't stop at one or two joints but instead smokes 20 a day and graduates to every other substance at hand the director , in an interview on monday in one of beijing s proliferating starbucks , said he did not believe that guilt about that freewheeling theater set motivated him to explore mr jia s story , because the actor would certainly have discovered drugs in any case he said he was drawn by the chance to portray the turbulence his generation faced , mostly in secret , as rock 'n' roll and libertinism invaded china s awakening urban youth he is also clearly fascinated , if sometimes bewildered , by his oddball friend there s something lovely about people like jia hongsheng , he said he s very pure and real he 'll ask himself about the meaning of life in a way that most people do n't after they start working , mr zhang added i think the drugs are part of that questioning of himself not surprisingly , mr zhang said that as a student , he was deeply influenced by the films of bergman and antonioni as for mr jia , in an early scene in quitting , he tells the camera that the film will be a good chance for me to think about my life he says this in one of several spotlighted , solo monologues by the main characters , reflecting on their roles these short takes , along with occasional distant shots of the stage set , are interspersed among conventional dramatic scenes , reminding the viewer that this is no ordinary film or story to the disappointment of his friends , mr jia did not , after mustering the wherewithal to act in this feature film , fully emerge from his shell true to character , mr jia refused to leave his home to be interviewed on monday but agreed to a meeting with this reporter and mr zhang in his modest apartment north of beijing that the actor bought with his pay for quitting and where he still spends much of his time in moody seclusion \( after several tormented years together , mr jia and his parents both agreed it was an excellent idea for them to live apart \) mr jia , who is now in his mid30 s , emerged into a sunny yard , dressed in the same allblack clothing he wore in qutting , his hair in a long pony tail , his pale face sporting a wispy goatee and an endless chain of cigarettes he said he really liked making the film and felt no embarrassment about exposing himself in the movie there is something pure , he said , echoing a word mr zhang had used i hope everyone can keep some purity in themselves and connect to god actually , he has seen god , he said a whitish , transparent man and the image lingers in my mind if anything , the movie scenes are n't shocking enough , he said during a jumpy and restless conversation i used to cry , but i could n't make myself cry in the film i used to get high , lie in the grass and listen to 'yesterday' all day the beatles were like food to me the film s chinese title is , in fact , yesterday , but the producer , peter loehr , said he and sony had decided that american audiences could use a stronger clue to the subject matter the music of the beatles is colored dark yellow , which is smooth and good , mr jia said , in one of a stream of unconventional pronouncements current chinese rock has too many colors in it , which is not good for your health he has done only sporadic acting since quitting was released in china last year to critical praise and the normally modest boxoffice return , and he still lives almost hand to mouth i think it s not necessary , mr jia said of the notion of pursuing new roles and i'm too tired he said he rather enjoyed his three months in the psychiatric hospital but that it was stupid for my parents to send me there , and he said that the medications he took for another six months did not seem to have any effect and that he currently takes none refusing to sound repentant or cured , mr jia is coy about other recent consumption habits drugs are not a problem for me anymore , whether i take them or not , he insisted mr loehr is an american who made a mark in beijing over the last several years producing several successful chinese movies , including both of mr zhang s earlier films quitting was made on a chinesestyle budget of under 500 , 000 , he said mr loehr has left his former beijing perch , imar productions , to form ming productions , with offices in los angeles , beijing , tokyo and hong kong now able to raise larger sums , he said , he can take advantage of more advanced film technologies that are often not yet available in china , including advanced special effects and postproduction work but he said he expected to keep a strong presence in china , which he describes as a fount of wonderful untold stories as well as a lowcost place to make movies photos jia hongsheng , center , as himself in a psychiatric hospital in the film

jerusalem , june 10 even as israeli and american officials speak of edging yasir arafat aside , the palestinian leader has tightened his hold on power , some of israel s senior security officers have concluded mr arafat is strong enough that he is unlikely to be replaced by new leadership even if israel banished him , a senior israeli security official said today ariel sharon , israel s prime minister , has advocated that step even if he s in exile , his influence from there would be strong enough to prevent any grass from growing up , the official said he described other potential leaders as scared to death of standing up to mr arafat paradoxically , mr arafat s position appears to have been bolstered by israel s recent military actions in the west bank though he was weakened by the israeli raids , potential replacements were weakened even more as their own reputations suffered and their internal alliances snapped relatively , he became a little stronger , the official said he has such power that no other palestinian even comes close to it mr sharon s government declared in december that mr arafat had made himself irrelevant but he was once again the inescapable subject today as president bush met for the sixth time with mr sharon mr bush has never met with mr arafat mr bush criticized mr arafat s leadership and dismissed his reforms in ramallah , where israeli infantry once again surrounded mr arafat s humbled compound tonight , palestinian officials responded with consternation tinged by bafflement nothing encouraging is coming out of washington , nabil aburdeineh , a close aide to mr arafat , said by telephone from the compound the israelis are confused , the americans are absent as always , and the region is in terrible shape some palestinians are also impatient with mr arafat s reforms on sunday mr arafat announced he would reduce the number of palestinian ministers from 31 to 21 hatem abdul qader , a member of the palestinian legislative council from mr arafat s fatah movement , predicted that the new government would not receive the support of the council he said most of his colleagues had hoped to see mr arafat create a prime minister with some executive powers this way , we can make the prime minister or the head of this government accountable , he said it is difficult to make president arafat accountable in setting up the palestinian authority , which has limited power to govern palestinians under the oslo accords , mr arafat created a system of overlapping , jostling security agencies , whose leaders all report to him some of the security chiefs have built their own power bases but none have a constituency like mr arafat s because the major agencies are split between the west bank and gaza strip on the other hand , none of the political leaders under mr arafat have direct authority over armed men outside the security services there is yet another , more chaotic force , the tanzim , a word that means simply organization this is the fatah militia , which israel calls a terrorist organization under mr arafat s control mr arafat is planning to consolidate security agencies he has appointed an overall leader for those agencies , maj gen ahmed razak yehiyeh , a longtime ally of mr arafat s with no independent power base to israeli intelligence , the reform fits a familiar pattern for mr arafat , of preventing any clear successor or challenger from emerging by dividing power below his level the most significant recent result of this method is the split between jibril rajoub , the chief of preventive security in the west bank , and muhammad dahlan , who resigned recently as mr rajoub s counterpart in gaza mr dahlan is angling for a job as a senior political adviser to mr arafat , which might broaden his exposure but would also leave him as dependent as ever on mr arafat s favor mr rajoub s fate in the reorganization remains unclear both men have independent sources of revenue israeli officials say that mr rajoub s comes from a casino , now closed , in jericho and from gasoline supplies , and mr dahlan s from fees some palestinians call it extortion levied on supplies imported into the gaza strip from the restricted crossings with israel each man , in his territory , has built up a large security force , receiving paychecks from him and returning their loyalty but mr rajoub s popularity dwindled after israel attacked his security compound in april and seized some palestinian prisoners held there mr dahlan tried in the last year to expand his influence into the west bank but that effort failed , only rupturing his relationship with mr rajoub the split suited mr arafat s purposes , the israeli official said together , they represent a strong alternative at the political level to the palestinian authority , he said they know it , and chairman arafat knows it , and that s why chairman arafat is not in any hurry to renew the relationship between them iran

luxembourg , july 6 lance armstrong opened the defense of his tour de france title today with a show of force that none of his rivals could misunderstand he won the short but difficult prologue in luxembourg and donned the leader s yellow jersey once again starting last in the field of 189 riders and wearing no 1 the sole carryover perk from his third successive victory last year the 30yearold armstrong was his usual dominant self in a race against the clock he has won the prologue twice in the last four years , the first time in 1999 , when he began his comeback from cancer , and has never lost a long time trial since then it s special , the tour de france , he said in unexpectedly fluent french afterward i love the tour de france despite victories in his last two multiday races before the tour , armstrong , the leader of the united states postal service team , had not won a time trial this year and some rivals thought he might continue that string today over the 7kilometer \( 43mile \) circuit through the city but with sweat pouring from his face at the finish , he was clocked in 9 minutes 8 seconds , a speed of 459 kilometers an hour \( 28 miles an hour \) that was two seconds faster than laurent jalabert , a frenchman with the csc team from denmark , and three seconds faster than raimondas rumsas , a lithuanian with lampre of italy santiago botero , a colombian with kelme of spain , was fourth and david millar , a scot with cofidis of france , fifth armstrong said the team would discuss over dinner whether it planned to defend his leader s jersey by racing at the front of the pack and chasing down opposing breakaways once the threeweek race takes to the longer road sunday we probably wo n't defend it , he said we 'll probably wait for the mountains , which begin july 18 by yielding the leadership , postal service would save itself a lot of early and tiring work later , looking relaxed and making jokes , he said that as he watched the results of some rivals , who left one minute apart , he thought 'i wo n't kill myself , i wo n't take any risks' but when i got on the course , it was dry and i felt incredibly good i'm happier than you think one reason , he explained , was that his wife and three children are with him here his son luke , 3 in october , handed his father a water bottle during the warmup period luke is a little wilder than he was a year ago , when he just stood there , armstrong said now he wants to play and run around that s fine my family is the most important thing in the world to me perhaps it s the reason i was so motivated today what none of the riders wanted today was rain happily , although it rained overnight and the skies remained overcast , only the occasional sprinkle fell the only problem we 're going to have is if it rains , said brad mcgee , a 26yearold australian with the fdjeuxcom team after he inspected the prologue course on friday rain will be dangerous the cobblestone section could end the tour for some riders he was thinking of the crash in the 1995 tour prologue that left chris boardman , the english favorite in the short individual time trial , on the ground with a fractured ankle after he failed to navigate a curve made slick by rain bicycle racing is an allweather sport , rarely canceled unless heavy snow blocks the road , and rain is a dreary fact of life in a race against the clock , however , many riders will take chances in the rain that they ordinarily dodge
boston , march 12 the boston archdiocese of the roman catholic church acknowledged today that its insurance policies would not cover an estimated 100 million in settlements of lawsuits against priests accused of sexually abusing children it also said it would have to sell church property , take out loans and ask for special donations from wealthy benefactors to cover those costs kenneth hokenson , director of development for the archdiocese , made the acknowledgment today in an interview but reiterated a promise by cardinal bernard f law that none of the money for the settlements would come from a 300 million fundraising effort under way , the biggest such campaign ever by an american diocese nevertheless , the acknowledgment is the clearest indication yet that the unfolding scandal is starting to hurt the archdiocese financially late monday night , the church s lawyers reached their latest financial agreement to pay 15 million to 30 million to 86 victims of a defrocked priest , john j geoghan the lawyers for the plaintiffs said today documents released in these suits show that cardinal law and other church officials shuffled mr geoghan , 66 , from parish to parish , though they knew he had been accused of sexually abusing a number of boys over the years the amount paid to each victim will be determined by an arbitrator the boston globe has reported that the archdiocese earlier paid 15 million to settle previous lawsuits involving mr geoghan the archdiocese itself recently gave prosecutors the names of more than 80 priests accused of sexual misconduct with minors in another indication of the financial problems facing the archdiocese , mr hokenson said that the church had decided to extend the 300 million fundraising campaign by at least six months , to give church officials time to overcome rising criticism of cardinal law s handling of the scandal the criticism has come from priests and parishioners both great sensitivity and flexibility will be needed considering the difficult environment we are operating in , mr hokenson said no doubt there are parishes having difficulty raising money because of the almost daily disclosures of child sexual abuse by priests , he said but mr hokenson insisted that the 300 million campaign goal would be met he said that big contributors like peter lynch , the former mutual fund manager and vice chairman of fidelity management , who has pledged 10 million , have not wavered in their support as of last week , 16 , 000 donors had pledged 170 million , mr hokenson said so far , 50 people have canceled pledges amounting to 257 , 000 i do expect that amount to go up , mr hokenson said but it still shows people are still giving and that people who are canceling are in a very small minority the difficulties facing the church are illustrated by what has happened in the st william parish , in dorchester , a poor section of boston that has long been dominated by irish catholics , though there is now a sizable vietnamese minority i think a lot of credibility has been lost , said the rev daniel j riley , pastor of st william s both the chairman and vice chairman of the committee that was to raise money from his parish for the campaign have resigned in protest , father riley said , and donations to the campaign are running 30 percent behind schedule it is a combination of anger toward the archdiocese and the anxiety of asking people for money in this sort of climate , father riley said in explaining the resignations i personally have anxieties in asking people for money in this crisis father riley added i believe the causes for the money are good , like catholic schools but the timing is bad in light of all the recent troubles , mr hokenson said , the deadline for the campaign has now been extended from december this year to at least june 2003 we are going to be very flexible about it , mr hokenson said a spokesman for mr lynch at fidelity , vincent loporchio , said mr lynch stood by his 10 million pledge , which was intended for innercity catholic schools in boston mr loporchio said mr lynch could not be reached to comment on whether he would donate money to help pay off the lawsuits mr hokenson , the church s development officer , did not indicate what church properties would be sold he said that cardinal law had already begun a special effort to raise money to cover the settlements , receiving 25 million in pledges so far , separate from the capital campaign in the catholic church , each diocese is a separate entity , responsible for its own fundraising , budget and insurance in an emergency , one diocese may borrow from another the vatican , no matter how extensive its wealth and holdings may be , is not a source of money for its dioceses if anything , money is expected to flow in the opposite direction from diocese to vatican to support causes like overseas missions in boston , the diocese capital campaign had been divided into five phases , each consisting of a cross section of parishes these will now be spread out into seven phases , made up of fewer parishes in each , so that church officials can provide more people to help priests and others press for donations , he said the rev robert w bullock , in the our lady of sorrows parish in sharon , an affluent suburb south of boston that has completed its share of the campaign , said , there has been a lot of discussion about people taking their money back everyone , father bullock said , is worried about the money being used for purposes other than what they gave for father riley , like a number of priests , said there might be a silver lining in the scandal as terrible is this crisis is , something good might come out of it , he said it is providing an opportunity to talk about the broader issues of the church these issues include what to do to stop the decline in the number of priests , and whether or not celibacy plays a role in that decline , a greater role for women in the church and greater participation by lay catholics , father riley said mary jo bane , one of his parishioners and a professor of public policy at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university , has been leading an effort to get people to withhold money from cardinal law s campaign as one of the few ways for ordinary catholics to make our voices heard by the church hierarchy lay people need to make a statement about how the scandal has been handled , and about the culture of secrecy in the church , said professor bane , who lives in dorchester and worked in the clinton administration as an assistant secretary in the department of health and human services at this point , until there is full disclosure of how the settlements are going to be handled , and where the money is going to come from , people should not give cardinal law has said , 'do n't worry about it the insurance will cover it' that s ludicrous , professor bane said what is this , pedophile insurance \? if the archdiocese is going to sell off buildings , she said , which buildings , whose buildings \? will they be schools or churches \? and if cardinal law goes back to raise the money from rich donors , professor bane said , then they wo n't be giving as much to the campaign photos cardinal bernard f law and peter lynch , who has pledged 10 million to the boston archdiocese and stands by the pledge despite the scandal \( bill brett the boston globe \) patrick mcsorley , 27 , left , says he was molested when he was 12 by his priest , john j geoghan , who has been defrocked

critics have called the rock singer and songwriter elvis costello many things over the years clever , angry , moody , humorous sean murdock , a 34yearold fan from bergenfield , nj , would like to add one more adjective addictive when you 're really a fan , it s like crack , he said you want everything that artist has that must be music to the ears of executives at rhino records , who last week released three new editions of vintage costello cd s , each with a second disc of bonus material mr murdock said he would pay for the updated version of 1982 s imperial bedroom , the third time he will have bought the same album he had already replaced his vinyl version when rykodisc rereleased the album with 9 extra tracks in 1994 now , he will get an additional 14 songs from the vault on the new set from rhino , part of the warner music group record companies are increasingly and repeatedly releasing similar deluxe editions of albums usually sporting improved sound , extensive liner notes , and bonus songs the third cd incarnations of both david bowie s the rise fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars \( 1972 \) and the who s live at leeds \( 1970 \) recently hit stores and marvin gaye , the cars , john coltrane , bob marley and the velvet underground are among many musicians getting a second cd goround with expanded albums but with the proliferation of deluxe reissues comes a pressing question how many times can record labels seeking to bolster their bottom line entice consumers to buy the same album even with bonus songs before generating resentment \? it s infuriating to me , said tod hensley , a 33yearold from new york who has bought mr costello s my aim is true \( 1977 \) and this year s model \( 1978 \) three times each but mr hensley directs none of his anger at mr costello i just ca n't see him saying , 'okay , i'm going to screw these guys over by redoing this all over again , ' he said if he did do that i would be very disappointed but i like to chalk it up to corporate greed mr costello does not have much sympathy for mr hensley s views if people still have interest in the records , even if they have bought them before , i'm offering them the opportunity to hear them in perhaps the most complete way , mr costello said it really comes down to their bank book and how they feel about it i'm sorry if they feel that they 're being coerced , but they really are n't i mean they have free will rebuying comes with the avid fan territory , said luke pacholski , who is such a devoted follower of the who that he has paid three times for live at leeds after buying the cd version of the original sixsong album , he bought the expanded edition in 1995 , and then the twodisc set with a live rendition of the rock opera tommy issued last year he fumes a bit , though , when new greatesthits packages offer only slightly different features though the who have released 11 studio albums , the band has put out eight american bestof compilations label executives do not have a formula to calculate how many fans they can upset and still turn a profit but those questions always get asked , said alex miller , senior vice president of bmg heritage this year , mr miller has overseen reissues of lovin' spoonful albums and lou reed s transformer \( 1972 \) still , the financial risk is relatively small the cost for creating reissues is a fraction of making a new album , because the recordings were paid for long ago and ad campaigns are typically modest music labels often have to sell 50 , 000 to 100 , 000 copies of a new majorlabel album by a new artist , or a halfmillion for an established hitmaker to start making money on the latest version of transformer , bmg heritage will have to sell between just 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 copies , mr miller said the who will have to sell more than 10 , 000 copies of next year s third cd edition of who s next \( 1971 \) to recoup its costs , said andy mckaie , universal music enterprises' senior vice president for artists and repertoire still , the number is less than needed for a new album if i were a consumer it would rankle me a little bit to see yet another version of the album in stores , mr mckaie said nonetheless , universal executives will not set the list price on deluxe editions below 2998 the case of the reappearing costello discs is a matter of the singer periodically regaining control of his catalog as he took his work from columbia to ryko to rhino , each label changed the packaging and content of the albums the fans appear to have followed the doubledisc my aim is true , mr costello s first album and one of his most popular , has sold 44 , 000 copies since its rerelease in august 2001 , according to nielsen soundscan the less well known blood chocolate , released originally in 1986 , has sold 12 , 000 copies since its release in february more deluxe editions are inevitable , and not just for classic rockers indie favorites pavement recently put out a doublecd version of their 1992 album , slanted enchanted and who knows what will happen when new remastering technology is available or more vintage tapes are uncovered in company vaults or under drummers' beds bmg added just two of a possible 15 extra songs onto the rerelease of mr reed s transformer can fans look forward to yet another edition of the album \? do n't rule it out , mr miller said what s going to happen in 5 or 10 years i could n't tell you' photo record companies keep rereleasing deluxe editions of albums by artists like elvis costello , the who and david bowie the sound is usually improved and bonus tracks are added
woodstock , ny , feb 18 emma berklin , not quite 5 , had clear visions of what school would be like when she finally got there there would be desks filled with textbooks and teachers lecturing at blackboards , and she imagined it all joyfully , the way other children might dream of christmas it wo n't be quite that way , though emma s mother , eugenia berklin , is helping organize a school with no classrooms , no grades and no lecturing teachers , and emma will be there in september when the hudson valley sudbury school opens but how will i learn to read \? how will i learn to write \? she wailed as ms berklin has explained to dozens of intrigued people in this town famed for its offbeat and freethinking soul , children at sudbury schools across the country are never seated at desks and lectured they pursue whatever they feel like all day long , be it video games , woodwork or , in emma s case , barbie dolls and ballet , and that is how they learn if a student wants to cook , the theory goes , he must be able to read words and numbers to follow a recipe , and that interest will spur him to ask for instruction from an older student or a staff member , as even the teachers are called he is led entirely by his own interests sudbury educators believe there is no right way to learn , no time by which a student should have mastered a given skill if a 16yearold does not know algebra or geometry , that is fine she will learn it when the need arises it is possible to graduate from a sudbury school without ever taking notes or writing a paper nonetheless , in a 1991 study of 188 students who attended the sudbury school in massachusetts , 87 percent went on to higher education , including degree programs at schools like wesleyan , yale and columbia universities , bard college , and massachusetts institute of technology we have really been brainwashed into thinking that if kids are left to their own devices they will fail miserably , when it s exactly the opposite , said ms berklin , a drama coach and personal healer who recently visited the massachusetts school and was deeply impressed the approach puts tremendous confidence in the natural curiosity of children , and it appears to be catching on the first one , the sudbury valley school in framingham , mass , opened in 1968 , and in the last 10 years 17 more have started , bringing enrollment in sudbury schools to about 600 not all carry the sudbury name but all use the sudbury approach , and more are on the way in woodstock , nearly 100 parents , many of them artists and practitioners of holistic health , gathered recently to hear more about sudbury schools from jeff collins , who first suggested opening one here in ulster county mr collins , who is financing the hudson valley sudbury school by lending it 700 , 000 and has already purchased a large plot of land , hopes to have 50 students from 4 to 19 years old and 8 staff members , none of whom will necessarily be a trained educator , when he opens in september he said he had commitments from a dozen families willing to pay 4 , 500 a year in tuition mr collins is a software engineer , but his presentation was decidedly low tech , without overhead projectors , microphones or fancy printed material two little girls , one wearing gauzy butterfly wings , the other in a purple wizard s cape , ran through the meeting giggling their play was clearly distracting , but no one tried to quiet them the parents were learning that play is an essential component of the sudbury experience mr collins described one boy at the massachusetts school who did little more than fish for four years and in the process learned focus , concentration and , of course , a great deal about fish that s awesome , a parent in the audience said mainstream educators , however , tend to discount the sudbury approach as a bizarre experiment undertaken by hippies , something akin to the summerhill school in england , which became a metaphor for total permissiveness , said frederick calder , executive director of the new york state association of independent schools nonetheless , mr calder agreed that new york state s push for increased standardized testing and a general move toward conservatism in education had made alternative schools more attractive to many parents much of the interest in sudbury has come from middleschool children s parents who are concerned about what may be ahead public high schools where the halls are patrolled by guards , students' privacy is invaded and there seems to be a basic distrust of kids , said one of the organizers , lisa montanuscollins judy reimer , who has seen public education through the eyes of her 16yearold son , said he was so miserable and bored in public school that she was planning to enroll her 4yearold daughter at the sudbury school this fall and has joined the collinses as a founder still , even forwardthinking woodstock residents have concerns about an education initiated entirely by children i worry , will my son learn grammar \? will he learn chemistry \? said janet villanigarratt , another founding parent but then i think , i learned chemistry in public school , and it s not in my head now so what does that mean \? if there s something wyatt wants to learn at sudbury , he s going to really get it and it s going to make a lasting impression the woodstock school has several hurdles to clear not the least is getting a charter from the new york state board of regents , which will secure the school s nonprofit status this entails answering questions about the curriculum , a process that , naturally , will require some delicacy since at a sudbury school there is no curriculum in the standard sense the woodstockarea parents accepted the freeform approach , but they were not ready to abandon their children to chaos parents need to feel there is a structure of some sort , said sarah chianese , whose son , 6 , and daughter , 8 , were doing gymnastics on the meetingroom floor behind her if they felt and saw that there was some kind of structure to work within , i think people would say , 'amen , let s go' indeed , there is structure , mr collins insisted , and the students create every bit of it democracies in the purest sense , the schools have no principal , just a student who runs the weekly meeting at which the children and adults debate school matters from starting a photography club to deciding whether pocketknives will be allowed and a 5yearold s vote counts as much as an adult s parents join the voting at an annual assembly where budgets , salary scales and tuition are decided daily questions of discipline are handled by a studentrun committee , and a staff member may be cited as readily as anyone else for rudeness or other unacceptable behavior students do get expelled from sudbury schools it is not , the founders insist , a freeforall upon hearing of the woodstock parents' plan , mr calder from the independent schools association had scoffed a bit , but he softened as he considered what mr collins and the others were trying to do a little part of me admires them , people who want to go way out there and try these new things , he said it s wonderful but the problem is , is it good for the kids \? we really do n't know are they going to be grateful as adults when they look back \? photos as woodstock parents and children listened to a description of the program at the planned hudson valley sudbury school , other children pursued one of the learning modes in the sudbury system play \( photographs by stephen chernin for the new york times \)
they are either putting something in the water in the national league or taking something out of the baseballs major league home run production is down 19 percent at this stage of the season compared with a corresponding period last season , and the numbers show that national league hitters or pitchers are the major reason nl home runs are down 28 percent , while american league hitters have hit 8 percent less home runs scoring reflects a similar disparity in fact , while nl scoring is down , al scoring is up slightly moreover , the national league is averaging nearly two runs less a game \( 861 \) than it was at this time two years ago \( 1057 \) al scoring has risen to 100 runs a game from 952 major league scoring the past two years has dropped from 1072 runs a game to 960 to 925 the period in question this season and last covers the first 383 games those games were played through april 30 this year and through may 1 last year , research by the elias sports bureau shows the new , enlarged strike zone that is , the umpires' closer adherence to the strike zone as it is defined in the rule book was cited last season and has been again this year as one reason for the decrease in home runs and runs the umpires have been interchangeable the past two seasons , however , working games in both leagues thus , their calling more strikes and fewer balls should not affect one league and not the other some of the reduction in home run production in the national league is startling and it is not all the fault of barry bonds , who hit 11 home runs in san francisco s first 25 games last season and 8 in its first 26 games this season the milwaukee brewers hit 42 home runs in their first 25 games \( through may 1 \) last season but hit only 19 in their first 26 games \( through tuesday \) this season jeromy burnitz hit eight in that period for milwaukee last season and plays for the mets this season geoff jenkins hit nine home runs in april last season , only two this season tyler houston , who hit five last year , has none this year the colorado rockies slugged 41 home runs in 25 games last year and plunged to 21 in 26 games this year todd helton hit half as many home runs , four , as he did last year , eight , while larry walker whacked five this year after hitting 11 last season todd walker , todd hollandsworth and jeff cirillo each hit five for the rockies last season , but none this season walker and cirillo have a good excuse walker plays for cincinnati now and cirillo plays for seattle the pittsburgh pirates made an early dent in the nl central race by winning 12 of their first 17 games , but they have dented fewer seats beyond the outfield fences , hitting 12 home runs in 24 games , compared with 26 in 24 games a year ago aramis ramirez hit six a year ago , none this season kevin young hit four last year , two this year emil brown slugged three last year and is not around this season the los angeles dodgers are another team in the midst of a home run drought in 26 games last season they hit 34 in 26 this season they hit 18 gary sheffield went from seven home runs to atlanta shawn green hit half as many as the six he had a year ago mark grudzielanek had five home runs in the first seven games last season , but only two in the first 26 this year and last year the dodgers had the benefit of a home run by pitcher darren dreifort he is on the disabled list this season other nl teams down a significant number of home runs were st louis , 39 to 25 houston , 40 to 28 and arizona , a leagueleading 46 to a leagueleading 34 not one nl team hit more home runs in the first month of this season than it did in the first month of last season san diego hit the same number , 20 the mets were down from 26 homers in 2001 to 23 this year , each in 26 games the national league total fell from 510 to 368 \( 251 a game to 179 \) with three more games played this season the american league total slipped to 362 from 392 \( 205 a game from 218 \) in three less games , with the yankees up one homer from 33 in 2001 for the entire season last year , home runs in the major leagues fell 4 percent , but it was the al that was responsible for most of the decrease , its total dropping 7 percent , compared with 2 percent in the nl photo barry bonds of the giants hit a record 73 home runs last season this season he has eight homers , but he has not hit one since april 17 \( reuters \)
mayor michael r bloomberg warned yesterday that the city faced layoffs and fewer garbage pickups , fewer police officers and less money for its schools if , as now seems increasingly likely , the city did not get all the help he sought from the state and federal governments and city unions the city s budget deficit has grown to nearly 5 billion for the fiscal year beginning july 1 , the mayor said yesterday as he presented his executive budget plan his plan to close that gap relies in part on 13 billion in savings that would require legislation in albany or washington or concessions from city unions but with almost none of that legislation passed , and no deals with the unions to speak of , mr bloomberg released a backup plan with half a billion dollars in further service cuts the mayor said the contingency plan would be onerous it calls for eliminating fire companies from eight firehouses that currently hold two , shrinking the police department by delaying the hiring of its next class , scaling back garbage pickups , raising the fare on express buses to 4 from 3 , closing 15 more centers for the elderly , eliminating medical services in homeless shelters , eliminating some youth programs and cutting a further 115 million from the board of education many budget watchdogs have questioned the likelihood that mr bloomberg will get 13 billion from state and federal actions and union givebacks since he first outlined his original budget proposal in february but the mayor continued to hold out hope yesterday that his requests would be granted if we get the help that we 've asked for , if our projections on revenues and how efficient we can run government are correct , we will never have to implement any of these , mr bloomberg said but prudence requires us to tell people what would happen if and so when you write the story of the contingency plans being very onerous , yes they are but our expectation and our hope , and if everybody cooperates and we 're a little bit lucky , we will never get to that point it was a sober , even somber budget presentation that mr bloomberg made in city hall yesterday he used words like scary and worrisome as he gave a powerpoint presentation outlining the city s climbing expenses and falling revenues , and the effects that the recession and the world trade center attack have had on the local economy once again , he set a philosophical budgetary stance that was far different from the city council s he sternly , albeit politely , rejected the council s proposals to increase several taxes , saying that it would never get permission from the state legislature to do so , especially in an election year his pledge of no new taxes , with the exception of a higher cigarette tax , laid the battleground for negotiations with the council , which must pass a budget in june in outlining his budget plan , as he is required to do each april , mr bloomberg was speaking to several very different , but important , constituencies to the bond rating agencies , whose approval or censure can save or cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars when it borrows money , he was trying to appear fiscally responsible to albany and washington , he was painting a bleak picture of the contingency cuts that would be needed if lawmakers did not cooperate to the labor unions , from whom he is seeking 500 million in concessions , the mayor said that the choice should be clear agree to back the city s plan to stretch out its payments to the pension funds , and make concessions on fringe benefits , or face layoffs the alternatives are the contingency cuts , and the contingency cuts include layoffs , mr bloomberg said his contingency plan identifies 2 , 600 positions that would be cut , largely through attrition , and calls for 649 million more in unspecified head count cuts neither mr bloomberg nor his budget director , mark page , would say how many positions would be cut under the plan but the independent budget office , a nonpartisan city agency that monitors the budget , estimated that the city would have to cut 2 , 500 to 3 , 000 more positions to save that much if carried out , those changes would remove 5 , 100 to 5 , 600 positions from the city s work force of roughly 250 , 000 to 300 , 000 , depending on how parttime workers are counted lillian roberts , the executive director of district council 37 , the city s largest municipal union , said in a statement that the union had no comment on the mayor s plan , but would make its own proposal to him shortly to the city council , the mayor issued a warning of sorts pass a responsible , balanced budget , or face the risk that the city could be taken over by a financial control board , as it was during the fiscal crisis of 1975 when that happened , he noted , the board cut 64 , 000 jobs , including about onefifth of the work force at the police department , the fire department and the board of education his remarks drew a sharp response from the speaker of the council , gifford miller , who had been talking in recent days about negotiating a budget with the mayor yesterday , mr miller pointedly left open the possibility that the council would pass its own if we 're unable to work out differences of opinion , of course we 'll pass our own budget , he said
secaucus , nj , may 19 they call him stevie franchise because of his scintillating and productive play at point guard but today he gave houston rockets fans another reason to chant his nickname as the only player on a dais filled with representatives from 12 other teams , steve francis watched houston win the top pick in the nba draft lottery a lot of those guys looked at me like they wanted to knock the mess out of steve francis , he said with a laugh maybe this is the start of me working on my career outside of basketball at 25 , francis still has a bright future ahead of him on the court , and it is beginning to look the same way for the rockets they had an 89 percent chance of landing the no 1 pick , but made the leap all the way from fifth the chicago bulls and the golden state warriors had the best chance of finishing first , at 225 percent each but the bulls came in second , and the warriors finished third memphis fell from the third spot to receive the fourth pick , and denver dropped from fourth to fifth the rest of the order went according to form , with cleveland selecting sixth , the knicks seventh , atlanta eighth , phoenix ninth , miami 10th , washington 11th , the los angeles clippers 12th and the milwaukee bucks 13th while much has been made about yao ming , the 7foot5 chinese center whom many teams would select first , it is not clear what houston will do neither carroll dawson , the rockets' general manager , nor coach rudy tomjanovich was at the nba entertainment studios , where the lottery was held francis spoke with each by telephone moments after the lottery but received no clues as to which way the rockets would go dawson , who has scouted yao in china , is known to be impressed with him , and in a western conference full of size , yao would be a good fit yao s handlers have implied that he would prefer to play in a large city with a significant chinese population houston , the nation s fourthlargest city , is 53 percent asian , the eighthlargest percentage in the country the rockets , who have young talent at most positions , could also trade the pick for an established veteran what seems certain is that they will not take jay williams , the duke point guard who with yao is considered one of the top two players available williams would make a lot of sense for chicago , which traded away elton brand for last season s no 2 pick , the budding star tyson chandler but jerry krause , the bulls' general manager , is leaving his options open if somebody makes an offer that we ca n't refuse , we 'll certainly listen to it , krause said , referring to a trade that guy we got at no 2 last year is a pretty good player , mr chandler if we get another one like that , oh boy , i 'd be the happiest man on earth naturally , several executives were disappointed , none more than jerry west , who recently took over as president for the memphis grizzlies , and scott layden , the knicks' president and general manager west was upset that the grizzlies did not at least keep the third selection , while layden appeared to be stunned that the knicks remained seventh layden may have spent more time than any other league executive scouting yao , and now the knicks have very little chance of acquiring him layden left open the possibility of trading up for the top pick , but most league officials believe the knicks lack the desirable personnel to gain the no 1 selection while yao may be out of the question , the knicks believe the draft is deep enough to get a solid player at no 7 there are all sorts of possibilities for the knicks curtis borchardt , a 611 junior from stanford , and chris marcus , a 71 junior from western kentucky , are the top centers after yao chris wilcox of maryland and maybyner hilario of brazil are the top power forwards kansas' drew gooden , who plays both forward spots , will probably not be available at no 7
the yankees already had the best record in the american league , and on each of the last two days , a future hall of famer has returned to their pitching staff roger clemens came back wednesday , mariano rivera yesterday it seemed like we traded for them , said catcher jorge posada , who pronounced both pitchers back to normal their results confirmed it clemens lasted seven strong innings on wednesday , and rivera worked a tidy ninth in yesterday s 63 victory over the kansas city royals at yankee stadium clemens won wednesday , rivera got the save yesterday the yankees are living abundantly again we 've got two of the horses back , outfielder rondell white said we 're ready to run the yankees have actually been sprinting since late june they have played 12 series since then and have not lost any they won another yesterday from the lowly royals , who had 10 hits in seven and twothirds innings off andy pettitte but could not match the yankees' power robin ventura , raul mondesi and alfonso soriano homered for the yankees , supporting another stellar effort from pettitte \( 74 \) , who struck out just one but used his curveball effectively my stuff did n't feel real crisp , which is good for me , pettitte said i want to go out there and battle i do n't dominate a lot of games i do n't expect to it was a great game for us we played great pettitte pointed to the yankees' outfield defense white made two standout plays , sliding for a catch in the eighth and bellyflopping on the warning track for a fourthinning grab white did it in trying conditions he said the yankee stadium sun is the toughest in baseball , following an outfielder like the eyes of the mona lisa whenever white looks up , he said , the sun is staring right back at him it s just right on you , he said you look up and it s right there , even with your shades down you 've got to move to certain angles to see the ball white said he was just happy to contribute any way he could he is batting 258 and has not had an extended run of offensive success another outfielder , mondesi , may be in the middle of his first in his last 14 games , mondesi has hit 333 with 5 homers and 13 runs batted in in the second inning , with posada on second and the score tied , 11 , mondesi launched a pitch from paul byrd into the first row of seats in the third deck in left field a fan dropped it and it landed in the first deck i need to get to the weight room , mondesi said mondesi s success has been less about muscle and more about a disciplined hitting approach manager joe torre believes mondesi may be trying to make up for a low average with a barrage of homers , and that has led him to concentrate on pulling the ball when asked about mondesi yesterday , in fact , torre focused not on the homer but on a single to center in the fifth sometimes you try too hard , you do n't hit the ball hard , mondesi said now , i think about hitting the ball middleaway and staying closed with my front shoulder i feel much better now mondesi stole second after his single and was on base for soriano s threerun homer it was the 28th homer of the season for soriano , two short of joe gordon s 1940 club record for a second baseman when soriano reaches 30 homers , he will also become the first second baseman in history to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season he has 31 steals soriano came into the game with 3 hits in his last 22 atbats , and he struck out three times to go along with his homer he said he has watched video , looking for flaws in his swing , and has found none maybe he is thinking too much , he said i know i'm struggling a little now , soriano said i'm going to be ok soon rivera has been saying the same thing or at least hoping so since july 20 , when he left a game against boston with shoulder pain after six pitches he has spent most of his time since then in tampa , fla , working to get stronger , and he was sharp yesterday , needing only seven pitches to get two flyouts and a grounder torre said rivera was going to pitch the ninth inning no matter what the score was , and rivera said it was not important that he earned a save in his first appearance back i just wanted to be a part of the team , he said but pitching in a save situation made it feel like a normal day , and normal was all rivera wanted normal stuff , normal soreness , normal result if i think about it , i would n't have success , he said , referring to his shoulder injury once i threw the first pitch , everything was perfect inside pitch nick johnson said he was relieved to find out he had only a bone bruise on his left wrist after undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging test and a ct scan yesterday morning but johnson , who landed on the wrist making a diving catch on wednesday , will probably miss at least three to five games if it does n't get any better or it looks like it s going to be awhile , then we 'll disable him , joe torre said ron coomer played first base yesterday , but torre said that jason giambi , who has a sore lower back , will probably return to the field tonight when the yankees open a series at the stadium with oakland photos mariano rivera returned from a shoulder injury yesterday , retiring the three batters he faced and getting the save rondell white making one of his two fine catches \( photographs by g paul burnett the new

anthony blunt his lives by miranda carter illustrated 590 pages farrar , straus giroux 30 anthony blunt , the socalled fourth man in the cambridge spy circle , remains one of the most enigmatic figures in espionage history unlike his three associates guy burgess , donald maclean and kim philby who subordinated their lives and careers to espionage , blunt had a separate and highly distinguished career as an art historian that for several decades made him one of the most prominent movers and shakers in the british art world as the critic george steiner has pointed out , the two vocations underscored a bizarre dichotomy in blunt s character the ruthlessly honest apostle of beauty and truth was also a traitor , practiced in the black arts of lying and subterfuge the much revered teacher turned out to be a talent scout in the employ of stalin the proponent of poussin and borromini turned out to be a spy the mysteries and contradictions in blunt s life have made him a popular model for characters created by such disparate writers as louis macneice , brigid brophy , john banville and alan bennett , as well as the subject of several nonfiction books , none of them as thorough and illuminating about blunt the man as miranda carter s new biography , anthony blunt his lives unlike john costello s mask of treachery \( 1988 \) , ms carter s book does not try to use blunt s escapades as a springboard for conspiracyminded pronouncements about the state of british intelligence and unlike conspiracy of silence \( 1987 \) by barrie penrose and simon freeman , her book devotes nearly as much consideration to blunt s career as an art historian and his aesthetics as it does to his infamous work for moscow judicious , dispassionate and energetically researched , his lives situates blunt in a cultural and political context , conjuring up the worlds of bloomsbury , cambridge and wartime london with a keen eye to social detail , while sketching in the intellectual influences on blunt and his friends ms carter adroitly traces blunt s evolving aesthetics , showing how he moved from an artforart ssake stand in the 1920 s to a doctrinaire marxism in the 30 s to a resolutely apolitical and empiricist approach in his maturity and with acuity and concision she renders the ofttold story of how communism became fashionable among cambridge students in part because of the depression and the spanish civil war so why did blunt become a spy for the soviet union when many of his university friends simply flirted with marxism then drifted away or grew disillusioned \? ms carter , like earlier writers on blunt , offers an array of factors she suggests that his homosexuality and sense of being an outsider nourished a suspicion of the establishment , even as he strove to join it she suggests that his upbringing as the son of a pious vicar left him with a religionshaped hole in his heart that he filled with a commitment to marxism and she suggests that he might have seen espionage as a way of taking action in a wartorn world , a way of shrugging off his customary role as an observer in addition , ms carter sees blunt as having been temperamentally suited to the life of a spy he habitually compartmentalized he was compulsively reticent he suppressed his feelings he was wary of emotional intimacy there was a part of him which needed to have secrets eventually blunt would find satisfaction in the game of keeping his lives separate certainly there was a large element of denial , rationalization and hypocrisy in blunt s betrayal of his country ms carter suggests that he was never much interested in contemporary politics and rather na ve when it came to such matters and that his commitment , such as it was , was protected by the fact that he was au fond a fellowtraveler , a sympathizer who never joined the party , never underwent the boredom of meetings and never had to be disenchanted by the mundanity and orthodoxy of the party blunt s temporary embrace of marxist aesthetics , which led him at one point to equate artistic achievement with ideological purity , pointed up the gulf , in ms carter s words , between what he thought he should think and what his personal preferences were when blunt s soviet controllers later tried to persuade him to defect after the 1951 defections of burgess and maclean , he reportedly replied that he could n't live in the soviet union i know perfectly well how your people live , and i can assure you it would be very hard , almost unbearable , for me to do likewise it is ms carter s contention that there is no evidence that blunt was the direct cause of any deaths but she adds that he was quite willing to furnish the soviets with whatever he could find , and nothing suggests that he would have held back had he been in a position to hand over more obviously destructive material one of his soviet handlers described him as a thorough , conscientious and efficient agent by the end of world war ii , ms carter writes , blunt had grown increasingly ambivalent about espionage as his career as an art historian soared with positions at the prestigious courtauld institute of art and the warburg institute in london as well as an appointment as the surveyor of the queen s pictures blunt withdrew into his work always somewhat chilly and detached , he seemed to many friends to grow even more remote there were also bouts of illness and depression , partly attributed in retrospect to fears of exposure and perhaps guilt in 1964 the government proposed a deal with blunt , offering immunity from prosecution and confidentiality in return for his confession , but his past became public knowledge in 1979 when prime minister margaret thatcher confirmed published reports that blunt had indeed been a soviet agent larger questions about the way in which the government and british intelligence were run , and about the need for more open government , receded , ms carter writes the establishment which had been accused of covering for blunt turned on him too , leaving him the focus of outrage and largely escaping any opprobrium itself blunt was stripped of his knighthood , and many of his honorary doctorates and academic titles were withdrawn because he never spoke candidly about his espionage , because he assumed so many masks , he remains something of a mystery in this book , despite ms carter s best efforts to explicate his life still , she has created a fascinating portrait of that most anomalous of career hyphenates the art scholarspy , a portrait that should go down as one of the most informative and compelling books yet on the cambridge spies photo anthony blunt in 1979 \( reuters \)
east rutherford , nj , jan 6 if you wonder why the playoffbound green bay packers won their last three games and six of their last seven , finishing with a 124 record , look no further than the quarterback true , ahman green rushed for 101 yards in today s 3425 victory over the giants true , there were long receptions by corey bradford \( 54 yards \) and bill schroeder \( 45 yards \) and true , dorsey levens , good enough to start for most teams but now green s backup , contributed kickoff returns of 31 , 35 and 53 yards but the packers' success starts with brett favre , at 32 playing his 11th nfl season his game statistics were typical he completed 15 of 30 passes for 315 yards , 2 touchdowns and no interceptions , and was sacked only once , the record breaker by michael strahan when the game was long decided as always , favre s season statistics were impressive 314 completions in 510 attempts for 3 , 921 yards , 32 touchdowns and 15 interceptions he was sacked 22 times he s been a little more discerning with controlling the football this year , coach mike sherman said after the game we have n't thrown many interceptions versus touchdown passes i think it s his experience he s seeing the field probably as good as any quarterback when he did n't do it , he took the blame , so you have to give him credit now favre , wearing an nypd baseball cap , declined to take too much credit i'm pleased with the way i played today , he said , but i always feel i left some plays on the field i did today but to win 12 games with a really tough schedule is impressive our team was battered all year , but we overcame adversity and made it exciting for ourselves and our fans i ca n't be dissatisfied with anything we 've done all season i'm proud of this team for what we 've done today , favre played with his usual enthusiasm after his 54yard touchdown pass to bradford raised the packers' lead to 3410 , he raced down the field to embrace bradford favre s grin seemed appropriate for a quarterback s first touchdown pass , not his 287th as a pro \( plus 25 in the postseason \) it was bradford s seventh career touchdown favre also lived up to his reputation as a fearless , almost reckless , player in the last three minutes of a game already won , on thirdand13 , he could not find a receiver , so he ran he gained 4 yards when he ran , sherman said , i was nervous after the play , we told him not to do that packers coaches and players say favre is their key player in every way he brings leadership , wide receiver antonio freeman said the guy has a lot of heart we go as far as he takes us that s no secret around this locker room sherman said he s such a big part of what we do , a tremendous leader , a strong hero i'm not just talking about arm strength it s character , a work ethic second to none he s a great example to young players one of those young players is green , who recorded his seventh 100yard rushing game of the season that tied the team record by the hall of famer jim taylor i 've been feeling good about this offense all season , green said the main reason is the big guys up front another reason is green s emergence as a dangerous and durable runner this is only my fourth year , green said i'm still a young back i 've got a lot to learn the packers have one concern their defense allowed the giants 81 offensive plays and 524 yards , enough to win most games handily that s something we have to address , sherman said we gave up yardage , but we did n't give up points you do what you have to do when you have to do it we 're winning football games we 're scoring points and not giving up a lot of points the packers need a quick answer because they play host to the san francisco 49ers next weekend in the first round of the playoffs they have injuries to freeman \( ribs and knee \) , linebacker na'il diggs \( sprained ankle \) and cornerback bhawoh jue \( mild concussion \) i think they 'll be fine , sherman said , but with jue it s his concussion , not mine photo brett favre eluding the giants' pass rush in the packers' 3425 victory yesterday \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
london , sept 5 les selby had only to hear the words ken livingstone and he was off and ranting he had plenty of time for it , because the taxi he was driving was inert , hemmed in from all sides by london s formidable midmorning gridlock it borders on criminal , what he s got up to , mr selby said of mr livingstone , or kamikaze ken , as he unfondly calls the man elected mayor two years ago on a trafficreduction pledge he wants people to use public transportation , but i would n't let a dog on the bus at night , let alone the wife london s bold trafficabatement scheme a program to charge motorists 5 , or about 780 , a day for the privilege of driving into central london at peak times is scheduled to take effect next february while the famously automobileshunning mayor is already hailing the plan as the best way to get traffic moving , critics , including small businesses and residents' associations , cannot quite believe it is actually going to happen to pay to drive your own car into your own city , i think it s a bit rich , said a woman who lives in kennington in south london , the site of the southernmost boundary of what is now being called the congestion area she did not want her name used , but stopped for a minute on the street to point to the demarcation area between the payment zone and the free zone if i want to drive across the street to visit my son , i'm going to have to pay 5 each time , she said nobody disputes that the traffic situation is terrible each morning , 40 , 000 cars , trucks and buses an hour pour \( or trickle \) into central london , using roads meant for horses , carriages and pedestrians traffic now moves at an average of less than 10 miles an hour businesses estimate that some 3 million a day is wasted because of gridlock according to the mayor , the answer is to impose socalled congestion charges , which are meant to reduce traffic in eight square miles in the center of london by 10 to 15 percent , while raising some 204 million a year although similar systems are being adopted elsewhere , most notably in singapore , no city of london s size and complexity has come close to anything this comprehensive other cities in britain are eagerly watching to see if the plan can be adapted for their areas the single most important thing about this is that it s actually going to go ahead , said robert r kiley , london s transport commissioner ken livingstone s view is that if you put it off , it wo n't happen it s a very gutsy thing to do some business groups have given the plan a tentative thumbsup , saying that any effort is better than none but the scheme will take a great deal of getting used to for one thing , the mayor has ruled out the idea of using smart cards , similar to the ez pass system in use on many toll roads and bridges in the united states , saying they would be too cumbersome as well too unfamiliar for london drivers while weekly , monthly and yearly passes will be available to regular commuters , people who want to make occasional trips into central london during peak hours from 7 am to 6 30 pm on weekdays will have to pay separately each day they make the trip payment can be made by telephone , over the internet , or through machines at gas stations and the like spontaneity will be a thing of the past , said angie bray , a conservative member of the london assembly you 'll no longer be able to say , 'let s do some shopping in oxford street , ' and take your car if you want to do that now , you will have to ring up or get on the internet and book your passage enforcement is another potential problem the system will be policed by 260 cameras that will photograph the license plates of each car using the zone each day , and connecting to other cameras and computers will theoretically be able to electronically separate the cars that have paid from those that have n't drivers will have until 7 pm the same day to pay the 5 people who forget to pay , or shirk their responsibility , will have to pay increasing penalties , up to 80 , depending on how long they wait the fine for not paying at all is 120 one of the big teething problems is going to be irate motorists who have no idea that they crossed the boundary and who find that they 're suddenly stung for large sums of money , miss bray said londoners do n't necessarily love their cars but they complain that the public transportation system which serves a sprawling city full of narrow , haphazardly arranged streets and is hardly comprehensive is not always an enticing option critics of the mayor s program have been horrified by the trafficabatement schemes he has already put in place , including adding more bicycle and bus lanes embarking on various roaddigging projects , including one making part of trafalgar square a pedestrianonly zone and adjusting many traffic lights to favor pedestrians over drivers traffic has become much slower , said kevin delaney , traffic and road safety manager for the royal automobile club foundation , a lobbying group mr delaney recently conducted a private road test , measuring his driving time on several of london s busiest roads his average speed was a miserable 29 miles per hour at one point , it took him 28 minutes to travel sixtenths of a mile i was surprised , he said well , staggered would be a better word many critics of the mayor s plan have accused mr livingstone of sneakily making the traffic worse now so that when the congestion charges start he can restore the lights and then claim the improvements are due to his new system he denies this emphatically he also denies that his anticar stance is personal , although there is evidence to the contrary mr livingstone rides the subway to work and does not have an official mayoral car , preferring public transportation or , in a pinch , a taxi when the subway shut down during the last transit workers' strike , the mayor walked to his office , an epic journey that took him several hours one sometimes suspects that his policy might be driven by an inchoate philosophical hatred of cars , said piers merchant , campaigns director of the london chamber of commerce , who does not himself hate cars that would be very bad indeed photos a london cyclist had an easy run down the bus lane on vauxhall bridge , notorious for traffic jams mayor ken livingstone , below ,

the natural the misunderstood presidency of bill clinton by joe klein 230 pp new york doubleday 2295 if it s true that bill clinton is what joe klein \( quoting george santayana on william james \) says he is , so extremely natural that there was no knowing what his nature was , or what came next and who would n't vote for that \? then this book could hardly be the last word on our immediate expresident but klein s new work stands as a solidly provisional overview of the prismatic clinton presidency the duality , triality , quadrality of bill clinton s nature and outlook should by now be a popular topic everywhere for focus groups trying to focus he has been variously viewed as a poll addict who could n't make up his mind , a creature of his audience , a man without core values who compromised on nearly everything , a closet liberal who went to the right whenever it suited him he was perceived as a faithless husband who loved his wife passionately a man of cosmic flaws a sucker for flattery with a compulsion to please owner of achilles' heels , elbows and other parts , which all proved impervious to enemy arrows during his eight years as target of the far right s pyrotechnic hatred his behavior also brought on what klein calls the most lurid month in the history of the american presidency the mostly monica month after which the electorate would have gleefully voted him a third term if only it had been legal loathed , pilloried , impeached , bill clinton saw his approval ratings stay illogically lofty , and he turned into the most compelling politician of his generation , a national anomaly , a charismatic celebrity who , even now , wows the globalists and historians with his knowledge and fills every room he enters klein , who has covered the white house for newsweek and the new yorker , cloned a serious likeness , president jack stanton , in the 1996 anonymous bestselling novel , primary colors , a book hailed for its language , verve and revelation of the intimacies of a presidential campaign very like clinton s in 1992 in the natural klein says his novel was wrongly considered an attack on the president i saw it as a defense of largerthanlife politicians who , inevitably , have mythic weaknesses entangled with their obvious strengths it seemed obvious that a largerthanlife leader was preferable to one who was smaller than life klein begins here with 1992 , musing , as he moves forward , on what the president achieved , where he fell short , his mystery marriage to hillary \( maybe the best chapter \) and his continuing personality puzzle why did he do what he did \? has he no shame \? no sense \? klein does n't stint on caustic appraisals even so , he emerges as a disappointed , bewildered , but awed clintonian , for unlike the haters , he sees past the negatives i 've roamed through a score of books about the clintons , and it s not easy to pinpoint where klein s information is new but this book is more readable than the others , dense but tight , funny , adroitly written and , in sum , the first savvy synthesis of the clinton age one of klein s points , historically sad , is that clinton had spent most of his life dreaming of a heroic rooseveltian presidency , of great acts and grand gestures but that dream ended with health care the campaign , spearheaded by mrs clinton , for universal coverage it was early in the first term , the clintons did n't yet understand congress or appreciate compromise , the grand dream became a fiasco , and it weakened the president he had to learn to proceed incrementally and he did in his second term , after snookering newt gingrich in the budget battle that shut down the government twice , he and the grudging republicans created a balanced budget with among much else 30 billion in tax credits to make the first two years of college a middleclass entitlement one skeptic remarked , it ai n't the gi bill of rights , but klein notes that the gi bill applied only to returning world war ii veterans , whereas by 1999 an astonishing 10 million , of 14 million americans eligible , would take advantage of the college tax credit clinton had also promised welfare reform and in his second term he got some , plus 24 billion for children s health insurance in five years 70 billion went to families with less than 30 , 000 in income persistence , klein writes , was his strongest character trait in this case in the service of his political beliefs , not his ambition the result was perhaps the most important substantive achievement of his presidency but , klein adds , these achievements were ignored by the left , which wanted bigger social programs , by the right , which wanted less spending , and by the press , which mostly did n't notice incrementalism was too subtle a story there was a news vacuum that needed to be filled in 1998 , it would be james carville , clinton s political consultant , asked the president about his tendency to live dangerously , and klein quotes the answer well , they have n't caught me yet but in the monica lewinsky case they caught him hard evidence of a sexual liaison with the young intern then came his assertions that it had n't happened , followed by apologies that it had and finally his testimony before kenneth starr s grand jury in august 1998 klein quotes the president on starr that man is evil when this thing is over , there s only going to be one of us left standing and it s going to be me and it was sort of
west point , ny , nov 15 several weeks before army s opening game of the season , coach todd berry said he expected the black knights to win all 12 of their regularseason games and then play in a bowl game and win that one , too three months later , even berry will concede that that was wishful thinking , to say the least , especially since fellow conference usa coaches had picked army to finish last this is a place of high aspirations , where young men aspire to do great things , berry , army s thirdyear coach , said on wednesday in his office when asked about that preseason forecast and as a coach i have to feel the same way and when i said that , i thought it was possible but i also felt that we could be really good or really bad unfortunately for berry , his team has been bad far more often than it has been good in fact , when army plays favored tulane on saturday at the louisiana superdome in new orleans , it will be seeking its first victory of the season if the 09 cadets lose , as expected , they will match a record for futility set by the 1973 team , which lost all 10 of its games and if army were to also lose the next week against another conference usa opponent , memphis , also on the road , it would be the first time an army team was 011 in a program that began in 1890 if army does not produce an upset in those two games , its last chance to win a game will come dec 7 in its season finale , against an improving navy team , which came close to upsetting notre dame last saturday since replacing bob sutton \( who enjoyed only two winning seasons during his nine years as army s head coach \) in 2000 and doing away with the runoriented wishbone offense that had been used by sutton and his predecessor , jim young , for 16 years , berry has presided over a 427 record the team is young ten sophomores and one freshman were among the starters in last saturday s game against air force and 77 of the 119 players on the roster are either freshmen or sophomores the team s starting quarterback , the sophomore reggie nevels , has been hampered by a hamstring injury for much of this season , forcing berry to use the freshman zac dahman in his place i'm very disappointed with this season and certainly hoped to have more wins , said the 42yearold berry , who was brought to west point from illinois state by army s athletic director , rick greenspan berry had turned around illinois state s program while greenspan was the athletic director there illinois state was 2424 in berry s four seasons , including an 113 record in 1999 , when the redbirds reached the semifinals of the division iaa playoffs this season , army has given up an average of 428 points , putting it 115th among the 117 division ia football teams , while averaging 211 points , which ranks 93rd the sad thing is that we 're not a bad football team we just play bad , berry said but if we play up to our potential , i seriously believe that we can win our last three games and given our youth , we 're going to mature , and i feel very strongly that we 're going to be a very good football team next year despite all of the defeats , berry s job does not appear to be in jeopardy todd deserves a chance to have his recruiting classes grow up under his leadership , said greenspan , who conceded that some west point graduates had expressed frustration over the losing streak they 'll ask what the heck we are doing and in some cases say maybe we should change something berry said some armchair quarterbacks had directed their frustrations at coaches' wives in the stands at michie stadium even my 16yearold daughter hears about it in school , berry said i guess that s part of the job but i still feel i'm a great fit for the academy berry s team seems to be upbeat as it prepare to play tulane i get sick to my stomach after losing some games , said the senior safety maurio smith who , like other cadets , is usually up by 6 30 am , takes five courses and does not get to bed until midnight and while i'm disappointed , i do n't get discouraged another senior , tight end warren stewart , agreed everybody gets a little down , but no one gives up , said stewart , whose fivecourse load includes subjects like numerical analysis and military history we 've learned how to deal with adversity , and i think that will help us down the line none of the seniors interviewed all of whom will be commissioned as second lieutenants when they graduate on may 31 attributed any portion of the team s record to the distractions created by a possible attack on iraq by the united states it s always in the back of your mind , defensive end clarence holmes said but when we practice or play a game , our focus is entirely on football berry may meet up with some of his seniors at army posts after they graduate since coming to west point , he has made it a point to travel to army bases in the united states and abroad during the spring we have a tremendous following , both in people who 've been at west point and troops who never have , and whatever pressure i feel is for those guys in the field , berry said and because of them , i feel crushed by all of the defeats photo

when edward mcmellon , a former police officer involved in the shooting death of amadou diallo , became a probationary firefighter at engine company 332 in brooklyn in november , there were at least two black firefighters working in the east new york firehouse now there are none , say firefighters assigned to engine company 332 earlier this month , timmy smith , a veteran firefighter , transferred out his move came three months after another black firefighter sought and received a transfer firefighter smith refused to work beside firefighter mcmellon , the daily news reported yesterday efforts to reach firefighter smith yesterday through the department were unsuccessful but department officials called the timing of firefighter smith s transfer a matter of coincidence as far as we know , it has nothing to do with anything , said david billig , a fire department spokesman the transfer was in well beforehand firefighter smith is now assigned to ladder company 123 in crown heights , brooklyn working in a ladder company is something he had talked about for years , said colleagues at engine company 332 , which shares the firehouse with ladder company 175 nicholas scoppetta , the new fire commissioner , said the department was simply honoring one firefighter s request to move on , not responding to a hostile work environment he has 10 years' seniority in the fire department , mr scoppetta said under any circumstance , when someone with that kind of seniority makes a request for a change , we will try and accommodate it , and in this case we did we 're not going to retry the diallo case here officer mcmellon was acquitted firefighter mcmellon joined the fire department after the former police commissioner , bernard b kerik , cleared him and the three other officers accused in the diallo shooting of departmental charges firefighter mcmellon had passed the fire department exam before the february 1999 shooting the four officers involved in the shooting were acquitted of all criminal charges in east new york yesterday , firefighters who have worked alongside both firefighter mcmellon and firefighter smith said the talk of tension was unfounded the guy comes to work , he does the job and he keeps to himself , one firefighter said , referring to firefighter mcmellon smith , he just always wanted to work a ladder assignment and he got it it s petty for people to make this into something that it s not another firefighter , a 10year veteran , said we lost 343 guys down at the world trade center i think that s a lot more important than whether one guy likes another guy

i have been asked what it s like being white in a field of music that s considered africanamerican , the vibraphonist gary burton says i think it would be equally valid to ask me what it s like being gay and playing a form of music that s seen as macho it s interesting that the subject never seems to come up although white jazz fans in particular like to think of themselves as colorblind , it often seems that race is all they ever talk about when the subject is music there is even a kind of reverse racial profiling that goes on in jazz white players are pulled over and ticketed for reckless introspection but whereas race is visible , even if it is becoming less so all the time , sexual orientation usually is not within jazz , race is considered a fit topic for public discourse , while a gay sexual orientation is regarded as private , a potential source of embarrassment for performer and audiences alike it is practically gospel in jazz that a player taking an improvised solo is coming clean , baring his soul , telling us who he is in no uncertain terms but what if the player is gay \? is n't that as much a clue to his identity as race \? mr burton s comments came during a panel discussion about homosexuality in jazz at the village vanguard in april , which i moderated it was presented by the national arts journalism program and columbia university , and along with the writer grover sales , the other panelists were the pianist fred hersch , the saxophonist charlie kohlhase and the singer and pianist andy bey there appears to be a growing acceptance of homosexuality among the general public yet the panel was the first public discussion that anyone could recall to address the topic of homosexuality in jazz in jazz the rule remains do n't ask , do n't tell this attitude is ironic because the jazz subculture has been notoriously free and easy , ahead of the beat on most social issues safety in numbers may have as much to do as sensibility with drawing gay men to certain professions , like hairdressing and floristry in general , the performing arts are another area in which the news that someone is gay hardly comes as a shock but there are ways in which jazz and all of popular music have more in common with baseball than with theater or dance \( jazz even has its own body of statistics , in the form of discographies , recording dates and musical lineups \) despite a growing number of female instrumentalists , the audience for jazz remains overwhelmingly male , which perhaps explains why jazz itself remains an enclave of machismo there was a time when all jazz musicians were straight , as far as anyone knew the composer and arranger billy strayhorn was a notable exception , but he was perfectly happy to spend his career in duke ellington s shadow , which was the same as being in the closet it was only in 1996 , with the publication of david hajdu s strayhorn biography , lush life , that nonmusicians learned of strayhorn s homosexuality a common objection to mr hajdu s book was that strayhorn s sexual orientation had no bearing on his music mr burton has been out to his friends and associates since the late 1980 s , when he took a male date to a party at the berklee school of music in boston , where he has taught since 1971 and is now an executive vice president my decision to come out resulted from the end of my second marriage , he said i was in my 40 s and finally came to the conclusion that i was more gay than straight the deciding factor was that i got a crush on someone who was very out , and in the course of dating him , i had to be out as well it did n't last , but i was out by then even so , mr burton did n't go public , as it were , until 1994 , when he discussed being gay in an interview on national public radio whatever repercussions he feared , an apparent lack of notice on the part of the jazz press \( and by extension , the jazz community \) left him more puzzled than relieved given his standing in jazz \( he has been a consistent downbeat pollwinner on vibes since the late 60 s \) , it was as if the guest of honor at a formal dinner had noisily slurped his soup or blurted out an offcolor remark best to look the other way except for an article about mr burton and other gay musicians in jazztimes magazine last year , which elicited an angry letter that accused gay musicians of not swinging \( long a white stereotype \) , the jazz press has continued to shy away from the subject , despite his willingness to speak frankly about being that supposedly rarest of creatures , a gay jazz musician in avoiding questioning mr burton about his sexual orientation , jazz journalists may be guilty of nothing more than trying to guard his privacy , or they might feel it s a nonissue but this reticence seems disingenuous in light of the role that miles davis s reputed prowess with the opposite sex played in defining his appeal to many of his male fans \( never mind the persistent rumors that davis was bisexual \) and discretion can be an unintended form of homophobia , said mr hersch there are several phases to coming out , and i think most of us went through one when we first told another human being that we were gay , mr hersch said we were nervous and looking for the perfect way to put it then , over time , we get to where we assume everyone knows and nobody really cares but the third phase is that in the same way that somebody else might talk about his wife or girlfriend , you want to be able to talk about your boyfriend or lack thereof

the recent meeting of vatican officials and roman catholic cardinals of the united states has led to at least one unequivocal order a team of church officials is to visit every american seminary and theology school that trains priests without delay and report its findings back to rome the last time the vatican ordered such an investigation , known as an apostolic visitation , was 21 years ago when pope john paul ii said he was concerned that american seminaries might have strayed from the teaching of church doctrine now , with the sexual abuse crisis raising questions about the health and morals of catholic priests , seminaries have again come under scrutiny in some cases that have recently been made public , the sexual abuse took place in a seminary , and the perpetrator was a seminary teacher or adviser an apostolic visitation is a chance to see how far the seminaries have come , said msgr francis maniscalco , spokesman for the united states conference of catholic bishops , and to assure the people that the candidates for the priesthood are suitable people , and any problems that might lead to immaturity in behavior would have been caught or addressed in seminary but other church officials say a seminary review is unnecessary because most of the abusive priests who have surfaced in news reports were trained in the seminaries of old , long before there was psychological screening of candidates i do n't think the seminary visitation is going to accomplish much of anything , said john r quinn , the retired archbishop of san francisco most of the cases of pedophilia we 're dealing with are by priests who were in the seminaries of the past , from long ago the vatican announced that this new review of seminaries would focus on two issues that were also central in the last review whether seminaries are teaching catholic moral doctrine in its integrity , and the need for a deeper study of the criteria of suitability of candidates to the priesthood some church observers interpret this as an indication that the vatican may be considering a ban on homosexual seminarians they noted that after the vatican meeting , several cardinals made statements critical of homosexuals in the priesthood , and implied that sexual orientation was somehow related to the problem of child sexual abuse a notion debunked by most specialists in the field of human sexuality the most forceful comment came from cardinal anthony j bevilacqua of philadelphia , who said his archdiocese screened out gay candidates we feel a person who is homosexualoriented is not a suitable candidate for the priesthood , even if he had never committed any homosexual act , the cardinal said the current practice at most american seminaries is to admit gay candidates who are committed to the vow of celibacy and have not been sexually active , either ever or in the last two or three years , depending on the seminary the rev kurt belsole said that at st vincent seminary in latrobe , pa , where he is the rector , the candidates were required to be committed to celibacy , no matter their sexual orientation i would n't want a heterosexual candidate who could n't live celibacy , father belsole said the issue is not simply homosexuality it s fidelity to teaching father belsole said he welcomed a visitation as an opportunity to demonstrate that seminaries had standards in place but he said that if the issue of homosexual candidates was raised , he would welcome that too i think it s important that it is taken up and that seminaries are given a clear direction on that , he said many conservative catholics have argued that the seminaries and the american priesthood have become corrupted with a preponderance of homosexuals james hitchcock , a professor of history at st louis university , said i 've personally talked to seminarians in various places who said , 'i went to seminary and i realized there was a homosexual network and i was being solicited and i reported it to the authorities and they did nothing' there are professors in the classroom who are saying that aspects of the church s moral teachings are outmoded there is a perception that i have , and i think others too , that the visitation of seminaries the last time around was not altogether thorough , mr hitchcock said a subcommittee of american bishops has just embarked on revising what will be the fifth edition of the norms for priestly formation , the document intended to guide seminaries , said the rev edward j burns , executive director of the secretariat for vocations and priestly formation of the united states conference of catholic bishops several bishops who did not want to be quoted said in interviews that should the question of whether to ban homosexual candidates come up , the bishops conference would probably be divided a church source said that the apostolic visitation of seminaries might be one way for the vatican to institute a ban without the bishops' concurrence the last apostolic visitation , to all 220 american seminaries and other institutions that prepare men for the priesthood , took six years , said bishop donald w wuerl of pittsburgh , who was the executive secretary for the visitation when it was done , the seminaries were commended , none were closed and some were privately warned to shape up the best adjective to describe it , bishop wuerl said , is that seminaries were uneven in the last visitations , bishop wuerl and other church sources said , the teaching of celibacy was an issue , but homosexuality was not one seminary faculty member recalls otherwise the visiting committees were asking not only what are you saying about sex , but are you encouraging samesex activity , permitting it , soliciting it , said mark d jordan , a former seminary teacher in texas who is now a professor of religion at emory university and the seminaries were put on notice that this could n't happen the seminaries were given the message that in theology , they must stick to orthodoxy and avoid relativism in priestly formation , they must not allow nuns or laypeople to serve as spiritual advisers to priests and in selecting students , they must reject men who appear psychologically vulnerable or sexually immature cardinal william w baum , an american who then led the vatican office in charge of education , wrote in 1986 , there would seem to be a number of seminarians who , at the end of their moral theology courses , are either not sure of what the church teaches in a particular matter or who think that the church s teaching is only one theological option among a number of equally valid theological options nowhere in cardinal baum s letter is there an explicit reference to homosexuality but he did write that seminaries should exercise much more caution in admitting men whose marriages have been annulled by the church , and that such acceptances should become very rare one of the grounds for an annulment is a husband who discovers he is gay the letter warns seminaries to beware of candidates who have had past problems of charity or chastity , of anger , greed or addiction photo bishop donald w wuerl of pittsburgh has experience with the investigation of seminaries \( gary tramontina for the new york times \)
piper , kan , feb 13 the piper school board normally meets in a cozy conference room at district headquarters , but on tuesday , folding chairs filled the purpleandwhite elementary school gym to accommodate the overflow crowd more than 100 parents , students and teachers skipped the basketball game at the high school next door to talk about the plagiarism scandal that has riven this tightknit community 20 miles west of downtown kansas city , kan , and become talkshow fodder as far away as guam as a symbol of the decline in american values it began in december with a teacher s finding that 28 of 118 piper high sophomores had stolen sections of their botany project off the internet the students received zeroes and faced failing the semester but after parents complained to the school board , the teacher , christine pelton , was ordered to raise the grades , prompting her resignation now , the community is angrily pointing fingers as they debate right and wrong , crimes and consequences , citizenship and democracy at tuesday s meeting , kay miesner , who graduated from piper high school in 1962 28 years after her father , 23 years before her son told the board members who overruled mrs pelton , i know each and every one of you , i think you 're all good people but , she said , i think you made a mistake someone yelled , yup , and the audience erupted but chris mccord , the board president , clamped the emotion , saying , we 'll have none of that such tension is unusual here in piper , a bluecollar bedroom community , in part because of young families drawn by the small school district several teachers said that nearly half the high school s 31member faculty plus its brand new principal planned to resign at year s end over the case , while parents fretted that the school s dwindling reputation might result in a decline in property values and disappearance of scholarship opportunities mrs pelton , meanwhile , has become a kind of folk hero , with dozens of calls a day offering support and jobs it s not just biology , you 're teaching them a lot more than that , mrs pelton , 27 , who had planned to resign this spring anyhow to start a homebased day care center , said between television appearances the other day you 're teaching them to be honest people , to have integrity , to listen , to be good citizens we got rules , and they got to follow the rules , she added i'm not expecting more than what would be expected of them either at home or down the road students , plagiarizers and nonplagiarizers alike , have already begun to feel the backlash a sign posted in a nearby high school read , if you want your grade changed , go to piper the proctor at a college entrance exam last weekend warned a girl wearing a piper sweatshirt not to cheat a company in florida faxed the school asking for a list of students so it would know whom never to hire at tuesday s board meeting , as five television news crews rolled tape , a woman worried that the community has been stamped with a large purple p on their foreheads for plagiarism the sophomore leaf project , an elaborate exercise in which students spend months collecting leaves and researching their origins , dates back a decade mrs pelton , who came to piper high in the fall of 2000 after a fiveyear program at the university of kansas , sent an outline of the assignment home on the first day of school , along with her classroom rules \( no 7 cheating and plagiarism will result in failure of the assignment and parent notification it is expected that all work turned in by the student is completely their own \) , which students and parents had to sign mrs pelton said she began to worry in october , when students' oral presentations , filled with big , unfamiliar words , sounded strangely similar as she flipped through their projects a month later , she found the writing far more sophisticated than previous assignments a plagiarismdetection web site , turnitincom , showed one in four were laced with lifted material the principal , michael adams , who declined to be interviewed , backed mrs pelton s decision to give students zeroes , as did the superintendent but after parents protested at the dec 11 school board meeting , the superintendent , dr michael o rooney , sent a memorandum home saying he had reluctantly directed mrs pelton to deduct just 600 of 1 , 500 points from the plagiarizers' projects , and to cut its value in the overall grade from 50 percent to 30 percent mrs pelton said a student told her , we won though teachers here say they begin discussing source citation in the fourth grade , some parents , of students with zeroes and those with a pluses , insist the students did not realize what they were doing was wrong \( some say they thought the admonition was against copying from previous students' papers , not taking simple descriptions from research material \) failing a whole semester , they say , is too harsh

los angeles , jan 10 as the spritesized sasha cohen arched her fragile back into a comma during a captivating spin , as she soared into her triple jumps with helium in her bones , her defiance was disguised beneath her grace inside , she is still the feisty skater who challenges her weary coach , who has shrugged off a back injury to practice quadruple jumps , who flicks off pressure as easily as lint so it is not unlike cohen to shake up the establishment that is what teenagers do but when she swiped sarah hughes s parking spot today at the united states figure skating championships , she did not even honk her horn no one saw the 17yearold cohen coming , not like this my young prodigy , the beautiful ms cohen , her coach , john nicks , said facetiously when she skates like that , all is forgiven cohen is a handful but her determined attitude was reflective of the day in an event in which every elite skater appeared to doubledare the next , cohen s performance disrupted all expectations after the short program an intense shell game is on with the long program , which accounts for twothirds of the final score and will be held saturday instead of jostling angela nikodinov for the third olympic spot , cohen finished in second place , behind the fivetime united states champion michelle kwan and ahead of hughes everyone really skated with their hearts today , said robin wagner , hughes s coach and choreographer that s an extraordinary feat for all the girls each of the top skaters was under different pressures , but none collapsed under their personal burdens after a difficult season , kwan , 21 , had left some wondering if her passion for skating had died but with joy on her face and the ethereal quality back in her skating , her reincarnation left the crowd at the staples center in deep adoration it s a relief , kwan said i 'd been leaving it all in practice it was nice to perform it at age 16 , hughes stepped on the ice as the no 1 threat to kwan and delivered a fluid , softedged routine , with only a barely perceptible flaw in her triple lutz and triple flip this was my best short program this year , hughes said this was the most complete of them all even so , hughes could have easily been fourth with a group of nine judges that handed out an unclear mandate four placed nikodinov ahead of hughes after she completed a gorgeous and composed program , able to hold herself together after the recent death of her coach , elena tcherkasskaia i could n't ask for anything more , nikodinov said after wiping away tears it s been a long season everything takes time you ca n't wake up and expect to be fine i want to stay strong i know elena is looking down on me she would have been proud nikodinov reflected the ballerina in tcherkasskaia , flaunting her grace during her spirals and spins one judge even put nikodinov first after the short program so not even kwan was untouchable two judges rated her short program second , with cohen receiving the other firstplace mark in a way , this was a flashback to 2000 , when the spunky 15yearold cohen dazzled everyone with her secondplace finish at the nationals i guess it is similar , cohen said this was a pleasing performance it was one of my better performances i do n't think i could have done better , just like in 2000 a few months later that year , cohen s progress was interrupted by a back injury that left her as a spectator at last year s nationals i made use of every minute , cohen said over a period of months , cohen endured back pain and physical therapy to make a comeback before today , she was seen more as a curiosity , the skater who was trying to make history by completing a quadruple jump today , she did not need bells and whistles her effortless triple jumps and her luminance on the ice were more than enough i worked hard this year , cohen said now , i have to focus on saturday and try to make the olympic team after cohen s performance today , the makeup of that team is anyone s guess photo after her graceful short program yesterday at the us championships , sasha cohen earned one firstplace vote from the judges \( reuters \)
seoul , south korea , june 2 true , none of the american players are married to a spice girl , as is england s top star president bush did not invite the national team over for a sendoff luncheon , as did italy s prime minister the loss of a starting midfielder to injury did not send the country into a panic attack and the american coach has no personal biographer , as does his counterpart in china this lack of national passion has prompted the same question to be asked repeatedly and skeptically for decades when is soccer going to make it in the united states \? the truth is , in some important ways , it already has the men s national team is in its fourth consecutive world cup , which continues through june 30 in south korea and japan , and will play its opening game on wednesday against portugal the women s national team is the reigning world champion the american women finished second at the 2000 sydney olympics , the men fourth professional leagues for both men and women were born after the united states played host to a world cup , a women s world cup and a summer olympics appealing to both sexes in nearly equal numbers , soccer is the only team sport to experience growth in participation between 1990 and 2000 , according to american sports data inc in college , soccer has overtaken track and field as the no 1 participatory sport for women from ages 6 to 17 , 725 million americans play soccer frequently , significantly more than the number who play baseball \( 475 million \) , according to the sporting goods manufacturers association that explosion is intimidating the other leagues , said don garber , the commissioner of major league soccer , the men s professional league , and a former executive of the national football league fifteen years ago , the men s national team played before tiny crowds of 2 , 000 or 3 , 000 now , the team regularly draws crowds of 30 , 000 or more at stadiums around the country the 1999 women s world cup final between the united states and china drew 40 million television viewers , the largest tv audience for a soccer game in this country in 1990 , the sport s national governing body , us soccer , was a momandpop operation with a budget of less than 10 million recently it approved a budget triple that size as the world shrinks and economies become more global , corporate sponsors are increasingly enthusiastic about soccer , the most pervasively global sport , said tony ponturo , vice president for sports marketing at anheuserbusch , a world cup sponsor since 1986 and soccer is also well positioned to accommodate the changing demographics in the united states it is particularly appealing to the hispanic population , whose explosive growth reached 35 million , according to the latest census figures i think soccer is arriving , accelerating into the station , but i would n't go so far to say that it has arrived , said rick burton , executive director of the warsaw sports marketing center at the university of oregon s college of business i'm not sure the networks or traditional leagues are yet sure how to think about soccer but i perceive it will continue to grow in the us i think over time soccer will become bigger than a niche sport leagues are struggling soccer officials are convinced that the sport will become the fifth major league sport in the united states they also concede that it will take a number of years using this world cup to build interest will be challenging , even if the united states is successful its firstround games against portugal , south korea and poland will be played while most americans are sleeping the professional leagues both remain economically fragile mls , now in its seventh season , has piled up losses of 250 million to 300 million , evidence of a weak television contract with abc and espn mls dropped two teams before the current season , reducing the number of franchises from 12 to 10 philip anschutz , the billionaire entertainment and telecommunications mogul , has an ownership share in six of the remaining teams , a sign that the league is struggling to attract investors and could fold if one man loses interest the women s united soccer association lost 40 million in 2001 , its first year of operation , roughly the total it had expected to lose over four seasons before becoming profitable television ratings for both leagues remain pallid the wusa switched from tnt to the pax tv network this year and reached only 81 , 000 households in its opening week attendance is down nearly 14 percent with an average audience of 7 , 164 through 31 games this season , compared with 8 , 104 a year ago if they are to build soccer into a pillar sport , officials in both leagues said they must convert participants into fans , that is , into regular ticket buyers and television viewers they must continue to educate the news media and advertisers , develop more star players and unite disparate constituencies that love the game but often clash and impede soccer s development we still have a difficult task ahead to convert masses of people into fans of the professional game here , said kevin payne , managing director of soccer for the anschutz entertainment group we basically have to create a whole new culture , a habit of supporting those teams
as the police and federal agents and scores of protest groups prepare for disruptive demonstrations outside the world economic forum , both sides are taking up positions on another potential battleground the internet demonstrators are using the internet to organize protests and publicize their causes the new york police department is using it to glean information about groups that it says may pose a threat and federal authorities say they fear that some protesters will use it as a tool of disruption or destruction representatives of several of the larger umbrella groups planning protests dismissed the idea of cyberattacks and said they had none planned but federal officials said they had significant concerns and , along with forum officials , were taking precautions the secret service is working with the police department on security preparations so far , the specter of tumult in the streets and the kind of vandalism and violence that marred similar economic gatherings in recent years has driven concern about the protests but increasingly , the potential havoc wrought by a computer attack has drawn the attention of federal authorities we 're living in a world where a keyboard has the potential to do enormous damage , said bruce a townsend , the special agent in charge of the secret service s financial crimes division in washington he would not say whether there was a threat specific to the forum but he said the agency s new york electronic crimes task force , a joint effort with the police department and nearly 50 other state , local and federal law enforcement agencies , had painstakingly reviewed computer systems associated with the meeting to make them less vulnerable cyberattacks on the world economic forum are not without precedent last year , a computer hacker gained access to the forum s database and obtained credit card and other information on hundreds of participants who attended the group s regional meetings in 2000 at the other end of the spectrum is a group planning a cyberaction for this year s meeting the group , called the electronic disturbance theater , is using its web site to call for a net strike to disturb the electronic infrastructure of the wef s corporate membership the group wants large numbers of people to swamp the web sites of the forum and its corporate members but the group s cofounder , ricardo dominguez , drew a distinction between his efforts , which he said were aimed at social disturbance rather than disruption or destruction , and those of anyone trying to break into or destroy computer systems it s a very american thing to do , he said , comparing the action to sitting down in the middle of a street in an act of civil disobedience
the bush administration s misguided effort to sidestep america s existing civil and military courts to prosecute al qaeda and taliban suspects in military tribunals has lurched from one problem to another now the pentagon is straining to come up with a legal theory that will let it bring some 300 detainees before the tribunals in the absence of specific evidence that they themselves have committed war crimes this is a distressing exercise in the united states we do not arrest people and then devise laws to prosecute and convict them public confidence in the outcome of these trials demands a return to established american legal principles , including independent court review the idea of special military tribunals dates back to the weeks immediately following sept 11 it had obvious appeal to a president seeking to convey a sense of wartime danger , a pentagon eager to interrogate suspects for information bearing on future attacks and a justice department impatient with the procedural safeguards and inevitable delays of normal trials a similar logic led the administration to shortchange the legal requirements of the geneva convention on prisoners of war in its handling of taliban and al qaeda detainees , weakening an international treaty that also safeguards the rights of american soldiers captured in battle inventing a parallel legal system may be found to be constitutional under the president s powers as commander in chief but there is no compelling justification for doing so and many good reasons not to , as a series of embarrassing legal stumbles has illustrated america s regular judicial system has established an impressive record of convicting and punishing international terrorists last year s embassy bombing trials provided a wealth of information about al qaeda the latest problem involves the pentagon s inability so far to tie many of the detainees being held at the guant namo naval base to specific violations of the laws of war few of the suspects have provided information to their interrogators and none have confessed to atrocities or war crimes to get around this obstacle , administration officials are now considering charging these people with being senior qaeda members or officers of units that committed such offenses that would resemble the charge of conspiracy familiar in civilian courts , but would depart from the practice of the nuremberg war crimes tribunal , where , for example , no one was convicted simply for membership in the ss many of the crimes committed in relation to sept 11 and al qaeda operations in afghanistan are distinctive and may call for innovative prosecutorial strategies , but not ones that depart from fundamental american principles of justice that is all the more reason to insist on independent judicial review of these cases trying them in regular civilian or military courts is the best way to assure this
banaras the luminous city , an exhibition at the asia society and museum , is nominally about the ancient indian center of learning and spiritual enlightenment , now called varanasi \( or sometimes benares \) but practically , it serves as a test case for using new interactive technologies to enhance the museum experience in theory , using computers and video projections for virtual navigation through the material and immaterial dimensions of something as complicated as a great city makes sense it would seem to be an ideal way to discover connections among art , architecture , mythologies , religious practices and social customs the question is does the technology become an intrusive distraction from the object being studied \? at the asia society , unfortunately but instructively , it most often does the exhibition is divided into two parts the first section presents a small and unremarkable selection of blackandwhite photographs , ranging from cityscapes shot in 1865 by samuel bourne to recent examples of highquality travel photography by linda connor , rosalind solomon and graciela iturbide more interestingly problematic is the second part , called the crossing living , dying and transformation in banaras it was produced by the palo alto research center , a xerox corporation research division , under the direction of ranjit makkuni , a specialist in the development of computer interface design the first impression you have upon entering the gallery is of a bewildering cacophony in every direction , you see wallsize photographs and reproductions of paintings , text panels , flickering video screens and video projections there are all kinds of sounds music , voices and electronic pings and boings far from the kind of contemplative peace of a traditional gallery or library , you are assaulted by a barrage of sensory stimuli yet nowhere are there any actual artworks or artifacts from varanasi resisting the urge to run away , you take a closer look at the various approaches to dispensing content these include a rickshaw with a video monitor attached , showing the view of someone riding through the streets of the city move the handlebars and you get a different view nearby is a tilting table that has part of an antique map projected on its surface if you push down on a side of the table , the map slides in that direction , affording overviews of different parts of the street plan built into a wall is a video monitor broadcasting interviews with experts on spiritual traditions it is surrounded by mirrors to create a kaleidoscopic effect then there is a bicycle wheel , computerized to play variations on traditional indian musical forms depending on which spokes the viewer touches this might be interesting if you could distinguish the sounds it produces from all the background noise there are several instances of what are essentially channel changers disguised as traditional objects , like a vase push the buttons and a different video projection appears to instruct you about one or another aspect of the city s culture and a movable monitor mounted on a post allows you to scan the cityscape and learn nuggets of information about certain points of interest , as words crawl across the bottom of the screen there is more , but you get the idea there are many technical problems with all this in addition to the difficulty of screening out background clutter while trying to focus on one display , the visual and auditory quality of individual presentations is too poor to hold your attention what you find yourself doing is playing with the various devices long enough to see how they work \( in some cases , failing to discover even that much \) , and then moving on to the next station if you do succeed in concentrating on one thing , you find that what it offers is pretty elementary about what you could learn from an online encyclopedia or an ordinary television travelogue none of this should suggest that interactive technology ca n't be applied effectively in certain museum situations futurists will say that the field is still in its infancy and deserves the benefit of the doubt in that sense , the value of this exhibition is in showing what to avoid what is most disturbing , however , is the implication that actual artworks and artifacts might reasonably be dispensed with nothing , after all , is more specifically informative about a culture than an object produced by that culture one of the great skills of a cultivated citizen of the world is the ability not only to see and identify objects from different civilizations , but to interpret them as well books , film and newer forms of media can help , but there is no substitute for the real thing if real objects become unnecessary , then so do museums banaras the luminous city is at the asia society and museum , 725 park avenue , at 70th street , \( 212 \) 5172742 , through aug 18 photo large detail from an 1865 temple photograph by samuel bourne in a show about varanasi at the asia society \( sepia international \)
after serving as host of a 75aperson fundraising party for 300 people friday night , the rev ruben diaz sr took his campaign for state senate to the streets of the south bronx yesterday he weaved his way from one neighborhood to the next with a convoy of sound trucks and colorful vans more than 100 volunteers handed out literature , and he was accompanied for a time by the rev al sharpton meanwhile , the incumbent state senator , pedro espada jr , spent part of the day at a family day celebration at the robert e moore public housing complex in the melrose section of the bronx and that was after he presented certificates and checks to a youth baseball team in st mary s park , in mott haven the two candidates' activity has all the trappings of a competitive democratic primary campaign in the 32nd state senate district , in other words , business as usual but the race , nonetheless , has proven itself to be one of the most uncommon and unpredictable of this political season and with just more than a week until primary day , sept 10 , no one involved in or knowledgeable about bronx politics would predict what candidate if any would remain on the democratic party s ballot by the time the polls open the uncertainty results from a series of court decisions in which mr espada was tossed off the democratic ballot , then restored on appeal on friday , the court of appeals , the state s highest court , assured a new round of confusion , ruling that the bronx democratic party had the right to remove mr espada from its primary ballot , but not for the reasons the party had cited the matter was sent back to a lower court and the party committee while local party officials hailed the decision , it remains unclear whether mr espada will ultimately be barred from the sept 10 ballot earlier this year , he announced that he was switching to the republican party , and began sitting and voting with senate republicans , although he has never officially registered as a republican since then , the bronx democratic party has been trying to keep him off its line in its ruling , the court of appeals determined that the party could not remove mr espada from its rolls based on statements or actions that took place in the senate itself those , the court reasoned , are protected by the state constitution but the court ruled that the party could remove mr espada based on his other public statements it is not clear that a final court ruling will come in time for the party to remove mr espada from the democratic line adding to the uncertainty is a lawsuit filed by mr espada that seeks to have mr diaz removed from the ballot mr diaz became an official candidate little more than a week ago , when a state supreme court justice ruled that raysa castillo , the candidate previously backed by the democratic party organization , had to come off the ballot because of residency issues mr espada is challenging the party s decision to substitute mr diaz for ms castillo the unusual nature of this race is coupled with the fact that the pace of campaigning has been ratcheted up to such a frenzied level in such a short time since becoming a candidate , mr diaz , whose son , assemblyman ruben diaz jr , is managing his campaign , has raised about 20 , 000 , printed posters and placed them throughout the district , and prepared campaign ads that will be shown starting tuesday on local cable stations in the bronx the uncertainty of the situation does n't affect my campaign , said mr diaz , 59 i'm prepared spiritually , mentally and physically to do what i have to do mr diaz said that the main campaign issue was whether voters could trust mr espada he was elected by the people as a democrat and then he became a republican , he said the people trusted him to be a democrat , and he failed that trust mr espada , too , is advertising on television and on radio he has been holding meetings at churches to talk about the millions and millions of dollars that i have been able to bring to this district as a result of being the first hispanic in the majority conference his campaign finance filing in july showed that he had raised 22 , 000 but that his campaign was running about 1 , 500 in the red but mr espada , 48 , said yesterday that he had since raised more than 75 , 000 his campaign , too , is managed by his son alex , 21 an undertone of family rivalry permeates this senate contest the two candidates' sons have also run against one another in 1996 , mr espada s son pedro gautier espada ran against ruben diaz jr in a special election to fill an assembly seat while the younger mr espada won that race , mr diaz s son was victorious in the regular election for a full term later that year pedro gautier espada is advising his father in the senate race , but is immersed in his own campaign , challenging assemblywoman carmen e arroyo both mr diaz and mr espada seem aware of the unusual nature of the race and the uncertainty that remains between now and primary day all we can do is to march forward until the decision is in , mr espada said yesterday you go forward until either your head is up , or it s bowed and you go home

bangkok , nov 7 a group of al qaeda operatives met in thailand and discussed plans to attack bars , nightclubs and tourist resorts throughout the region months before the october bombing in bali killed more than 190 people , asian and western officials said this week the group was led by a senior lieutenant of osama bin laden and included a qaeda explosives expert , who was later arrested and told american officials of the january meeting during his interrogation they talked about hitting soft western targets throughout southeast asia , an american official said the blast at an indonesian resort area in bali may have been the first such attack , western diplomats said is thailand next \? is the question being asked by seemingly everyone here , from bartenders to hotel owners , to businessmen and diplomats , as well by many thai officials when they are speaking privately the presence of al qaeda in thailand , with its freewheeling culture , chaotic cities and porous borders , is greater than the thai government has been willing to acknowledge , or than western governments , including the united states , were aware of , diplomats from several countries said in interviews an attack here could further unsettle a region where thailand serves as the economic engine and the hub of tourist industry that draws more than 10 million visitors a year to this country alone a western intelligence analyst said thailand was a vital link in the international terrorist s underground railroad two of the sept 11 hijackers traveled from afghanistan to malaysia and then in effect laundered themselves through thailand before entering the united states , western officials said this week last month , a dozen suspected qaeda operatives fled to thailand from malaysia and singapore , and then disappeared , to the embarrassment of the thai government , asian and western officials said a thai government spokesman , sita divari , said today that the government was certain that there was no qaeda network in thailand and that there was no serious threat of a terrorist attack it is an assertion that diplomats here have been hearing for months and which they do not take seriously people who claim this country is devoid of any prospects of terrorism are na ve , one ambassador said officials investigating the bali attack are now looking closely at thailand and suspect that the plan to set off a car bomb in front of a popular nightclub on oct 12 was hatched during the meeting in january the meeting , these officials said , was called by a man who has become the most wanted terrorist in the region , al qaeda s top man in southeast asia , riadun isamuddin , known as hambali also attending , they said , was a qaeda explosives expert , mohamed mansour jabara , a kuwaiti national with a canadian passport who was picked up in oman in march and is now in american custody precisely when he told american officials about the january meeting is not clear mr jabara was one of the main planners in a plot to blow up the american , australian and israeli embassies in singapore last december when the plot was uncovered , he and several others fled undetected to thailand , asian and western officials said counterterrorism experts say al qaeda , no longer dependent on camps for its operations , is probably working in small groups , much like the one that met here the bali operation , an american official said , may have been the work of cells in several countries , none of them larger than six or eight men the fear now is that thailand will not only provide an easy base of operation for terrorists working in smaller cells , but also that the country itself is high on the list of potential targets as al qaeda shifts its focus to tourist sites we have already seen in recent months more and more information that tourist centers are under threat , the chief of german intelligence , august hanning , said this week it is because tourist centers cannot be guarded he named the philippines , indonesia and thailand as the likely next targets thailand has long been a route for drug traffickers and people smugglers , a country where guns and explosives are readily available and where preparing fraudulent documents is a developed industry it is easy to get a false passport in thailand , a european ambassador said adding , a professional terrorist can enter this country and leave quite easily , after having launched an attack even a thai intelligence official acknowledged that it would be relatively easy for a terrorist to hibernate in bangkok , a teeming city of 12 million people , thousands of whom are tourists or transients western diplomats agreed until recently , visas were not required here for citizens of most countries , including those from the middle east the government did not ask a lot of questions of visitors , especially of the foreign men who patronize the bars and nightclubs that form the center of bangkok s tourist industry who knows who s here , an ambassador said deepening worries is the relative inexperience and disorganization of thai intelligence agencies , which are short on manpower , training and resources , officials from several countries said generally speaking , they are considered better than the intelligence services in indonesia , the officials said , but not in league with a country like singapore i do n't think anyone s intelligence here is terrific , a western ambassador said but diplomats and others also said the qaeda presence in thailand , a largely buddhist country of 62 million people , is not as big as in indonesia , the world s most populous muslim nation nonetheless , in recent weeks germany , several other european nations and australia have issued warnings to their citizens to exercise extreme caution in certain popular tourist areas in thailand the united states has issued a new travel advisory covering all of southeast asia the western intelligence analyst summed up the reactions here since the bali blasts as hysteria , and a false sense of confidence western governments have overreacted with their travel warnings , he said , while the thai government has refused to face up to terrorist threat it faces it is not clear why the travel warnings vary from country to country , since they are sharing intelligence , diplomats said we interpreted it differently , an american diplomat said but several ambassadors acknowledged that the warnings were heavily influenced by the domestic political concerns of governments seeking to protect themselves against charges , in case of another attack , that they did not take all precautions photos a thai policeman inspected the ruins of one of five schools burned in arson attacks officials say the attacks are the work of local groups a youth prepares for a day at the beach on phuket island thailand says tourists are safe from attack \( reuters \)
mombasa , kenya , nov 30 as investigators struggled to determine who was behind the attacks on israeli targets here on thursday , they are reexamining evidence that east africa has served as both a useful base and a target for osama bin laden s terror network for nearly a decade we are aware that kenya has been bombed before by al qaeda and we do n't want to rule them out , julius sunkuli , kenya s internal security minister , said today mr sunkuli , with israeli and american help , is coordinating the investigation of the bombing of an israeliowned hotel and the failed missile attack on an israeli airliner the hotel attack killed 10 kenyans and 3 israelis , along with 3 suicide bombers but while al qaeda remains a strong suspect in the case , the kenyan police reported few leads today , the police released 2 of the 12 people who had been held for questioning an american woman and her spanish husband who had hastily checked out of a nearby hotel after the bombing officials said the two were apparently leaving because they were frightened and were not suspected of involvement the other 10 people still undergoing interrogation are 6 pakistanis and 4 somalis , none of whom have been confirmed to have connections to al qaeda , officials said the men had been detained several days before the attacks , for illegally entering mombasa s port on a small boat kenyan investigators called on the public again today to report any suspicious behavior but the record of recent years suggests the difficulties they may have in cracking the case american intelligence officials have said that suspects include al qaeda and al itihaad al islamiya , a somali terrorist group believed to have links to al qaeda evidence of al qaeda s operations in africa emerged even before the 1998 bombings of the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania but rooting out the terrorist network has proven especially challenging for intelligence agencies around the world most of the suspected qaeda operatives arrested by the kenyan police after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon were later released in one instance , the police announced the capture of a senior aide to mr bin laden , only to say later that they had mistakenly taken in a man with a similar name to my knowledge there were a number of arrests but nothing ever stuck , said a united states official who has monitored the kenyan investigations of al qaeda american officials have had similar difficulties in tracking the organization in africa , where porous borders and the easy availability of fraudulent passports make it easy for people to move around unnoticed and to bring weapons along for the ride we have always been very concerned about the susceptibility that africa offers to terrorist organizations , a senior united states official said today in a telephone interview from washington these countries have huge borders , long coastlines and populations in some areas that could be hospitable to terrorists difficulties have also been encountered in tanzania and uganda , where the local police rounded up scores of suspected qaeda members after sept 11 but never established definitive ties to the terrorist organization several months after the attacks in the united states , uganda s president , yoweri museveni , said , the americans recently captured some documents highlighting a possible uganda link to al qaeda they discovered that uganda was targeted for 'liberation' by mr bin laden s network , mr museveni said despite the difficulty in tracking qaeda operatives in africa , it is known that mr bin laden once lived in sudan , which borders on kenya according to evidence from the trial in new york last year of four men charged with conspiracy in the bombing of the american embassy in nairobi , mr bin laden sent some of his men to kenya in 1993 to scout out bombing targets , including not only the american embassy but also unspecified israeli interests evidence introduced in the trial also indicates that al qaeda has operated in the kenyan capital since at least 1993 , and in mombasa since 1994 in kenya , american investigators have said , al qaeda established safe houses for its members and others who were passing through it used small businesses and relief organizations to subsidize and conceal its activities , and it made the country a jumpingoff point for operations in other countries in the region for example , american officials said , a letter the authorities in nairobi seized in 1997 that was written by a member of the kenya cell warned that the americans knew that mr bin laden s operatives in kenya had helped to train the fighters who attacked american troops in somalia in 1993 , an assault in which 18

marie antoinette was a bit like diana , princess of wales beautiful , undereducated and na ve , the austrian archduchess was betrothed to a future king when she was still a teenager she had a tender heart but was woefully unprepared for dynastic intrigues and court life the 1770 marriage of marie antoinette to the future louis xvi was arranged to cement the alliance of two traditional enemies , france and austria her most important role was as a breeder of future kings like diana , marie antoinette acquired a public persona the moment of her betrothal she became a fashion icon as one of the few great beauties ever to become queen of france , she elicited jealousy among her peers and rapt attention from the french press charming , goodhearted and dutiful , marie antoinette seemed to have enjoyed only one role , that of patron of the arts , especially theater and music marie antoinette was the first queen of france to break with the tradition of selfeffacement to which the wives of louis xiv or xv had submitted before her , chantal thomas writes in the wicked queen the origins of the myth of marie antoinette \( translated by julie rose , zone books , 2001 \) she was the first to lend versailles her style , to impose her imprint on it , and to promulgate the dictates of fashion of course , the illfated queen eventually became a scapegoat , endlessly characterized in pamphlets as a frivolous spendthrift and scandalous agent of all vices she was the austrian , representing france s hereditary enemy ms thomas s book shows how the wickedqueen myth was propagated in ever more vicious ways in the years leading up to the french revolution no wonder marie antoinette wanted to create her own private world at the petit trianon , a beautiful pavilion that louis xv had built on the grounds of versailles louis xvi gave marie antoinette this architectural jewel in 1774 , the year he became king , and it became her favorite residence , a place to escape the burdens of court life the petit trianon is considered the masterpiece of angejacques gabriel in 1775 , gabriel was succeeded as chief architect to the king by richard mique marie antoinette had mique design several pleasure pavilions in le n tre s great park at versailles the queen s theater , a temple of love , a belvedere and the hamlet , a village of cottages with thatched roofs , including a dairy , a farmhouse , a dovecote and a mill of mique s buildings , the queen s theater is probably the least known , both then and now the performances were held in private , the actors and audience being none other than the queen , the members of the royal family and a few servants , g rald van der kemp wrote in versailles \( sotheby parke bernet publications , london , 1978 \) this is how little comic operas , such as 'the village soothsayer' by jeanjacques rousseau , were performed last fall , the world monuments fund completed a 785 , 000 restoration of the queen s theater , which will be used for special performances it is still too fragile to accommodate the general public , but groups of 20 or more can visit by appointment for 250 euros for the group \( requests for reservations may be faxed to the service des visites , ch teau de versailles , 01133130837790 \) there are probably only a halfdozen court theaters from the 17th and 18th centuries that still exist , said bonnie burnham , the director of the world monuments fund marie antoinette s is unique because it was really done for her , with her heraldry and d cor we took the restoration on because the balconies were at risk of falling down , the silk walls were in shreds and all the gilding had gone black john stubbs , the new york architect who has managed world monuments fund projects since 1990 , said the theater project at versailles was like archaeology it was never ransacked during the french revolution and had all its original stage mechanisms they still operate they are like rare antiques we did n't touch them why would marie antoinette want her own theater when she could have used the grand one in the chateau next door \? the queen wanted a private theater apart from the chateau because she liked to act onstage , said bertrand de vignaud , the chairman of christie s monaco and the head of the world monuments fund france she wanted to get away from the tensions at court mr vignaud noted that the queen was not allowed to travel except to other royal chateaus in paris , fontainebleau , st cloud and compi gne she spent her whole life in a small part of france , he said she traveled only in her mind the intimate theater seats only 120 those who were excluded got cross people wrongly assumed that the theater was very costly , mr vignaud said there were rumors that there were precious stones and pure gold on the walls from the outside , the theater looks anything but grand the simple building resembles a stonedressed barn perhaps mique did not want to attract the attention of anyone strolling nearby the interior , however , seems quite sumptuous , with gilded boxes and balconies and walls covered in blue silk from lyons it is the harmony of blue and gold favored by marie antoinette that makes it so beautiful , said pierre arrizoliclementel , a senior curator of the museum at versailles the ceiling , depicting apollo and the muses , was originally done by a famous painter of porcelains , lagren e it was destroyed and replicated by pierre paulet above the stage , two nymphs support a giant cartouche with the queen s monogram beneath the ceiling a series of oval \( oeil de boeuf \) loggias with gilded grills ring the room fittingly for a theater , none of the decoration is real the marble wainscoting around the orchestra is faux , as are the papierm ch balusters and the sets in her book , ms thomas describes how marie antoinette obtained the king s permission to put on and star in the beaumarchais play the barber of seville in her private theater she also acted in his marriage of figaro , an opera that incensed the king because it assailed seignurial power never a great reader , the queen may not have appreciated its satirical side nonetheless , acting was considered a dubious activity in the 18th century having a queen on the throne act in little comedies was criticized by everybody , mr arrizoliclementel said no queen had acted in public before marie antoinette each year there are nine million visitors to versailles , a quarter of whom are american it has been a major attraction for americans since before world war ii , mr vignaud said why \? it s france s largest and most beautiful chateau , with the best park and grounds , and a history linked with famous americans like ben franklin and thomas jefferson it is symbolic because of the french revolution , and it occupies a very special part in world history is that why the american friends of versailles are rebuilding louis xiv s three fountains bosquet and the world monuments fund did the queen s theater \? or are we simply romantic monarchists at heart \? photo the recently restored queen s theater on the grounds of versailles \( jeanmarc manai world monuments fund \)
berlin , feb 28 a european union that has become increasingly distant from its citizens began an extraordinary effort today to create a more representative government as the 15nation bloc expands across the continent and absorbs as many as nine new members a group of 105 parliamentarians , experts and governmental nominees opened a yearlong constitutional convention of sorts in brussels that was designed to chart a more efficient and more democratic structure for the growing union if we succeed , in 50 years' time , europe will have changed its role in the world , said the convention s chairman , val ry giscard d'estaing , the former french president it will be respected and listened to , not only as the economic power it already is , but as a political power that will speak as an equal with the largest existing and future powers on the planet symbolic of european aspirations for a more perfect association , the convention began on the day that national currencies like the french franc and the german mark officially stopped circulating , replaced by a single european currency , the euro , in 12 of the member states already creaking at its current size , the european union is expected to expand to as many as 24 nations by the middle of 2004 , as it takes in the poorer countries of formerly socialist eastern europe , with the balkan states and turkey still to come but how such a vastly bigger european union should be shaped and governed as a federation or as a confederation of different states , and in a way that small countries have a say and large countries have a stake and ordinary citizens feel some real connection to the bureaucrats in brussels has bedeviled busy leaders for years so last december , at their summit meeting in laeken , belgium , european nations agreed to set up this convention , which has been likened to the american constitutional convention of 1787 if we fail , mr giscard d'estaing warned the delegates today , each country will go back to the logic of a free trade area none of us , not even the biggest , would have sufficient weight to deal with the big powers of this world in his opening address today , he switched from french to english to german , and , rather like the pope at christmas , greeted the assembled ladies and gentlemen in all 11 official languages of the european union , and then in polish as a gesture to the candidate states how to better share sovereignty between brussels and the member states , whether to directly elect a president of europe , whether to give more executive powers to the governmentappointed european commission in brussels and more legislative powers to the european parliament are knotty questions that go to the heart of europe s future but the delegates will also grapple with how to make decisionmaking more efficient in a europe where some nations want to move faster than others and france , for example , does not want to lose the old principle , enshrined in the early days of the union , of equality with a germany that is now reunited and much larger nor do smaller states , like denmark , finland or ireland , want to be bulldozed by the larger states , so the smaller ones are likely to favor continued strong powers for the commission the convention could even try to draft a european constitution , which would try to put the last 50 years of stopgap treaties into one , coherent document it will be the leaders of the member nations who will receive the recommendations of this convention and decide what to do but it will be harder for the leaders to ignore the recommendations that emerge from this open process , and harder for them to maintain the european union as a topdown affair , with little power given to the european parliament for all the talk of philadelphia in 1787 , the dream of a united states of europe , which animated one of the european union s founders , jean monnet , the french economist , has been dead for years the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said that the real aim of this convention is not to build a superstate european integration is unique , he said , and the eu is unique in that it is a union of peoples and states but he supported the idea of a constitution for europe , saying that such a document would mark the birth of europe as a political entity
boston , nov 26 boston s archbishop , cardinal bernard f law , met today for the first time with voice of the faithful , a fastgrowing group of lay roman catholics that the cardinal has largely shunned for months but cardinal law declined , at least for the time being , to lift a ban on the group s meeting in most churches and to accept donations from the group , voice of the faithful leaders said and the cardinal , who would not discuss the meeting today , repeatedly asked whether voice of the faithful saw itself as outside the authority of the church , saying that was his major concern the cardinal did agree to allow the group to meet with other archdiocesan officials to discuss those issues and he did not rule out agreeing to some of the organization s requests in the future leaders of voice of the faithful , which formed in response to the sexual abuse scandal in the clergy , expressed a restrained optimism i do n't know how you score it , said james e post , president of the lay group , which wants the laity to have a greater role in the governing of the church i think in negotiations you either go in looking for specific outcomes , or you go in looking to build a relationship i think we made progress on the relationship side , since we had none and anything was a step forward dr post added i think there were the hopeful signs of progress on the specific outcomes i had the sense of being with people who wanted to figure out how to work together because they did n't want to ignore the reality of voice of the faithful , but there was going to have to be some kind of moving around , a kind of dance the meeting reflected the embattled cardinal s new approach to the scandal that has devastated his archdiocese , part of several steps he has taken in response to pressure from priests and lay people to be more open , acknowledge his mistakes and show greater humility but the meeting also came as the archdiocese faced renewed criticism for trying to conceal information about its handling of abusive priests on monday , the judge responsible for hearing sexual abuse lawsuits excoriated the archdiocese , accusing it of trying to keep thousands of pages of documents from the public at today s meeting , both the receptive and the selfprotective sides of the cardinal were on display , said voice of the faithful leaders who attended there were some moments of tension , said bill cadigan , the group s vice president and one of four leaders who attended the meeting at the chancery they arose concerning issues regarding our view versus the cardinal s view of the legitimacy of the existence of our organization , the discussions regarding the bannings of our group from church property , and the desire to see a more open process of governing within the church at the same time , said mary scanlon calcaterra , another leader at the meeting , there was some disarmament the archdiocese issued a noncommittal statement , saying the meeting was intended to obtain greater clarity on how voice of the faithful , as an organization , sees itself in relationship to the church and how it would hope to be seen and recognized by the church the statement , by a spokeswoman , donna m morrissey , added while the emergence of new groups is a constant in the history of the church , a proper discernment must always take place to ensure their compatibility with the faith , discipline and mission of the church today s meeting was a step in that discernment concerning the voice of the faithful on the part of the archbishop dr post said the cardinal was quite formal in the beginning , opening by saying , 'i know we 're scheduled for two hours , but we probably do n't need all that time for this meeting' then he kind of crisply moved through what he had to say that was not a hopeful sign the organization , which started in february with 40 people meeting and now claims 25 , 000 members in 40 states , had given the archdiocese a proposed agenda for the meeting but they never accepted the agenda , dr post , a professor at boston university , said they kind of danced around it the meeting lasted a little over two hours cardinal law twice said he would have preferred if the group had sought permission from the archdiocese before forming , mr cadigan said dr post said , his primary concern was , are we who we say we are and what will we continue to be in the life of the church dr post added , he needed to be sure that the kind of changes we envisioned were not to create some sort of structure outside the church that would challenge the church in a negative way the great unspoken question was , is voice of the faithful involved in a kind of splitting of the church , dr post said nobody said schism , ' but that was the unspoken word voice of the faithful leaders told the cardinal that their goal of greater involvement by the laity did not mean changing the dogma of the church , only the human mechanism governing it , dr post said we told him we are people very involved in our parishes , he said we have all of these different roles as teachers and eucharistic ministers and lectors and people who go to church regularly we 're kind of the bedrock catholics of the church
washington , sunday , oct 20 detectives tracking the deadly suburban sniper raced to a shooting near richmond , va , on saturday night as the police reported that a man had been wounded by a single shot in a parking lot outside a shopping center restaurant investigators pursuing the sniper , who has killed nine people and wounded two so far this month , emphasized it was not immediately known whether the shooting , of a 37yearold man outside a ponderosa steakhouse in ashland , va , 90 miles south of washington , was part of the spree that has frightened the washington area since oct 2 chief frederic pleasants of the ashland police and other authorities in hanover county said the victim was hit by a single shot the sniper s signature mark after he left the restaurant with his wife about 8 pm the man , who was not immediately identified , was at a local hospital in critical condition this morning the shot came out of the darkness , said the hanover county sheriff , stuart cook , at a news conference in ashland asked if the shooting was part of the sniper spree , sheriff cook said , we 're going to treat it as if it is until we know it s not a dragnet was put into effect with the news of the shooting , centered on nearby interstate 95 , the main east coast highway where leaders of the manhunt have focused we 're not taking any chances , sheriff cook said witnesses in the new shooting said they thought the shot had come from a wooded area bordering the shopping center this led to speculation that the gunman s method was similar to the shootings in the washington area but there was no confirmation of fears that the sniper might have enlarged his range significantly beyond the washington beltway area the shooting set off a latenight alarm across the washington commuter region immediately , there was speculation that the sniper , who had previously not been active on weekends , might be changing his method the shooting was one of several during the day in which tense teams of investigators awaited the deadly sniper s next move the frenetic manhunt focused on a white truck once more on saturday as the police , making no claims of a breakthrough , examined a truck seized in virginia that they said contained a shell casing with forensic tests still under way , the police said there would be no firm word until later in the week on whether the find might be related to the sniper who has killed nine and wounded two this month but the truck s discovery on friday at a rental agency near dulles international airport , west of the washington beltway , supplied a fresh focus of hope for hardpressed investigators and excitement for the many reporters camped outside montgomery county police headquarters , where the search is headquartered a white cargo truck has been urgently sought by the police since the first killings with 200 detectives and hundreds of uniformed police invested full time in the manhunt , the investigation ground forward this weekend across five counties and hundreds of square miles of the washington suburbs the unified local , state and federal police task force was braced for another possible attack by the gunman , who last struck on monday manhunt leaders continued pleading with the public for more information about a neighbor , a stranger or a troubled family member that might lead to the killer s identity they made a show of force this weekend along the complex ribbons of commuter roads that the sniper has been able to master even as the police vetted traffic with drawn guns it s a whodunit at this point , chief charlie deane of the prince william county police admitted on oct 10 , after the sniper killed a seventh person in eight days , shooting a man in the head as he was filling his gas tank in manassas , va nine days and two more deaths later , the identity of the gunman remains no less mysterious one member of the manhunt team , just before fresh hope arose with the finding of the truck in virginia , described the investigation as unbelievably quiet at its heart , despite all the energy being poured into it by rolling teams of detectives the public could only hope the police did not share its sense of bafflement as the sniper remained on the loose for a third week even one small point of relative comfort that the killer had gone over four days without striking , his longest ceasefire thus far only underlined the worry that he was therefore due to strike again at any moment to this point , the manhunt has been a 17day frenzy punctuated by meticulous singleshot attacks and a dearth of promising clues earlier last week , detectives were crestfallen at having to charge one of their few promising witnesses with being a fabulist who misled them with a tale about having seen the sniper still , the gunman s image and pattern have become clearer , if silhouettelike and only at the cost of each dreadful attack the detectives in the manhunt admit that they do not know enough , but they know these signature characteristics the sniper chooses his shooting perch far more carefully than he chooses the victim who finally wanders across his sights as he patiently waits he prefers a clean shot at a random stranger caught in some unguarded , mundane moment

paris , june 7 venus and serena williams worked their way down the lunch line linked as closely as paper dolls , side by side as they inspected the cafeteria spread , inseparable as they searched out a table moments earlier , they had been hitting together on a practice court at roland garros now they were laughing together over lunch sisterhood as usual but on saturday , they will step into the finals of the french open and try on the skin of strangers if this meeting is anything like the others , they wo n't make eye contact on the changeovers , acknowledge a good shot of the other or let a bad line call go without an argument but try as they might , they have never competed without genetic baggage blood dilutes their killer instincts kinship takes the edge off the overheads they have n't played up to their potential , their mother , oracene williams , said of their facetoface encounters there might be a barrier they are sisters you ca n't neglect that fact spy novels are laced with fewer plots than the debate surrounding an allwilliams final if one does n't play well , it must be the other s turn to win if one unleashes more unforced errors , it must be part of a family strategy many players believe it , some onlookers swear by it and jennifer capriati only added to it with her collusion theories after losing to serena in the semifinals according to her logic , even the sisters' ascent to no 1 and no 2 in the ranking is probably by design wishful thinking , oracene williams said with a smile in reality , the sisters' unbelievable rise in the ranking , but uninspiring play against each other , is less a sinister plan and more the product of the subconscious to have no mercy against other opponents is one thing , but to prey on a sister s vulnerable moment is another they have played seven matches against each other , with venus winning five of them none have left anyone spellbound by the level of play that could change this time there is a chance that after enough time as opponents on grand stages , venus and serena will find a rhythm that will manufacture at least a few compelling points there is a chance the one in a groove will be serena in the three years since she won the united states open , becoming the first of the two sisters to nab a major , she has watched venus capture four major titles the 2001 united states open was venus s last , a title she accepted on the court with her arm draped around serena , the crestfallen runnerup this time , i 'd like to see serena get one since she has n't had one since 1999 , oracene williams said serena may be in position to do it on the clay surface , she has compact steps , bursts of speed and the ability to slide on a dropvolley shot that she got against capriati on thursday , serena left the skid mark of a getaway car angular in body style , venus is n't built for clay she has the wingspan of a condor and the speed to match , but her loping strides and reluctance to slide may leave her with a disadvantage the tale of the tape aside , serena may simply be hungrier than venus for the french open title and more serious about tennis than she has been in the past few years right now , i really want to win the french open , and i'm sure she does , too , serena said i think in the beginning , maybe for me , it was a bit tougher to play her because of me being the younger sister but now , i'm just i'm really i want to win a grand slam more than anything i think at the us open , i was too caught up with getting back to the finals serena s emotions tend to surface quicker than venus s her nerves are more transparent , too this spring , serena has proven less vulnerable to the turns of her stomach that have overwhelmed her in the past not only did she brush venus aside in key biscayne , fla , with a straightset victory early this spring , she came back against capriati in two tense matches on thursday , she made it a third , outlasting capriati once again serena has been playing really well , intensity level , running well , venus said we 've practiced a lot on clay i guess we 'll be running down a lot of balls that is the hope long points , passionate rallies , an exciting final usually , that s not too much to expect of the no 1 and no 2 players in the world but sisters make complicated adversaries , a fact underscored by venus s wish for serena to find as much success as she has actually , i 'd like to stay no 1 , but i 'd like to see serena no 1 also , venus said i'm not giving it up , but i'm sure she 'll get there either way , they 'll be side by side , with no sign of jealousy in between it s just a sport , oracene said what it is , tennis is on the court off the court , we do n't even talk about it

washington , may 17 as the pentagon prepares for a possible invasion of iraq , military planners say the most complicated problem they face is the chance that president saddam hussein might use chemical or biological weapons against american forces and their allies that prospect has colored planning for almost every aspect of a possible invasion , from training and supplies to the location of an assault and the best time of year to begin , military officials said that mr hussein might fire missiles tipped with chemical or biological warheads at israel and other allies has also prompted discussion of a host of preemptive options for destroying his stockpiles or limiting his ability to use them none of those theoretical problems are considered large enough to deter an attack , senior military officials said but they are more complex than the threats posed by mr hussein s conventional weapons , because of the destructive nature of chemical and biological weapons and the widespread panic they can induce , the officials said the threat of biological or chemical attacks plays a huge role in preliminary planning about iraq , said a senior military officer involved in the process , which is under way even though president bush has not decided that any military action should be taken without question , it s the toughest nut to crack , the officer said though iraq possessed chemical and probably biological weapons during the persian gulf war of 1991 , it did not use them , possibly because of american threats of retaliation but now that president bush has placed himself behind an effort to change governments in baghdad , military experts and pentagon officials say they must assume that mr hussein would use every weapon in his arsenal this time , once the tanks start rolling , saddam knows they wo n't stop until they reach baghdad , said kenneth m pollack , the director for national security studies at the council on foreign relations and the former director for persian gulf affairs in president bill clinton s national security council he has no incentive for restraint unlike iraq s tanks , artillery and aircraft , which pentagon planners do not find particularly intimidating , chemical and biological weapons are less well understood and induce more fear those weapons are thought to include sarin and vx gas which attack the central nervous system , causing paralysis , convulsions and death as well as anthrax and botulism , said charles a duelfer , the former deputy chairman of the united nations commission that monitored iraq s chemical and biological weapons programs until 2000 to deliver those agents , iraq has between one dozen and three dozen advanced scud missiles that can travel up to 375 miles , iraq analysts said it is also thought to have drones , artillery shells and bombs capable of dispersing chemical and biological agents whatever he s got now , it s less than what he had in 1991 , mr duelfer said but in 1991 we were n't going to baghdad it s different now american forces have not been attacked with chemical weapons since world war i , the pentagon says though troops are equipped with chemical suits , trained in the basics of chemical defense and inoculated against certain biotoxins , not even the most seasoned officers have any battlefield experience with chemical or biological weapons just the threat of its use can psychologically help an enemy , said lt col john kulifay , chief of doctrine at the army s chemical school at fort leonard wood in missouri it causes confusion and takes away your focus at the chemical school , trainers try to give soldiers a taste of that fear and confusion inside a semicircular building nestled in the woods , soldiers wearing masks and fullbody chemical suits are put into airtight chambers tainted with enough poisonous nerve gas to kill scores of them before entering , trainees have a tendency to strap their masks on so tightly that their heads throb some break down in tears they 've seen pictures of what saddam hussein did to his own people with chemical weapons , said staff sgt brad koland , an instructor the chemical suits , though lighter than those used a decade ago , are still very hot and cumbersome , reducing dexterity and lowering a soldier s ability to spot a target by as much as 20 percent , pentagon studies have shown so the threat of chemical weapons , much less their use , can significantly slow the tempo at which units operate , forcing them to conduct repeated chemical and biological detection tests and to carry much more water than normal , both for drinking and decontaminating equipment the implications for desert warfare are obvious pentagon planners say they would prefer to avoid attacking in the summer because of the health problems and logistical difficulties created by wearing chemical suits in hot weather the school at fort leonard wood trains about 5 , 000 soldiers a year , enough to fill a specialized brigade and to place chemical warfare specialists in most combat command units altogether , the army has 17 , 587 soldiers with this training military experts say the pentagon is also considering a range of preemptive strikes to damage iraq s biological and chemical stores , as well as the weapons to deliver them , before an invasion begins the problem , officials said , is finding the stockpiles mr hussein is thought to store those weapons in deeply buried bunkers that are difficult to demolish with nonnuclear weapons he also moves his weapons about to avoid detection , and may even keep some near civilian areas to discourage attacks that might cause deadly plumes to waft over hospitals , schools and homes , military experts said we look , for example , today at terrorist states , and they are literally putting their weapons of mass destruction capability right next to schools and hospitals and mosques , purposely , secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld said in a senate hearing this week to allay israel s worries about being attacked , the pentagon will probably send antimissile systems to israel that are capable of shooting down scuds another proposal calls for quickly seizing western iraq at the outset of an invasion , to limit mr hussein s ability to lob scud missiles across jordan into israel , military experts said for all the concerns , there is a broad consensus that the united states is better prepared for chemical and biological attacks than a decade ago nevertheless , said walter b slocombe , who was the under secretary of defense for policy in the clinton administration , the use of chemical or biological weapons would be a horror it would n't stop the war , he said , and saddam wo n't win the war because of them , and it should n't be a showstopper but you 've got to be ready for casualties
the food and drug administration yesterday shut down a substantial part of the cryolife corporation , the nation s largest processor of donated human tissue , saying the company could not adequately assure patients that its softtissue products were free of deadly bacteria and fungi the agency ordered the company to recall all soft tissues such as tendons , ligaments and cartilage processed since oct 3 and to withhold from the market or destroy tissue processed after that date the tissues , obtained from cadavers , are widely used in elective orthopedic surgery to repair wornout knees and other joints the agency said 27 people had developed serious infections after receiving tissue implants processed by the company , and one of them had died the centers for disease control and prevention learned about possible problems with the tissues in november and since then has been investigating the company with the food and drug agency , which has regulatory authority over cryolife the agency said it was considering a similar recall of heart valves processed by the company if they are found to pose similar contamination risks cryolife processes soft tissues and heart valves with identical technology , but the two types of tissue are regulated by different arms of the food and drug agency the company plans to continue providing heart valves , veins and other products used in surgery the agency said people who became ill after receiving softtissue implants usually developed symptoms within days or a few weeks of their surgery , so people who have had implants longer than that are probably in no danger but it can take months for infections in heart valves to produce symptoms , they said recipients of cryolife heart valves and recent recipients of softtissue implants should consult their doctors , the agency said about 650 , 000 americans have surgery involving softtissue implants each year , and cryolife supplies 15 to 20 percent of the market cryolife is the nation s largest supplier of heart valves obtained from human donors it processes 70 percent of the nation s heart valves and 90 percent of vascular tissue recall orders like the one issued today are rare , said dr mary malarkey , director of the division of case management in the food and drug agency s office of compliance and biologics quality the agency inspected cryolife s operations in kennesaw , ga , for two weeks last march and april we found significant violations from our regulations , dr malarkey said what they were doing did not ensure tissue safety cryolife responded to the agency s concerns on may 15 , dr malarkey said , and we deemed their response inadequate the fda sent a warning letter to the company on june 17 and since then the company has not responded in ways that assure that their material is not bacterially contaminated , dr malarkey said with the issues unresolved , the fda decided to stop the sale of soft tissues until further notice william kitchens , a cryolife lawyer , said that the company filed an appeal yesterday with the fda requesting a hearing and change in the order to allow limited distribution of tissue used for bypass surgery and dialysis patients with two exceptions , cryolife has not admitted to causing any infections in any tissue recipients according to david fronk , vice president of clinical research , all surgery is risky and microbes can be introduced through many routes , including operating rooms and surgeons cryolife has never maintained that its products are absolutely safe , he said you cannot sterilize tissue and maintain its functionality , dr fronk said most orthopedic surgery using these tissues is elective , dr malarkey said , and there are enough other processors that we hope it will not pose a supply problem by contrast , most heartvalve surgery is lifesustaining it is uncertain if other suppliers could meet the demand for heart valves , which has often involved emergency surgery at least nine families are suing the company , accusing it of killing or maiming patients with contaminated tissues a classaction suit on behalf of investors was filed on july 16 saying that cryolife issued false and misleading statements regarding qualitycontrol problems the new york stock exchange suspended trading of cryolife stock at 12 29 pm when shares fell 42 percent to 552 more than 150 small tissue banks across the country the exact number is not known collect tissue from human cadavers and turn it over to companies like cryolife , which process it for transplantation the companies charge a fee to doctors who implant the tissues a human body can supply enough tissue for 30 orthopedic transplants tissue processors use various technologies to disinfect tissues the one used most commonly for soft tissues and heart valves involves soaking the tissues in an antimicrobial solution at a particular temperature for a certain length of time many such recipes are proprietary companies that are members of the american association of tissue banks follow nonsecret procedures , including the practice of testing tissues before they are soaked in the solution designed to kill bacteria and fungi cryolife is not a member of the association
lawrenceville , nj , oct 23 in may , when douglas r forrester first asserted that his prescription drug insurance company was worth more than 100 million , new jersey s republican primary for the senate quickly changed from a competitive race into a victory lap for mr forrester but since mr forrester s reported wealth and presumed ability to help pay for his senate race turned him from an unknown to the republican candidate , the 100 million estimate has played a very different role now , it appears that the company , of which mr forrester owns 51 percent , is worth far less than 100 million and the original estimate seems to be hindering his campaign , not helping it by claiming such substantial wealth , mr forrester gave many new jersey republicans an excuse to sit on their checkbooks , and he has raised barely 1 million for the general election democrats , meanwhile , have used the 100 million figure to accuse him of gouging his customers in a year when the enron and worldcom accounting scandals have made corporate ethics a national concern , democrats charge that mr forrester made windfall profits by engaging in shady business practices even though they have produced virtually no evidence of any misdeeds involving his company , benecard services and it is not clear at all what the company is worth mr forrester will not release company records or describe the formula he used to calculate his company s value , but says that his rough estimate of benecard s worth was reasonable given the aggressively high values many high tech companies boasted about before the dotcom market crashed as he tries to convince voters that his experience in the pharmaceutical business would help the senate devise an effective federal prescription drug plan , mr forrester often finds himself forced to defend wealth he almost certainly does not have it s frustrating , frankly , he said in an interview last week there have been so many distortions that people lose sight of what is really at stake here , and that s the issue of getting people the prescriptions they need at an affordable price no one disputes that mr forrester has been successful in the littleunderstood field of pharmacy benefit management , the companies behind the plastic cards most americans hand to druggists when they fill prescriptions after leaving the state division of pensions in 1989 , mr forrester teamed up with richard ullman , whose company , national prescription administrators , was looking to expand mr ullman recruited mr forrester to run and coown benecard , which specialized in selling national prescription s plans to small businesses , local governments and municipal unions having served as the mayor of west windsor , mr forrester knew that local governments were desperate for a way to manage prescription coverage costs as new jersey s former director of pensions , he had impressive political connections mr forrester said his original goal was to broaden the company s client base , which heavily depended on contracts with local governments today the business is split almost evenly between public and private sector clients during the 13 years that mr forrester has run benecard , the soaring cost of prescriptions has spurred tremendous growth and profitability among pharmacy benefit managers , known as pbm s they now cover more than 70 percent of all americans benecard has remained a relatively small niche player in the industry , however it has 18 employees working out of a headquarters in a suburb of trenton gauging the precise value of a privately held company is an exercise in interpretation , but a few financial details that have emerged about benecard in the past year offer some guidance credit agencies estimate that benecard handles 13 million in annual revenues a figure mr forrester would not confirm , but described as a rational assessment he has also said that his company s profit margin is less than 10 percent because most wall street analysts estimate that a company s value is about 10 times its earnings , those numbers would seem to indicate benecard s value at far less than 100 million while there are those who would dispute his estimate , mr forrester said he thought it was a fair , goodfaith assessment but he added that his legal and business advisers had told him that the most responsible course of action would be to err on the side of overreporting his worth so after consulting with his accountants , mr forrester checked the highest box on the senate disclosure form , which stated that his stake in the company was worth more than 50 million pbm s are a highgrowth industry , mr forrester said look at the course of the valuation of amazon dotcom stock their worth was remarkable , but their earnings were negative whatever mr forrester s intentions , the result has been to convince many republicans that he is wealthy enough to pay for his campaign without their help when people heard that his company was worth 100 million , they unfortunately got the misconception that we had a republican jon corzine who could spend 68 million to get elected , said joseph r kyrillos jr , the state republican chairman but that s not the case
if there was a form of government that produced autocrats who sponsored terrorism , stole millions of dollars while impoverishing their citizens , shredded public education and health , permitted child bondage , tortured dissidents and tolerated pogroms against minorities , then we would all condemn it except that in south asia such a system is called democracy that s what makes this week s election in pakistan so fascinating president bush has winked as gen pervez musharraf steamrolled over a democratic system so as to maintain the army s hold on power mr bush s stance is hypocritical and threatens to undermine everything we stand for except that , frankly , general musharraf has done better in governing pakistan than his democratic predecessors have the pakistan election has an importance beyond that country that rigged referendum and our complicity in it raise questions about what constitutes democracy without much of a sense of gritty realities in the developing world , we in the west tend to regard democracy as simply elections when trouble erupts in cambodia , somalia , east timor , afghanistan , angola we prescribe elections , bless the result as democracy , and hurry off we place an inordinate emphasis on elections alone , noted sumit ganguly , an expert on the region at the university of texas at austin he notes that elections are only one element of a democracy others include a free press , an independent judiciary and respect for minorities without these checks , countries can end up with elections that \( as in pakistan \) are used by drug lords as a convenient way to install their pals in important offices once in place , they can use their power to steal money and murder critics when we followed the democratic path , we got only disappointment , said arif ali khan abbasi , the former chief executive of pakistan international airways at least there is a semblance of order when you get a benevolent dictator that s how washington feels as well as a quasidemocracy , pakistan was pretty close to a terrorist state then general musharraf seized power in 1999 , installed himself as president in 2001 and \( after 9 11 , with an american gun to his head \) began to turn the country away from terror and extremism it s quite a task a poll last fall found that 82 percent of urban pakistanis regard osama bin laden as a freedom fighter pakistan s intelligence agency is responsible for more terrorist killings than al qaeda the country has been on the edge of bankruptcy , 55 percent of adults are illiterate , 10 percent of children die by the age of 5 , and there are more drug addicts than college graduates prior to 9 11 , all of us considered pakistan a failing state , 5 , 10 or 15 years away from collapse in one way or another , said marshall bouton , an expert on the region and president of the chicago council on foreign relations more broadly , south asia as a whole is both impressive in the way it has sustained democracies and depressing in how poorly the democracies have often served their citizens indeed , in sri lanka elections led to the rise of demagogues who competed for votes among the majority sinhalese population by pledging to discriminate against the minority tamils they got the votes , and sri lanka got civil war none of this is to argue against democracy , though , because \( aside from general musharraf \) military rulers in the area have been even worse as najam sethi , a prominent pakistani newspaper editor , puts it yes , the experiments with democracy have not been successful , but the experiments with military dictatorship have been disastrous for that reason , mr sethi and many others with whom i spoke are horrified by general musharraf s fraudulent referendum to stay in power but i ca n't help thinking that pakistan may be better off under him if only he will use his power to build credible democratic institutions , starting with the parliamentary elections in october one hopeful sign is that he is instituting local councils whose members must be onethird women a remarkable step in a country where women often are doormats if we are to wink at general musharraf s charade , we must at least press him to promote not just the army but also an independent judiciary , press , parliament and other pillars of a free society
san francisco , nov 5 a notepadsize computer controlled by a pen has long been one of silicon valley s most cherished ideas and one of the most elusive in unveiling its new tablet computer system amid much fanfare on thursday , microsoft of redmond , wash , is betting that it can succeed where dozens of silicon valley companies have failed the pen computing vision has consistently led to the valley s most spectacular commercial flops among them were failed efforts like grid , agilis , the go corporation , eo , general magic , apple , momenta and others nevertheless , for more than a year bill gates , microsoft s chairman , has been proclaiming the features of a style of tablet computing that he asserts will come to displace both desktop and portable computing the company has tailored its windows xp operating system for pen computing and designed hardware features for tablet computers to enhance readability microsoft s marketing blitz has clearly irritated the small community of silicon valley designers who pursued these same technologies long ago if they 're actually claiming the innovation high ground , they 're just not being observant of history , said paul mercer , a designer who worked on a variety of handheld pen computers at apple computer in the early 1990 s it s just wrong the microsoft notion of tablet computing does not have many believers among the pioneer designers of handheld pc s who found that consumers largely ignored their systems several generations ago indeed , many think that mr gates may have succumbed to the same form of technological hubris that led to john sculley s downfall , in part over the failure of the handheld newton , at apple computer in 1993 at the same time , several of the pioneers would not rule out the possibility that microsoft might succeed where others have failed you have to give microsoft credit for persistence , said larry tesler , who led the newton project at apple being too early is often the worst mistake microsoft has acknowledged that its designers have not made significant progress in handwriting recognition , opting instead to try to convince users to work with electronic ink users can scribble their notes on the computer s screen and leave them in handwritten form microsoft s software will then seek to recognize words in the background and turn them into electronic text , permitting them to be searched later despite such features , skeptics in silicon valley said that microsoft s new product is too similar to existing notebook computers to be successful it s the same old story , said jerry kaplan , an entrepreneur who help found the go corporation to build a pen computer in the late 1980 s if you attach a pen to a laptop , it s going to look and feel like one and have all the same limits microsoft s growing power as a hardware designer has raised concerns among silicon valley executives as well while the company was once only a software publisher , it is now designing phones , personal digital assistants , video game players , and now tablet computers , which are then manufactured by consumer electronics and computer makers that gives the company more control over the electronics industry while insulating it from financial risk the ironic thing is they have just as much control over the hardware as apple has over its computers , but they have none of the risk , said stewart alsop , a venture capitalist at new enterprise associates in menlo park , calif on thursday , at an event in new york city , mr gates will announce the release of the company s windows xp tablet pc edition in partnership with eight companies , including acer , fujitsu , hewlettpackard and others the company is expected to proclaim that tabletstyle computing with a pen is a more natural and easier to use technology than personal computers with keyboard and mouse mr gates has said the machines will be used as notetakers for professionals in meetings , reading tools for next generation electronic books and automation tools for a range of workers , from doctors and nurses to sales representatives and delivery workers despite a multiyear development effort , the company s challenge will be to convince users that it has done better than the silicon valley companies of the early 1990 s in solving the fundamental problems of pen computing , for example , poor handwriting recognition and the inefficiencies involved in managing large amounts of text with a pen the challenge is compounded because the tablet companies are hoping to persuade users to pay a premium of 10 percent to 20 percent over the cost of today s notebooks , meaning that the machines will generally be priced from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 if microsoft succeeds where others failed , it will probably increase the residue of bitterness here among those who believe that a decade ago the company killed a nascent pen computing industry because it thought it would be a threat to its windows operating system business mr kaplan has described in his book startup a silicon valley adventure \( houghton mifflin , 1995 \) how microsoft succeeded in persuading compaq computer to adopt its unfinished pen windows software over go s operating system that decision undermined go s business , even though microsoft s pen windows and winpad were never released the belief that microsoft was involved in the demise of go contributed to the enmity that grew between it and its silicon valley competitors , which eventually led to the justice department antitrust suit if go had ever been given the chance , they would have succeeded , mr alsop said photos microsoft s tablet pc , to be introduced today , can handwrite email messages \( john rizzo for the new york times \) \( pg c1 \) leland a rockoff , director of the microsoft tablet pc group , left , and cory linton , project manager , prepare a display for today s unveiling \( john rizzo for the new york times \) \( pg c5 \)

hauppauge , ny , april 24 ronald j caputo works on long island , where he was born and grew up , but he says he can no longer afford to live here mr caputo , his wife and four children were told last year that they would have to leave the house they rented in port jefferson , which the owner was selling to take advantage of soaring real estate prices desperate to stay within their budget , the family scoured the region and eventually moved to a house renting for 1 , 150 a month in mount pocono , pa his resulting commute is a nightmare he drives 105 miles through new jersey , new york city and nassau county to his office in suffolk , averaging about three hours , with a return trip to match i could n't find anything on long island under 2 , 500 , said mr caputo , 37 , an organizer for a painters' union who says his family income is a bit over 80 , 000 a year i 'd never be able to save to buy a home the caputos are not the only refugees of high rent flocking to pennsylvania everybody we meet in that area , guess where they are from \? he said new york predominantly long islanders , working in manhattan there is a reason as the nation s first postworld war ii suburb , long island enshrined the singlefamily homeowner and generally barred multiple dwellings today the island has one of the nation s smallest supplies of rental housing the few that exist carry exorbitant price tags , making the island the nation s fifth most expensive metropolitan area for rentals despite past political prohibitions of multiplefamily housing , now there is a major new effort to build more a new group called the long island campaign for affordable rental housing gathered here today to announce a push for more low and moderateincome rentals there is no more important human or economic problem confronting long island today than affordable housing , said matthew crosson , president of the long island association , a leading business group that has joined in the new organization , a coalition of religious , government , civic , labor , environmental and nonprofit groups families have been dislocated , families are spread all across the us because children who grew up on long island cannot afford to live here , mr crosson said this cannot continue the shortage of rentals is also crimping business because employers have a hard time recruiting workers and paying the salaries to meet housing costs we are strangling ourselves , mr crosson said to foster new rentals , the coalition proposes tax abatements for developers , using surplus public land for housing , redeveloping downtown areas and a model zoning law enabling higher density and requiring developers to include housing for a range of income levels or , alternatively , to pay fees to a housing trust fund most early long island suburbanites came from new york city to escape the density of highrise buildings and multiple dwellings zoning laws here imposed their wishes , and so only 20 percent of long island s housing is rental property in new york city the rate is about 66 percent , and nationwide is 33 percent the unintended consequence is that long island has few rentals for the elderly , singles , newlyweds and service workers with modest paychecks many people left new york city to find an idyllic suburban environment , the suffolk county executive , robert j gaffney , said today we became exactly what we wanted to be , but we found that it no longer works on a personal note , mr gaffney added i speak to you not only as the county executive but as the father of a married daughter who lives in colorado and who explored the options of affordable rentals in suffolk county and found that there are virtually none individual stories like that may help turn the tide against town and village zoning restrictions and against school officials' fears that more rentals will produce a surge of new students fears that housing proponents say are unfounded i have seen a real change in resistance to housing proposals , said jim morgo , president of the long island housing partnership , a nonprofit group everybody has someone who ca n't find a home it s the same people who advocated exclusionary zoning whose children now ca n't afford to live here homeownership costs have soared selling prices average nearly 240 , 000 in suffolk and more than 300 , 000 in nassau rentals offer little relief federal statistics show that the fairmarket rent for a twobedroom apartment on long island is 1 , 230 to afford that , according to federal guidelines , a tenant should be earning 2365 an hour nearly five times the minimum wage the only areas in the nation where tenants need to earn more than that to pay local rents are oakland , calif , 2390 an hour stamfordnorwalk , conn , 2662 san jose , calif , 3062 , and san francisco , 3360 over the years long island governments and religious and other nonprofit groups have built some subsidized apartments , especially for the elderly planners say tens of thousands more are needed , just to meet existing needs

is conan o'brien , the nbc latenight star , up for grabs \? not officially , anyway executives from nbc acknowledged last week that they were aware that representatives of the fox network have made approaches to mr o'brien over the last several months to determine if he would be interested in switching networks when his contract ends next august several articles last week , including one in tv guide , reported that fox was willing to make mr o'brien a substantial financial offer to jump networks while executives on both sides confirmed that there have been getacquainted talks between fox and mr o'brien and his representatives , no one from fox has made any offers or even negotiated with mr o'brien they cannot , and will not , be able to for almost two months nbc holds an exclusive negotiating period with mr o'brien through march 15 , meaning that only nbc can legally discuss a new contract before that date senior nbc executives said they would offer mr o'brien a new fouryear contract and were confident they would be able to resign him as host of the network s late night program , broadcast weeknights at 12 35 am it s not going to be a problem , one senior nbc executive said one reason for nbc s confidence is the risk mr o'brien would be taking in going to fox , which has never had a successful latenight program the fox show would be set for 11 pm weeknights giving mr o'brien a head start on the nbc and cbs latenight shows at 11 35 pm but a new latenight show on fox would not follow fox s primetime programs , which have the kind of younger audience mr o'brien would like to reach , but would mostly follow hourlong newscasts on fox stations nbc has been in a similar situation before , having seen the last host of late night , david letterman , jump to cbs in 1993 after badly bungled negotiations one would think they would have liked to have this wrapped up by now , said one executive close to the o'brien side of the negotiations they have a history of throwing up all over their shoes on this nbc executives have also had a history of being less than completely attentive to mr o'brien he spent the early years on late night on very shortterm contracts 13 weeks long at one point and only more recently , with ratings and critical praise increasing , has he won a degree of longterm security but an nbc executive noted that the exclusive negotiating period had so much longer to run that there has not been undue pressure to make the deal yet nbc is committed to keeping mr o'brien , the executive said , from the network chairman , bob wright , on down mr wright attended mr o'brien s wedding earlier this month , and even took a moment at the reception to express his intention to work out a new deal soon , an attendee at the wedding said none of the principals would comment on the record about either the fox approach to mr o'brien or nbc s effort to keep him despite several efforts , the fox network has not been able to build a successful franchise in late night in 1992 , fox made a bigger financial offer to mr letterman than cbs in trying to win him at that time then fox turned to chevy chase , whose program failed quickly fox has continued to include a clause in its affiliate deals that would mandate that fox affiliates carry a new latenight series should it initiate one mr o'brien has met with top executives like sandy grushow , the chairman of fox entertainment , and peter chernin , the chairman of the news corporation , fox s parent company mr grushow has had other reasons to maintain contact with mr o'brien in august , fox bought a pilot for a situation comedy called beat cops from mr o'brien s production company the test for mr o'brien , associates and executives close to him said , is whether he thinks the time is right to try to expand his audience by moving to an earlier time period or whether it makes more sense for him to remain at nbc conan is only 38 , one nbc executive said there is still time for him to move to an earlier show later in his career
baltimore a utilityman for the orioles , melvin mora changes positions as often as he changes his children s diapers being versatile is perhaps his biggest strength , and it is a good thing he has been so adaptable playing baseball nowadays is the easiest part of his life back home in bel air , md , melvin and his wife , gisel , are busy rearing baby quintuplets and a 5yearold girl how do i handle it \? mora , 30 , said before a recent game i have a wonderful wife melvin and gisel married during the allstar game break in 2000 and soon decided to have children gisel , 27 , who has a daughter , tatiana , from a previous marriage , used fertility treatments and became pregnant she learned she was carrying quintuplets during spring training last year it was melvin s only offday in spring training , gisel said i started bleeding and i thought i had miscarried we went to the doctor s office and they found five strong heartbeats i was so relieved , but melvin , he looked like he was about to pass out two and a half months before the babies were due , while mora was with the orioles in anaheim , calif , gisel began experiencing hard contractions at 7 10 am on july 28 , 2001 , a team of nearly 20 doctors and nurses at johns hopkins hospital started delivering and taking care of five babies two boys , christian and matthew and three girls , rebekah , genesis and jada they were born when gisel was a little more than 26 weeks along in her pregnancy at that point , said dr chris lehmann , an attending physician in the neonatal intensive care unit at johns hopkins , the odds of survival are pretty good , but a premature birth does guarantee being susceptible to illness the quintuplets had immature lungs and needed a breathing machine their brain size was small and their immune systems weak the largest baby , christian , weighed about two and a half pounds the babies were so small , mora said , that he could slide the national league championship ring he earned with the 2000 mets \( size 11 \) up each baby s arm to the shoulder nobody believed how small they were , he said the babies require intensive medical care they recuperated at mount washington pediatric hospital in baltimore , and they were not healthy enough to go home until october gisel still spends a few days a week transporting her babies to various doctors' offices some of the children continue to use feeding tubes , although gisel said they were improving daily none of them have had a perfect course , lehmann said they were all very worrisome at some point the moras are very fortunate for the most part , the moras have coped with the difficulties of caring for the quintuplets on their own gisel , who grew up in coney island , has family in new york melvin s relatives live in his native venezuela the moras decided to maintain their yearround residence in bel air to be close to their doctors at johns hopkins although aided by a nanny a few days a week , gisel has handled the bulk of the parenting duties and she handles it , seemingly , with ease everything in the house is ultraorganized each child has colorcoordinated bottles , and often all five babies are dressed in matching outfits the three girls sleep in two cribs in a room decorated with ballerinas each of the boys has his own crib in another room , which has a baseball theme the children eat at the same time each day , nap together , and , amazingly , all pretty much sleep through the night at least once a night , one of them wakes up at about 2 in the morning , melvin said , smiling gisel still somehow manages to drive tatiana to gymnastics class for the most part , gisel tries to make sure melvincan concentrate on baseball he s all business , said orioles second baseman jerry hairston jr , a close friend of mora s to be able to focus the way he has is a credit to him it s amazing they make it look so easy what most of the players did not see , however , were the numerous trips mora made to the hospital to visit his babies i saw mr mora quite a bit , lehmann said i'm a father of a premature infant myself , so i know that must have been a lot of stress on him still , mora has been one of the more productive players in the orioles lineup usually baltimore s leadoff hitter , he was batting 246 with 11 stolen bases , a teamhigh 349 onbase percentage and 28 walks going into this weekend last monday , against the san diego padres , he had a careerhigh five runs batted in , including a tworun home run in the bottom of the eighth that gave the orioles an 86 victory so far this season he has played second base , shortstop , center field and left field in the past , he has also played third and right field last season he had a 250 batting average and a 362 onbase percentage , comparable numbers from his prequints stage to tell you the truth , it never concerned me how it was going to affect melvin on the field , orioles manager mike hargrove said i believe god does n't give you more than you can handle and melvin seems like a very stable person there were a lot of problems with those babies last year like a crisis a week and i heard about some of them , but not from him a popular myth in baseball is that every player is a multimillionaire playing in his fourth major league season , mora is making about 350 , 000 more than the average joe but just a little more than the league minimum he also supports his mother , a sister and a couple of brothers in venezuela one of his brothers , jose , was murdered by a hit man in april in venezuela mora , who also played a partial season of winter ball to earn extra money , is now helping with tuition for jose s three children the mora babies go through plenty of formula and roughly 35 diapers a day when we buy groceries people ask us , 'who are you giving food to \? ' mora said they think it s like a donation or something gisel said she might have to cut back the nanny s hours to keep the family s household expenses in check the orioles have pitched in to help the wives threw a couple of baby showers for gisel among the gifts were payments for housekeepers every time he gets a hit , said hargrove s wife , sharon , i say 'go melvin ! feed those babies ! ' it is difficult for mora to be on the road it s really hard for him , gisel said there are many times i wish he did n't have to travel and to top it off , the babies are doing so many cute things now when he comes home , it s like he s lost sometimes the kids cried when he held them the babies have made it to camden yards only a couple of times because such an excursion is a logistical feat on their first trip , about two weeks into the season , mora wheeled them into the locker room in a custommade , fivebaby stroller melvin was just beaming , said stacey johnson , the wife of orioles pitcher jason johnson he was so excited to bring his kids to the ballpark that he did n't even change out of his uniform for mora , not changing was a welcome change photo melvin mora and his wife , gisel , with their quintuplets , two boys and three girls , who were born last july 28 , and gisel s daughter tatiana , center \( larry french \)
a river barge crashed into an interstate highway bridge about 65 miles southeast of tulsa , okla , early yesterday , collapsing a 600footlong section of the fourlane highway and sending as many as nine cars and trucks tumbling into the arkansas river , the authorities said three bodies were recovered late last night , but the officials said they did not know how many others remained underwater the accident occurred shortly before 8 am , when the barge struck one of the concrete pilings supporting the 2 , 000footlong bridge on interstate 40 in webbers falls , said rebecca smith , a spokeswoman for muskogee county emergency medical services a minute or so later part of the bridge collapsed into the river as horrified boaters and fishermen watched , ms smith said the cause of the accident was unclear yesterday , but crew members on the tugboat that was pulling the 495foot barge recalled seeing the pilot black out and fall to the deck shortly before the crash , said gov frank keating , who spoke yesterday afternoon near the site witnesses said several cars plummeted 60 feet to the fastrunning river as the bridge gave way beneath them , but others vehicles , including at least two tractortrailers and a horse trailer , careened off the precipice afterward , unable to stop in time some drivers could not see the gap ahead because it was on the side of the bridge s crest opposite them , witnesses said a few victims were rescued by boaters who saw the collapse and rushed to help , but others apparently could not escape from their sinking cars , ms smith said i saw three semis go in , said fred benton , who was camping on the shore at the time and was in one of the first boats to reach the site , where the barge was still lodged with huge concrete slabs from the bridge sitting on top of it the bodies of two women and a man , along with three vehicles , had been pulled from the river by last night , officials said rescue operations were suspended at 7 45 pm and would resume at daylight today , they said several hundred emergency vehicles clogged the area around the bridge yesterday , as cranes struggled to stabilize the barge and divers tried unsuccessfully to recover bodies on the river , rescue workers gathered floating car seats , children s clothing , and other debris from the sunken cars the barge , one of two being pushed by the same boat , had just dropped off a load of asphalt and was headed north , said officials at the oklahoma highway patrol it struck the bridge near its western edge , far from the marked channel , which runs through the middle of the bridge s span , officials said last night shane guthrie , a personnel manager for the magnolia marine transport company in vicksburg , miss , told the associated press the company s tugboat was pushing the two barges when the accident took place none of the seven people who were on the barge were injured , mr guthrie said the pilot , who was identified by the authorities as joe dedmon of florence , miss , was being treated at hospital in muskogee , a few miles away , governor keating said joel henderson , a spokesman for magnolia marine , said mr dedmon had been a tugboat pilot for about 30 years and was very familiar with these waters it s our understanding that he blacked out and then came to after the contact , mr henderson said the national transportation safety board was sending a team to investigate the accident , governor keating said state transportation officials were checking the bridge s construction to see if it contributed to the collapse , said terri angier , a spokeswoman for the oklahoma transportation department the bridge was built in 1967 and last was inspected in 2001 , said ms angier when it was inspected it was in great shape no problem , she said divers from a local fire department and the oklahoma lake patrol tried to rescue people trapped underwater yesterday afternoon , but were delayed by the instability of the barge and the collapsed bridge section , ms smith said there is lots of debris and fast water there s no visibility , said doug mclaughlin , a volunteer firefighter working as a diver the cars and trucks were submerged in 11 feet of water , officials at the scene said wanda morgan , who lives less than a mile from the bridge , said she and her husband rushed out of their house after they heard what sounded like an explosion shortly before 8 am i saw two cars go off the bridge , she said they were there and then they just went off and there was a big splash of water one survivor , bleeding from the head and chest , was wandering near the shore after a boater dropped him off , ms morgan said he did n't even know how he got out of the river , she said several fishermen who were taking part in a bassfishing tournament on the river helped gather suitcases , clothing , candy wrappers , and other debris that was drifting in the water shortly afterward all kinds of people tried to help , said mr benton , the camper then i saw a baby shoe and i just quit looking four survivors were in stable condition yesterday at the muskogee regional medical center , about 20 miles away , said ken laubenstein , a hospital spokesman interstate 40 is the major highway running eastwest through oklahoma the bridge , about 35 miles west of the arkansas border , typically carries 20 , 000 vehicles a day , governor keating said one or two barges pass under the bridge a day , transporting about 4 million tons of cargo a year , he added it is a major thoroughfare across the united states , and having it down is not good news for commerce , he said photo a 600footlong section of a bridge over the arkansas river in oklahoma collapsed yesterday after a barge struck one of its pilings

nukus , uzbekistan forty years ago , when uzbekistan was part of the soviet union , the kremlin ordained a colossal task to turn this heatpuckered land and four of its neighbors , a swath of desert and scrub as big as western europe , into an irrigated cotton plantation improbably , it succeeded from the mountainous chinese border to the caspian sea , the soviet union remade the two grand rivers of central asia , building 20 , 000 miles of canals , 45 dams and more than 80 reservoirs the government turned sand and dust into one of the world s great cottongrowing regions but the soviet union is long dead and here in western uzbekistan and in areas of its four neighbors , one of socialism s most grandiose schemes is being sundered by capitalism , nationalism and a legacy of waste without a bigger supply of water or better use of it an economic and social crisis seems to be awaiting the region of 58 million people , already racked by islamic insurgencies and tamed by oppressive rule on a dusty plain outside this regional capital , one farmer , yerken kharpov , unshaven and lean in blue nylon track pants , looked out at the 80 acres of stateowned farmland that he tends , and tallied the misery in 2000 , his entire crop died for lack of water in 2001 , again lacking water , he grew but 10 acres of cotton this spring , he tried again , with 15 acres of cotton and sunflowers mr kharpov could give up , as he did three years ago , when he was a 28yearold millworker , but without water , it is much harder to start fresh there are no other jobs , he said where would i go \? mr kharpov s question is central asia s we talk about the developing world and the developed world , said sarah o'hara , a geographer at the university of nottingham , england , who has studied the water problems here this is the deteriorating world the five nations at work here uzbekistan along with its arid neighbors , turkmenistan and kazakhstan , and two mountainous ones , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have drunk dry the natural flow of two great rivers , the amu and the syr not enough to go around the craving for water has turned the aral sea , once the world s sixthlargest inland ocean , into a shrunken , dustshrouded necklace of lifeless brine lakes still , the nations are thirsty their demand for water already exceeds the entire annual flow of the two rivers by 25 percent adding to the pressure , afghanistan , whose right to river water was ignored during taliban rule , is poised to reclaim a share of the bigger river , the amu the five neighbors have swelling populations growing 15 percent a decade , with a third of the residents 13 or younger that presents their governments with the challenge of creating more jobs and growing more food , even as the water supply is divided ever more thinly they also are not keeping up the waterworks , causing more waste in soviet times , the kremlin spent at least 60 an acre every year to keep the water systems in repair uzbekistan currently spends less than 25 an acre tajikistan , reeling from civil war , spends 4 one result is an irrigation network beset by staggering waste now in disrepair , some parts waste more water than they deliver the karakum canal , an 837mile manmade river in the turkmenistan desert , appears from the air as a thin line fringed by a mileswide band of weeds the government admits that 28 percent of its water vanishes into the sands scientists put the figure closer to 60 percent the region grew used to free water , in profligate supply one example is in the tiny village of dzhalagash , along kazakhstan s shadeless southern border not far from the syr s banks here the rainfall averages just 59 inches a year , yet the preferred crop is rice zhakhslyk kabyrov , who runs a former soviet collective farm , hired korean advisers this year to help cut water consumption in his 250acre rice plot still , he reckons he will use a stunning 740 million gallons , enough to fill 1 , 300 olympic swimming pools , to flood paddies with ankledeep water to produce the rice he can consume so much because rice is a profitable staple of local diets , and water , at about 65 cents per swimming pool , is ridiculously cheap arid kazakhstan grows an astounding 160 , 000 acres of rice 250 square miles of nothing but flooded paddies uzbeks grow almost as much an obvious solution to such excess is to raise the price of water but that could wipe out an entire class of small farmers who comprise a future capitalist class , while enriching the already wealthy moreover , controls over water use are so loose , thanks in part to ramshackle equipment , that fee dodging would probably be rampant if you were trying to save water , you would n't grow rice , said philip micklin , a retired university of michigan geographer and a specialist on central asian water but look , it s a management problem everyone makes choices and sometimes it s not even choices , it s who grabs the most a regional tradeoff that is not how things were supposed to work instead , the kremlin conceived an elegant tradeoff , linking the mountains rich in wild rivers and glaciers with the arid plains , rich in gas , coal and oil and so , in the winter , the plains would send fuel to the mountains in return , the mountains would hoard river water , then send it downstream for crops in the spring and summer

the homeland security advisory council , a group of leaders from business , academia and state and local government , was created by executive order in march its 21 members have been meeting monthly in washington to advise the bush administration on strengthening domestic security joseph j grano jr , chairman and chief executive of ubs painewebber and a special forces veteran , is chairman of the council he talked last week about the business role in guarding against domestic terrorism patrick mcgeehan q what is the council doing \? a the national strategy came out with three clear and succinct objectives to prevent terrorist attacks , reduce america s vulnerability to future attacks and minimize damage and recover from attacks when and if they occur we as a group opined on that national strategy we are making recommendations on how you coordinate and implement it there is no way as a nation that we can achieve a high degree of protection without engaging the private sector protecting our critical infrastructure is one of six mission areas in our national strategy what most people do n't recognize is that 80 to 85 percent of all of the critical infrastructure in the united states is owned or operated by the private sector among the initiatives in the strategy is to build and maintain a database of this infrastructure , things like the lincoln tunnel , but also private facilities securing cyberspace is also a very , very big issue to do that , we need to work as a partnership q but companies tend to guard information and solve their problems alone is there a willingness to change \? a these things are done more in silos by each company my view is it probably has to be done industry by industry if you were to pick a category to serve as an example , there is probably none better than wall street heretofore , every company is focusing immediately on the issue of business continuity we all have disaster recovery plans that we had to implement but look at it from a full capitalmarket perspective , post9 11 , when the whole community pulled together to get the market back up that type of coordination we now know is possible i'm not going to say to you that we are arm in arm , walking in the sunset but my experiences thus far and the letters that i have received from other ceo s have all shown a complete willingness to get on with the task at hand q the legislation to create the homeland security department seems stuck in the senate are you worried \? a right now , the problem is the politicizing there this department should have already been formed it s been a year and a day this is war we need to start thinking about a 21stcentury response to a 21stcentury threat the intelligence gathering of the private sector needs to be able to be communicated there are , in my view , some archaic laws that are deterrents i 'd say , look , guys , you have got to give us some flexibility here about passing information if the american public understood some of the archaic and arcane rules and regulations that a bureaucracy can create , they would quickly rally to the side of the president the faa federal aviation administration has more flexibility than what congress is trying to give this department the departments of health and human services and agriculture have more authority to transfer their budgets if there s a unique threat on our borders , this department obviously should be held accountable to congress , but they have to have the flexibility to marshal these 170 , 000 people and organize them against the objectives of winning a war today , if you found a borderpatrol person drunk on the job and you tried to fire that person , it takes you 30 days and you have to pay them for those 30 days you cannot have the equivalent of tenure in a school system being an albatross around the neck of our security efforts q is n't there a danger that new ties between government and business over domestic security will hurt productivity at the time the economy needs it most \? a i do n't see the threat the formation of the homeland security department will be more focused than what we have today as the partnership with the private sector and with local and state government gets synergized , it will create more productivity and create incremental new businesses in fields like security i think it has a very positive ramification if we get it right if we do n't get this terrorist situation right , from the point of prevention and reduction , what do you think that would do to our economy \? let something happen and see what happens to our consumer base there s your threat q how much time is this work taking away from your real job at ubs painewebber \? a it is probably taking up 5 percent of my working hours of what little spare time i have , i am spending about 40 percent of that , mostly reading and , i can assure you , it keeps you awake at night luckily , i do n't need much sleep photo joseph j grano jr
last fall , congress responded energetically to the sept 11 terrorist attacks but the response was incomplete when the fog of normalcy , with its paralyzing partisanship , again descended on capitol hill late last year , congress had not yet enacted urgently needed legislation to provide federal help in insuring against similarly catastrophic terrorist attacks in the future it must do so now , particularly in light of the constant stream of bush administration warnings about new potential terrorist threats before sept 11 , insurance companies routinely provided businesses with coverage for terrorismrelated losses as part of their general property and casualty policies not anymore not after the attacks resulted in some 50 billion in insured losses unable to assess the risk of future attacks and their potential cost , some insurance companies and reinsurers have stopped providing terrorism coverage altogether many others are charging astronomical premiums for very limited coverage in new york city and elsewhere , highprofile sites are finding it especially hard to insure against terrorism legal disputes between lenders and property developers about the adequacy of their insurance coverage , such as one involving the new cond nast office tower on times square , could become more common as more and more policies expire and companies are forced to proceed without terrorism insurance , or with an insufficient amount meanwhile , in the absence of a federal backstop , the prospect of potentially devastating workers' compensation liability in the event of future attacks may force many businesses to reconsider concentrating so many employees in manhattan there is broad support across the political spectrum for the notion that the federal government must cover the bulk of any private losses that exceed 10 billion from a terrorist attack even if congress fails to formalize the commitment , it will undoubtedly act after the fact by passing a law now requiring the insurance industry to provide terrorism coverage in exchange for capping its potential losses , congress can create a market for affordable coverage and protect potential terrorism targets , from new york city to san francisco , from an exodus of business none of this is seriously in dispute in washington what has produced a partisan stalemate on the issue was the house republicans' decision late last year to transform the issue into a trojan horse for their cherished tort reform agenda their bill , passed last november , was stuffed with items on a longstanding wish list of desired curbs on litigation , such as a cap on lawyers' fees and exclusions for noneconomic damages the restrictions would apply only to lawsuits that stemmed from a terrorist incident , but the republicans wanted to make a political point this is an ideological showdown the american economy cannot afford senate democratic leaders , eager to pass their own bill , must compromise , even if it means offending trial lawyer groups senate republicans appear willing to accept far more modest curbs on terrorismrelated litigation than their house brethren their proposals provide the basis for an eventual reconciliation of house and senate efforts it would be a reckless blow to america s economy for congress to continue neglecting this wartime imperative
firing its old auditor was easy now , with arthur andersen out of the way , the enron corporation faces a much more difficult task finding another accounting firm willing to take its place two of the other four large accounting firms said they did not intend to compete for the account of enron , now embroiled in one of the largest accounting scandals in history the remaining two deloitte touche and kpmg would not comment that may mean that a much smaller firm will have to wade through the complex , restated and muchcriticized finances at enron , even as lawsuits against the company and against andersen pile up and creditors demand a speedy resolution of enron s bankruptcy proceedings enron has only just begun the process of finding and hiring a new auditor , having fired andersen two weeks ago after the accounting firm said that its employees shredded enronrelated documents if that were not enough to deter auditors , enron s finances are now , anyway infamously complex sophisticated and undisclosed transactions hid much of enron s debt and contributed to the company s collapse into bankruptcy last month we are confident that we will find a highly qualified auditor , said karen denne , a spokeswoman for houstonbased enron she added that enron would probably not take out advertisements to solicit applications from accountants but would contact potential auditors directly but a company as big as enron needs a big accounting firm , and the biggest firms do not want to go near enron , at least for a while those that have not been directly implicated in the scandal caused by enron s implosion do not want to risk being tarred by it now it s a hot potato , said arthur w bowman , editor of bowman s accounting report the risk , i guess , is still high , but you would think that whatever results would fall on andersen s shoulders but you can sue anybody for anything , he added that may be why executives at the remaining four members of the socalled big five accounting firms do not sound eager to take on this particular client we do not intend to do the audit for enron , david nestor , a spokesman for pricewaterhousecoopers , said in an interview last week ernst young is already advising enron in its chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings , said lawrence j parnell , director of public relations at the firm is ernst young considering applying to become enron s auditor \? not to my knowledge , he said a spokesman for deloitte touche , which is advising the judge overseeing enron s bankruptcy proceedings , would not comment on the possibility of auditing enron kpmg appeared to leave the window open a crack to the possibility of stepping into andersen s shoes we would not discuss business we were bidding for , one way or the other , a spokesman said lawyers for enron said that a new auditor would be subject to review by creditors and approval by the bankruptcy court if enron were to be liquidated rather than reorganized , the need for an auditor would diminish , said martin j bienenstock , a lawyer at weil gotshal manges , which is representing enron so far , mr bienenstock said no beauty contests had been scheduled to let accounting firms compete for the enron audit at some point an auditor will have to be found because federal law requires that publicly traded companies put out audited financial statements and enron is still publicly traded , even if its stock has been kicked off the new york stock exchange in overthecounter trading , the stock , which traded for 80 a year ago , now fetches less than 50 cents if none of the big five firms are willing to audit enron , the company could turn to a smaller firm but most such firms cannot devote hundreds of accountants to a single client , and enron would require significant manpower i'm going to guess that enron had over a thousand andersen people working on jobs , mr bowman said , adding that many firms could not provide such a large work force smaller accounting firms can collaborate on large accounts , but such relationships are complicated , said clarence d hein , managing partner of hein associates , which has offices in colorado , california and conveniently texas the firm has about 120 accountants we 've never put together that large of an audit relationship , mr hein said that s something we 'd really have to look at auditing a company with a history of reportedly questionable accounting would be a risky endeavor because bankruptcy proceedings and lawsuits would affect valuations of enron assets , he said bdo seidman , with 420 million in revenue and about 2 , 000 employees in the united states , could probably handle an audit of enron , but a spokesman declined to talk about the idea ms denne , the enron spokeswoman , was undeterred when told of accounting firms' reluctance to tackle or even comment on the prospect of tackling the company s tangled finances we will find an auditor , she said

atonement by ian mcewan 351 pp new york nan a talese doubleday 26 ian mcewan s stonytitled new novel , atonement , opens with a scene of pastoral bliss it is 1935 , an english summer is in full swing and parallelograms of morning light are making their way across the floor of the tallis family s country house , where everyone is busy preparing for the return of leon , the oldest son this is exciting news for his younger sister , briony , who is putting on a production of her new play it s not such good news for her older sister , cecilia , who will have to face her childhood friend , robbie , whom she spent most of her time at cambridge pointedly ignoring , and secretly falling in love with so far , then , atonement would seem to have very little to atone for , unless you were to count an aboveaverage chance of being made into a merchantivory film this in itself should be enough to have hardened mcewan fans anxiously flicking back to check that it is indeed his name on the dust jacket just a few novels ago , mcewan was offering useful tips on how best to saw through a human thigh bone \( remove the trousers first \) , and his last novel , amsterdam , which won the 1998 booker prize , ended with a mutual euthanasia pact try getting that past emma thompson s agent yet here is mcewan , at the helm of what looks suspiciously like the sort of english novel irises in full bloom , young lovers following suit that english novelists stopped writing more than 30 years ago gradually , though , a familiar disquiet begins to settle over the novel like dust there s that date for a start , four years distant from the onset of the war , but still a little too close for comfort then there s the arrival of leon s friend , paul marshall , a quiltylike bore whose gaze lingers on the tallis girls just that fraction of a second too long then there s the small matter of briony or perhaps not so small at 13 , briony stands on the threshold of adolescence , with all its itchy selfdramatizing instincts and glamorous mood swings contemplating the loss of a favorite dress , briony knew her only reasonable choice then would be to run away , to live under hedges , eat berries and speak to no one , and be found by a bearded woodsman one winter s dawn , curled up at the base of a giant oak , beautiful and dead such fantasies seem harmless enough , and another novelist might have mined them for their charm alone , but mcewan has always had an eye on the darker veins that course through children s imaginations his recent book for children , the daydreamer , had a nice roald dahllike streak of malice to it , and his adult fiction has always heeded the close alliance between creative and destructive impulses when briony s plans for her play are derailed , her dramatic instincts look to feed elsewhere , and they find scandalized sustenance in glimpsed intimacies between robbie and cecilia before the night is out , a crime will be committed , a lie told and a little girl who thought herself the heroine of her own drama will find herself playing the villain in someone else s so much for the soft bloom of innocence it would be shame to divulge exactly what happens on that night one of the great things about mcewan is how much faith he has in the urgings of plot his books have a natural 45degree tilt , leaning forward , through a fog of mounting unease , toward claretdark revelation interestingly , what stays with you afterward is the unease , not the revelation rereading his novel black dogs recently , i remembered that the climax involved some dogs black ones , as i recall but could n't remember what it was the mutts got up to this is not an insult on the contrary , mcewan seems instinctively to have found a perfect fictional equivalent for the ways and workings of trauma for its blind spots and sneaky obliquities the events of that night , for instance , account for only half the plot of atonement the rest is reaction , ripple , repair when the action reopens a few years later , robbie is dodging german shells in france , cecilia is praying for his safe return and briony , now estranged from the both of them and working as a nurse , is busy piecing together soldiers in a london hospital here and there one edge of the ruptured skin rose over the other , revealing its fatty layers , and little obtrusions like miniature bunches of red grapes forced up from the fissure beside inducing an immediate desire to skip lunch , such details serve as a handy reminder of the ian mcewan of old the mcewan who was dubbed ian macabre by the british press they also illustrate how far he has come since then his early shortstory collections delivered their doses of disquiet neat , without narrative frill set against arid landscapes of urban desiccation , and beneath a persistent fug of moral rot , his narrators \( mostly teenage males \) whiled away their time in feverish fantasy and morbid selfexploration i saw my first corpse on thursday , begins one story from mcewan s 1978 collection , in between the sheets another began , eaters of asparagus know the scent it lends the urine
most investors believe they should own both growth and value stocks , but many have some odd notions about how to define them only 16 percent of the people polled in a survey sponsored by american century investments were able to correctly answer at least 7 out of 10 basic questions about growth and value investments only one in 300 correctly answered all 10 questions and only 15 percent claimed to be knowledgeable about the issues while the turmoil of the markets has underscored the importance of growth and value equity exposure in a diversified portfolio , many investors still do n't fully understand the characteristics of those types of investment terms , ' said doug lockwood , vice president for shareholder education at american century , which is based in kansas city , mo fiftyone percent correctly identified a growth stock as one that is demonstrating betterthanaverage profit and earnings gains nearly a quarter wrongly believed that a growth stock offers a guaranteed rate of growth tied to the consumer price index , while 2 percent believed that it was a stock specializing in organic products that are grown and 15 percent said that all of those answers were correct , while 9 percent said they could not answer similarly , 49 percent correctly identified a value stock as one that has a low pricetobook ratio , while 14 percent wrongly believed that it was a stock in a fastgrowing company that specializes in highvalue , lowcost products , such as a discount retailer eight percent said it specializes in valuable goods , such as precious metals and jewelry , while 14 percent said all those answers were correct the remaining 15 percent could not come up with a definition the survey was based on telephone interviews of 300 people selected randomly all said they were financial decisionmakers in their households , and none were employed in the financial services industry

taxes are climbing a budget deficit is looming the mayor is awaiting trial on federal charges of racketeering , bribery and conspiracy there seems to be no end to the indignities of living in bridgeport , conn , these days and this week , residents of the state s largest city are enduring yet one more an outcry from the city council over revelations that the mayor , joseph p ganim , and other top city officials were paid a total of about 60 , 000 in bonuses over the last three years for not taking any sick days joe gresko , a spokesman for mr ganim , said the payments were actually a result of a budgetcutting maneuver in 1999 under which nonunion public employees could no longer accrue sick days and cash them in at retirement it was a costsaving measure , mr gresko said instead of letting individuals accumulate their sick time , it made them basically use it or lose it in that individual year such employees get 10 sick days a year , he said under the plan , if they use none they get an extra week s pay but city council members , including the council president , john fabrizi , have reacted with alarm , saying the payments are suspicious and that the council was never consulted this is one item that was never requested for funding or specifically disclosed , mr fabrizi said mr fabrizi said that even if the mayor s office broke no law in implementing the plan , it just did not look good for public officials to reward themselves for showing up at work should elected officials benefit from perfect attendance policies \? mr fabrizi asked no ! mr fabrizi alerted the rest of the council to the issue in a letter to the budget committee asking for further investigation according to the connecticut post , which first reported the council s concerns on wednesday , mr ganim received 5 , 984 over three years for never taking a sick day mr fabrizi said that the city could not afford the bonuses we have a shortage of public health school nurses , he said , and we have screams and cries from education that they need additional dollars based on all that , you have to take your hardest look at the budget and delete anything that is not a priority another city official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that residents were fed up with the appearance of impropriety taxes are through the roof , he said the mayor is under indictment people are fleeing the city this is like the straw that broke the camel s back , if the camel even had a spine left councilman bob curwen , a cochairman of the budget committee , said that the council had never been informed about the sickpay plan and it just makes you wonder how many more of these types of scenarios are out there another councilman , bob walsh , said that both the city s office of labor relations and office of policy and management told him that they had conducted no cost analysis on the sickpay plan another official to receive a bonus for perfect attendance was state senator alvin penn , the city s affirmative action and compliance officer in previous years , he refused to submit time sheets for his city job , but mr gresko , the mayor s spokesman , said the forms had now been submitted time sheets or not , mr penn received an extra week s salary 1 , 148 last year for not taking sick days the year before councilman walsh said it was silly for mayor ganim to be expected to keep time records the mayor s job , after all , requires being on duty 24 hours a day , 7 days a week to require the mayor to do so is ridiculous , mr walsh said then for the mayor to turn around and actually say he had perfect attendance is equally ridiculous mr walsh said it was understandable for people to doubt mr ganim , who is facing trial on a 24count federal indictment charging him with racketeering , conspiracy , extortion and bribery involving hundreds of thousands of dollars in alleged bribes mr ganim has maintained his innocence and suggested that the charges are part of a smear campaign there are more and more signs that the mayor is definitely being distracted by the ongoing federal investigation , mr walsh said it seems more and more things are not getting done in city hall he s not doing his job and i have said all along there will come a point in time when enough is enough mr walsh added have we reached that \? maybe not yet but we are getting closer and closer
h christopher whittle , the 54yearold founder and chief executive of edison schools , sat in his stylishly simple midtown manhattan office and pondered what his critics have said about him that he is extravagant that he exaggerates reality that he promises more than he can deliver maybe in the past , allowed mr whittle , a small , casually elegant man with a lopsided grin but not at edison , his favorite brainchild and the nation s largest commercial manager of public schools here , he said , executives fly coach or pay the difference themselves and his own salary is just 1 a year , plus stock options but others see d j vu in mr whittle s stewardship of edison , whose plan to take over 20 failing schools in philadelphia this summer has made it a lightning rod in the stormy national debate over school reform just as he promised more growth than he delivered a decade ago at channel one , the controversial inschool television news network he once owned , mr whittle last fall led wall street to expect edison to get far more new schools to manage in the coming year than it did and just as there were complaints in 1994 about incorrect accounting and unpaid taxes at his earlier media empire , whittle communications , mr whittle said last week that edison had settled a regulatory complaint about its reporting of revenue also , with edison s overhead consuming a very high 173 percent of revenues last year , several investment bankers who have studied edison s books see echoes of the spending habits that led mr whittle to build a lavish headquarters in knoxville , just as whittle communications was faltering and once again , those bankers said , mr whittle has surrounded himself with smart , talented people who do not know enough about business and finance to keep edison out of trouble this time , however , more than just mr whittle s personal reputation is at stake , said thomas toch , a writer at the national center on education and the economy in washington who is working on a book about education reform mr whittle has become the standardbearer for people who believe that privatesector management can transform america s public schools , mr toch said , and edison s ambitious effort in philadelphia is being widely watched on all sides of the school reform debate while mr toch said he believed that a marketplace of educational options was inevitable , he said he feared that an edison failure in philadelphia would put the movement back two decades mr whittle , who seemed upbeat in a recent interview even after just completing an overnight flight from los angeles , explained that edison , with its public stockholders , is a different world from the private companies he ran in the past a world requiring new skills that he is still trying to master at his private companies , he said , he would deliberately set goals that were out of reach to inspire extra effort but public markets are wired differently , mr whittle said , natty in his signature bow tie and navy sweater vest there , the idea is 'underpromise , overdeliver' he added , i had difficulty in that segue that difficulty , he acknowledged , is partly to blame for the fact that edison s stock has plummeted it closed last night at 126 , down 94 percent this year just as it needs to raise up to 50 million to finance its expansion this summer in philadelphia and elsewhere but mr whittle seemed undaunted , pointing out that edison has already defied early skeptics by becoming one of the 50 largest school systems in the country , with about 75 , 000 students in 22 states how many times has this company been declared dead \? he asked rhetorically , a favorite conversational tic multiple times almost as many times as mr whittle himself has been prematurely declared defeated i have a pretty good track record on raising capital , he said , in a voice that still has the soft twang of his native tennessee and my critics would have difficulty establishing that i am not a good crisis manager i 've been through my share his business career began in 1968 , when he was a student at the university of tennessee with a few classmates , including philip moffitt , he hatched knoxville in a nutshell , an adfilled campus guide for incoming freshmen a decade later , after a constant highwire scramble for capital , it had grown into the 1330 corporation , which offered a host of ingenious media options to advertisers trying to reach under30 consumers the young company hit the national scene with a noisy splash in 1979 , when mr whittle and mr moffitt bought esquire magazine , a financial invalid which had long been a showcase for america s best editors and writers we were convinced that we could have this thing upright within six months , mr whittle recalled but within 90 to 120 days , all of our capital was gone we had no idea how fast this boat was going down but with skeptics ready to gloat , mr whittle helped persuade esquire s former owner , associated newspapers in london , to chip in fresh capital mr moffitt deftly handled a lively stable of talented young writers , and esquire was eventually put back on its feet
new information about an apparent accident in the former soviet biological weapons testing program three decades ago has raised some troubling questions about our own nation s ability to protect its citizens against a potential terrorist attack the openair test of a soviet smallpox weapon in 1971 caused a small outbreak of the disease in a port on the aral sea , in what is now kazakhstan , even among people who had been vaccinated although moscow has never acknowledged either the outbreak or the openair test , researchers at the monterey institute of international studies , with the help of kazakh officials , have prepared a report on the incident they conclude that two infants and a young woman , none of whom had been vaccinated , died from a rare hemorrhagic form of smallpox seven survivors who had been vaccinated contracted mild to serious cases of the disease the outbreak was contained by quarantining hundreds of people and vaccinating almost 50 , 000 residents within two weeks , a demonstration that public health responses can be effective the report infers from circumstantial evidence that the outbreak was triggered by airborne viruses from a germ warfare test on an island in the aral sea the viruses infected a crew member on a research vessel that is said to have come within nine miles of the island , and she in turn spread the virus to others in the city of aralsk although some experts think the aralsk outbreak may have had natural causes , a former general in the soviet germ warfare program told a moscow newspaper it had been caused by fieldtesting of germs if that is true , it raises the worrisome possibility that a smallpox attack might be carried out with plumes of germs that could infect large numbers of people simultaneously the incident also raises the possibility that the soviet virus was unusually potent and thus able to overcome at least partially the protective effects of vaccination this makes it imperative that the bush administration press russia for full details on what smallpox strain was tested and how it was disseminated such knowledge is vital to determine whether new vaccines or drugs might be needed to protect against that strain s falling into the hands of terrorists
having thrown trent lott overboard , republican leaders seem to think they are now absolved of any further responsibility for the racism and ethnic insensitivity that have tainted their party the problem is now supposed to go away they are deluded the problem is n't going away because republican leaders have n't rid themselves of the habit of playing to the closet racists and the confederate flagwaving yahoos who mean so much to the gop for 40 years the party has gone out of its way to court the enemies of black people it s an offense for which it should be begging forgiveness americans have made tremendous progress on matters of racial and ethnic tolerance over the past three or four decades but those gains were made in spite of the ugly , backward , divisive and destructive behavior of many , many politicians in the republican party , including those at the very top and that pattern continues bill frist is supposed to be the new , more moderate , more tolerant face of the gop but he s more mask than face senator frist is a favorite among republicans in part because of the success he had as chairman of the national republican senatorial committee his job in that post was to raise money and otherwise assist republicans running for the senate now that senator frist is ascending to the majority leader s post , it s interesting to note the republicans' choice to succeed him as chairman of the senatorial committee it s none other than senator george allen of virginia , a neanderthal on matters of race who , like trent lott , all but worships at the altar of the confederacy a few years ago , when he was governor of virginia , mr allen issued a proclamation declaring april confederate history and heritage month from mr allen s proconfederate perspective , the civil war was a struggle for independence and sovereign rights independence , in this case , does not refer to the independence of black slaves i 'd like to know if senator allen feels we 'd all have been better off if the south had won the civil war it s a fair enough question mr allen loved the old confederacy so much he displayed the confederate flag in his living room he was a little touchy about it , though when someone accused him of flying the flag in his living room , he took umbrage it was never flying , he said it was nailed to a wall gee , i wonder why there are so few blacks in the republican party the trent lott fiasco lifted the fig leaf and exposed the shameful behavior of the gop for all americans to see suddenly there was a spotlight on the party s shortcomings that s the reason party leaders were so anxious to toss the clownish senator from mississippi into the drink mr lott had to go not because of any hurt to black people that his remarks and his leadership might have caused , but because of the potential harm to his party , which has made racebaiting a cornerstone of its electoral philosophy the gop could cleanse itself of the taint of racism , but it s not so inclined for one thing , party leaders would have to admit that they have a problem in this area and take steps to remedy it across the board do n't hold your breath this is a party that will smile in the face of a colin powell while waving confederate flags behind his back republicans are not turned off by the george allens of the party he s in the party mainstream the gop has spent more than 30 years demonizing democrats for trying to help racial and ethnic minorities it has spent more than 30 years stomping on the voting rights of blacks and it has gone out of its way to pack the federal courts with judges who are hostile to the interests and the rights of minorities the party wo n't be rid of these sins and their consequences until its leaders acknowledge them , and take meaningful steps to do better many of the officials and operatives who threw trent lott overboard have voting records and campaign histories that are as bad as senator lott s , or worse the real lessons of the trent lott experience are lost on them mr lott may be gone as senate republican leader , but the gop is still hot for the racist vote it s a vile addiction that s guaranteed to bring a great deal of additional grief for the party , and for the rest of us

selected poems by mona van duyn 218 pp new york alfred a knopf 2750 mona van duyn s selected poems , her first book in nine years , contains nearly half of the poems published in her eight previous volumes because if it be not i collected poems 19591982 \( 1993 \) , near changes \( 1990 \) and firefall \( 1993 \) are still in print , selected poems offers nothing not easily available elsewhere as a result , fans of her work will find the book less than essential unless learning which half of her oeuvre the poet prefers is a source of interest to readers unfamiliar with van duyn s poetry , however , this book offers a generous yet judicious sampling of a long and successful career the first woman to be named poet laureate of the united states \( she held the position in 199293 \) , van duyn has received almost every major prize given to poets in this country , which might explain why this selected poems has been published despite the absence of new work characterized by candor and compassion , van duyn s poetry depicts the pleasures and drudgeries of middleclass american life , an approach that at its best becomes an exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of that life a pioneer of the poetry of the suburbs now a common mode in which the ordinary is routinely revealed as extraordinary van duyn also knows that the ordinary is frequently just that yet her suburban settings can combine the ingredients for conflagration birds , a neighbor and a backyard garden , for example , in elementary attitudes in the poem , the flowers planted by the narrator are burning and even the petunias are turning violent as the colors flame together and spread over their borders such incendiary moments , though , are rare in van duyn s work her poetry is primarily , and literally , civil , seeking to uphold the accepted foundations of civilization marriage and friendship , love and sympathy while occasionally plumbing those foundations for cracks in her strongest poems , she uses her suburban surroundings not as subject matter but as scene , helping to illuminate her real subject human relationships neither cynical nor distraught , van duyn seeks the joys of living and of loving , and often finds them , as she notes in the first of three valentines to the wide world hating is hard work , and the uncaring thought is hard but loving is easy , love is that lovely play that makes us and keeps us \? hers is an affirming poetry in which the baser emotions rage , shame , envy , selfloathing are largely absent but van duyn s version of the world is not altogether optimistic even her most exalted subject , marriage , can receive ambivalent treatment , as when she describes it \( in toward a definition of marriage \) as an artless work in which none of the hohum passages can be skipped , a duel of amateurs , a contributor to expediency in life and the politics of love her poetry continually celebrates the hard ways we have to love love for van duyn becomes hardest when she writes about her parents taking as their starting points memories of her childhood and her parents' deterioration and deaths , her poems on kinship show the poet at her least complaisant remedies , maladies , reasons , for example , portrays her relationship with her hypochondriacal mother , described by the poet as a hideous machine that pumps and wheezes , suppurating , rotting , stinking , swelling and in photographs , she sees her young self as skinny from trying to please and hardly ever pleasing although difficult , the poet s relationship with her parents seems less painful at the ends of their lives in letters from a father and the stream , van duyn learns how to accept their peculiar ways of loving the casually formal surfaces of van duyn s poems often resemble those of her model , elizabeth bishop , and like bishop she excels at both formal and free verse van duyn s formalism is most impressive when most flexible , and she has shown a stronger commitment to free verse than her closest contemporaries howard nemerov , richard wilbur and anthony hecht have shown it would be misleading , however , to compare van duyn to other contemporaries who also started publishing in the 1950 s and 1960 s poets like adrienne rich , w s merwin and james wright and broke from formal poetry to write free verse selected poems demonstrates that van duyn remained committed to formal verse from the 1950 s to the 1990 s , and her use of free verse does not have political implications , as it does for rich , merwin and wright selected poems also demonstrates that van duyn s best books are her first three , especially the national book awardwinning to see , to take , which joins religious and mythological themes divine and human love and the violence of love with less rarefied subjects in those books as well as in later volumes , she shows a predilection for rhyming couplets and quatrains , triplets \( tercets with one rhyme \) and longer singlerhyme stanzas as her forays into free verse become more common , her handling of traditional forms becomes less masterly practicing a tired formalism in too much of her later work \( the world s perverse , but it could be worse \) , van duyn seems to have fewer , or less pressing , reasons to write after letters from a father , and other poems \( 1982 \) the poems in near changes and firefall frequently become public gestures of affection , often to other poets , and many of them take as their subjects poetry or being a poet \( one poem is about winning the pulitzer prize \) others read like genial ways to pass the time van duyn s selected poems ultimately emerges both as a monument to an illustrious career and as an attempt to solidify her position as a major poet although the book highlights her memorable poems , it is unlikely to enhance her reputation , because her poetry s modesty of demeanor is frequently matched by its modesty of achievement
miami , jan 1 in the days after the sept 11 terrorist attacks , dorothy slaughter was reluctant to fly from her home here to visit family in new york like she had done regularly for years it was not that ms slaughter had been overcome by the fear of flying that had gripped so many americans , or even that she minded the extra security but ms slaughter uses a wheelchair and depends on family members to get her to the gate and while she appreciated the new security measures 'please check under my cushion , ' i tell them makes me feel better , she said the rules prohibited anyone without a ticket from going beyond the security checkpoint because of the hardship on passengers who use wheelchairs , advocates for disabled travelers successfully lobbied for the airlines and the federal aviation administration to change the restriction so on a recent trip home , ms slaughter s cousin , mel fischer of brooklyn , could accompany her to the gate at la guardia airport with a pass from delta air lines the airline industry is eager to make such concessions because customers like ms slaughter represent a fastgrowing market that the carriers say they are competing to serve better their effort to cater to the growing numbers of passengers who use wheelchairs , though , has caused some difficulties and occasionally taxes the entire system even before the new security procedures , one airline was 20 minutes late in boarding a flight here several months ago because 17 elderly passengers arriving for a caribbean cruise requested wheelchairs , sending the few workers at the gate scrambling to try to comply such chaos is an extreme example of the increasing logistical challenges the airlines say they face as they try to care for these passengers with sensitivity without causing major flight disruptions this is a very good market frankly , said andrea rader , a spokeswoman for american airlines , said of disabled passengers even with the decline in travel since the terrorist attacks , the number of american airlines customers who requested wheelchairs when they made reservations rose to 765 , 721 this past year from 748 , 153 in the previous year , ms rader said she added that the number of wheelchair requests was as much as 40 percent higher when combined with requests from people who ask for wheelchairs once they arrive at airports the airline gets about 500 requests a day for wheelchairs at hubs like the miami airport , she said the main reason for the surge is that , more than a decade after passage of the americans with disabilities act brought about wider access to public buildings , people with debilitating conditions have much more mobility to travel for business and leisure , airlines and advocacy groups say improved technology has also made wheelchairs and medical equipment lighter and more portable , giving the growing population of elderly americans more freedom to fly , advocates for disabled people say at the same time , the airlines say they expect an even greater demand for services geared toward passengers with limited mobility as more graying baby boomers begin to request wheelchairs at airports certainly the travel industry understands that this is a growing market , ms rader said that does not mean that every company does it right 100 percent of the time joni green knows that well and says the most recent flight she took was such an ordeal that it will probably be her last when mrs green , who is 72 , took an american airlines flight in august from miami to london for a 14day scandinavian cruise with her husband , she got stuck in the recline position in her firstclass seat and then found her wheelchair broken in baggage claim on the return flight it was , mrs green says , a reminder of the disability that she has worked hard not to make the focal point of her life since surgery four years ago for hip and pelvic cancer i am so active and think of myself as being very strong and healthy , mrs green said it frustrated me terribly , the whole airline business ms rader , the american airlines spokeswoman , said that she was not familiar with mrs green s case , but that such an incident should not have happened and that despite the airline s best efforts passengers occasionally have problems with wheelchairs or baggage three months ago the transportation department charged northwest airlines with discriminating against passengers with disabilities after customer complaints about wheelchair service and other assistance northwest would not comment directly on the case because the airline is in settlement negotiations , but a spokeswoman said the company was seeking ways to improve its service to what it considers an important customer base not only is it the right thing to do but it also is smart business , said kathy peach , a spokeswoman for northwest , which says the number of requests for wheelchairs the airline receives increased to 15 million last year from 12 million five years ago by law , airlines must reasonably accommodate passengers with disabilities since congress passed the air carrier access act in 1986 , for example , the carriers must train all personnel who deal with travelers on rights and accommodations for people with disabilities , help with delivering those passengers to connecting flights and equip newer jets with movable armrest for easier transport from a wheelchair to a seat yet for an industry trying to adjust to the new demands , the terrorist attacks only confounded the problem , some passengers say one woman who is in a wheelchair and was recently traveling home to houston from o'hare airport said she fretted in the days after the terrorist attacks about how she would handle a restriction on curbside passenger dropoffs i could n't fly without curb side , said the woman , susan mancil , 63 , who was waiting to take a continental flight after having visited her daughter it s one of the most important things for us how would i get myself and my bags to the counter \? i could n't do it in general , passengers who use wheelchairs , like most other travelers , give the airlines and airport workers a mixed service rating alan troop , a hardware wholesaler in miami who broke his neck in a surfing accident 24 years ago , said that , like any other frequent flyer , he had his share of horror stories mr troop says he has had his shirt ripped by a worker assisting him , has been nearly dropped by airline personnel lifting him in and out seats and has had to wait to be helped off planes until after the cleaning crew finished it makes me feel devalued , mr troop said it makes me feel more disabled actually because i have to rely on people who are not reliable still , mr troop says the airlines have come a long way since he first lost the ability to walk back then , none of the airlines had any procedures written down , he said , recalling the days when some airlines asked disabled customers to sit in separate sections of the terminal to keep them all in one place before boarding i mean travel with a disability is now a million times better than it used to be photo airlines at the busiest airports get about 500 requests a day for wheelchairs a skycap , james stephens , retrieved a chair at miami international \( andrew itkoff for the new york times \)
rome , march 2 many vatican officials , conservative and liberal alike , say it will take a sweeping reform of the priesthood to stop the pedophile scandals the liberals want better psychological screening and revamped training in seminaries the conservatives shift the focus elsewhere , saying that sexual abuse cases in the church mainly involve teenage boys , not young children , and for that reason they say the priesthood should become less welcoming to gays priests who said this made clear they were not suggesting that gays were any more likely to be pedophiles but they said most of the sex cases being investigated did not fit the classic definition of pedophilia with this in mind , pope john paul ii s spokesman , joaquin navarrovalls , questioned whether ordinations of gays were even valid people with these inclinations just cannot be ordained , dr navarrovalls said in an interview , citing canon law but wading into what he knew was sensitive territory that does not imply a final judgment on people with homosexuality , added dr navarrovalls , a spanish layman who is a psychiatrist by training but you cannot be in this field dr navarrovalls compared the situation of a gay man who becomes a priest to that of a gay man who marries a woman unaware of his orientation just as such a marriage can be annulled , considered invalid from the first , the ordination might similarly be invalid , he said where dr navarrovalls and a number of conservative american priests differ is on the vatican s handling of the sex scandals the vatican response has been so lowkey that a surprising number of the vatican rank and file are still only dimly aware of the crisis in the american catholic church , these priests say for americans here , the scandals back home have been topic a for weeks our bishops are in hysteria , one priest said the law is out the window , and suddenly it s like the french revolution still , he added good will come out of it eventually there will be bloodletting , but we are learning as big as the story is in the united states , you certainly do n't hear about it here among colleagues who are not american , said the rev keith pecklers , a jesuit at the pontifical liturgical institute in rome to the extent that others are aware of it , many tend to write it off as an american problem so there is widespread unhappiness among americans at the vatican , even among conservatives who are usually the least inclined to criticize the hierarchy on this issue , they say the response from rome has been embarrassingly weak several , none willing to be quoted , independently used the word disaster to describe both scandal and response , which they characterized as waitandsee they say that approach is typical of a still italian , largely eurocentric church unaware of the gravity of the situation the pope s spokesman argued that point we 're very well aware of the dimension and implications of the problem , dr navarrovalls said ruefully , very well aware asked if there had been any discussion of the need to formally respond to the american scandals from here , he said not for now they 're working on it there when the pope has something to say to one of his bishops or cardinals , dr navarrovalls said , he delivers the message directly and not through news releases cardinal bernard f law , who has been under pressure to resign over his handling of cases in the boston archdiocese , came to rome six weeks ago and met with the pope privately , dr navarrovalls said until recently , cardinal law was considered the vatican s favorite american cardinal , but that is no longer the case , a number of officials said dr navarrovalls defended the pope s silence on the scandals by arguing that the pope had spoken very explicitly on the general topic of sex abuse by members of the clergy in a recent vatican document but the way the pope communicated his apology to victims of abuse in a paragraph deep inside a document about a bishops' conference of several years ago was also cited as an indication that the church was not addressing the matter urgently without criticizing the pope , people in church circles here express a frustration with the vatican s inability to respond more quickly and less obscurely another reason for the vatican s muted response is that even now the standards for reporting and addressing accusations of sex abuse in the united states are seen as a model that the church would like to export to where such problems have been ignored in western europe , for example , there are no treatment centers specifically for sexually abusive clergy members , and sex scandals of all kinds receive much less attention than they do in the united states the true intention of a recent move to centralize the way accusations of sex abuse against priests are handled , vatican officials insist , is to bring the rest of the church up to american standards now when there s a problem it must be reported to the vatican , dr navarrovalls said this is not going to be a substitute for any legal or criminal penalties but will be an additional guarantee , an acknowledgment of the seriousness of the problem the holy see has thwarted american bishops who want to make it easier under canon law to dismiss predatory priests americans bishops want to be able to decide this on their own , administratively , rather than going through the judicial process spelled out in church law , said one italian canon lawyer at the vatican the judicial process can take years , whereas the administrative decision can be immediate he accused americans of pushing for this change only because tort law in the united states exposes bishops to liability in a way that does not apply elsewhere the painful thing is that it s all about money now , the italian priest said dr navarrovalls said the pope had reacted with pain to the disclosures he has shown tremendous sadness , a very physical sadness that affected his whole body and said , how can this happen \? ' dr navarrovalls said this has been my impression several times photo joaquin navarrovalls says the vatican is aware of the scope of the problem \( associated press \)
who s to blame for much of our weed problems \? possibly jethro tull , the 18thcentury farmer and writer who advocated , and developed , implements for the thorough pulverization of the soil as we gardeners go out every spring to turn over our soil we have also been churning our ground and exposing the myriad weed seeds lurking in every soil to light and air , which is just what they need to sprout years ago , i decided to try to put an end to my weed problems , and began by dispensing with tilling my soil in fact , although it may seem contrary to what many gardeners take as gospel , i now try to avoid any disruption of the natural layering that develops over time in soil i set transplants in the ground by pushing the dirt aside just enough to snuggle the roots in place spent annual flower and vegetable plants are cleared from the garden by giving their stems a sharp twist or jerk , or else by first severing the largest roots with a knife small roots are left to rot and improve the soil i even avoid disrupting the natural layering when enriching the soil rainfall and earthworms and other soil life gradually work fertilizers and organic materials into the ground after i lay them on the surface organic materials also protect the surface from pelting rain and hot summer sun , a benefit that is largely lost when these materials are dug in furthermore , fertilizers and organic materials do most good near the surface , where plant roots naturally proliferate not all weeds come from seeds within the soil they also sprout from seeds carried by wind or dropped by birds most weeds that arrive in this manner can be dealt with by covering the ground with a thin , weedfree mulch , renewed yearly or as needed the kind of mulch depends on the look i want , the plants and the soil poorer soil or more demanding plants get the most nourishing mulch compost i slather it an inch thick each fall over all my vegetable beds buckwheat hulls are adequate and attractive in flower beds paths get wood chips , straw or some other lean material free of viable weed seeds i could not , of course , just banish such words as rototill and dig from my vocabulary , throw some mulch over the ground and carry on as usual most soils need to be aerated , which tillage does however , the reason most soils need to be aerated is because they have become compacted from being driven or walked upon i avoid this problem by not walking or driving where plants grow my garden is laid out with permanent areas for plants and permanent areas for traffic planted areas in my vegetable garden consist of rectangular beds my flower gardens are more free form ground covers almost never get walked on and trees are planted in islands of mulch that also are rarely trod upon ideally , it should be possible to reach into the center of any bed especially vegetable beds , which need frequent attention for planting and harvest with feet firmly planted in a path thirtysix inches is a good width for a vegetable bed , although gardeners with longer reaches than mine could make do with 40inch wide beds flower beds can be wider , tolerating an occasional step garden paths range in width from a minimum of 18 inches for those between adjacent vegetable beds to 5 feet for a main path through the vegetable garden or a path for leisurely strolling among flower beds instead of mulch , paths could be nothing more than steppingstones among flowers , for example or even wellbehaved lawn there is little or no reason to go to the trouble of creating and maintaining raised beds except where drainage is a problem changing my watering technique was the final step i took on my road to weedless gardening not all plants need regular watering , but for those that do , i use drip irrigation drip irrigation pinpoints water right to plants , so none is wasted promoting weed growth between widely spaced plants or in paths the combination of all these techniques has brought benefits beyond fewer weeds the mulches also conserve water and keep roots cool minimal soil disturbance keeps humus levels high and maintains a network of permanent pores for draining excess water and moving capillary water around i no longer have the trouble of tilling and the delay of waiting for the soil to dry enough to till in spring and because there s no need to leave space between every row of plants for walking , more plants can be squeezed into the garden planted in beds and more vegetables and flowers reaped of course , in spite of my weedless gardening system , weeds do still appear , but weed problems do not what few weeds i find i yank out roots and all weeds with long taproots , like dandelion and burdock , may need to be coaxed out by thrusting a trowel alongside their taproot , then levering up just enough to free the root colonies of small weeds are quickly done in with a winged weeder , colinear hoe or some other hoe having a sharp blade that slides parallel to and just a fraction of an inch below the soil surface i pay special attention to the garden edges , where weeds and grasses attempt to sneak in very important in avoiding weed problems are regular weed forays young weeds not only are easiest to remove but have yet to spread by seed or creeping roots by planting in beds and not disturbing the soil , keeping the surface covered and using drip

washington , july 31 a federal judge provided a significant legal victory for the bush administration today when she dismissed lawsuits brought by two groups of detainees at guant namo bay , saying united states courts had no jurisdiction over prisoners there the judge , colleen kollarkotelly , said that the american naval base at guant namo , cuba , where the detainees are being held , was not formally part of the united states and that as a result the detainees did not have constitutional protections under wellestablished principles , even noncitizens have some constitutional protections once they are inside the united states in dismissing the cases , judge kollarkotelly said she did not believe that any court would have jurisdiction over the guant namo detainees the cases , one brought by a group of 12 kuwaitis and the other by an australian and two britons seized while apparently fighting for the taliban in afghanistan , provided the first definitive ruling on the legal rights of the guant namo prisoners in effect , judge kollarkotelly s ruling justified the administration s decision to use the base at guant namo to hold prisoners seized in the war against afghanistan officials chose the 45squaremile base in southeastern cuba because it was isolated from civilians and remote enough to allow them to control the prisoners and interrogate them the authorities also said they thought the base would be out of reach of american courts the question presented to the court by these two cases is whether aliens held outside the sovereign territory of the united states can use the courts to pursue claims brought under the united states constitution , the judge wrote both parties , she said , were seeking for the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus , a technique to challenge someone s detention as illegal or unconstitutional judge kollarkotelly cited a 1950 case in which the supreme court ruled that 21 germans held in china and charged with waging war against the united states did not have habeas corpus protections she also ruled that the guant namo base , which the united states leases under a 1903 agreement that was renewed as a perpetual lease in 1934 , was not the equivalent of a united states territory american officials have said that more than 560 prisoners from 33 countries are being held at guant namo the officials said they were making room for more than 2 , 000 prisoners barbara olshansky , the assistant director of the center for constitutional rights in new york , which helped represent the australian and two britons , called the ruling misguided and said she would appeal ms olshansky said detainees in guant namo had not been given some rights that the supreme court allowed the germans who were tried in china moreover , she said , it was unrealistic to assert that american courts did not have jurisdiction over guant namo , because that would mean cuba has control over the area , and it clearly does not there s a wide assumption that all these people are guilty of something , ms olshansky said , but right now they are being held in a legal limbo and have not been charged with anything judge kollarkotelly said that while the guant namo detainees were not entitled to constitutional protections , they had some rights under international law what those rights were , she said , was a matter to be negotiated between diplomats from the united states and the detainees' home countries the judge expressed mild skepticism about the claim of the australian and two britons who said they were in afghanistan for peaceful reasons she noted that in an earlier filing , they had acknowledged more openly that they had carried arms the kuwaiti prisoners have said they were in afghanistan during their vacation time to help build mosques and aid orphans and refugees kuwaiti officials , who are paying for the lawsuit , have asked the united states for permission to visit the prisoners officials at the kuwaiti embassy here had no comment today thomas b wilner , a washington lawyer who represents the kuwaitis , said in a statement that he would also appeal the ruling although defense department officials have acknowledged that some of the detainees at guant namo are completely innocent and do n't belong there , none have been allowed to meet or speak with their families or with counsel , and none have even been informed of the charges , if any , against them , mr wilner said
much of the classical music world has rolled up its summer tent and headed off for a few weeks' quiet before the start of the new season but at bargemusic the concerts go on , and hearing a recital there on thursday evening a night when there were few offerings for a concertgoer to choose from a listener was struck by how far this floating concert hall has come since 1977 , when olga bloom began presenting her chamber music series there in the early years the nature of the hall a converted barge , moored on the brooklyn side of the east river made the concerts something of a novelty but bargemusic quickly became a place where one could hear promising young musicians in varied repertory and at reasonable prices the schedule gradually increased to the current level of four concerts a week \( two programs , each repeated once \) , and now bargemusic is doing something that none of the manhattan concert halls are doing it offers concerts all year round with no regard for seasons and their social conventions there have been some tradeoffs by the mid1980 s the porous roster of young players coalesced into a core ensemble of players who had become fixtures of chamber music life in new york that helped establish a solid performance standard , but it made the performances interchangeable with many that could be heard any night in manhattan and although the core group was regularly augmented with young players , bargemusic had ceased to be a place to discover fresh interpreters starting next week , the hall , which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year , is presenting a revamped roster , focusing again on young players with edward arron , the cellist , and navah perlman , the pianist , directing the programming the change has restored an important part of bargemusic s original mission , but it has also left some bruised feelings among the former core players , who feel dispossessed for her part , mrs bloom , who is a vigorous 83 , is aggrieved that some of the musicians had been negotiating the future of the barge with members of the organization s board behind her back something that may have helped precipitate the change of roster but probably the best thing for everyone , including listeners , would be a schedule in which the former regulars still played at the barge on occasion the performance on thursday evening showed that the old guard still has much to offer , a point that was never in dispute the players were carmit zori , the violinist , and randall hodgkinson , the pianist the program had some unusual touches handel s violin sonatas , for example , have been rarities at violin and piano recitals since the 1960 s when the advent of the earlymusic movement made such performances seem oddly anachronistic ms zori and mr hodgkinson opened their recital with a sweettoned account of the sonata in e \( op 1 , no 15 \) , and if they showed due regard for academic niceties by keeping the performance tightly focused , ms zori made no compromises in tone color or breadth mozart s sonata in b flat \( k 454 \) also benefited from ms zori s sumptuous tone , which was abetted by mr hodgkinson s carefully balanced keyboard line there was also a sense of lively dialogue that framed the music as a discussion rather than a dry recitation that quality enlivened beethoven s sonata in e flat \( op 12 , no 3 \) as well , particularly in the rondo , in which the interplay between the violin and the keyboard was particularly spirited ms zori and mr hodgkinson closed the concert with dvorak s sonatina in g \( op 100 \) , a work with an appealingly quirky , folkish undercurrent ms zori and mr hodgkinson gave it a graceful and often zesty performance photo the violinist carmit zori and the pianist randall hodgkinson at bargemusic \( hiroyuki ito for the new york times \)
negotiators of the proposed merger between cnn and abc news reported extensive progress late last week and predicted that an agreement in principle could be in place as early as january but as the negotiators pushed ahead , new questions arose over whether the leadership of cnn s parent , aol time warner , would delay any deal as it coped with other issues roiling the company aol time warner has been buffeted by a series of crises in the past year , including management changes , and it is now facing a federal investigation into its accounting some executives at the two companies said aol time warner could put off finalizing the merger , possibly for many months , to deal with what the board considers more pressing priorities the board may be a little gunshy for various reasons , one executive involved in the discussions said not because they think it s a bad deal i'm just not sure they want to take on a big , potentially controversial deal right now the board approval could also hinge on the position of ted turner , the aol time warner vice chairman and founder of cnn numerous executives involved in the talks said mr turner s position was unclear they said he wanted to ensure that cnn was the dominant partner in the new entity still , the executives negotiating to bring about the new venture expressed confidence that it would eventually be approved because it would result in what one executive said was hundreds of millions in cost savings and revenue gains the internal factors at aol time warner aside , that conclusion was challenged last week by analysts and competing news organizations who said they were doubtful that a deal would be as beneficial as indicated by abc s parent , the walt disney company , by aol time warner and by some in the news media specifically , the questions concern claims being made by cnn and abc news that a joint venture would enable them to marry their resources , cut redundancies and increase ad sales enough to generate more than 200 million in additional profits a year for the combined company some critics said the deal was a pure push to dazzle investment houses , with few other longterm benefits in an analysis of the merger last week , which he labeled a curb your enthusiasm report , tom wolzien , a media analyst for sanford c bernstein , said he could not find anywhere near that much in savings and additional revenue i can get to 100 million , he said after that i do n't know where it comes from mr wolzien said that trimming costs at a news division was much more difficult than simply combining costs of coverage because individual programs , like nightline and prime time live , had their own separate costs , which are far harder to cut without affecting the content the coverage business is a smaller portion of the costs than dealing with the costs of the shows , mr wolzien said cutting too deeply , he added , means you could start to disrupt the organization one unintended cost is the morale cost , he said how much is that worth \? competitors , for certain , have reason to raise questions should the merged venture run as smoothly as aol and disney hope , it could be a mighty force analysts , the negotiating parties argue , are drawing conclusions without knowing exactly what has been discussed or the exact budgetary structures of the two organizations a point mr wolzien conceded there could be stuff in there i do n't know about , he said the executives involved in the deal emphasized that the revenue improvements would be realized over the long term we 're looking for hundreds of millions over five years , one executive involved in the negotiations said it 'll take five years to get it all up and running the plan , as it has been worked out by the two sides , would be to form a new entity , a joint venture to manage the two news operations but each news operation would maintain its own identity these brands are too valuable to change , said one executive , who added that no new name would be introduced and that at least in the short term , viewers would see almost no difference still , the path to a merger is thick with nettles , and obstacles to the completion of a deal , as well the financial and strategic challenges the new organization faces , remain they seem to number in the dozens , from how the abccnn consortium would sell advertising time to how valuable that time would ultimately be and how scheduling decisions would be made about news programs shown on the abc broadcast network in essence , abc newscnn would be an outside contractor to the abc network disney would own roughly 30 percent of the new company to aol time warner s 70 percent the entity would have a single management structure and would be overseen by a board that , under one possible plan , would be composed of two officers from disney and two from aol time warner this would provide joint control in the face of the lopsided equity arrangement before factoring in any cuts , the new organization would have nearly 16 billion a year in costs 900 to 1 billion from the cnn side and roughly 200 million in profit , almost all of it generated from the cnn side
he was lefthanded he wore a goatee he had a tattoo of an ostrich on his left arm , and another that said namor his wife s name just above his navel he smoked cigarettes and always carried a souvenir blue lighter from atlantic city on the morning of sept 11 , 2001 , he was wearing a light blue shirt with a navy blue blazer and black slacks , the typical attire of a young man selling stocks for a financialservice firm in the world trade center his name was michael young , he was from brooklyn , and he had turned 37 a day earlier there is one other telling detail about michael young he does not exist four months ago , namor young began a prison sentence after admitting she concocted a story about a dead husband to defraud disasterrelief agencies detectives say that ms young , 32 , melded the descriptions of two exboyfriends to create a fictitious spouse and collect more than 53 , 000 beyond its creepy audacity , what makes the story of michael young interesting is that there are dozens like it since the disaster , many people have been caught capitalizing on the grief and chaos of the moment by fraudulently claiming to have lost loved ones new york city authorities say that they alone have made 37 arrests , and others have cropped up around the country in springfield , ill , people raised more than 6 , 400 for a coworker who said his brother had died in the collapse , leaving a wife and seven children no such brother existed , the police said in west chester , ohio , a man was convicted of falsely filing a claim on a 100 , 000 insurance policy in the name of his father , who was in india when the towers fell in san diego , a man was indicted for collecting more than 136 , 000 after claiming that his wife , the mother of 10 children , had died she is alive , they have one child , and he gambled away the money at casinos two weeks ago , federal authorities in missouri charged cassaundrea montgomery of st joseph with creating a younger brother so convincing that she collected more than 63 , 000 in aid on the pretense that he had died in the trade center collapse ms montgomery , who has not yet entered a plea , claimed he always wore a st christopher medal and preferred marlboro light 100 s for daniel heinz , a sergeant assigned to the new york police department s special frauds squad , the allegations in the montgomery case extend beyond fraud to approach a secular kind of sacrilege the name of her makebelieve brother , jeffrey montgomery , followed that of a reallife firefighter in the roll call of the dead that rang through lower manhattan during september s firstyear commemoration of the disaster everyone in this squad had friends who perished , he said since the collapse , the official number of victims has dropped dramatically it fell from 6 , 729 in the first harrowing weeks to 2 , 801 by the firstyear commemoration , and continues to fall , with discoveries of duplication , mistaken death reports and more fraud , which has occurred because hundreds died without leaving a trace as of today , the official number of dead is 2 , 792 but that number will probably fall again , said sergeant heinz , who has led the squad s seven other detectives in trying to prove or disprove the existence of scores of people listed as trade center victims the squad s trade center work is far from over , he said we have nearly two dozen cases of potential fraud that we 're still investigating in the first days after the collapse , law enforcement veterans of the oklahoma city bombing offered the new york police some hardearned advice be prepared for an avalanche of fraud but sergeant heinz said he and others were overwhelmed at the time with grueling assignments at the medical examiner s office , carrying body bags , notifying family members fraud seemed the least of it soon , though , the police and the manhattan district attorney s office began focusing on disasterrelated crimes beyond the theft of tourneau watches or the electronic looting of a credit union here and there among the thousands of grieving relatives were people providing evasive answers instead of solid documentation about lost loved ones several agencies have worked on these cases , including the medical examiner s office , the state attorney general s office , the city s law department , and police departments across the country but the bulk of the caseload fell to the special frauds squad , which for most of the last year has worked out of a stuffy back office in east harlem , where a fan propped near the door stirs the tight air we 've had fictitious victims , we 've had victims who have been dead for years , we 've had people in prison calling to say that they were dead , sergeant heinz said and just because we have the case does n't mean that it s fraud we 've even had one or two homeless people to track down and we did i used to have a lot of the names of the victims in my head from notifying so many families , he added now i have the names of all the perps
following are excerpts from the senate debate about the use of force against iraq , as recorded by the new york times the speakers included senators tom daschle , democrat of south dakota richard j durbin , democrat of illinois phil gramm , republican of texas and john w warner , republican of virginia , senator daschle with this resolution we are giving the president extraordinary authority how he exercises that authority will determine how successful any action in iraq might be in 1991 , by the time the president s father sought congressional support to use force against iraq , he had secured pledges of military cooperation from nearly 40 nations and statements of support from scores of others he had already secured the backing of the united nations , and he had already developed a clear plan of action in assembling that coalition , the legitimacy of our cause was affirmed regional stability was maintained the risk to our soldiers was lessened america s burden was reduced and perhaps most importantly , iraq was isolated at this point we have done none of those things that is why , unlike in 1991 , our vote on this resolution should be seen as the beginning of a process , not the end for our efforts in iraq to succeed , the president must continue to consult with congress and work hard to build a global coalition that is not capitulation it is leadership and it is essential in my view there are five other crucial steps , steps the administration must take before any final decision on the use of force in iraq is made first and foremost , the president needs to be honest with the american people , not only about the benefits against iraq , but also about the risks and the costs of such action we are no longer talking about driving saddam hussein back to within his borders we are talking about driving him from power that is a much more difficult and complicated goal a story in this past sunday s philadelphia inquirer suggests that top officials in the administration , have exaggerated the degree of allied support for a war in iraq the story goes on to say that others in the administration are rankled by what they charge is a tendency by some in the administration to gloss over the unpleasant realities of a potential war with iraq a report in yesterday s washington post suggests that an increasing number of intelligence officials , including former and current intelligence agency employees , are concerned the agency is tailoring its public stance to fit the administration s views i do not know whether these reports are accurate we do know from our own national experience , however , that public support for military action can evaporate quickly if the american people come to believe that they have not been given all of the facts if that should happen no resolution in congress might pass that would unify our nation the american people expect , and success demands , that they be told both the benefits and the risks involved in any action against iraq second , we need to make clear to the world that the reason that we would use force in iraq is to remove saddam hussein s weapons of mass destruction i would have preferred this goal had been made explicit in this resolution however , it is clear from this debate that saddam s weapons of mass destruction are the principal threat to the united states and the only threat that would justify the use of the united states military force against iraq it is the threat that the president cited repeatedly in his speech to the american people monday night it may also be the only threat that can rally the world to support our efforts therefore , we expect , and success demands , that the administration not lose sight of this essential mission third , we need to prepare for what might happen in iraq after saddam hussein regime change is an easy expression for a difficult job one thing we have learned from our action in afghanistan is that it is easier to topple illegitimate regimes than it is to build legitimate democracies we will need to be much better in postsaddam iraq than the administration has done so far in posttaliban afghanistan iraq is riven by religious and ethnic differences and demoralized by a repressive government and crushing poverty it has no experience with democracy history tells us that it is not enough merely to hope that wellintentioned leaders will rise to fill the void that the departure of saddam hussein would leave we must help create the conditions under which such a leader can arise and govern unless we want to risk seeing iraq go from bad to worse , we must help the iraq people build their political and economic institutions after saddam that could take many years and many billions of dollars , which is another reason we must build a global coalition the american people expect , and success demands , that we plan for stability and for economic and political progress in iraq after saddam fourth , we need to minimize the chances that any action we may take in iraq will destabilize the region throughout the persian gulf there are extremists who would like nothing more than to transform a confrontation with iraq into a wider war between the arab world and israel or the arab world and the west what happens if by acting in iraq we undermine the government in jordan , a critical ally and a strategic buffer between iraq and israel what happens if we destabilize pakistan and empower islamic fundamentalists \? unlike iraq , pakistan already has nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them what happens if that arsenal falls into the hands of al qaeda or other extremists \?

effort to expand 480 tickets the owners of broadway inner circle , which sells 480 premium tickets for the producers , are trying to add other shows to their highpriced ticket plan , which has outraged many theatergoers before starting the company , the founders of inner circle approached the producers of several broadway productions , including two major hits , the lion king and mamma mia ! since then they have also approached at least three other broadway shows arriving soon the graduate , sweet smell of success and oklahoma ! while boxoffice reports indicate that the inner circle has done well with the 480 tickets , none of the other shows have yet decided to offer similar tickets through the company a spokesman for broadway inner circle , owned by four producers of the producers , declined to comment on the participation of other shows the program , which targets corporate customers and highend tourists who are willing to pay plenty for quick access to the show , started in october apparently in an effort not to appear to be pricegouging a tickethungry public , the producers presented the new tickets 50 at every show as a way to get a cut of the lucrative market dominated by scalpers as well as a way of assuring its creative team and investors a share of earnings others , however , saw the 480 tickets as just another step in the evolution of broadway from populist cultural entertainment to elitist fare and despite the producers' vow to fight the scalpers , indications are that the 480 ticket has done little to cut demand for resold tickets or their price this week , for example , two tickets for wednesday s evening show were offered for 810 each on www ticketsnow com inner circle s founders have been tightlipped about whether the 480 tickets have been a success , but a glance at recent box office reports suggests that the tickets have been selling , at least during the busy holiday season last week the show reported a gross of 1 , 230 , 123 , which could be reached only if most or all of the 480 tickets had been sold it is not known whether demand for the highpriced tickets will remain strong after the show s stars , nathan lane and matthew broderick , leave the production both are under contract only until midmarch another uncertainty is whether any other broadway show has the boxoffice appeal to warrant such prices mamma mia ! , for example , is an undeniable hit the show grossed 962 , 801 at the winter garden theater last week but scalpers generally charge only 250 to 300 for its orchestra seats spreading the risk how many producers does it take to hang a witch \?

detroit , aug 29 for nearly a year , the three foreigners picked up at an apartment here a week after the sept 11 attacks seemed like just another group of arab men caught up in the government dragnet they languished in prison while facing charges that seemed minor federal agents had actually been looking for the previous occupant when they raided the apartment but at least one thing appears to have separated the detroit trio from hundreds of other arabs swept up by the government in the last year a cooperative witness a fourth arab man who once lived with the men and who had been charged in the case appears to have become a witness against the other three and is playing a critical role in the government s case the picture painted by the indictment issued on wednesday by a federal grand jury is of a busy terrorist cell working hard to avert suspicion the men used fake names to open post office boxes and had phony visas so authenticlooking that one veteran investigator of visa frauds said he could not tell the visas were bogus , and they even enlisted a mentally unstable man to disguise their notes , federal court filings show much of this evidence comes from an apartment on norman street in detroit which was once the residence of nabil almarabh , who the government believed had ties to al qaeda it was mr almarabh , 35 , that federal agents were looking for when they raided the apartment on sept 17 his name was still on the mailbox instead , they found the three men who were indicted on wednesday as being part of a terrorist conspiracy karim koubriti , 24 , and ahmed hannan , 34 , both moroccans , and farouk alihaimoud , 22 , an algerian a fourth man from chicago and known as abdella was also indicted he is still at large the detroit case has been aggressively investigated by federal authorities since last september when the men were first arrested the case has stirred debate within the government , government officials said some officials have hinted that they suspected the men had ties to al qaeda , but others have said that no evidence has emerged to show any definitive connection the indictment paints the men as operating a terrorist cell , though no definitive connections to al qaeda are revealed none of the men are now suspected of knowing in advance of the sept 11 attacks , government officials said while the men are regarded by counterterrorism officials as lowlevel operatives , the charges against them are serious , particularly an accusation that they conspired to provide material support for terrorism against the united states some officials said today that the case was important but not a breakthrough in understanding terror operations in the united states the indictment provides little information about the nature of the terror operation that the men are accused of supporting , nor does it indicate how far plans for an attack had progressed investigators did find in the norman street apartment a cache of material they considered suspicious , including audiotapes that preached jihad , notes suggesting a plot against william s cohen , the former secretary of defense , and a cache of phony id documents the indictment said investigators also found a videotape that had surveillance footage of the mgm grand hotel and casino in las vegas and disneyland in anaheim , calif it remains unclear whether the material belonged to the three men or to mr almarabh mr koubriti , one of the three men , implicated a fifth man , youssef hmimssa , whose picture was found among forged identity documents mr koubriti said that a day planner that contained notation in arabic referring to an american airbase in turkey , the american foreign minister and an airport in jordan , belonged to mr hmimssa mr koubriti and mr hmimssa had lived together in dearborn mr hmimssa was arrested shortly after the first raid , on sept 28 , in cedar rapids , iowa kevin ernst , a lawyer for mr alihaimoud , said in an interview on wednesday that mr hmimssa was cooperating with the government the only difference between october of last year , when the government dismissed the charges against my client because there was no evidence , and today , when they issued the superseding indictments , is one snitch , mr ernst said referring to mr hmimssa mr hmimssa s lawyer , stephen rabaut , did not return calls government officials would not say whether he was an informer jim thomas , a lawyer for mr hannan , said his client had been held since sept 17 without a bond he is still , in the face of these very serious charges , presumed to be innocent , mr thomas said the trial will be scheduled hopefully for some time in january and at that time we expect to have a full and fair hearing in front of impartial jury while the case against the three men in detroit has grown more serious , the case against mr almarabh , the initial target , appears to be winding down mr almarabh , who is being held at a prison in batavia , ny , is likely to be deported to algeria after pleading guilty to illegally entering the country we brought an immigration violation charge against him that charge does not contain any evidence linking him terrorism , bryan sierra , a spokesman for the justice department , said in the indictment against the other men , the government says they were part of a terrorist cell that provided support to other operatives , recruited members , collected intelligence on potential targets and cased the detroit metropolitan airport while all three worked there part of the men s intent was to cause economic harm to us businesses , the indictment said , and previous documents said they planned an economic jihad the men went to some length to conceal their plan , it said they used a mentally unstable man to try to disguise their writings in a notebook they used the man , who is not identified in the indictment , to write his name and personal information on some of the notebook pages found in the apartment , which contained plans and sketches of an american airbase in turkey and a jordanian hospital they also had the man temporarily hold on to the notebooks it appears that they also had highquality false id documents edward seitz , a special agent for the state department who has investigated visa fraud for 14 years , testified at an april hearing that one of the visas

perhaps the best news from the jets' victory last sunday was that ted cottrell , their defensive coordinator , saw none of the body language that expressed his players' onfield exasperation in the previous five games , when shoulders sagged and heads shook with each long run by opponents and every missed tackle but the jets missed only three tackles sunday against minnesota , the first time all season that statistic was a single digit newcomers made huge plays cornerback donnie abraham intercepted a pass by daunte culpepper on the vikings' first offensive play veterans , who finally seemed to find their comfort level with new teammates , made even bigger plays linebacker mo lewis forced two turnovers deep in jets territory and put pressure on culpepper that resulted in another in the end zone the four turnovers , and two near interceptions , reminded cottrell of the last 10 games of the 2001 season , when the jets turned their defense around drastically coach herman edwards even started talking about establishing a defensive identity would it be a run stopper \? an overall dominant defense that gives up few points \? a defense that excels at creating turnovers , as it did last season \? we just do n't want to be a sieve defense like we were , cottrell said with a laugh a bye week gave the jets' defense extra days to practice and build trust the integration of six new starters has taken far longer than cottrell expected , but sunday s game bore the earmarks of the turning point in 2001 last season , the jets' defense struggled through six games in week 7 , the jets played an ugly game against carolina , then one of the worst teams in the league the jets' 1312 victory was ugly unless you were a defensive coordinator cottrell had tinkered with the unit , which allowed 162 yards against the panthers from that point , the jets allowed 41 yards a play the pittsburgh steelers , who had the league s top defense last season , allowed 45 yards a play for the season if this is the beginning of another jets turnaround , then it came against better competition than the panthers of last season the jets faced a vikings offense that was ranked sixth in the league but in considerable disarray the vikings did not try to force the ball to randy moss more \( he did not catch a pass in the first half \) , and 26 of their 101 rushing yards came on culpepper scrambles the jets gave up 389 yards to the vikings , but 191 came in the fourth quarter , when the jets were protecting a lead the jets added a few significant wrinkles to the defense that will most likely be seen again they switched coverages to confuse culpepper and force him to go to his second or third option the jets had lewis be more active he rushed the quarterback at times or dropped into coverage the jets frequently used a threeman rush and dropped eight defenders into coverage to take away the vikings' deep routes especially if we do n't feel we are getting a good enough rush , we might as well drop another guy on coverage , edwards said at times , when you are not getting there with four guys and you have to get there with five , every once in a while you have to make sure you have enough on coverage the jets freed weakside linebacker sam cowart to roam the field he had seven tackles , even though cottrell estimates he missed 25 to 30 snaps because he did not play on third down and in the dime package at the end of the game but the run defense benefited from improved play on the line defensive tackles josh evans and larry webster played their best game of the season , cottrell said we were able to stop the run with a sevenman front , cottrell said we did n't have to commit a safety if we had to commit a safety , it would open things up for randy most encouraging for the jets , they finally showed the trust in each other that enabled each player to perform his assignment without fear of what was happening somewhere else the jets' defensive turnaround last season enabled them to win four games in a row and propelled them into the playoff race to accomplish the same thing this year will be a challenge cleveland , the jets' opponent on sunday , does not have a highpowered offense the browns' running game is next to last in the league \( the jets are last \) , but their passing game is ranked 11th on nov 3 , san diego s ladainian tomlinson will test the jets' revived defense that is why there was no celebration sunday night , just a sigh of relief we finally looked like a defense , cottrell said i know they 've been wanting to do well they were pressing at times , leaving their area they had to trust guys on their back side we told them , 'we can only put you in a spot , but you have to make a play' they made some plays we ca n't just have this one thing and say we 're there we have to do it over and over and over again it s 'what have you done for me lately \?

chestnut hill , mass , jan 24 duke s nonconference road games at this time of year take on the appearance of a traveling road show , with opposing fans turning out as much for the slim chance of an upset as for a peak at the best team in the country boston college sold out conte forum tonight and its students , clad in mustard yellow tshirts , tried their best to rattle duke s best player , jason williams each time williams went to the freethrow line , the tomahawk chop began in the student section later , chants of fsu rose from the crowd , a reminder of the two foul shots that williams missed in the closing minute of duke s only loss this season , at florida state and finally , eagles fans seemed giddy as they chanted troy is better , in reference to their star guard , troy bell none of that mattered topranked duke is so good , so dripping with talent , that williams can have an off night and his teammates can play for half a game and hardly any team stands a chance duke built a 29point lead in the first 15 minutes , got lazy and still won by 8878 i do n't like duke , bell said that s the bottom line i never have i like grant hill after shooting 25 percent in his previous three games and playing through a poor first half , bell finished with 26 points williams scored 15 , missed half of his 16 foul shots and turned the ball over 6 times bell had longed for this game since an embarrassing loss last season in durham , nc and since he had played alongside three duke players last summer in a tournament in japan his revenge must wait bell teamed with duke center carlos boozer and teammates chris duhon and dahntay jones in japan the duke threesome combined to score 54 points tonight , led by boozer s 28 boozer collected 14 of his points in the first half as duke raced ahead , 203 , 3911 and then 4213 , its biggest margin of the game the blue devils could have built off that the only thing that appears to hold duke back sometimes is its own wavering intensity the blue devils settled for a 4626 halftime lead duke resembled a professional team in training , with crisp passes , defenders slicing into the passing lanes and repeated breakaway attempts boston college looked as if it forgot to show up duke was leading by 3511 before coach al skinner called his first timeout skinner explained that he typically lets his team play out of funks , but by then , the game was as good as over all i know is they did n't miss , skinner said of duke even in a game of horse , you miss the eagles' uka agbai said , it seemed like we were all in a daze bell seemed the most passive he missed a 3pointer to open the game and , after taking a backdoor pass for a layup , received the ball on the perimeter , but hesitated and did not shoot twice , he dribbled the ball off his leg but bell helped orchestrate the eagles' rally , using a 226 run to draw within 7766 on his leaning jumper with 4 minutes 7 seconds left williams missed 5 of 10 foul shots after that , but boston college did not get closer until a 3pointer at the buzzer free throws have become a problem for williams he entered tonight s game shooting a careerlow 648 percent from the line he s too good of a player to worry about , duke coach mike krzyzewski said i'm not worried about his freethrow shooting , let s put it that way and if he s taking pressure free throws , that means we have the lead and that 'll be very , very good bell and williams each appeared out to prove something a look of anger flashed across williams s face after bell sent him tumbling with a hard foul on a breakaway attempt early in the game when bell dribbled into williams later , sending both players crashing to the floor , bell snatched at the ball asked if bell and ryan sidney \( 10 points \) had proven they were as good as williams and duhon \( 10 points \) , skinner said , i'm looking at the bottom line and they won and we lost last season s meeting , a 9775 blue devils' victory , ended in ugly fashion , with boston college s kenny walls shoving williams into the scorer s table in response to williams s taunting of the eagles walls then promised a return victory this season williams had 34 points in that game and bell scored 16 , but made only 4 of 16 shots bell gave more depth to the rivalry last summer , when he teamed with duhon , jones and boozer on the united states team at a tournament in japan krzyzewski did not wait until after the game to praise bell the eagles' guard was strolling by the duke bench during a break in the closing minute and krzyzewski approached him , congratulated him on a good game and told him how much he respected his game the two shared a smile and krzyzewski told bell , hopefully , this game made both of us better

he arrived in this country , tall and skinny and speaking with a jamaican accent you know how cruel kids can be at 11 , 12 , 13 , said mike jarvis , who became his high school coach i told him that one day they 'd be buying tickets to watch him play this was back in the neighborhood between central square and the charles river , jarvis said it was not boston , jarvis said it was cambridge jarvis , who maintains his finely tuned sense of being an outsider even as the coach of st john s , was trying to explain his friend patrick ewing , who retired as a basketball player yesterday ewing has been an enigma to many of the fans in madison square garden , to say nothing of some of his professional coaches he never satisfied the needs of the new york news media , if that is indeed possible jarvis says none of that matters he says ewing is the classic american success story somebody who came with goals , and met all the important ones he not only came from another culture , his culture came with him , jarvis said proudly yesterday as ewing held a news conference in manhattan to say he would become an assistant coach with the washington wizards jarvis was his coach at cambridge rindge and latin school before they rode off , separately , into the big time perhaps none of this would have happened for either of them except for the fierce dreams of dorothy and carl ewing she came here as an immigrant , and she brought her children , one by one , jarvis recalled you hear patrick talk about hard work his mother s foundation was her sweat ewing briefly referred to his jamaican roots yesterday , but quickly meandered into the clich of giving 110 percent , an echo of how he went through four years at georgetown saying he agreed with whatever coach john thompson had just said yet give ewing this on the day he retired , a phalanx of former teammates , former coaches , executives , publicists and mike saunders , his former trainer , showed up for him these loyal friends , with their own talents and standards , ought to matter more than ewing s lack of public grace jarvis remembered how ewing s parents wanted to make sure he received an education at rindge and latin she did not care about basketball and she did not care about money , jarvis said she cared about education if he had a degree , he would be all right jarvis was no fool seeing the athlete within that shy , gangly boy , he sometimes visited the family apartment in cambridge it was clean , jarvis said yesterday it was a home , but it was a poor home his room had a bed his door was a sheet hung from the ceiling but it was a home it was full of love and encouragement the parents left the basketball to jarvis the father was , i guess you 'd say , a laborer , jarvis said the mother worked in the kitchen at massachusetts general hospital , doing what you do in a kitchen , in an entrylevel job i do n't remember her ever going to a game she worked six days a week she had no time for basketball his father might have come to a few games , later on , but he worked hard , too part of the ewing legend is that the vicious banners and chants in the gyms of new england burned him at an early age that s because we almost always won , jarvis said that was part of it , going in to play a game , knowing you had to win and fight your way out i grew up that way in boston but the banners only got bad when he chose georgetown people in boston felt he was deserting them at some of the arenas of the big east conference , there were banners that said , ewing , you ca n't read this he graduated in four years with a degree in fine arts his mother died during his junior year she died of hard work , jarvis said hard work became ewing s mantra in good times and in bad , he would persevere , with sweat dripping off his face and body , staring intently at his coach in the huddle he became almost a caricature , the true believer , but he also played the game his way jeff van gundy praised ewing yesterday , alluding to his stubbornness and adding , patrick always came to you with his problems the knowledgeable fans in the garden that is to say , many of them writhed over his lack of imagination , his relatively weak hands , his susceptibility to a doublepump fake and ewing remained an outsider in new york who never learned to reach out also , he never won a championship oh , that , jarvis said , rolling his eyes unfortunately , he played at the same time as michael jordan when he dies and goes to heaven , nobody s going to say , 'but you did n't win a championship' ewing admitted he would always regret not winning in the pros , he emphasized , a reference to his national championship at georgetown much more important , ewing lived up to the dreams of his mother , who brought him up from jamaica and sent him out into the neighborhood and told him to make his way in this world photo st john s coach mike jarvis and patrick ewing after ewing announced his retirement yesterday in manhattan jarvis was ewing s high school coach \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
albany , may 2 a day after gov george e pataki and legislative leaders shook hands on the framework of a budget deal , the agreement appeared to be about as solid as butter left out overnight , as staff members struggled today to shore up critical details and resolve outstanding disagreements under the tentative deal , the legislature would add about 600 million in spending to the governor s proposed 89 billion budget , lawmakers and pataki aides said but they must also make up for a 14 billion shortfall in revenues caused largely by the blow terrorists dealt to the economy last year to pull off this trick , the leaders are relying on shifting hundreds of millions of dollars in funds dedicated to the environment and health care to the state s general coffers , spending more from reserve funds , borrowing more money for capital projects and raising taxes on tobacco the plan also counts on raising 175 million from deadbeat taxpayers through an amnesty program the budget is to cover the 2002 fiscal year , which began april 1 but the agreement remained fluid today , with nothing committed to paper or signed even the details of what lawmakers have promised to do to help the city solve its 5 billion budget shortfall remained sketchy that was evident when the governor was asked at a news conference with mayor michael r bloomberg how much the state would send the city schools i do n't want to get into the specifics and the dollars , because though we have the framework of the budget , the leaders still have to sit down with their conferences in the assembly and the senate and make sure the membership are on board , the governor said senator joseph l bruno , the leader of the republican majority in the upper house , said he expected the total package of aid the state would provide the city to be worth about 600 million , but he also hedged his comments until everything is wrapped up , it s hard to get more specific , he said but assembly democrats with knowledge of the tentative agreement said the legislature would give the city the ability to raise parking fines , impose new telephone taxes and refinance some of its debt to raise about 200 million the state also intends to let the city raise the tax on cigarettes to 150 a pack from 8 cents , but the state would get half of the 250 million generated by the tax a pack of cigarettes in the city now costs about 5 , including taxes beyond these measures , state leaders are undecided about what else to do for city hall that has n't been finalized , one senior legislative aid said i ca n't tell you what the city will get out of this budget the agreement does include some new tax cuts families of victims of the attack on the world trade center will not have to pay income tax for what they earned in the last two years the state would also create three taxfree periods during the year in lower manhattan to attract shoppers to that devastated area , a proposal the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , championed the precise amount of aid the city schools will get also remained murky today the agreement adds 515 million in education aid to the 142 billion the governor first proposed , but lawmakers have not decided how much of the increase will go to the city the state will also give the city schools an additional 200 million to cover old expenses from previous years that were never reimbursed because the city was late in requesting payment that money is expected to be spent on higher salaries for teachers , mr silver said beyond the additional school aid , the legislature persuaded mr pataki to add about 240 million in spending to restore some cuts he proposed to the college scholarships and give raises for thousands of healthcare workers , among them employees of nonprofit homes for the mentally ill , a pataki administration official said the state would pay for these additions partly by taking money from bank accounts fed by special taxes and earmarked for particular purposes the plan calls for taking 200 million out of the environmental protection fund to help close the budget gap another 200 million would be taken from a health care fund that usually provides insurance for the poor and used it to pay for emergency medical costs stemming from the sept 11 attack the money would eventually be repaid , administration officials said we are doing a lot of cash snatching , said assemblyman herman d farrell , chairman of the ways and means committee governor pataki has declined to raise taxes to deal with the financial crisis , but there are a few hidden tax increases in the plan the state s cigarette tax would be expanded to include chewing tobacco and cigars , for instance the administration also plans to borrow about 300 million to pay for construction projects rather than using cash , officials said mr pataki has also agreed with legislative leaders to scale back 1 billion in borrowing he wanted to do to provide seed money for hightech companies developing new products instead , the state would borrow 600 million for those projects this year , and 600 million more next year , but only if revenue from future indian casinos becomes a reality lobbying against some pieces of the tentative budget began in earnest today , even though state leaders committed none of their ideas to paper some environmentalists bemoaned taking money from the environmental protection fund , which is supposed to be dedicated to buying parkland , recycling and similar programs hospital executives also complained about borrowing 200 million from the 19 billion in various pools for health care one thorny problem still unresolved is how to offer early retirement to state workers several plans were floated at the bargaining table , but legislative leaders and the governor could not agree union leaders have proposed several plans , but so far none has satisfied the demands of the democratic speaker and the republican governor mr silver has advocated a program under which any employee who had reached 55 years of age and served 25 years would be eligible the governor insists managers should be able to pick and choose who would be let go some lawmakers said the unresolved issues like the early retirement incentives made it less likely the deal would hold together until a budget could be passed i do not think this deal will stick , said assemblyman richard l brodsky of westchester county it seems to me fairly clear that you have a handshake deal on a bigpicture agreement with many , many pieces unclear the city comptroller , william c thompson jr , also released a report today saying that the economic assumptions underlining the mayor s budget were too rosy in particular , he said the city s economy was likely to grow far more slowly than the mayor predicted , expanding by just 2 percent rather than the 47 percent forecast by the mayor mr thompson also predicted that the number of new jobs would rise by 30 , 000 , or 5 , 300 fewer than the executive budget assumes mr bloomberg s plan assumes that wall street is likely to rebound next year , which is heartening but may not be something that the city should count on , according to a statement released by mr thompson s office photo gov george e pataki s budget deal may give mayor michael r bloomberg 600 million for the city \( chester higgins jr the new york times

mayor michael r bloomberg announced yesterday that he would overhaul the byzantine system of building schools in new york city by merging the two agencies responsible for construction , cutting 600 jobs in the process mr bloomberg said that the department of education s school facilities division would be immediately combined with the school construction authority , an independent agency the idea is to have a single entity in charge of both the planning and execution of school construction instead of what the mayor called a twoheaded monster with divided responsibility and divided accountability the two agencies cannot officially merge without state legislative approval , but mr bloomberg , who won control of the school construction authority last spring when he took over the school system , said their duties could be combined at once legislative leaders indicated that they would agree to the change the cost of building schools in new york city has soared over the last decade , and various studies have attributed the problem to poor communication and backbiting between the department of education and the school construction authority a recent report by a state panel found that the two agencies often gave conflicting directives to contractors , causing many of them to stop building city schools as a result , the pool of bidders shrank and costs shot up that report , by the moreland commission , found that the average cost for new school construction was 432 a square foot last year in new york city but 146 a square foot nationally mr bloomberg and schools chancellor joel i klein said yesterday that they hoped that merging the two agencies would bring the average cost down to 325 a square foot the board of education used to have sole control over the planning and construction of schools , but it did such a bad job that the legislature created the school construction authority in 1988 the legislature left some responsibilities in the board s hands and did not clearly define each agency s role , so the problems continued the merger alone is not enough to sharply reduce the cost of building schools the bloomberg administration would also have to eliminate or change some of the roughly 3 , 000 regulations involved mr klein said that slashing regulations would be an urgent priority we are going to take a look at all these frontend requirements which have n't been looked at for years , mr klein said , standing next to mr bloomberg at a news conference on the site of a halfbuilt school in astoria , queens and we are going to try to streamline that in an effort to bring more competition competition will drive down the price mr bloomberg also appointed two new trustees to the school construction authority yesterday stanley e grayson , a former deputy mayor in the koch administration who more recently investigated problems with school construction as a member of the moreland commission and craig m hatkoff , a former wall street executive and longtime democratic fundraiser chancellor klein , who was also hired by the mayor , is the third trustee before mr bloomberg won control of the construction agency , its trustees were appointed by three people the chancellor , the mayor and the governor none of whom could be held directly accountable for problems with school construction mr bloomberg also recommended that the new trustees appoint william h goldstein , a construction executive , as the agency s new president mr goldstein , whose appointment is virtually guaranteed , is vice president of o'brien kreitzerg urs , a construction management company as president , he would oversee the daytoday management of the school construction authority mr klein said mr goldstein s first task would be figuring out how to cut 500 jobs from the construction authority and 100 from the school facilities division within the next six months those reductions would cut the staff at the construction authority by half and at the facilities division by 15 percent mr klein did not say exactly how much the reductions would save , but he said most of the two agencies' budgets 123 million for the construction authority and 400 million for the facilities division was spent on salaries harold o levy , the former schools chancellor , proposed merging the functions of the construction authority and the school facilities division in august 2001 , after officials discovered a nearly 3 billion shortfall in the 7 billion , fiveyear school construction budget mr levy lacked the political support to push the change through , though because of the shortfall , many construction projects have been frozen or put off indefinitely mr klein said another top priority would be figuring out how to make more accurate estimates of the cost of new schools and school renovations the disconnect between this kind of lofty fiveyear plans and what s going on in the field is significant , mr klein said we need much more timesensitive capital budget planning in addition , mr bloomberg said , the merged agencies would standardize school design as a way to cut costs currently , each school design is customized , down to the doorknobs , lights and clocks they never use the same plans twice , and once they give out a contract , they change the requirements so many times that it never gets done , and the cost escalates out of control , mr bloomberg said you just cannot in this world today customize every single thing photo chancellor joel i klein , left , and mayor michael r bloomberg said a top priority in the consolidation would be finding a total of 600 jobs within six months to trim from the two agencies involved in school construction \( james estrin the new york times \) \( pg b3 \)

i recently finished a hitch teaching writing at a large state university between new york and philadelphia because i may want to teach there again someday albeit in the distant future , under circumstances so fantastic and remote i ca n't possibly even imagine them let s just call the place flutgers you do n't teach for the money , which for flutgers adjuncts works out to a cool 12 euros a semester , about enough to cover the cost of gas and pringles no , i did it for the personal satisfaction of giving back to the community , of transferring knowledge to the next generation , of helping young writers unlock their intellects and explore their creativity on the other hand , the euro s kind of a fun currency , do n't you think \? profitable or not , i took it seriously i even dusted off the elements of style by strunk and white before my job interview , just in case i was to be quizzed on comma splices , participles and the other grammar hooey i never bothered to learn as a student but now felt qualified to teach at the college level i faded on strunk and white after page 4 , but it hardly mattered though my credentials got me the interview , i'm pretty sure i got the job because of a clean criminal record , inoffensive breath and a pulse rate flutgers has a sprawling writing program , and expository writing 101 expos 101 to all is legendary among undergrads for being difficult you have to pass it to receive a bachelor s degree , and many students have taken it term after term , year after year , epoch upon epoch in a tragic quest for a required credit one poor student told me she had taken and failed 101 six times i taught evenings , and my students included a few in their 20 s and 30 s who had returned to campus to finally muscle through their remaining credits most , though , were collegeage regulars who wound up in an evening class either because they had to work days for tuition money , or because out of dread they had waited too long to get into a daytime section none of us were prepared for the actual torpor of the thing by 7 30 pm , most students were spent and sullen many had already put in a full workday , dinner had come and gone , and yawns popped around the room like long , slow flashbulbs there was a lot of scratching i discovered that for many students , writing is a mystery up there with the virgin birth , only without any payoff instead of joy and revelation , these poor mugs got a pummeling readings so obscure they could make an angel beg for death a breathless writing schedule and my handwritten feedback , which was so extensive and messy you could n't read it if you wanted to and you never wanted to the readings , a collection of social science essays , were how you say just plain awful , for example , peter drucker s utopian maunderings on the rise of the knowledge worker penetrating and profound , and dry as a burlap bag at first , i assumed i could skip the basics , like sentence fragments and pronounantecedent agreement sure enough , by the end of the term i had delivered lectures on your friend the verb , make big letters work for you ! and the semicolon it s too complex to get into here , so leave it alone to keep people motivated , i also started out writing comments like , hi , ted your font selection is excellent ! keep it up ! ! rich weeks later , this had become ted you suck as a writer rp cruel \? sure but look at the provocation , like the student who spent 16 weeks researching child abuse only to conclude putting an child into heated oven is very disturbing fact and vanilla , he might have added , is very popular flavor really liked a lot in the end , i think you 're either programmed for writing or you 're not add to this the fact that most people are in a fog until long after college , and you 'll know what a university is up against which is why the unsung heroes of the flutgers writing program deserve combat bonuses the directors , the advisers , the staff and i do n't say that just because i may someday , in the distant future under circumstances so fantastic and remote that i ca n't even imagine them , want to teach again looking back , i hope my work mattered that one day a former student , writing an important office memo on , say , a new pickling process , will come to a nonessential clause , recognize it as such , and suddenly get it she 'll insert a comma in the right place or , she 'll paste in a template , run it through grammar check , scan in a signature , and have a good guffaw at expos 101 drawing \( tom bloom \)
washington , april 3 tom ridge , the homeland security director , said today that he would brief two house committees in coming days , in an effort to strike a balance between the white house s refusal to have him testify before congress and lawmakers' insistence on questioning him but the two sessions , with committees that are republicancontrolled , will be informal , and congressional aides said that at least the first of them would be held behind closed doors , to ensure that informality that will do little to diminish the rift between the white house and the democraticcontrolled senate over who is responsible for explaining domestic security efforts before congress senators say they want mr ridge to give formal testimony about how he coordinated the white house request for 38 billion for domestic security in the next fiscal year and 52 billion in supplemental appropriations this year , and how that money will improve the nation s defenses noting that he had served in congress for 12 years , mr ridge said at a briefing for reporters today that he understood the needs of lawmakers and had spoken informally on 35 occasions with senators and house members since his appointment by president bush last fall i have been , am and will continue to be accessible to members of congress of the united states , he said but with concern that the conflict in the middle east could pose a threat to civilians in the united states , the demand for mr ridge to testify is growing today he rejected any suggestion that increased vigilance was needed here because of the israelipalestinian violence he said the nation remained at the same yellow level of alert as before the stepup in palestinian suicide bombings and the resulting israeli military campaign in the palestinian territories that level , the middle one on a scale of five , requires national readiness for a significant risk of terrorist attacks mr ridge said there was no new threat based exclusively on credible information , none , that pointed to terrorists' planning new attacks in the united states as a result of the middle east fighting that does n't mean that an attack could or could n't occur , he added mr ridge said his mission to cobble together a comprehensive domestic security plan was on schedule he promised that the full strategic blueprint would be completed around july 1 but mr ridge also said the president had yet to approve the only proposal given him so far to begin some consolidation of the 80 departments and agencies that affect domestic security that plan , presented last month , would merge parts of the immigration and naturalization service and the customs service into a new agency that would control who and what enters the country the recommendation gained momentum in midmarch after the immigration service sent a flight school a pair of visa extensions , approved last summer , for two of the sept 11 hijackers that lapse raised more questions about mr ridge s mission and whether he had the authority to direct such an effort tom ridge needs to be a cabinet secretary subject to senate confirmation , with budgetary authority and accountability to congress for a homeland security strategy , said representative jane harman of california , ranking democratic member of the house intelligence subcommittee on terrorism and homeland security the dispute with the senate began when senator robert c byrd of west virginia , chairman of the appropriations committee , asked mr ridge to testify formally senator ted stevens of alaska , the committee s ranking republican , joined in the request but the white house , citing the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches , rejected the request , saying that as a member of the president s staff and not the head of a cabinet agency , mr ridge was not required to testify in an effort to meet congressional needs , mr ridge said today , he will brief the house government reform committee on april 11 that committee s chairman , representative dan burton of indiana , and other republican members decided that the meeting should be closed to ensure informality , said kevin binger , staff director of the panel mr ridge will then brief the house energy and commerce committee on april 17 the chairman of that panel , representative billy tauzin of louisiana , said through a spokesman that the session could be closed if mr ridge wished the spokesman , ken johnson , said it was important for the white house to work closely with congress in the war on terrorism , and added so we 'll meet with mr ridge at any time , anyplace , behind closed doors or in an open forum it s his call photo tom ridge at the white house yesterday he said there was no heightened security alert as a result of the middle east conflict \( carol t powers for the new york times \)
president bush s vacation plans changed abruptly when he decided recently to summon more than half his cabinet to a convenient location for an economic conference well , baylor university in the scorched prairie of waco , tex , a halfhour s drive from mr bush s ranch , was at least convenient for the president now the question is whether tomorrow s forum , which is reportedly going to include republican donors and exclude administration critics , will do anything to resolve the administration s failure to speak with one reassuring voice on the economy the waco forum is obviously a way to let mr bush show that he is concerned about the economy few americans could seriously doubt it but in truth there is not much mr bush or anyone can do to change the economic indicators as the november elections approach and to give the president his due , he came into office warning of a recession , even though the tax cut he proposed to deal with it was a bad idea that looks worse the more he presses to extend it the passage of legislation to promote trade was an important achievement , and mr bush signed a solid bill to restore corporate responsibility after showing an early lack of enthusiasm but on economic policy , and especially fiscal policy , this administration has no convincing plan what it has is an ideology and even that ideology lacks consistency the commitment to free trade did not survive pressures from swingstate steelmakers for protection , and the dedication to fiscal conservatism was tossed overboard with the enactment of an obscenely expensive farm aid package the impression left is that the white house s handling of the economy is driven by shortterm political concerns that image is not likely to be changed by the holding of a politically driven event like the waco conference the bush economic team has come under such heavy criticism these days that even many republicans expect a reshuffling after the election treasury secretary paul o'neill , lawrence lindsey , director of economic policy at the white house , and mitchell daniels , the budget director , are the ones most criticized , even by republicans in washington mr o'neill s crusty shootfromthehip style is popular among some , but it does n't necessarily make him the best choice for calming markets mr lindsey is supposed to manage economic policy , but he has done little beyond advocating tax cuts as the solution to everything but the biggest problem is that no one on the economic team seems to have the stature to work out a coherent policy and force the others particularly the political handlers to come on board mr o'neill was at least skeptical about tax cuts when he entered office , and he openly criticized the administration s expediency on trade \( perhaps mr o'neill could debate karl rove , the white house political director , at the conference tomorrow that s one way to bring the crowds to waco \) the treasury secretary s supporters say he wanted faster action on corporate issues but was rebuffed these reports have diminished his stature and cast doubt about how policy is made mr daniels , director of the office of management and budget , also has credibility problems his forecasts have had to be revised constantly , and his lectures on spending restraint are undercut by mr bush s signing the costliest farm bill in history in political terms , this is the first republican administration in a long while that will have a tough time beating up on democrats over the budget , in part because it is republicans who want to spend on the military and on homeland defenses and none of them want to think about rescinding the tax cut the president is not going to engage in any midcourse corrections until after the elections but this gathering in waco should mark the end of the administration s attempts to solve its problems by demonstrating that mr bush cares we know he cares what we need is evidence that he knows what to do
irvington nobody can pinpoint how many decades ago mike maffucci took to spending most of his waking hours sitting on a waisthigh brick wall in front of the irvington volunteer fire department on main street , greeting anyone and everyone who happened by with a friendly how 'ya doing \? nor can anyone say for certain when it was that local firefighters and police officers started looking after mr maffucci , a retiree with an everpresent sailor hat but shop owners , dog walkers and commuters alike are very much aware of the void created by the absence of the 76yearold man who people here call the mayor their sadness is tempered by the fact that they know exactly where he is and how he got there a story , they say , of smalltown citizens who cared today mr maffucci , who has no dependents , is a resident of bethel nursing home in ossining , being treated for a kidney ailment he is there thanks to the collective efforts of a trio of his old friends , headed by the town s mechanic and former fire chief , michael colantouno with the help of two irvington police officers , lt daniel raimondo and youth officer michael foley , mr colantouno set up mr maffucci s stay at the nursing home last fall in much the same way he has looked after him for years making sure he ate , had enough clothes , made doctor appointments and paid his bills there is a special place in heaven for everything that mike colantouno is doing on behalf of mike maffucci , said philip mondello , an irvington lawyer who helped arrange mr maffucci s financial affairs it goes beyond what anyone would even consider doing for a parent , and makes all the evils of the world look worse the entire town has adopted mike maffucci , but standing above the rest of us is mike colantouno mr colantouno , 48 , has power of attorney over mr maffucci s bank account and pays bill directly from it he does so with the support of mr maffucci s brother , joe , a florida resident , and the men talk at least three times a week mike just trusts me , and he s been a good friend to me , my wife and my children , mr colantouno said he always remembers my kids' birthdays , and not a day goes by when he does n't ask after my daughter why do i do it \? i want to finish what i started besides , friends look after friends it s that simple mr maffucci followed an unlikely road to becoming as much a part of local lore as rip van winkle , whom some say he resembles with his distinctive white beard walk down main street just about any time of day , and mr maffucci would be perched in front of the fire station , drinking coffee and greeting everyone with a smile and a comment on the weather or the yankees' most recent game he was always formal , calling men chief and women miss mike would drink his coffee and eat doughnuts , tossing the crumbs to the birds , said laura promin , manager of video visions , next door to the fire station i feed the birds popcorn , but it s not the same they seem to looking for him other than serving in the pacific with the united states navy in world war ii , mr maffucci has been an irvington resident virtually all his life never married , he lived alone in a twostory house across the street from the fire station , working at the old general motors plant in tarrytown , in irvington s sanitation department and finally as a janitor at town hall , retiring in 1977 last fall , he celebrated his 40th year as a member of the town s volunteer fire department for as long as anyone can remember , mr maffucci ate most of his meals either sitting on the wall , or in fire station s secondfloor television room , where he would indulge his passions for detective shows and baseball as the years wore on and mr maffucci needed a helping hand , fellow firefighters led by mr colantouno ensured he always had warm clothes for winter , comfortable shoes and food store owners did their part mr colantouno opened a charge account for mr maffucci at zarrilli deli , where he would eat the same lunch every day a sandwich of ham , bologna and cheese on white bread with mustard on days when mr maffucci was n't eating what he got , ken zarrilli , the deli owner , would let mr colantouno know the unofficial arrangement took an urgent turn in july 2001 when mr colantouno found mr maffucci doubled over in pain inside his home stricken by a painful kidney ailment , mr maffucci spent a month at community hospital at dobbs ferry , before moving to the nursing home it broke my heart to have to put him there , but i had to do it , mr colantouno said mike needed roundtheclock care , and i just could n't take care of him anymore without help three days a week after leaving work , mr colantouno goes to the nursing home to visit mr maffucci , always taking his favorite cupcakes with a cup of black coffee mr colantouno and his wife , eileen , continue to arrange doctor s appointments and handle bills for mr maffucci , who is now using a wheelchair and , perhaps once a month , they take him back to the irvington firehouse , where he is greeted like a longlost friend meanwhile , police officers raimondo and foley have pitched in to help mr colantouno renovate mr maffucci s house , which has fallen into disrepair by cleaning , rewiring and painting the twofamily house , they hope to rent one apartment , with the income going to nursing home expenses , and to prepare the other for mr maffucci s eventual return mike has always been there , a friendly , jolly old guy who loved to play cards , lieutenant raimondo said it got to the point where he 'd remember things that happened 40 years ago , but not something from 10 seconds ago he needed help while mr colantouno says mr maffucci s health is on the mend , he worries about his friend s mental acuity , which he admits comes and goes that makes it hard to have a conversation with mr maffucci beyond the usual pleasantries , although , he still retains his sense of humor , and mr colantouno said , still wants to knows everything that s going on back home despite local rumors about mr maffucci that he is really a millionaire and that he has multiple exwives mr colantouno says with certainty that none of that is true he s just a nice old man , a loner of sorts , with a good word for everyone , he said one of mike s favorite sayings is , 'when you moan , you moan alone when you smile , the whole world smiles with you' i hope he will be well enough to come home again he belongs here back in front of the fire station photos mike maffucci , wheeled around by his friend , mike colantouno the two chat in mr maffuci s room at the nursing home mr colantouno set up mr maffucci s stay at the nursing home , much in the same way he has looked after him for years in irvington , making sure he ate and was all right \( photographs by richard l harbus for the new york times \)
san crist bal , cuba , oct 13 dino brugioni had spent decades poring over every detail from the spy plane photographs of soviet missiles whose discovery here , 40 years ago this weekend , brought the superpowers to the brink of nuclear holocaust but today the former central intelligence agency officer learned a few things that had eluded even his careful eye , thanks to none other than gen anatoly gribkov , who was the soviet officer who supervised the construction of missile bases in cuba in 1962 more like old colleagues than former adversaries , the two men stood this morning in front of an abandoned bunker , discussing roads , cables and missile locations their exchanges contained more shop talk than sharp words i got a little more detail than i could see , said mr brugioni , who during the cuban missile crisis had prepared briefings based on spy plane photos i'm glad i came to talk with my russian and cuban counterparts it s been 40 years i 've forgiven this weekend , presidential advisers and military officers from all sides who took part in the cold war s tensest episode gathered in cuba to discuss issues arising from those 13 days , including intelligence failures and independent arms inspections those themes have taken on special resonance at a time when united states officials are considering the possibility of preemptive action against saddam hussein to ensure that iraq does not develop or use weapons of mass destruction participants at the conference organized by the cuban government and the national security archive , an american research group that obtained recently declassified american , soviet and cuban documents did not explicitly draw comparisons but they did say president john f kennedy s peaceful resolution of the crisis held a powerful lesson i hope that 10 years from now the cuban missile crisis will be looked upon as a learning period for the world in understanding the risk to the human race in continuing huge nuclear forces , robert s mcnamara , who was defense secretary at the time , said in an interview on friday what happened in cuba is very commonplace military operations are much more complex than civilian ones the variables are greater mr mcnamara , who headed the american delegation at the conference , said recent examples of civilian and friendly fire casualties in afghanistan underscored the hazards of warfare , even when it is confined to conventional weapons there is n't any learning period with nuclear weapons , he said you make one mistake and you destroy nations fidel castro , the cuban president , attended most of the closeddoor sessions in havana and offered long commentaries according to those present at a meeting on friday , mr castro questioned a retired soviet military officer at length about the size of the soviet nuclear arsenal compared with that of the united states and the numbers and location of warheads on the island castro did n't know , said thomas blanton , the national security archive s executive director but he said that they had a sense that the soviet union was first with sputnik , yuri a gagarin and having the largest bomb he added that they assumed the soviet union was at least equal to the united states militarily the americans viewed the soviet missiles , evidence of which mr kennedy received on oct 16 , 1962 , as a provocation but cuban officials placed the crisis in the context of the threat of an american military invasion , mindful of the abortive bay of pigs invasion by cuban exiles in 1961 they had also worried about cuban exiles backed by the united states in the destabilization campaign known as operation mongoose the united states had already developed subversive activities including assassination plans against the leaders of the revolution , said esteban morales , a researcher at the university of havana theodore c sorensen , mr kennedy s counsel and chief speechwriter , said mr kennedy had had no intention of staging an american invasion of cuba rather , the goal was to isolate cuba and prevent it from becoming a soviet military outpost nonetheless , at the conference mr sorensen apologized to the cubans for the sabotage campaign i represent nobody but myself , he said i just thought an apology was due mr kennedy s military advisers were urging him to prepare for an invasion , however , once the united states had responded to the detection of the missiles by establishing a naval and air blockade to prevent soviet ships from reaching cuba on oct 27 , according to documents released at the conference , events were spinning out of control an american surveillance plane was shot down over cuba , another wandered into soviet airspace , and an american destroyer was dropping depth charges to force to the surface a soviet submarine that had approached the american blockade line the commander of the soviet submarine , which had a nucleartipped torpedo , summoned the officer who was assigned to the nuclear torpedo and ordered him to assemble it to battle readiness , according to a soviet document made available at the conference
after deadly rollover crashes of 15passenger vans that killed or injured young athletes , church choir members and summer campers , a growing number of colleges and churches are prohibiting or severely limiting the use of the vehicles , and some insurance companies are refusing to insure the vans as costly lawsuit settlements threaten to cut into their profits accidents involving athletes from urbana university , kenyon college , depaul university , the university of wisconsinoshkosh and prairie view am university within three months led federal officials to issue a wellpublicized warning about the vans two years ago but the officials , from the national highway traffic safety administration , concluded that the vans , which are also commonly used by airport shuttle services and day care centers , were not inherently dangerous many of the problems , it said , are attributable to inexperienced drivers piloting fully loaded vehicles last april the agency repeated its warning the marine corps , which , like other military services , uses the vans widely , distributed the safety alert to all of those using the vehicles capt shawn turner , a marine spokesman at the pentagon , said last night that the corps was considering limiting the use of the vans because of safety concerns when carrying only a few passengers , the traffic agency said , the vans have a rollover rate that is similar to other light trucks and vans but when fully loaded , the likelihood of a rollover is six times the usual the insurers say the vans , even when lightly loaded , sometimes roll over if the steering wheel is jerked in an emergency maneuver the ford motor company , which accounts for about 80 percent of the 21 , 000 15passenger vans sold annually , acknowledges that its e350 , econline and club wagon models can be tricky to handle but carolyn brown , a ford spokeswoman , said if it is not overloaded and if it is driven properly , it is a very safe vehicle the problem with 15passenger vans is similar to what ford experienced two years ago with its explorer sport utility vehicle both have high centers of gravity and thus can tip over more easily than cars if they have to negotiate sudden turns , as when a tire blows out ford has been building similar vehicles for 40 years , ms brown said , adding that sales were on the rise we would see no reason why an insurance company would not feel it was a worthy vehicle to insure , ms brown said but the colorado school districts selfinsurance pool , the biggest insurer of public schools in that state , stopped issuing new coverage for the vans on july 1 and , on top of the average premium cost of 750 a vehicle , it imposed a 500 surcharge for customers with up to 10 of the vans guideone , a leading insurer of churches and their vehicles , announced last week that it had stopped selling new policies two other big church insurers , church mutual and brotherhood mutual , have issued safety advisories p j crowley , a spokesman for the insurance information institute , a trade group that represents major insurers including state farm , said other companies were deciding case by case whether to insure the vans fatal rollovers , however , have continued most recently in late june , when a ford econoline van carrying firefighters in colorado crashed , killing five passengers between 1990 and 2000 , the large , heavy vans were involved in 388 rollovers , killing 558 people , government records show comparable figures for other vehicles were not available jeff wigington , a lawyer in corpus christi , tex , who has represented plaintiffs in half a dozen cases involving fatal crashes with the vans , says they ought to be recalled other assessments have not gone that far , at least not publicly but jim wallace , the chief executive of guideone , called the vehicles inherently dangerous our underlying claims experience has been bad on these , he said we 've had a number of heartwrenching claims they tend to be sunday school classes going on retreat or on missions to help others these things turn over , and a lot of people die or get injured guideone , based in west des moines , iowa , said it would continue coverage on the 10 , 000 vans it already insures but it is raising rates 20 percent to 25 percent and is trying to persuade van owners to replace them with small school buses federal officials say they are powerless to recall a vehicle that may be difficult to handle but that has no specific mechanical defect this is not a defect issue , dr jeffrey runge , the administrator of the federal agency , said through a spokesman it s a behavior issue with drivers and passengers the spokesman , rae tyson , added these vehicles do n't handle like a passenger car , they handle more like a truck and people who drive trucks understand you have to be particularly careful to avoid a situation that could lead to a rollover critics of the traffic safety agency say it is as weak in response to the dangers of the 15passenger vans as it was to the ford explorer problem mr wigington called the agency s warnings in this case merely a bandaid on a bleeding wound with the ford explorer , he said , it was n't until many people died and there was a public outcry that the manufacturer took steps to redesign the vehicle
the chairman of augusta national golf club , continuing to resist pressure to admit a woman , says the club has no immediate plans to change its allmen s membership he says that no woman will be invited to join augusta before next year s masters , in early april , and that it may be several years , or longer , before a woman is invited speaking for the first time since the issue became public in july , the chairman , william johnson , remained steadfast in his position that as a private club , augusta national had no legal , moral or social obligation to invite a woman to join , despite hosting the masters , one of golf s four major championships , which is watched by millions worldwide i 've said before and i 'll say again that a woman may very well become a member of augusta , mr johnson , known as hootie , said in an interview but that is sometime off in the future , which would n't suggest that it s on the horizon in the meantime , we hold dear our tradition and our constitutional right to choose martha burk , chairwoman of the national council of women s organizations , reacted with dismay to mr johnson s position if the decision stands not to admit a woman before next year s masters , then it s a slap in the face to augusta members who have spoken out asking for this discrimination to end , she said the rational and predictable course of action would be to get this over with but mr johnson has shown that he does n't always take the rational and predictable approach mr johnson remained adamant that the club would not be swayed by pressure from ms burk , who has urged the club to admit women ms burk has nothing to do with this club , johnson said her threats mean nothing to me by restating his position , mr johnson also indicated that he had not been moved by the public positions of some highprofile corporate executives who are members of augusta and who have endorsed admitting women they include sanford i weill of citigroup and kenneth i chenault of american express mr johnson declined to comment on their positions i'm not going to talk about member issues , he said those are private matters to be dealt with from within mr johnson , 71 , made his statements last week in a 45minute session at his office in augusta , ga the interview , which was offered by his aides , was one of several interviews he gave with major news organizations on condition that they not publish them until today mr johnson s mood ranged from serious to jovial , and he often leaned forward in his chair to emphasize a point there were several questions regarding membership policies that mr johnson refused to discuss but it was clear that augusta was no closer to admitting women than it was over the summer , when the dispute between mr johnson and ms burk gained international attention augusta has for years protected the privacy of its internal workings , and it is not clear who would make the decision to invite a woman to join however , those who have portrayed mr johnson as a dove on the issue , and an internal proponent of change , would seem to be mistaken what s really gotten me is that this woman calls us discriminatory , mr johnson said she calls us bigots and the press and the media jump all over this if we discriminate , do the girl scouts discriminate \?

houston , feb 28 testifying for a second day at the capital murder trial of andrea pia yates , her husband said today that despite her history of mental illness and two suicide attempts , he had had no reason to believe that it was unsafe to leave her alone with their five children , whom she drowned last june at the time , said the witness , russell yates , i did n't think she was dangerous none of us did in contrast to his emotional appearance on wednesday , when mr yates fought back tears and glanced frequently across the courtroom to his wife as he testified on her behalf , the proceedings today were largely subdued he calmly responded to questions from prosecution and defense lawyers as they led him through a description of the couple s lives in the months before the killings he barely looked at mrs yates , who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity he smiled at her just once , as he entered the courtroom under crossexamination by the prosecutor , joseph owmby , mr yates said doctors had told him that his wife was suffering from postpartum depression but that it was treatable i knew that she was sick , he said she would n't have tried to commit suicide if she had n't been sick later in the day , he testified that during a time when she was relatively well , he asked her about her suicide attempts she replied that she had been in a dark period , that she was in a dark place , he recalled when the defendant s lawyer , george parnham , suggested that mr yates shared blame for the death of the children because , as the family s decision maker , he had not been as aggressive in pursuit of psychiatric treatment as he might have been , the witness replied whenever there was a decision to be made of any significance , we did it as a family i did n't make decisions without consulting the family mr yates said the family s occasionally uncommon lifestyle living at times in a 38footlong recreational vehicle or a converted bus outfitted with sleeping quarters and a kitchen stemmed from a desire to lead a simple existence that clung to traditional values that s where the man is the breadwinner , said the witness , a nasa engineer , and the woman is a homemaker
when the rain stopped and matches started yesterday five hours after they were scheduled to begin the united states tennis association dodged having to give yesterday afternoon s ticket holders tickets to next year s united states open the usta s policy on tickets is not to give refunds for tickets in the event of rain if one full match at arthur ashe stadium is not completed or rain stops a session before at least one entire match is completed , a fan can send in his ticket and receive a comparable one to the next year s open those with a ticket plan can turn in their tickets for credit toward a ticket plan the next year none of that happened yesterday , but people with tickets to the matches wednesday night qualify lindsay davenport s match on the arthur ashe stadium court wednesday night made it only into the second set , and james blake s match that night never started the open has not had a night session postponed because of rain since sept 2 , 1998 an entire day has not been washed out since sept 4 , 1988 open officials postponed all of yesterday s doubles competition women s , men s and mixed until at least today to try to keep the singles schedule on track the singles matches were spread out on all the courts to try to finish them last night and keep the disruption of the singles schedule to a minimum more rain was forecast for today and tomorrow gimelstob s brief moment justin gimelstob s big moment , an arthur ashe stadium court match against his friend andre agassi , went so quickly yesterday that he joked that he thought he had been rained out did we even play out there \? gimelstob said i do n't even remember agassi closed out a 60 , 61 , 61 secondround victory in 66 minutes , prompting gimelstob to say his open highlight so far had been his first attempt as an analyst for the usa network i think my tv commentating debut went better than my tennis today , gimelstob said during his broadcast debut , he created a tennis term , calling making a great forehand approach down the line gilberting a shot it was a tribute to the master of that shot , brad gilbert that was pretty much the staple of his game , gimelstob said any player would know what that meant if they saw it sympathy for philippoussis lleyton hewitt expressed sympathy for his fellow australian mark philippoussis , who was forced out of the open when he reinjured his knee in a firstround match the news that philippoussis would miss two months also puts him out of australia s davis cup matches against india in adelaide next month it s obviously bad news , not just for the davis cup tie , but for his career , i guess , hewitt said if you can draw a positive out of anything , i do n't think he has to have an operation , which is a good thing philippoussis was hesitant to commit to playing davis cup for australia in the past now that he has regained his enthusiasm for it , his knee gave out the injury actually looked worse when philippoussis landed awkwardly and hyperextended his left knee on tuesday and he had to retire late in the fourth set of his firstround match against sjeng schalken but according to information released by philippoussis s management company , a magnetic resonance imaging scan conducted wednesday morning in miami showed a bone bruise according to the news release , philippoussis will not require a fourth surgery on his left knee but he is expected to be unable to compete on the tour for the next two months , a significant blow to the powerful 25yearold who missed part of the 1999 and 2001 seasons in a statement , philippoussis said i'm obviously upset at having the injury yesterday , and that i will have to miss the davis cup tie in adelaide and the upcoming tour events i'm delighted that the injury is not as severe as i first thought , and i will be able to continue to show improvement and get better in the future kafelnikov may retire yevgeny kafelnikov is serious about quitting tennis after kafelnikow , seeded fourth , lost in straight sets to dominik hrbaty of slovakia yesterday , he was asked if he might follow through on his vow to retire if he helps russia win the davis cup not 'might' i will , he said , later adding that winning that trophy would mean there would be nothing to accomplish for me \( ap \)
under radar by michael tolkin 212 pp new york atlantic monthly press 23 it s not just that michael tolkin is something we do not expect to find much anymore an honesttogod moralist that makes him so unusual it is that he is a moralist who can tell the difference between gucci and prada at 500 yards in novels like the player \( the basis for robert altman s film \) and among the dead , and in two movies he has directed the rapture , a serious depiction of the day of judgment , and the new age , a savage comedy about los angeles tolkin applies an old testament vision with an uptothesecond feel for the details of contemporary affluence stylishness and grotesquerie rub right up against each other he has an uncanny talent for getting inside the heads of narcissistic borderline psychopaths and bringing us uncomfortably close to their wholly selfinvolved worldview at the same time , he views them from a pitiless distance , magnifying their every transgression as if sizing up their chances of escaping damnation tolkin s third novel , under radar , is his most explicitly religious work since the rapture it is also the strangest thing he has ever done , compelling but puzzling , its meanings hanging just out of reach , like the long story the protagonist , tom levy , hears in a jamaican prison , which , in the course of the week it takes him to hear it , turns his hair white a lawyer who has gone on vacation with his wife and two daughters to a jamaican family resort , tom broods on the uppermiddleclass complacency of his surroundings were tom to send a postcard , tolkin writes , he would have listed his complaints against the hotel s bourgeois want of eccentricity that it was homey , with no sex , with none of the drama of sex and yet tom is , from all outward appearances , the perfect bourgeois , a dogged provider and achiever , devoted to his daughters , faithful to his wife he does not see that his life represents the very things he loathes in the place he is too arrogant for that he looks at the moms and dads loitering around the pool , gathering at night to dance to the hotel s reggae band , and thinks himself too good to be anything like these people that sense of his own exceptionalism is at the heart of the act of violence that is at the center of the book , tom s murder of another man in front of his daughters , as well as the man s own children one night , tom sees his 4yearold daughter on the dance floor , innocently moving to the music , unaware that the band s lead singer is making overtly sexual gestures when tom discovers that another guest had encouraged his daughter to dance \( the man had seen the child hanging back shyly at the edge of the dance floor \) , tom makes the decision , as cool and logical to him as it seems abrupt to us , to kill him as with most of the horrors in tolkin s work , the murder is upsetting because it s so coolly premeditated making love to his wife the night before the killing , tom used the murder he would commit the next day as a vehicle to bring his grief into the bed , and then he stripped the grief of its selfishness by reminding himself with all his strength that the woman beside him trusted him , and in this true sobriety came mercy and so he was tender to tolkin that is the ultimate hubris , the voice of someone who has allowed his grievances and desires to take on godlike stature the murder is also the means of his humbling , if not his salvation the second half of under radar feels both inexorable and baffling sentenced to life in prison , divorced by his wife , forgotten by the daughters who have been told he is dead , tom hears a tale told by a condemned man and then , like a priest of some ancient order , lapses into seven years of silence when he emerges and shares the story with the other prisoners , it sets off a journey that finds him released from jail and crewing with a strange american couple planning to sail around the world he ultimately plans to enter back into the lives of the family that has left him behind this is a book in which every character has a story to tell , none of them immediately comprehensible appropriate to a novel that trades so assuredly in spiritual mysteries , under radar leaves us like puzzled pilgrims , struggling with the meaning of the cruel fable that has been so enticingly told
one was in class when the news came one most likely found out from the television at his prison one waited by the telephone one was probably at work one , his mother said in tears , did not even care none of the men convicted in the 1989 rape and beating of an investment banker in central park were in downtown manhattan yesterday when the district attorney s office released its report clearing them their parents and sisters came instead , in a reversal of 13 years ago when they waited as the teenagers were questioned , charged , tried and convicted they spent all morning in the narrow hallway at the courthouse elevators , immobile , indifferent to workers bumping past they were there to hear the manhattan district attorney recommend the dismissal of rape and assault charges against their sons and brothers although the report released yesterday also recommends the dismissal of charges stemming from other crimes that night , it did not completely exonerate the teenagers it concedes that there was ample evidence showing they were part of a pack of 30 youths who beat and harassed eight other victims that night the five teenagers did not know one another well the night of the attacks , and they still do not the ordeal forged no lifetime friendships they all served their sentences and are all struggling , in five different ways , to begin life after prison , life after the jogger case kharey wise , 30 , stayed in the longest , released just this august paradoxically , this may have saved the group matias reyes has said he decided to take responsibility for the attack only after bumping into mr wise in prison and feeling remorse had that encounter never taken place , mr reyes may never have stepped forward his mother , deloris wise , said little about his life today at the time of the attack , he was said to have an iq of 73 and a secondgrade reading level mrs wise is intensely protective i do n't have a doctor , a lawyer or a chief in my home , but i know i did n't give birth to a rapist , she said she recalled visiting him in prison , buying food out of vending machines and laying place settings on the visiting room table , making a little meal i do n't know him , she said yesterday that jail raised my son up he s 30 years old he s so institutionalized i ca n't even begin to tell you the things going on he does n't even know what s going on she added my son is not angry at anybody he does n't know how to be linda mccray scolded reporters who inquired about her son , antron , now 28 i do n't appreciate you all asking what he is doing , she said what he is doing is trying to live a life the best he can as a boy , antron played third base for a baseball team that his father coached , and he once traveled to a tournament in puerto rico his lawyer said antron is now married with three children and works in a factory in the new york area and has family in maryland my son is free , mrs mccray said , and , speaking of all five men , perhaps thought of him as she zeroed in on fatherhood maybe they will live to become the men they want to be , the fathers they want to be , to raise their children so this does n't happen to them kevin richardson , 28 , is pursuing a bachelor s degree in social services with 40 credit hours to go , his lawyer said he is a night watchman and a clerk in a new york home for the elderly his sister , angela cuffee , called him yesterday with the news from the courthouse he was waiting by the phone , she said and he just sighed he was speechless he was n't able to speak she added , if my brother was here today , he 'd be in tears yusef salaam is 28 and is studying computer technology out of state he was in class when the report was filed , his sister said he plans to come home for christmas he has had trouble at times getting or keeping jobs , his mother said , because of the stigma of the conviction the core essence of what he is never changed , said his mother , sharonne salaam you look at him and see the same yusef beautiful , beautiful boy the district attorney s report could have the greatest immediate impact on raymond santana , 28 , but he was likely the last to know , as he serves a prison sentence for another crime , a 1999 drug conviction his lawyers said that without the central park prior convictions , he would have been released from the 1999 conviction long ago , and that the vacating of the central park case could bring him home i want to say to my baby brother , i know he s watching , i love you , baby brother , said his sister , joann , staring into television cameras yesterday i always believed in you he called three days ago , his father , also named raymond santana , said his last job was working at night , packing trucks after the attack ,

romantic triangle that includes his mistress , marion davies \( ms dunst \) , and charlie chaplin \( mr izzard \) the direction is sometimes plodding the madcap decadence of jazz age hollywood never

anthony blunt his lives by miranda carter illustrated 590 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 30 anthony blunt was among the most powerful figures in the art world in the decades after world war ii his books and catalogs on the theory of art in the italian renaissance , on the baroque , on french art and architecture and particularly on poussin changed tastes and made reputations as surveyor \( curator \) of the king s pictures , one of the richest collections in private hands , he was responsible for getting the british royal works properly cataloged and then shown to the public for the first time he turned the courtauld institute in london from an enjoyably chaotic finishing school into a sophisticated , if dictatorially run , center of scholarship art history grew as a subject , and blunt grew with it , becoming , in miranda carter s characteristically vivid words , a kind of cattle baron in its new and developing territories his students included future directors of great public galleries , scholars , writers and critics he was an exceptional teacher , his aloofness and apparent austerity only half concealing the intensity of his visual responses people he taught , and others from all backgrounds whom he simply befriended because they were interested in art , still speak of him with admiration and striking tenderness many of them were drawn to what they describe as a strange blankness in him , which they sensed derived from some unhappy secret most people today , though , detest blunt s memory , because the secret turned out to have been that he was a soviet spy an intimate and recruit of the younger guy burgess , he began to work for the soviets in 1937 at first he was merely a talent scout at cambridge , where his main find was michael straight \( later owner and editor of the new republic and chairman of the national endowment for the arts \) during world war ii , however , blunt suddenly found himself employed at the heart of british military intelligence , in department b of mi5 this was where surveillance teams and agents were based , and where german material translated by codebreakers at bletchley was analyzed under the noses of trusting colleagues and respectful policemen , blunt took many hundreds of documents home and had them photographed for his soviet control he provided detailed information about the personnel and working methods of mi5 he told the soviets that the enigma code had been broken , and gave them the date and place of the allied landings in france in 1944 it was mostly a waste of time though the antics of the rival intelligence organizations have been the subject of many expos s , few accounts have matched carter s in the quiet irony with which she describes how a combination of inefficiency , internal politicking and justifiable suspicion made the soviet intelligence service incapable of using or even reading much of the extraordinary material lavished on it by blunt , burgess , donald maclean , kim philby , john cairncross and the rest beyond this , carter concludes despite sensational stories to the contrary that no ally died as a direct result of blunt s actions but she points out that if any of the information he purloined had fallen into german hands while being carried across london and back to moscow , the results could have been devastating blunt continued to do odd jobs for the soviets into the 1950 s by then he had been rumbled , and , over long years of interrogations , made what seems to have been only a limited confession in 1964 , michael straight decisively exposed him , but the matter was still hushed up the ostensible reasons had to do with fears that the evidence might not hold up in court , and political embarrassment after several other recent intelligence scandals but blunt may also have been helped , if only indirectly , by having friends in the highest places in august 1945 , he had undertaken a secret mission on behalf of king george vi , to a part of germany under american occupation he was to retrieve some family papers from the castle of one of the king s cousins , princess margaret of hesse there has been all kinds of speculation about these papers , including the possibility that they concerned efforts by george s brother , the duke of windsor , to do a deal with the nazis carter s sources argue that the duke was no letter writer , and that in any case his nazi sympathies were well known but it seems possible that the king just was n't sure what the material might contain and did n't want anyone else to find out blunt successfully carried out his errand , for which he was even better equipped than the king could have known whether out of conscious gratitude or not , queen elizabeth ii did n't sack blunt when she was told his secret in the mid1960 s every effort was made to keep the story under the carpet , and it did n't officially come out until the end of 1979 blunt was by then in his 70 s , and died four years later why did he do it \? and what should we feel about it , now that half a century has passed and the russians are once again allies of the west \? carter s absorbing authorized biography does n't offer any simple explanations there are none but it gives readers the evidence they need to form their own judgments
my aunts , two tarttongued midwesterners , have declared me crazy because in a month i will become a new mother in of all places new york city you ca n't raise a baby in that city , aunt dee says twice a week , as she and her sister call from detroit to check in and chastise me a baby needs space you do n't even have a backyard who s going to help you with the stroller when you 're on the subway \? what if the terrorists strike again \? when i can get a word in , i remind them of the millions of women who dare to raise children in new york and live to tell about it i try to explain that my baby will grow up where history lives and all the world s cultures thrive and collide just outside your door sometimes i slip in that i live at the foot of prospect park , a magnificent backyard but mostly i laugh past their concerns , my way of trying to extinguish my own fear that i will somehow become my mother and that , like me , my child will yearn for more love than i can give in the books i have piled beside my bed to prepare me for the day i push my way to motherhood , i have found the tips and secrets that many expectant mothers learn from their mothers in random subway and coffeeshop chats , new york mothers , young and old , have shared the secrets of buying the perfect city stroller and making room in an apartment where there is none and they 've talked about the perils of choosing day care , nursing in public and navigating the inevitable bouts of boredom and isolation while the city roars around them i wonder what , if anything , my mother read did she obsess about food and exercise \? did she agonize over choosing a name for me \? did she ever think twice about shooting her veins full of heroin while she was pregnant \? the day i was born , i was supposed to die this is what grandma tells me when i ask for details she says my tiny body lay in the hospital for weeks squirming and shaking from my mother s drug abuse when the doctors finally released me , i went home to grandma s house my mother went back to drugging and running the streets of detroit eventually , we became roommates at grandma s , but my mother , with her orangejuiceblond afro , was little more than a passing shadow , dropping in for a few days or weeks whenever she needed money for a new high never long enough for me to hear her say , i love you , or to braid my hair like my friends' mothers did she was not around for my first day of school she did not take me to my first beauty shop appointment or explain why my body suddenly began to draw stares from boys and men by then , she was in a jail cell , news that quickly traveled the neighborhood , leaving me the butt of jokes from kids whose families were also struggling , but who could at least say they had a mother at home their laughter stopped the year i turned 13 that december my mother , home on one of her extended stays , went up to our room and died on her 36th birthday she swallowed one too many of her little pills , on purpose , grandma and the doctors said i did not cry i told myself i was i happy back then i was happy , too blinded by hatred to see her as anything other than an evil woman , too young to understand what grandma always said every woman who has a child is not a mother i know she is right i am not my mother my mother and i chose different paths i graduated from high school , went to college on scholarship my mother dropped out of school at 15 she made friends easily , danced up a storm at family parties i never perfected those skills what she needed in life , she stole at 14 , i got a job making popcorn i married for love my mother married because of me her choices have always haunted me but i'm also learning to accept her mistakes as a mother , to see them as one detail of my life , painful yet strengthening i know , despite what my aunts say , i will survive as a mother in new york or wherever we choose to live , so long as i keep my promise to look into my baby s eyes and say what my mother never could mommy loves you i will speak the words over and over , as much for me as for my baby drawing \( lisa haney \)

must do without their chauffeured city cars , several of mr giuliani s deputies are now earning several times more than the 168 , 700 a year that they were paid in government one , ninfa segarra , has taken a pay cut to stay in public service as director of the city police museum , earning 115 , 000 a year , but others at highpowered law firms could earn more than 1 million annually there is also a

albany , feb 14 the assembly democrats and senate republicans unveiled a plan for new district lines today calculated to preserve their majorities in both houses and play mischief with the districts of members of minority parties under the plan , new york city would gain four assembly seats at the expense of the rest of the state , while the senate would expand by one to 62 members , adding a new seat in southern brooklyn , where a republican has a chance to win the senate democrats immediately cried foul , claiming the republican majority had added a seat and crammed more people into city districts than in upstate and suburban districts to preserve their grip on power the assembly republicans also cried foul , claiming the democratic majority in that house had done just the opposite to justify two more seats in the city than its population warrants it s a blatant power grab , said john j faso , the beleaguered republican leader in the assembly it s highly unfair and legally suspect the release of the proposed new district lines starts a brutal political and legal battle that is repeated every 10 years after the national census public hearings on the lines will be held across the state before final approval by the legislature and gov george e pataki then the united states justice department must sign off on any changes made in the city to ensure they do not disenfranchise minority residents some political trades are expected along the way as lawmakers seek to save their districts whatever agreement is reached , all sides expect it to be challenged in state and federal courts a joint commission of assembly members and senators drew up the lines , but they were hardly independent under a longstanding tradition , the leaders in both houses form districts that help each chamber s dominant party and then abide by the lines the other house presents critics say the arrangement is one reason that neither house has changed hands since the 1974 election here redistricting is all about protecting the majorities in both houses , said blair horner of the new york public interest research group the senate s proposed lines completely redraw the districts in brooklyn and queens , creating three open seats one of the districts in central queens would have a hispanic majority another in southeast brooklyn would be mostly black the third is carved out of neighborhoods in southern brooklyn that often vote republican the senate s plan also throws three pairs of democratic incumbents into the same districts , forcing them either to step down , move into the new districts , or slug it out against each other for some democratic senators the new lines could spell trouble for instance , senator carl kruger , who is white and represents a mostly white part of brooklyn , would now be thrown into a mostly black district with senator john l sampson , a black incumbent senators daniel r hevesi and toby a stavinsky , both democrats , would find themselves in the same district so would senators vincent j gentile and seymour p lachman the republicans also redrew senator guy j velella s district in the northern bronx , moving it north to include more white neighborhoods in westchester county , an effort to salvage his chances of winning in a part of the state that has become more and more hispanic and black by expanding the senate to 62 seats , the majority leader , joseph l bruno , avoided losing one of the republican senate seats outside the city , which would have been inevitable given the shift in population toward the city and its suburbs in the 2000 census the census found new york state had gained 5 percent in population , to a little under 19 million people but new york city grew by 9 percent and its suburbs by 4 percent while upstate communities grew only 1 percent the assembly democrats used that trend to justify shifting four seats to the city , taking one from western new york , one from the finger lakes region , one from the adirondacks and one from long island there are 150 seats in the assembly , and under the proposal the heavily democratic city would have 65 of them queens would have two new seats one in flushing with a majority of asianamericans and one in jackson heights with a hispanic majority a third district would include parts of bay ridge in brooklyn as well as the west side of staten island the fourth new district would be in the central bronx the assembly s plan also creates 12 open districts across the state and ensures that in at least 9 of those , two incumbent republicans will be facing off against each other one exception is in erie county , where two districts will be collapsed into one , forcing republican sandra lee wirth to fight it out with democrat brian higgins assemblyman william l parment , a jamestown democrat who was the democrats' point man on the joint task force , said the new districts in the city would create a ripple effect , causing minor shifts in assembly district lines he said none of the changes would punish dissidents who challenged speaker sheldon silver s leadership two years ago everybody s got a fair shot at it , he said we had no instructions to target anybody or to do anybody in the main arguments against the plan rested on the way in which the commission used its ability to go 5 percent above or below the ideal population size for a district in general , the assembly democrats kept the population in city districts at the lower end of that range , and made sure upstate districts were at the upper end the aim was to place as many seats in the city as possible , republicans charged the republican plan did the opposite the rural and suburban seats upstate that have traditionally been held by republicans are mostly on the low end of the population scale , while the city s democratic districts are at the maximum
in a film trend wellchronicled by the news media this summer , older women married ones at varying distance to middle age began taking up with the kind of men who could more aptly be called boys the good girl had jennifer aniston besotted by jake gyllenhaal lovely and amazing put him in the back seat of a car with catherine keener in tadpole , sigourney weaver , as an upper west side doctor in drapey wools , develops feelings for her voltairequoting stepson during a weekend he spends home from boarding school popular culture , with enormous help from mrs tony soprano , has been busily wearing away at our attachment to the promises of married life , which would make it seem like an odd moment for fashion to enshrine the image of the good wife , content and undimensional it s odder still that such an image should fascinate donna karan , who , before she shifted her attentions to clothes meant for sitting on floppy pillows in front of candles scented like hay , was considered the most impassioned dresser of the professional woman the press notes for her spring 2003 collection , shown on friday afternoon , indicated she would be returning to suits , but what sauntered down the runway were dresses in silk and chiffon , printed with all manner of colorful flora and fauna there were hourglass cuts and low necklines , squareshaped and cinched at midchest to show cleavage a few of them were lovely on their own terms , reminiscent of the kind of dresses done so well at tuleh but you could n't shake the vaguely creepy feeling that perhaps ms karan had cottoned on to the hype surrounding sylvia ann hewlett s controversial book creating a life and decided that women should retire some of their grander ambitions to greet their husbands off the 6 07 , gin and tonics in hand notions of the cheever world were played with wittily , however , at anna sui s show later that evening ms sui turned out what she called country club clothes for the sort of country club one might find in williamsburg not the williamsburg of colonial association , mind you , but the one that can be reached via a bridge off delancey street she did a wrap golf skirt in white knit , short enough to be prohibited on many an actual golf course , and emblazoned with an appliqu of a putting green there were tennis dresses with mesh tops and a great silk mini printed with equestrian imagery none of the clothes veered toward the precious , styled as they were with platform sneakers , frye boots , white motorcycle boots , tube socks and turbans fashioned out of tshirts for years now , cynthia rowley has trafficked in the cheery , the whimsical , the girlish hers have often been the kind of clothes you could wear to lunch at a country club that was really , in fact , in connecticut at her show on friday night , held in a garden on elizabeth street , with the newlywed candace bushnell in the front row , hardly looking the part of the matron , ms rowley showed clothes that seemed a little more mischievous maybe a lot more open to rolling home around dawn there were all sorts of asymmetrical hemlines , slinky glittered knits and layerings of diaphanous fabrics some of the looks were named after the seven deadly sins sloth , lust and so on ms rowley may also have turned out the most prettily amusing high heel to come down a runway in a while a green stiletto sandal with the cutout of a fig leaf to his good fortune , matthew williamson keeps company with a coterie of british it girls sophie dahl , jade jagger whose imprimatur preserves his reputation as someone whose coolness is above question but at his show on friday night , it was hard not to wonder what anyone would make of his clothes if he were not the kind of guy who could get naomi campbell to model and britney spears to sit in the front row the title of mr williamson s show was flamingo bay , and one speculated whether it was a reference to the similarly named resort in las vegas his collection , with overalls undone to reveal an olive mesh shirt splattered with gold coins , a bright blue silk dress given shape only with the aid of a beaded fanny pack , reeked of the garish a hodgepodge of ethnic references made the spirit of the whole thing seem about as authentic as a theme hotel no one could accuse liz collins of disingenuousness gothish looking herself , ms collins has built an identity as an inventive designer of knits , the kind that are conceived to look as if they were upside down , backward and put on one s body with the intervention of a pilates machine the sweaters and knit skirts ms collins showed on friday afternoon were brilliantly crafted a nubby dress wrapped around the body on the bias and was patterned to look as if she had taken an egg slicer to it at the end of the show , ms collins gave the runway over to the work of a friend , gary graham the two had also collaborated on some pieces , among them a splicedup knit gown all mad woman in the attic that featured a long , contorted train with a doll s head at the end and its onceattached body dangling in netting below the hip and even if the clothes had not been shown on models with giant crazylady hair , it would be hard to imagine where any of these pieces would actually go suffice it to say , they wo n't be waiting for the 6 07 photos from donna karan , a 1940 sstyle pleated sun

like all the cast members on nbc s friends , matt leblanc has made some nonetoomemorable movies since the show began its phenomenally popular run in 1994 but as the series is about to begin its ninth and reportedly final season , the hollywood stakes have become a lot higher , not only for him but for his five costars , courteney cox , lisa kudrow , jennifer aniston , david schwimmer and matthew perry in the series' heyday , mr leblanc , for instance , could trade on his television fame with a starring movie role in a limp comedy like ed about a baseball player and a chimp and still take comfort in the knowledge that he could return to friends as the clueless but likable joey tribbiani but now , their safety net almost gone , the pressure is on the actors to parlay their popularity into movies and avoid the fate of many former tv stars who could not make a successful leap to film so far , ms aniston , 33 , seems to have one of the best shots at crossing over permanently she received good reviews this month for playing against type in the small independent movie the good girl and she just signed on to play jim carrey s love interest in a new comedy , bruce almighty mr perry , 32 , also has a new bigstudio comedy , serving sara , playing opposite elizabeth hurley it opens on friday but none of the cast members were as determined as mr leblanc to fit in a new film this year in order to make his new movie , a dark world war ii comedy called all the queen s men \( opening in october \) and tape friends at the same time , mr leblanc , 35 , commuted weekly between eastern europe and los angeles for almost two months he took a plane every wednesday evening to do the show and came back monday morning , the film s director , stefan ruzowitzky , recalled by phone from vienna it was a nightmare once , we were outside budapest and we had to have a small plane take him to vienna then he flew to frankfurt and then to los angeles it was incredibly exhausting for him in the film , which was inspired by a true story , mr leblanc plays a macho soldier who must dress as a woman to steal a coding device used by the nazis mr leblanc s decision to play a part quite different from joey tribbiani appears to be part of a strategy by all the cast members to show that they can stretch as actors and move beyond television it s often a difficult transition , said jeff zucker , president of nbc entertainment , which oversees friends it s only the relatively few george clooney , bruce willis , tom hanks who cross over into movies and make it big even mr perry is hoping to go in a new direction next year by starring in what he calls a spiritual movie about life and death he said the movie , if it got the goahead , would be directed by gerald di pego \( who directed john travolta in phenomenon \) and would represent a great departure after their show began , many of the friends actors chose movie roles in romantic comedies that were similar to the characters they played on tv mr schwimmer , 35 , made the pallbearer with gwyneth paltrow in 1996 and kissing a fool in 1998 mr perry made fools rush in \( 1997 \) and three to tango \( 1999 \) ms aniston played a variation of her character , the sexy and often selfabsorbed rachel green , in a string of romantic comedies , including picture perfect in 1997 and the object of my affection in 1998 , both of which grossed only about 30 million each only ms kudrow , 39 , sought out quirkier roles in smaller , independent movies , like her wellreceived turn as an uptight single woman in the opposite of sex in 1999 now the rest of the cast is following her early lead mr schwimmer will be seen next in hotel , a lowbudget independent film directed by mike figgis \( of leaving las vegas fame \) in venice , italy he plays a meanspirited , wouldbe hollywood producer who arranges for his best friend to be killed in order to take over his film it was the most fun i ever had , mr schwimmer said recently by telephone it was all improvisational and shot with four cameras on digital mr schwimmer , who started the lookingglass theater company in chicago in 1988 , calls the stage his passion he will be writing and directing an adaptation of studs terkel s book race at the theater after friends wraps in march but he admits that taking smaller movie roles is a way of making movies without waiting for hollywood to call studios are n't exactly banging down my door , he said people can see us 15 times a week for free we 're not seen as being as valuable a film commodity as film actors among the friends cast , ms cox , 38 , has had the greatest success in big studio films in the late 1990 s she costarred as the tv reporter gale weathers in scream and scream 2 , which grossed more than 200 million she had costarred with jim carrey , then unknown , in ace ventura \( 1994 \) but the first film in which she will be seen after friends is much smaller she will play a single mother in rural tennessee in a dark comedy called the secret life of daltry calhoun the movie has an estimated budget of about 3 million and will be directed by a relative novice , the 28yearold katrina bronson there s nothing funny about it , ms cox said happily
east rutherford , nj during the 18minute first intermission last night , the fans at the devilscarolina game were entertained by a novelty act called quick change a pair of dancers , male and female , performed various steps while dashing behind swirling veils to reappear in an eyecatching variety of colorful costumes while this took place , another quick change occurred backstage at continental arena in the hurricanes' locker room , coach paul maurice decided to replace goalie arturs irbe with his backup , kevin weekes this was the second consecutive game in which maurice did this in the first one , on sunday , irbe gave up three early goals and the devils went on to a 40 victory last night , irbe gave up a goal on the first shot , to bobby holik , and another one late in the first period to brian gionta , and the devils went on to a 31 victory that evened the fourofsevengame eastern conference semifinal round series at two victories each on the second goal , irbe failed to stop a routine wrister while the hurricanes had a power play he did not seem ready for it i missed the shot , irbe said i'm not happy weekes was more talkative and made the appropriate excuses for irbe tough circumstances , weekes said the first one was tough luck the second one was tough luck , too then he added an ambiguous compliment for the top goalie on a mediocre team the franchise is where it is largely due to him , weekes said of irbe irbe did not change clothes until after the game he was on the bench for the final two periods in the same red uniform with white trim but unlike the photographers to his left and the players to his right , he wore no helmet irbe spent part of the time taping his stick , which has not been scuffed by many pucks lately in the first two games , both 21 victories in carolina , irbe stopped 64 of 66 shots in part because of irbe s poor play in the next two games \( 5 goals on 20 shots \) , the devils have erased the twogamestonone lead that carolina took when the playoffs opened last week because game 5 is tonight in raleigh , maurice must decide soon what to do concerning his most important position should he start irbe again , an early or weak goal against carolina could shatter the confidence of his team and discourage the local fans but if he starts weekes , maurice will display a lack of confidence in his starter and will depend , instead , on a backup who has been with the team for less than two months we wo n't make it in the next few hours , that s for sure , maurice said after the game , referring to his decision he seemed to be leaning toward weekes he came in and made three great saves , maurice said he s a big guy he covers a lot of the net weekes said he was ready if you were a goalie , how much would you like to start \? he said goalies make popular candidates for the conn smythe trophy , awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs in the 37 years of the award , goalies have taken it 12 times , including last spring , when patrick roy of colorado won it after leading the avalanche to the stanley cup championship roy has won it three times this year s winner will not be known until midjune , but irbe is not a favorite as for the devils , martin brodeur gained notice with a shutout in game 3 and a 23save performance in game 4 his goals against average is 125 one of his best moments last night came with 3 minutes 21 seconds left in the second period protecting a 20 lead , brodeur faced kevyn adams , who raced in alone from the blue line after a devils turnover in the neutral zone adams took a wrist shot and brodeur snatched it with his glove hand had adams scored , it might have been a pivotal moment in the game or the series in the detroitvancouver series , the canucks stunned the favored red wings with two victories in detroit and were tied , 11 , in game 3 on sunday night when niklas lidstrom of detroit took a slap shot from the far side of the center red line it skipped past goalie dan cloutier and led to a 31 victory compared to that one , gionta s goal on irbe seemed like a work of art this game , and the one before it , belied the myth that every playoff game is a cauldron of excitement for much of last night s game , the fans not quite filling the arena were subdued there was little tension about the outcome the frustration of the hurricanes showed in the third period when jaroslav svoboda s angry penalty for holding holik set up brian rafalski s powerplay goal minutes later , carolina s marek malik went off for roughing john madden the hurricanes were not in the frame of mind to mount a comeback as for last night , aaron ward , who scored carolina s late goal , said momentum did not matter as much as you can read into this , quit wasting energy , ward said of irbe s performance , ward said , i do n't think he s struggling ward said the players were told when maurice replaced irbe with weekes , we are not putting blame on anyone photo arturs irbe was replaced last night for the second consecutive game \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
atlanta in january 1996 , with full support from israel and responding to the invitation of the palestine liberation organization , the carter center helped to monitor a democratic election in the west bank and gaza that was well organized , open and fair in that election , 88 members were elected to the palestinian national authority , with yasir arafat as president legally and practically , the palestinian people were encouraged to form their own government , with the expectation that they would soon have full sovereignty as a state when the election was over , i made a strong effort to persuade the leaders of hamas to accept the election results , with mr arafat as their leader i relayed a message offering them full participation in the process of developing a permanent constitutional framework for the new political entity , but they refused to accept this proposal despite this rejection , it was a time of peace and hope , and there was no threat of violence or even peaceful demonstrations the legal status of the palestinian people has not changed since then , but their plight has grown desperate ariel sharon is a strong and forceful man and has never equivocated in his public declarations nor deviated from his ultimate purpose his rejection of all peace agreements that included israeli withdrawal from arab lands , his invasion of lebanon , his provocative visit to the temple mount , the destruction of villages and homes , the arrests of thousands of palestinians and his open defiance of president george w bush s demand that he comply with international law have all been orchestrated to accomplish his ultimate goals to establish israeli settlements as widely as possible throughout occupied territories and to deny palestinians a cohesive political existence there is adequate blame on the other side even when he was free and enjoying the full trappings of political power , yasir arafat never exerted control over hamas and other radical palestinians who reject the concept of a peaceful israeli existence and adopt any means to accomplish their goal mr arafat s alltoorare denunciations of violence have been spasmodic , often expressed only in english and likely insincere he may well see the suicide attacks as one of the few ways to retaliate against his tormentors , to dramatize the suffering of his people , or as a means for him , vicariously , to be a martyr tragically , the policies of mr sharon have greatly strengthened these criminal elements , enhanced their popular support , and encouraged misguided young men and women to sacrifice their own lives in attacking innocent israeli citizens the abhorrent suicide bombings are also counterproductive in that they discredit the palestinian cause , help perpetuate the military occupation and destruction of villages , and obstruct efforts toward peace and justice the situation is not hopeless there is an ultimate avenue to peace in the implementation of united nations resolutions , including resolution 242 , expressed most recently in the highly publicized proposal of saudi arabia s crown prince abdullah the basic premises of these resolutions are withdrawal of israelis from palestinian lands in exchange for full acceptance of israel and israel s right to live in peace this is a reasonable solution for many israelis , having been accepted in 1978 by prime minister menachem begin and ratified by the israeli knesset egypt , offering the greatest threat to israel , responded by establishing full diplomatic relations and honoring israeli rights , including unimpeded use of the suez canal this set a pattern for what can and must be done by all other arab nations through constructive negotiations , both sides can consider some modifications of the 1967 boundary lines east jerusalem can be jointly administered with unimpeded access to holy places , and the right of return can be addressed by permitting a limited number of displaced palestinians to return to their homeland with fair compensation to others it will be a good investment for the international community to pay this cost with the ready and potentially unanimous backing of the international community , the united states government can bring about such a solution to the existing imbroglio demands on both sides should be so patently fair and balanced that at least a majority of citizens in the affected area will respond with approval , and an international force can monitor compliance with agreed peace terms , as was approved for the sinai region in 1979 following israel s withdrawal from egyptian territory there are two existing factors that offer success to american efforts at persuasion one is the legal requirement that american weapons are to be used by israel only for defensive purposes , a premise certainly being violated in the recent destruction in jenin and other towns of the west bank richard nixon imposed this requirement to stop ariel sharon and israel s military advance into egypt in the 1973 war , and i used the same demand to deter israeli attacks on lebanon in 1979 \( a full invasion was launched by ariel sharon after i left office \) the other persuasive factor is approximately 10 million daily in american aid to israel president george bush sr threatened this assistance in 1992 to prevent the building of israeli settlements between jerusalem and bethlehem i understand the extreme political sensitivity in america of using persuasion on the israelis , but it is important to remember that none of the actions toward peace would involve an encroachment on the sovereign territory of israel they all involve lands of the egyptians , lebanese and palestinians , as recognized by international law the existing situation is tragic and likely to get worse normal diplomatic efforts have failed it is time for the united states , as the sole recognized intermediary , to consider more forceful action for peace the rest of the world will welcome this leadership drawing \( hadley hooper \)
the familiar image of manipulative lawyers and rapacious clients bringing frivolous lawsuits is almost as much a part of american lore as george washington chopping down the cherry tree whether it s teenagers suing mcdonald s for making them fat or a grandmother winning millions for burning herself with spilled coffee , the succession of sensational stories fuels the public s fury at a legal system apparently running amok but now a growing number of political scientists are arguing that america s famous litigiousness is n't rooted in plain and simple greed but is rather the logical response to america s distinctive distribution of power and to a historical distrust of big government the proliferation of lawsuits grows out of fundamental features of the american constitutional tradition , thomas f burke , assistant professor of political science at wellesley college , declares in a new book , lawyers , lawsuits and legal rights the battle over litigation in american society in other words , blame the founding fathers for their deep mistrust of centralized authority and their glorified view of selfreliance the government they structured with its separation of powers , its limited national control over state and local police forces and its independent judiciary was intended to protect against tyranny , but it also had the unintended consequence of making it harder for democratically elected leaders to get things done while countries like britain , germany , france or sweden have a centralized government with powerful regulatory agencies to provide safeguards and with generous social welfare benefits to cushion life s blows , professor burke argues , the decentralized american system forces americans to take their problems to court so instead of national health care , he says , americans get proposals for a patients' bill of rights that would allow the sick to sue their managedcare companies professor burke was a student of robert a kagan , a political science professor at the university of california at berkeley and the author of adversarial legalism the american way of law professor kagan argues that while the public is suspicious of government , it nonetheless expects and demands comprehensive governmental protections from serious harm , injustice and environmental dangers this fundamental tension forces people to turn to the courts to do everything from cleaning up the environment to rooting out discrimination , or to go one step further , to warn them away from unhealthy overeating or even unexpectedly scalding coffee under this system of adversarial legalism , as professor kagan calls it , the judiciary and lawyers become a critical part of the governing process both professors kagan and burke rely in part on the work of the stanford legal historian lawrence friedman , who in his 1985 book , total justice , wrote that growing wealth and technological advances were leading people to expect government to solve their problems as professor kagan said recently , people used to say if we can put a man on the moon , we certainly ought to be able to figure out how to make a product safe this quest for total justice has had the effect of creating a far greater role for courts and lawyers because elected officials are n't sufficiently empowered to bring changes , people turn to the judiciary modern tort law actually developed because the american government was n't passing laws to protect people from the hazards of the industrial revolution , carl t bogus , a law professor at roger williams university , explains in his book why lawsuits are good for america , published last year the courts stepped in to mandate safety measures , some of them life saving , when the legislatures refused to by the middle of the 20th century , lawyers discovered that litigation could also be a tool for broad social change , filing the landmark brown v board of education in 1954 then congress passed the civil rights act of 1964 , inviting plaintiffs to sue to open up the workplace to women and minorities this was the era of what s known as the due process revolution , when lawyers won criminal defendants the right to counsel and welfare recipients the right to hearings eventually , the aged and disabled won rights that were likewise enforceable by lawsuits lawyers began bringing class actions , and the law seemed to be expanding into every facet of daily life sexual harassment law developed in the 1980 s , for example , bringing the courts into the workplace all of this alarmed corporations and insurance companies , which began lobbying to limit their liability by the 1990 s , popular books like the litigation explosion by walter olson and the death of common sense by philip k howard made the threat of litigation a public cause , warning that individual greed was replacing community values not everybody accepted that story , however academics like mark galanter , law professor at the university of wisconsin , published articles debunking the claims of outrageous litigiousness and demonstrating that there were n't many more lawsuits in the 1980 s than there were in

take on general motors \?
scientists have identified a hormone that causes the sensation every dieter craves the feeling of fullness the hormone , peptide yy336 or pyy , is made by cells in the small intestine in response to food and then circulates to the brain , where it switches off the urge to eat it stops you feeling hungry , said dr stephen r bloom , a professor of endocrinology at hammersmith hospital at imperial college school of medicine in london , who led a study of the hormone that was being published today in the journal nature it controls you and me after every meal we eat pyy has been known since the 1980 s , but its ability to suppress appetite was discovered only within the past year or so , dr bloom said in his study , people who were given a tiny dose of the hormone and offered a buffet lunch two hours later consumed about 33 percent fewer calories than they did when they were not taking the hormone they reported feeling full , but not overstuffed or ill the effects lasted about 12 hours , and when the hormone wore off , the people had no tendency to overeat to make up for the calories they had missed dr bloom said he hoped it would be possible to use pyy itself , a drug based on it or a diet that stimulates the body to make more pyy to help people lose weight highfiber diets seem to stimulate pyy production naturally , he said pure pyy would have to be injected it cannot be taken by mouth because it would be broken down in the stomach but a drug based on pyy might be made in pill form , he said the research is in its earliest stages today s study included only 12 people , none of them obese far more testing is needed to find out whether pyy or related molecules are safe and effective , especially for longterm use another appetite suppressant , leptin , made by the body s fat cells and thought to have promise in treating obesity , has turned out not to work because most overweight people are resistant to it a researcher who was not involved in the pyy study , dr david e cummings , an endocrinologist at the university of washington and the department of veterans affairs in seattle , said , i think this is a very important finding dr cummings said pyy might ultimately prove more useful than other hormones previously found to suppress appetite some of those hormones suppress appetite only briefly , so that test animals eat smaller meals , but compensate by eating more often , and so do not lose weight others , like leptin , affect weight , but only after a very long time , he said pyy seems to fall in the middle it fills a new niche , dr cummings said it rises with every meal and falls in a few hours , but its actions are longer lasting in animals , he added , pyy keeps working with repeated doses and causes weight loss in may , dr cummings led a team that showed that another gut hormone , ghrelin , was a powerful appetite stimulant he said that pyy seemed to be an antighrelin and that , to help people lose weight , adding pyy would probably work better than trying to take away ghrelin drugs to help people lose weight are badly needed , dr bloom said , because obesity is increasing worldwide in every age group it s causing a lot of disease , dr bloom said it s the biggest epidemic that exists , and it causes far more premature death than any other disease globally , a billion people are obese in the united states , about 60 percent of adults are overweight or obese , as are nearly 13 percent of children some 300 , 000 americans a year die from illnesses caused or worsened by obesity dr bloom said he thought pyy would be safe , with few or no side effects , since it is made by the body and people are exposed to it after every meal in addition , the dose that quelled appetite in his study was small , only about as much as the body makes after a generous meal side effects \? he said you must be having them every day when you eat lunch did you notice them yesterday or today \? i ca n't think of anything more natural than something that goes up after a meal but some of dr bloom s coauthors on today s paper did have concerns about potential side effects dr michael a cowley from oregon health and science university in portland said that although no problems had occurred , pyy might act on the cardiovascular system and gut dr cowley added that large doses could theoretically affect heart rate and blood pressure or cause digestive problems like diarrhea we 're just saying you have to be very careful , he said pyy is easy to synthesize in a laboratory and not terribly expensive , dr bloom said it costs about 250 per milligram , dr cowley said , enough for three treatments but that does not include the costs of testing and marketing it as a drug , which would run to hundreds of millions of dollars dr bloom said he was not sure whether drug companies would be interested in developing pyy itself , because , as a naturally occurring molecule , it might not be patentable a new molecule related to pyy would be patentable , though like many other scientists , dr bloom attributed the rise in obesity to the increased availability of fattening foods humans had evolved to survive famine , not feast , he said , and people today are the descendants of ancestors who had withstood starvation because they had genes that enabled them to store fat as a reserve we did n't evolve for this environment of supermarkets at every street corner , dr bloom said so what we do is , we find out how appetite is regulated and we work to readjust that regulation to make us more fitted to the environment we 're in we interfere with nature to alter the bad effects of this environment for which we have n't evolved
as the city taxassessor scandal moves toward a new phase , with the first trial scheduled in january , newly disclosed information suggests that the corruption was much more extensive than prosecutors have previously said despite repeated warnings and investigations , the city seemed unable to root out the corrupt assessors a newly disclosed letter suggests that in 1993 the city was asked to investigate whether not only tax assessors and tax consultants , but also prominent tax lawyers and by extension owners may have been knowing participants in the scandal mayor michael r bloomberg has called it the largest and most financially damaging corruption scheme ever conducted within city government fifteen assessors have pleaded guilty in the scheme the man accused of being its leader , a tax consultant named albert schussler , 86 , has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial on jan 27 mr schussler is accused of paying bribes to the assessors to lower tax assessments , and thus tax bills , for owners of office towers , hotels , apartment houses and parking lots in manhattan as investigators prepare for the trial , testimony by the tax assessors who have pleaded guilty in the scandal , and a previously unreleased letter from a city official , raise new questions about the possible involvement of property owners and propertytax lawyers many of the owners of the 562 properties that prosecutors say benefited from the bribes , however , have said that they were unaware of any wrongdoing by mr schussler no owners or propertytax lawyers have been charged for more than 14 years , despite repeated warnings , the city was seemingly powerless to stop the scheme , which involved nearly half the municipal tax assessors , according to previously unreleased city documents and the testimony of those involved in 1993 , for instance , the president of the city s tax commission sent an urgent letter to the city s department of investigation alerting investigators to possible corruption in the tax assessor s office but the official , david goldstein , never heard back from the agency nine years later , the two men cited in mr goldstein s letter mr schussler and thomas j mcardle , who were both consultants to some of the city s biggest property owners and taxlaw firms figure at the center of an indictment brought in february against mr schussler and 17 other current and former assessors accused of taking bribes to lower taxes mr goldstein said in his letter that the tax consultants were offering owners lower assessments before the city s tax roll was published in january prosecutors say that mr schussler was the mastermind of the scheme , which began in 1967 the indictment charges that mr schussler used three unidentified coconspirators , or gobetweens , to bribe assessors prosecutors have refused to name those suspected of being mr schussler s coconspirators but some of the 15 assessors who have already pleaded guilty to bribery charges and defense lawyers have identified mr mcardle his son stephen e mcardle and a third man , joseph marino , as the gobetweens who handed the assessors cashstuffed envelopes all three men , who did not return calls requesting comment , are believed to be cooperating with investigators frank valvo , who is 70 and had worked as a city assessor for 27 years before he pleaded guilty in september , testified that mr schussler was the one who was soliciting real estate , outside interests , and going to mr mcardle he said mr mcardle had paid him 130 , 000 over the years to reduce taxes the involvement of mr mcardle raises a series of questions , since he was a city assessor in the 1970 s , a hearing officer for appeals to the tax commission in the 1980 s and a tax consultant in the 1990 s for some of the largest taxlaw firms in the city , including schwartz weiss asked about mr goldstein s 1993 letter , emily gest , a spokeswoman for the department of investigation , said , doi never gave up on its efforts to uncover the scheme joel r marcus , a former president of the real estate tax review bar association , said he had been disappointed by the department of investigation he said he was interviewed by the agency after he complained to mr goldstein in 1993 about potential corruption among assessors , property owners and certain tax lawyers i left doi thinking they were n't going to do anything , he said i do n't know what happened , but nothing changed mr goldstein said this week that the corrupt assessors seemed to have powerful political patrons in the democratic party in brooklyn after suspicious supervisors transferred mr marino and mr valvo out of manhattan in the 1970 s , he said , they got transferred right back one lawyer who has worked inside and outside the city s finance department said the corruption persisted for a variety of reasons but , he said , none of the mayors wanted anything to happen on their watch it broke with bloomberg because he 'd just come into office , so it s not his fault
as i think about president bush s plans to take out saddam hussein and rebuild iraq into a democracy , one question gnaws at me is iraq the way it is today because saddam hussein is the way he is \? or is saddam hussein the way he is because iraq is the way it is \? i mean , is iraq a totalitarian dictatorship under a cruel , ironfisted man because the country is actually an arab yugoslavia a highly tribalized , artificial state , drawn up by the british , consisting of shiites in the south , kurds in the north and sunnis in the center whose historical ethnic rivalries can be managed only by a saddamlike figure \? or , has iraq , by now , congealed into a real nation \? and once the cruel fist of saddam is replaced by a more enlightened leadership , iraq s talented , educated people will slowly produce a federal democracy the answer is critical , because any us invasion of iraq will leave the us responsible for nationbuilding there invade iraq and we own iraq and once we own it , we will have to rebuild it , and since that is a huge task , we need to understand what kind of raw material we 'll be working with it is instructive in this regard to quickly review iraq s history before saddam romper room it was not it was a saga of intrigue , murder and endless coups involving the different ethnic and political factions that were thrown together inside iraq s borders by the british in july 1958 , iraq s king faisal was gunned down in his courtyard by military plotters led by brig abdel karim kassem and col abdul salam arif a few months later , kassem ousted arif for being too pronasserite around the same time a young saddam tried , but failed , to kill kassem , who himself executed a slew of iraqi nasserites in mosul in 1959 in 1963 , arif came back from exile and killed kassem a short time later arif , and the baath party thugs around him , savagely slaughtered and tortured thousands of leftwingers and communists all across iraq arif ruled until 1966 , when he was killed in a helicopter crash and was succeeded by his brother , who was toppled in 1968 by saddam and his clan from the village of tikrit that s when saddam first began sending away his opponents to a prison called qasr alnahiya the palace of the end since 1958 , every one of these sunnidominated military regimes in baghdad began with a honeymoon with the kurds in northern iraq and ended up fighting them the point here is that we are talking about nationbuilding from scratch iraq has a lot of natural resources and a decently educated population , but it has none of the civil society or rule of law roots that enabled us to quickly build democracies out of the ruins of germany and japan after world war ii iraq s last leader committed to the rule of law may have been hammurabi the king of babylon in the 18th century bc so once saddam is gone , there will be a power vacuum , revenge killings and ethnic pulling and tugging between kurds , sunnis and shiites this is not a reason for not taking saddam out it is a reason for preparing the us public for a potentially long , costly nationbuilding operation and for enlisting as many allies as possible to share the burden there is no avoiding nationbuilding in iraq because to get at iraq s weapons of mass destruction we 'll need to break the regime open , like a walnut , and then rebuild it what s worrying about the bushies is that they seem much more adept at breaking things than building things to do nationbuilding you need to be something of a na ve optimist i worry that the bushies are way too cynical for nationbuilding my most knowledgeable iraqi friend tells me he is confident that the morning after any us invasion , american troops would be welcomed by iraqis , and the regime would fold quickly it s the morning after the morning after that we have to be prepared for in the best case , a nice strongman will emerge from the iraqi army to preside over a gradual transition to democracy , with america receding into a supporting role in the worst case , we crack iraq open and it falls apart in our hands , with all its historical internal tensions particularly between its longruling sunni minority and its longfrustrated shiite majority in that case , george bush will have to become iraq s strongman the iron fist that holds the country together , gradually redistributes the oil wealth and supervises a much longer transition to democracy my iraqi friend tells me that anyone who tells you he knows which scenario will unfold does n't know iraq
bush at war by bob woodward illustrated 376 pp new york simon schuster 28 the 100day campaign to oust the taliban from afghanistan , summed up a year after the fall of kabul , seems a model of military efficiency and economy starting from scratch within a day or two of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the world trade center on sept 11 , 2001 , the team reporting to president bush came up with a plan , recruited allies , persuaded reluctant nations bordering on afghanistan to serve as launching pads , sent in covert action teams , began bombing the taliban s paltry handful of military assets on oct 7 , galvanized the northern alliance , sweettalked pashtun tribal leaders to switch sides , chased the taliban out of kabul on nov 13 and installed a friendly interim government under hamid karzai three days before christmas what could be cleaner than that \? but watched day by day from inside the white house , as recorded by bob woodward in his remarkable new book , bush at war , the campaign was halting and full of alarms , a hastily assembled patchwork of old ideas chief among them were heavy leaning on governments that would have preferred to keep out of it , bombing and then more bombing , stack upon stack of 100 bills for tribal leaders and a strategy of let syouandhimfight these various strands were held together by a confident president who believes his job is to know what he wants , stay one jump ahead of his team and keep pushing until the team , and then the world , fall into step behind him what s remarkable about woodward s book is the same thing that was remarkable about many of his others extraordinary access to secret documents , like contemporaneous notes of national security council meetings , and to high officials , including president bush , who submitted to a 2hour25minute interview of lively give and take woodward says he himself asked questions or interjected comments 300 times also quoted repeatedly in the book are many other officials the national security adviser , condoleezza rice secretary of state colin l powell and his deputy , richard l armitage secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld and his deputy , paul d wolfowitz director of central intelligence george j tenet and his chief counterterrorism expert , cofer black but the rules of the game mostly prevent woodward from naming his sources , which , in any given instance , might be an official document or something remembered by a cabinet secretary or the recollection of words overheard by an assistant two or three levels down the food chain in one typical example , woodward describes a national security council meeting on oct 16 in which rumsfeld insisted that the military was following the cia s strategy in afghanistan oh no , tenet s deputy , john mclaughlin , said , our guys work with the cinc that is , the commander in chief in the field , gen tommy r franks we 're supporting the cinc the cinc is in charge no , rumsfeld countered , you guys are in charge we 're going where you tell us to go after the meeting , according to woodward , rice took rumsfeld aside and said , don , this is now a military operation and you really have to be in charge the earlier quotations might have come from nsc minutes , but what about rice s chiding of rumsfeld for being sulky \? it would be nice to know who told woodward that , but more important is the question whether it is true woodward has been writing books in roughly this way for 20 years , and during that time he has rarely been attacked by his subjects for getting things wrong in the present case rice and rumsfeld were both there either or both could say it never happened , but both have been silent the lack of protest , combined with woodward s reputation , inclines me to trust his account as solid until something else comes along that says different with footnotes accepting bush at war for what it is something akin to an unofficial transcript of 100 days of debate over war in afghanistan , with omissions of unknown significance then what does it tell us about the character of president bush and his government , and what does it tell us about the war they are planning to fight next \? it is my sense that the answer in both cases is quite a lot over the last several months , as the administration talked first of attacking iraq without further delay , but then with much footdragging agreed to consult with the united nations and finally to give saddam hussein a chance to submit to the security council s tough new resolution , i sometimes imagined that it was all an elaborate charade following a wellconstructed script woodward s account of the internal argument over attacking iraq , a kind of coda to his book , persuades me it was n't so far from being deeply hidden , what these men believed and wanted was so close to the surface that even the newspaperreading public knew roughly how the argument was unfolding rumsfeld wanted somebody to hold his coat so he could start throwing punches , cheney growled that inspections were a waste of time , powell was distressed by his colleagues' apparent willingness to toss 50 years of american commitment to collective security out the window , while bush , listening to the inner voice he has grown increasingly to trust , gradually tipped in the direction of regime change , and once he got there , said so loud and clear
the indictment of 18 former and current city tax assessors on monday was , it turns out , years in the making while the investigation that resulted in the federal racketeering charges began five years ago , city and law enforcement officials have been concerned for at least a full decade by suspicions of corruption in the finance department , the city agency that oversees the process by which real estate taxes are assessed as a result , the investigation an effort to penetrate the clannish and insular world of a group of lifelong bureaucrats bound together , prosecutors say , by millions of dollars in bribes actually moved forward in fits and starts in two instances , the city s department of investigation inserted undercover agents into the manhattan government office where billions of dollars in tax decisions were routinely made by men making modest salaries and working cheek to jowl in a grimy bullpen on the ninth floor of the city s municipal building , according to people who were briefed on the case and as the investigation ground forward , former finance department officials say , the agency s new commissioners were made aware of the problems and suspicions after they were sworn in and asked not to make personnel changes that might interfere with the inquiry yesterday , city and federal investigators would not say what had led to the final break in the case , a feat that allowed them to penetrate a tightly knit cell and gather enough evidence to charge more than a third of the assessors at the agency s manhattan office with a scheme that they said spanned three decades they said that the scheme reduced the tax rates on some 500 properties corruptly , depriving the city of tens of millions of dollars in tax revenues but several current and former investigators yesterday likened the closed world of the assessors to that of an organized crime family , where the bonds are born of years of committing crimes together it s like trying to infiltrate a mob family , said one person who had been briefed on the case , and who spoke on the condition of anonymity it literally would take years as an assessor to be accepted by these guys all that partly explains why even infiltration by undercover agents did not instantly work , the investigators said in fact , over the years , the men had begun to speak in code , using euphemisms to describe the value of the reductions that prosecutors charge they were making in exchange for bribes lawyers for several of the men who were indicted would not discuss the case , while at least one said that his client would fight the charges prosecutors , in announcing the indictments , said their investigation was continuing , but they would not discuss whether it would involve the property owners or others involved in the tax assessment process city investigators began focusing their energies on the assessors in manhattan roughly five years ago , after a man whom they were interviewing about corruption among brooklyn assessors misunderstood his questioners apparently believing they already knew about corruption in the manhattan office , he made several disclosures , said the person who had been briefed on the case but progress after that was still slow the man became reluctant to talk , and the complexities that cloud the assessment process a subjective one that practitioners liken more to an arcane art than to a science make it difficult to uncover evidence of corruption , several current and former law enforcement officials said it s one thing to have the allegations , one said but the target can always come back and say , 'this is why we ranked this building at a lower assessment than the guy next door' according to the indictment , the scheme was so sophisticated that albert schussler , the 85yearold tax consultant whom prosecutors put at the center of the scheme , paid salaries to three men , all onetime tax assessors , to funnel the bribes to other assessors on his behalf all three of the men were identified in the indictment as coconspirators , but were not charged one , according to the person who was briefed on the case , was joseph marino , a former assessor responsible for gauging commercial tax rates in a rich swath of midtown manhattan in the 1990 s in a separate but related case , mr marino pleaded guilty in april 2000 in federal court in manhattan to taking 41 million in bribes , which , according to a transcript of his sentencing to 48 months in prison , were paid by mr schussler it was the focus on mr marino , which came after the accidental disclosures made in the brooklyn case , that , in the words of barry w mawn , the assistant fbi director in charge of the agency s new york office , opened the door to the successful inquiry into what he said was widespread corruption in the manhattan office investigators then examined mr marino s financial records there , they found evidence of the bribes , which ultimately led to the unraveling of the broader bribery scheme , several people said the person who has been briefed on the case said that the department of investigation has long focused on corruption among tax assessors the department has done investigations in that area going back easily 25 years , including putting people undercover as assessors before , going way back , the person said and sometimes they made an occasional arrest there and they were always aware that there might be something like this going on , but they were unable to make a dent in it whether any property owners were aware of the bribe scheme remains unclear some investigators said they found it inconceivable that none knew what accounted for their success in obtaining reduced payments some former tax assessors said they agreed that there must have been some level of knowledge among the people who benefited from the reduced assessments what is clear , according to some real estate executives , is that there had long been a sense among certain segments of the industry that something was amiss at the finance department several executives said they resented any implication that owners , or the industry , colluded somehow with the bribery scheme jeff gural , a partner in newmark company and a property owner , said that he and steven spinola , president of the real estate board of new york , the industry s powerful lobbying organization , took their suspicions to the giuliani administration as far back as 1994 or 1995 mr gural , whose father , aaron , was a longtime friend and client of mr schussler , said he told officials that he was becoming alarmed at the proliferation of tax consultants like mr schussler , who seemed to be unusually successful in persuading assessors to reduce tax bills for certain properties i asked the city , please investigate , he said make sure these guys are not being paid off but the fact that owners willingly paid mr schussler s extravagant fees is not proof that landlords condoned bribery , said one executive who frequently hired mr schussler sometimes we pay lawyers huge amounts of money to speak on our behalf , he said we pay lobbyists that s the system we live in sometimes you get one that s crooked yesterday , the finance department removed the head of the manhattan office , and commissioner martha e stark said the man , anthony gatto , has been reassigned

washington , july 22 senator robert g torricelli of new jersey appeared at a closed hearing of the senate select committee on ethics today to give sworn testimony about allegations that he accepted tens of thousands of dollars in cash and gifts from a wealthy campaign contributor in exchange for political favors the questioning , which lasted more than four hours , was the first time mr torricelli has been compelled to give congressional officials his account of his dealings with the businessman david chang , a commodities trader from bergen county , nj a fouryear federal investigation into the relationship ended in january without prosecutors seeking criminal charges now , with mr torricelli facing reelection in november , the ethics committee is reviewing the material gathered by prosecutors and the committee s decision whether it clears mr torricelli or finds some violation of senate rules could play a pivotal part in his race against the republican challenger , douglas r forrester the committee operates under such strict rules of confidentiality that its members would not disclose the location or time of the senator s appearance today , and it is unclear whether the questioning indicates that the ethics proceedings are nearing an end or entering a more intensive phase mr torricelli , a democrat first elected to the senate in 1996 , left washington after the hearing to attend a campaign fundraiser in central new jersey and did not hold a news conference his spokeswoman issued a oneparagraph statement , once again questioning the credibility and mental stability of mr chang , and predicting that the committee would exonerate the senator senator torricelli has had a complete review of the facts with the ethics committee staff , said debra deshong , his spokeswoman the simple fact is , senator torricelli never accepted gifts from david chang but mr chang s lawyer , bradley d simon , said federal investigators found a wide assortment of evidence to corroborate that mr torricelli had indeed accepted gifts from mr chang and had used his office to help mr chang s business deals mr simon faxed a letter today to the committee chairman , daniel k inouye , democrat of hawaii , asserting that mr chang was eager to testify before the committee some government watchdog groups also said they were concerned that the committee might complete its inquiry without taking testimony from mr chang or the merchants who have told reporters that mr chang paid for expensive gifts that were delivered to mr torricelli the committee is not sending signals that it is taking this very seriously , said celia viggo wexler , a senior policy analyst for common cause it s a very important principle that members of congress not be influenced by people because they get expensive gifts from them but if the committee is not going to talk to the main witness , or the people who corroborate him , it is saying that it does n't think that principle is important at all it is relatively rare for a sitting senator to be questioned under oath alfonse m d'amato and robert packwood have faced such questioning in recent years but today s proceeding was handled so surreptitiously that it created little stir in washington indeed , while a handful of camera crews and reporters waited outside the ethics committee office in the hart senate office building , the proceeding was actually under way in the capitol , a few blocks away the committee s chief counsel , victor baird , conducted the questioning because none of the six committee members attended one committee member , senator pat roberts of kansas , left open the possibility that mr torricelli could be called back for questioning before the full committee right now , the staff is doing its work , mr roberts said but mr torricelli s supporters have been quietly pushing the committee to complete its inquiry before congress takes its august recess , arguing that the matter has already been the subject of a lengthy criminal investigation and should be brought to a close before the campaign season intensifies they have also scoffed at the notion that the committee should feel obligated to question mr chang under oath he is serving a prison sentence for making 53 , 700 in illegal donations to mr torricelli s 1996 campaign and urging a witness to commit perjury the spectacle of a convicted felon with a history of perjury traveling from a federal penitentiary to the united states senate would make a mockery of the process , said ms deshong , the senator s spokeswoman while the ethics committee has access to evidence gathered during the justice department s criminal inquiry , the committee does not have to meet the demanding standard of a criminal bribery case , which requires that prosecutors prove that a gift was given in exchange for a specific favor the prosecutors who opted not to seek charges against mr torricelli in january ultimately decided that in order to meet that standard , they would have to rely too heavily on mr chang s credibility senate regulations forbid senators to take gifts valued at more than 50 , except under certain carefully delineated circumstances , and require that any gratuities be reported on a senator s financial disclosure forms mr torricelli has denied ever receiving any gifts from mr chang and has never declared any on his disclosure forms , so if the committee were to rule that he accepted mr chang s largess , it could find he violated senate regulations photo senator robert g

that question is taken seriously by chevron word of the women s raid quickly spread from this remote village to london , where chevron executives cut short a management meeting to rush to nigeria chevrontexaco s giant terminal the size of 583 football fields is protected by barbedwire fences and moatlike waterways but , as the executives knew , it is also surrounded by tens of thousands of africans who have grown poorer and angrier americans rarely set foot in those villages , flying in and out of the terminal aboard helicopters and planes but how long these two worlds can coexist in such proximity without inflaming violence is a question that increasingly preoccupies the top management of chevrontexaco in the years ahead , the company , which operates in 186 countries and is the top american investor in subsaharan africa , will pump more of its oil in places where people live on less than 1 a day , said its chief executive , david j o 'reilly the big challenge it s an enormous challenge is to ensure that as a human race we provide an environment in which these billions of people achieve the standard of living that the majority of the people in the world have come to expect , mr o 'reilly said in an interview at the company s headquarters in san francisco does it have to be the same living \? no but should it have a standard \? yes commenting on a recent trip he made to the niger delta , he said there are tremendous needs we ca n't fill them all there s no question but we have to play a role during the women s 10day occupation , chevron representatives repeatedly crossed the creek to negotiate with village leaders much was at stake executives at the escravos terminal dispatched regular updates to chevron headquarters in san francisco on the fate of the 350 , 000 barrels of crude that is supposed to be shipped out daily so far , there is a truce that allows the output to continue the industry an enterprise rises , and a village sinks many of the women are old enough to remember the americans' arrival here in the 1960 s they watched the terminal grow over time , the giant redandwhite communications tower rise into the sky , and the first helicopters and planes land on the terminal airstrip meanwhile , on their side of the creek , life deteriorated ugborodo , a fishing village , is sinking into the water , a fact that villagers attribute to company actions to widen the creek and a nearby river oil wealth has brought few modern amenities outhouses made of corrugated zinc line the nearby shore the villagers follow raised planks to them and defecate directly into the same water where they fish for crabs ugborodo may sit across from chevron s largest terminal in the delta , but the village does not have a gas station villagers buy their gasoline upriver and have it shipped here , paying three times what the rest of nigeria pays these issues impinge on american interests , too , as the demonstrations show in the coming years , the united states will increasingly rely on oil from the mangrove swamps of the niger delta , already its fifthlargest source of imported oil seeking new sources of oil outside the middle east , especially since the sept 11 attacks , the bush administration has been courting big african producers like nigeria and angola , as well as upstarts equatorial guinea , s o tom and pr ncipe the united states imports 15 percent of its crude oil from africa , but the share is expected to rise to as much as 25 percent in a decade , with most of the world s new oil reserves coming out of this continent the output of nigeria itself is expected to increase 50 percent , to three million barrels a day , by 2007
a secret history of the ira by ed moloney illustrated 600 pp new york w w norton company 2895 can the hope of the greenwhiteorange irish flag peace between catholic and protestant ever be realized \? when ed moloney , a respected journalist born in england and educated in northern ireland , finished a secret history of the ira earlier this year , the omens looked good the agreement signed on good friday , 1998 , with papal blessing and lowkey american support , continued a ceasefire by the mainstream irish republican army , and its political ally , sinn fein , had joined the powersharing assembly in belfast to which britain had transferred daytoday government but the ira is still holding huge stocks of arms , mostly from libya and the united states then , last month , a senior sinn fein official was charged with having information likely to be of use to terrorists , reportedly on possible targets for assassination britain suspended the northern ireland assembly to forestall a walkout by hardline protestants in the worst case , the killing and maiming of 35 years of guerrilla war and savage counterinsurgency resumes and ireland , north and south , is back at tragic square 1 moloney , a former northern editor of the irish times and the sunday tribune in dublin , begins his account in the 1960 s , when the bitter seeds of the current cycle of ireland s troubles were planted and the leadership still dominant on both sides emerged in his version \( which , having covered the same events for the sunday times of london , i commend \) , northern ireland s repressive stability was shattered , like that of many another unjust regime , by overtimid attempts at reform in 1965 , with a reasoning that still holds good , the patrician protestant northern irish prime minister , terence o'neill , met his dublin counterpart , sean lemass , a veteran of the 1916 easter rising , arguing that catholic acceptance of northern ireland was needed to revitalize its economy and that this meant giving catholics fairer access to jobs and houses a fiery protestant fundamentalist , the rev ian paisley , warned of a sellout to rome seeing their privileges threatened , workingclass protestants formed loyalist gangs in the summer of 1966 , loyalists shot a catholic , peter ward , 18 , caught in a protestant pub a catholic pedestrian was shot on the street and an elderly protestant woman died in a botched bar firebombing the first deaths of the present round inspired by the american civil rights movement , young students , mostly catholic , formed their own protest movement , people s democracy in 1969 , loyalists attacked a movement march , setting off escalating sectarian violence and a northern irish government request for british troops welcomed as peacemakers , they soon aroused ancestral memories of longago english invasions moloney notes that many of the regulars were veterans of counterinsurgency operations in malaya , aden and kenya and unthinkingly brought with them colonial perceptions of native treachery on aug 9 , 1971 , police officers and soldiers arrested 342 people , mostly catholics , who were interned without charge or trial , many on the strength of outdated intelligence , mistaken identity or village gossip some were tortured riots broke out all over northern ireland on jan 30 , 1972 , bloody sunday , in a bungled attempt to bring the ira to battle , british paratroopers in londonderry fatally shot 14 unarmed catholic civil rights demonstrators , none connected with the ira the british embassy in dublin was burned , and young catholics flocked to join the terrorists in 1972 , the most violent year of the troubles , 467 people died the internment of oldline ira fighters moloney estimates there were no more than 50 still active in belfast cleared the way for younger militants still unknown to the police the ablest of them , gerry adams , was 18 and working in a bar in 1966 when , according to moloney , he was sworn into company d of the ira s belfast brigade , in which his father had been wounded in an action on both sides the adamses have deep republican roots \( meaning , in irish terms , they favored the reunification of ireland at gunpoint if necessary \) adams was brought up in ballymurphy , an isolated catholic ghetto on the western edge of belfast in constant danger of loyalist violence adams , president of sinn fein since 1983 , has never admitted involvement with the ira , but with his family history this is hard to believe more surprising , moloney reports that adams has never personally fired a shot in anger against the british or their local allies still , he was briefly interned without trial in 1972 , again in 1973 , and then served three years for trying to escape in periods of freedom , according to moloney , adams rose to command the belfast brigade and is credited with introducing armalite rifles bought with contributions by irishamericans to the cause of northern aid adams shared his time in prison , moloney reports , with a group of internees devising a new strategy for the ira force was still favored to drive the british out but , to achieve something during our lifetimes , adams called for a long war that , to retain the essential support of catholics , meant open political activity as well in this , moloney says , lay the germ of the ira s acceptance of a ceasefire 20 years later most of moloney s book is devoted to the gradual evolution of this policy years of nonstop bloodshed , some 3 , 600 deaths to date , a slowmotion world trade center in an area scarcely bigger than connecticut of tragicomedy , like the racehorse held by the ira for ransom , shot while trying to escape and of stomachturning cruelty on both sides \( the shankill butchers , a protestant gang who sliced their catholic victims with cleavers , and the human bombs , beginning with a catholic working for the army who was forced by the ira to drive a car bomb into a base and was then blown up \) moloney names a selfeffacing hero , the rev alec reid , a redemptorist priest who acted as a tireless gobetween , and fills out the roles of other men of peace the northerndescended irish prime minister , charles haughey , and the nobel laureate john hume , who risked his catholic support to meet adams and convey plans for an end to ira terrorism through the many and devious policy shifts that led to the 1997 ira ceasefire , moloney traces what he calls the golden thread of consent implicit in the principles of nonviolence laid down by the mediator , and former united states senator , george j mitchell there are two traditions in ireland , as the flag acknowledges , and peaceful reunification can be achieved only by negotiation between them , meaning that a majority in northern ireland , as well as a majority in the irish republic , must first democratically agree but ireland also has two traditions of lawless violence , not one and the terrorists of the loyalist side have not disarmed either , any more than the ira has and neither is likely to give up its weapons while the other side keeps its a return to the sectarian battles of 1972 onward is still a possibility pessimistically , until the current generation of diehards passes on it takes two to make peace one side cannot unilaterally cancel the hatreds of 30 violent years freelance , unauthorized terrorism by unreconciled ira and loyalist splinter groups goes on , and while most catholics support an allparty government in belfast , the democratic unionist party of ian paisley , with his uncompromising watchword no surrender ! , emphatically does not paisley s unionist party is attracting more and more protestant votes , forcing the moderate ulster unionist party to harden its stance against sinn fein on a recent visit to northern ireland , i saw heartening economic progress that gives workingclass catholics and protestants alike a stake in reconciliation mortgages and machine guns seldom go together in a telling aside , moloney reports that gerry adams , usually clad these days in politician s suit and tie , dresses down to jeans and tshirt to meet his old workingclass ira comrades moloney throws much new light , though of necessity on only one side , on a far from finished conflict he s made an important contribution to our understanding just the same drawing \( ray bartkus \)
the profits were an illusion the multimilliondollar rewards for executives were real over the last few years , executives at some companies released inaccurate earnings statements and , before correcting them , sold large amounts of stock at inflated prices at others , executives insisted for months that the recent recession would not much affect their businesses by the time they acknowledged their error , some had sold millions of shares at prices that were just a memory it happened at major technology companies like oracle and sun microsystems it happened at guess and at xerox , at dollar general , a discount retailer , and at providian financial , a credit card company the discovery of similar practices at enron , global crossing and other bankrupt companies in recent months has caused outrage everywhere from internet chat rooms to congressional hearing rooms but the pattern executives reaping rewards from their own mistakes , while shareholders suffer is far more common than many people realize and an analysis of company filings , which were provided by thomson financial , a research firm , shows that it is hardly limited to failed companies rather , the practice appears to have gone hand in hand with the general decline in accounting standards among american companies as they strove in recent years to present their financial results in the best possible light the recent recession and the fallout from enron s collapse have forced many to restate profits or to make more conservative forecasts , but the reckoning has often occurred after company officials walked away with millions of dollars in fact , stock option grants have become so large over the last decade that executives have become wealthy by selling just a fraction of their holdings during a stockprice runup that turns out to be fleeting management interests in too many cases have become misaligned with investor interests , said alan beller , the director of the corporation finance division at the securities and exchange commission in 1998 and 1999 , paul a allaire , then the chief executive of xerox , made about 16 million selling company shares that were trading at more than 50 , according to thomson financial last week , xerox agreed to restate its earnings back to 1997 and to pay a 10 million fine for inaccurate accounting the stock closed on friday at 1052 at vitesse semiconductor , executives including louis tomasetta , the chief executive , sold 53 million of stock in the first two months of last year , more than they had in all of 2000 before the quarter had ended , the company cut its earnings projection by more than half , and the shares began a descent from 72 to their current price of 894 around the same time , lawrence j ellison , oracle s chief executive , mocked microsoft for lowering its earnings forecast , saying its products , not the economy , were the cause a month later , with oracle s share price steady , mr ellison made his first sale of oracle stock in almost five years , for a gain of almost 900 million five weeks after that , he acknowledged that oracle s profit would miss its estimate , and the stock dropped 21 percent in one day little , if any , of such behavior by executives was illegal regulators say executives probably broke the law in only a few cases , mostly at littleknown companies , when they sold shares while evidence suggested that they knew their stock would soon fall or that they deliberately reported inaccurate information but because insidertrading cases are difficult to prosecute , some investors and regulators say that either the government should enact stricter regulations or directors should change the way they design pay packages there should be some kind of redress , said sarah teslik , executive director of the council of institutional investors otherwise , mismanagement pays in a speech on thursday , harvey l pitt , the chairman of the sec , said boards and the nation s stock exchanges should clamp down on the awarding of large stock option grants to senior executives without laying out the details , mr pitt said executives should be able to exercise options only after their companies' results have proved to be sustained that , he said , would help abolish perverse incentives to manage earnings , distort accounting or emphasize shortterm stock performance still , few executives are expected to be required to forfeit gains from stock sales , because insidertrading cases are so hard to bring executives who release earnings reports that later prove wrong are most likely to attract the sec s attention , mr beller said , declining to comment on individual cases xerox offers a recent example of the phenomenon from 1997 to 2000 , the company exaggerated some profits by prematurely counting revenue from leasing copiers , according to the sec the move allowed xerox to meet its earnings projections and gloss over the decline of its business , analysts say an assistant treasurer at the company , james bingham , had questioned its accounting standards , but xerox fired him in 2000 , calling him disgruntled last week , the company agreed to pay the fine , by far a record for a financial reporting case , stemming from some of the same accounting practices mr bingham had faulted for much of the period , mr allaire was xerox s chief executive , and he was chairman the entire time barry d romeril was its chief financial officer from 1999 until last year
after my first grandson , evan , was born three years ago , a friend gave him a sagegreen blanket made of polartec fleece the blanket was made by malden mills , the textile company in lawrence , mass , that nearly burned to the ground on dec 11 , 1995 i had n't noticed the blanket s label until this past november , just after malden mills filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as the fire was raging in 1995 , aaron m feuerstein , the chief executive , decided to keep paying all of his outofwork employees as he rebuilt the company , which is privately held for his actions , mr feuerstein , now 76 , was heralded as a hero , someone whose commitment to his employees and community went beyond any ethical obligation but by late last year , the company had run short of cash its annual sales stagnated at 180 million , and its earnings dropped to nearly nothing from 35 million in 2000 already on the hook for 140 million in loans , mr feuerstein asked his creditors for an additional 20 million to keep the company operating they agreed , but only if he first filed for bankruptcy protection so that the new loans would receive priority payment should the company not survive i begged them on my knees not to go into this chapter , he said but he recognized that it was the only way he could get the funds given mr feuerstein s magnanimous behavior in the past , are any of his constituents employees , customers or the company s hometown ethically obligated to help him now \? so far , none of his customers manufacturers like l l bean , patagonia and north face that use polartec in their highend garments have left him his union workers have agreed to a salary freeze until 2003 and are giving up paid personal days this year he estimated that those and other concessions would save malden mills around 2 million he has also received letters of support , some including small donations it s one thing when you have a fire and you decide to rebuild , he said but when a company is in chapter 11 , he added , who would ever anticipate that you would have thousands of letters of encouragement from strangers \? mr feuerstein said he never expected anything in return after keeping his employees on payroll in 1995 you 're supposed to do what s right because it s right , not because there s a payoff , he said and so i do n't expect anything of people the question is should he \? as part of its polartec promise campaign started in december , the company is asking consumers to buy products made with polartec fleece those generally cost more than those featuring fleece made in countries where labor costs are lower any individual certainly can do that , said jon p gunnemann , a social ethics professor at emory university but there s no moral obligation to do it at some point , if you decide to live in a market system , you ca n't function that way the only thing that s going to fix his problem is a profitable business mr feuerstein knows that he says he s optimistic that the company will make a 19 million profit on revenue of 200 million this year , despite another setback this month the company voluntarily recalled 15 , 000 electric blankets that had been distributed by lands' end after one shorted out barbara ley toffler , an adjunct professor at columbia university s graduate school of business who specializes in ethics , said caring is something we like to see , but she wondered if making enormous demands on his constituencies is the only way somebody like feuerstein can be successful it s difficult not to want malden mills to succeed as stories abound of corporate executives paying themselves fat bonuses before filing for bankruptcy while leaving the retirement funds of rankandfile employees eviscerated , we are desperate for business heroes like mr feuerstein but did his lenders have an ethical obligation to grant him the new loan \? or his union employees to agree to concessions \? do we have an obligation to buy from mr feuerstein simply because of his past good deeds \? absolutely not , just as he had no obligation to keep paying his employees six years ago for him , it was the right thing to do without obligation , his constituencies can now decide what s right , whether that means buying a north face jacket lined with polartec or a less expensive knockoff i , for one , have my eye on another blanket made of polartec fleece for my new grandson , lucas drawing \( christophe vorlet \)
morton feldman once described his second string quartet as a nightmare that has certainly seemed to be true from the standpoint of the groups that have played it in a splendid new recording by the ives ensemble on hat art , the piece is five hours long 293 minutes , to be exact if you lift your right arm into the position to hold a violin bow and imagine keeping it there for five hours , you will see the problem the piece is a medieval torture device for string players the otherwise adventurous kronos quartet used to rush through it in four hours and , after a few such trials , refused to play it , even infamously canceling a planned 1996 performance at the lincoln center festival since then , the younger flux quartet has played the work in new york , and now members of the ives ensemble of the netherlands have made a longawaited first recording but feldman was not thinking merely of length when he called the piece a nightmare born and raised in new york , feldman was a musical revolutionary , known for his long association with john cage , for writing superlong works with dynamics marked as soft as possible and , more recently , for being perhaps the most influential composer of the late 20th century it s like a jigsaw puzzle that every piece you put in fits , feldman said of the quartet , and then when you finish it , you see that it s not the picture that was the idea the jigsaw puzzle , everything finishes , and it s not the picture then you do another version , and it s not the picture finally you realize that you are not going to get a picture the second string quartet , from 1983 , is indeed made up of hundreds of shards , juxtaposed as in a puzzle or , perhaps more relevantly , as with the patches of color in one of the persian rugs feldman loved to collect along with stravinsky , messiaen and ralph shapey \( who has never received credit for it \) , feldman was one of the 20th century s great musical imagists there is no syntax in his music there are no transitions , no connective tissue and certainly none of the contrapuntal rhetoric one associates with string quartet writing instead there are pairs of chords that recur over and over fournote repeating melodies in pizzicato breathy tone clusters d sharp leading to c sharp again and again and about every 15 minutes , an archshaped theme that keeps coming back like the eternal unanswered question it is generally easy to characterize feldman s mature music as sustained notes gliding by at different rates in different instruments but his music for strings tends to depart from the pattern drier , spikier , written more in unison ensemble rhythms although the second quartet sometimes lapses into a kind of slow atonal waltz for a few minutes , it is otherwise obsessed with fourness groups of four chords echo in the silence , and fournote ostinatos follow one another , sometimes lurching into the motoric repetitions of minimalism if anyone wants to make the case that feldman was , after all , a minimalist , this piece is exhibit a the case has often been made \( in a 1987 obituary of feldman , the new york times referred to him as both a minimalist and an expressionist , an awkward but arguable pairing \) in an era that rejected repetition of any kind , feldman used repetitive figures as early as his structures for string quartet , of 1951 , long before terry riley , steve reich and philip glass created a splash with tape loops and repeated phrases in the mid60 s yet feldman s repetitions were always hesitant , irregular , creeping back as ambiguously as dim memories , never propulsive and metronomic like those of mr reich and mr glass when feldman started making his music more repetitious again in the 1970 s , he showed anxiety about possibly being seen as a minimalist epigone at one point , he pulled his composition student peter gena into his office , showed him a new score and asked , tell me , do you think it sounds too much like steve reich \? repetition notwithstanding , feldman s music never sounds like mr reich s momentum is no part of the feldman vocabulary quite the contrary , his music sounds as if it could die away at any moment , as if it were inching through unmarked terrain and pondering whether it should turn aside or even continue at all like others in avantgarde musical circles of the 1950 s , feldman was intrigued by the mobiles of alexander calder , and he sought ways in which music could replicate the mobile s gradually metamorphosing shapes credit for having achieved that effect usually goes to feldman s close colleague earle brown , whose open form pieces like available forms i allow the conductor to improvise with set passages of music but feldman came up with his own brilliant solution repeated figures in different instruments floating at different rates and recurring irregularly so that the relationship between figures keeps changing this mobile technique appears most clearly in the long chamber works feldman began writing in the 1970 s , especially in the cycle for flute , keyboard and percussion why patterns \?

denver , jan 31 the ice warriors of arapahoe county and arvada hockey were scheduled to play a youth hockey game on sunday , but officials said today that the game would be postponed that s because the last time the two suburban teams met , just last sunday , a melee broke out among more than a dozen parents four parents were charged with disorderly conduct , including one who is a police lieutenant and was offduty at the time , the arapahoe county sheriff s office said two of the parents , including the lieutenant , have been barred from attending any more games this season none of the parents involved in the brawl required medical treatment the incident took place in the suburban town of centennial only two days after a massachusetts man , thomas junta , was sentenced to 6 to 10 years in prison for beating to death a fellow hockey father at an ice rink outside boston in july 2000 it is not clear exactly what sparked the fight in the denver area last sunday , but one reason given similar to the explanation offered at the bostonarea trial was the fierceness of the play on the ice several parents declined to talk about the incident , saying their lawyers had told them not to comment other parents did not return telephone messages several participants said the incident began with shouting among players and parents over rough play , and eventually escalated , with parents shoving and punching one another the game was stopped for 30 minutes as police officers restored calm and interviewed those involved daniel madden , who was among those charged with disorderly conduct and who was banned from youth hockey games for the rest of the season said he regrets his actions i should have just laughed it off , he said i should have been more mature obviously , it got way out of control madden said the game had been very rough , and that his son cory , 15 , was suspended for the rest of the season for his aggressive play john mckibbon , director of the arvada hockey association , said he was disturbed by the incident the timing was terrible , he said , referring to junta s sentencing in massachusetts for people passionate about youth sports , it was also embarrassing others charged with disorderly conduct , a misdemeanor , were michael thode , who is a lieutenant in the aurora police department and david and diane harper , who were at the game to watch their son , matthew , 17 , a player for the ice warriors if convicted , each adult would face maximum penalties of six months in jail and fines of 650 we would have thought that the message would be loud and clear less than 48 hours after the sentencing of mr junta , said fred engh , president of the national alliance for youth sports in west palm beach , fla but instead we see parents behaving the same way the same thing could have happened again , but thank goodness it did n't this time until we educate people on the dangers and consequences of this behavior , engh added , it will continue it points out clearly that parents across america have n't the emotional maturity to deal with children in sports
washington , jan 25 in a ruling that could limit the data government agencies can withhold from congress , a federal judge in california has held that the bush administration must give democrats in the house access to census figures the administration wants to keep secret the judge , lourdes g baird of the united states district court for the central district of california , in los angeles , based her decision on an obscure provision of a 1928 law called the seven member rule the law , which has never been applied , specifies that government agencies must turn over information if it is requested by seven members of the house government reform committee or five members of the senate governmental affairs committee the administration is expected to appeal the decision , which was issued on jan 18 , and the matter may ultimately be decided by the supreme court mark j rozell , a professor of politics at catholic university and a specialist in the area of government secrecy , said that if the decision was upheld , members of the minority party in congress could gain access to much more information than they get now the ruling would apparently not affect the question of whether the administration must give congress the records of vice president dick cheney s energy task force , mr rozell said in that case , the administration maintains that the general accounting office , congress s auditing arm , has no authority to have the information as a practical matter , the seven member rule benefits the minority party in congress the majority can seek information simply by issuing a subpoena after the 2000 census count was made , the census bureau conducted a survey of 314 , 000 households and determined that 125 million people had been missed by the regular count or counted twice those missed tended to be poor and were often members of minorities those counted twice were mostly white homeowners the bush administration , over the objection of most democrats , decided last year to use the raw head count and not the adjusted figures for redrawing congressional districts and distributing government aid in april , representative henry a waxman of california , the ranking democrat on the government reform committee , asked the census bureau for the adjusted figures for states , counties and even neighborhoods the bureau refused on the ground that the figures were flawed mr waxman and 17 other democrats on the committee then filed suit under the seven member rule the law states that if seven members of the house committee , called the government operations committee until the last decade , or five members of the senate committee make a request , a government agency shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee judge baird said the law was so specific that she had no alternative but to rule the way she did she implied that she might have ruled differently if material had been withheld on the grounds of national security , law enforcement requirements or the privacy of internal deliberations the typical grounds for what is called executive privilege but in the case of census figures , none of those grounds could plausibly be claimed the administration argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because what was at issue was a political dispute between the other two branches of the government judge baird rejected that view in an interview today , mr waxman said that if the ruling was upheld , the seven member rule could become an important tool for the public s right to know

norwich , england i'm not a pagan myself , but i work with them not what you 'd expect to hear at an academic conference , perhaps , but then this was n't your typical academic conference blood , text and fears , which took place here this fall at the university of east anglia , was the first academic conference ever devoted to buffy the vampire slayer let s get the giggles and snorts out of the way now the idea of an academic conference devoted to a show called buffy the vampire slayer is bound to arouse derision , and all sorts of talk about the trivialization of academia that condescending cast of mind is all too familiar to those of us who have championed this gothic teen drama as the most daring , innovative and emotionally complex show on television like all great fantasies , buffy is grounded in emotional reality its fantastic elements only serve to heighten and amplify its emotional impact \( just as the bigness of opera amplifies emotion \) now in its seventh season , buffy has escaped the staleness that overtakes almost all longrunning television series like the harry potter books , it confronts darker and scarier emotions as its characters grow older it s a tremendously rich text , said dr carol o sullivan , the associate director of the university s british center for literary translation and an organizer of the conference it s now built up as a body of work substantial enough , and well thought out enough , that it sort of lays itself open and invites interpretation , she said so a buffy conference is no more outlandish than the notion of academic attention being paid to c s lewis s narnia books or to the lord of the rings though it may still amuse those for whom adult television is epitomized by the tidy and dull civics lessons of the west wing the idea for the conference was born in dr o sullivan s flat , where a group gathered weekly to watch buffy the organizers envisioned perhaps a oneday gathering with maybe 12 papers presented instead , 120 proposals were submitted , from which 60 speakers were chosen the 160 attendees came not only from britain but from australia , europe and north america the response silenced any potential skeptics even those who were n't confirmed buffy watchers greeted the conferees with bemused good humor prof andrew higson , dean of the school of english and american studies at east anglia , rose to welcome them wearing a pair of plastic vampire fangs part of the great fun of blood , text and fears was that , as dr o sullivan noted , everybody who s come is a fan but they are also very serious people who reflect on their own academic discipline she said there might have been some expectation that it would be the academic equivalent of buffycon , solely a fan event she cited the eternal vexed question of the cardboard cutouts were we going to have them with buffy holding a sign saying , 'this way to the buffy conference' \? but what distinguished the gathering was that people were serious without , happily , taking themselves too seriously the vexed cardboard cutouts did appear alongside a table of buffy merchandise , courtesy of the local comics shop \( i got a nifty cell phone case but decided , wrongly i now think , against the action figure of anya , the show s vengeance demon , in her halloween bunny costume \) because the seventh season of buffy does n't begin in britain until january , the few american speakers who dared make reference to it were greeted with shouts of protest begging them not to spoil the surprises some americans had brought along tapes of the first three episodes , and a place was found to show them to attendees who had not yet seen them there was such a demand that three screenings were arranged during the presentation of the papers , speakers often used clips from previous seasons for illustration they were greeted with sighs of pleasure as people got to see some of their favorite scenes , and then with small protests of disappointment when they were turned off though no one connected with buffy attended , there were , as at any gathering of fans , definite favorites among the actors james marsters s spike , the punk vampire who first appeared as the epitome of evil and has now succeeded david boreanaz s vampirewithasoul angel as the show s brooding and doomed romantic hero , was an object of acrosstheboard fascination marc blucas s riley , buffy s straightarrow boyfriend of a few seasons back , held about as much appeal for the attendees as a bowl of soggy corn flakes and the papers \? fears of a glut of jargonheavy pontification might not have been assuaged by the title of the opening address pain as bright as steel the monomyth and light in 'buffy the vampire slayer' but as it turned out , the enthusiasm that bubbled up among the participants had translated beautifully of the dozen or so papers i heard , none went in for more than a passing nod to theory in fact one , presented by james gray of goldsmiths college , was an extended rebuke to roland barthes s idiotic theory of the death of the author gender studies made its impact felt in some of the papers , and a reasonable listener might have begun to suspect that the discipline ends up unintentionally reinforcing every stereotype it means to subvert women who display some degree of gumption and independence are said to have been masculinized mostly , though , the papers were all good close readings of the show the aforementioned pain as bright as steel was delivered by rhonda wilcox , a professor of english at gordon college in barnesville , ga , who with david lavery , a professor of english at middle tennessee state , runs a web site called slayagecom devoted to papers on buffy , and it was brilliant \( ms wilcox and mr lavery hope to hold the first american buffy conference in 2004 \) using clips from the series , ms wilcox talked about the moral complications of light imagery in a genre where , for the vampires at least , light equals death with disarming modesty , her piece challenged the way academia can deaden the most exciting subjects leaving her talk , you felt the audience revved up and ready to jump in sparks flew in the discussion following the sex and violence session , where one person accused the three speakers of winking at what he called the show s tit for tat use of femaleonmale violence only to find himself vigorously rebutted by the audience there was something undeniably amusing about being among a group of folks who had traveled from as far away as australia and california to meet and debate the merits and meanings of a television show about a young woman chosen as the slayer of demons and vampires but it was more amazing , more bracing , than it was absurd the coffee breaks that separated sessions turned into little klatches of people discussing the papers they 'd just heard , adding their own annotations and observations , eager not to let the discussions end before they bundled into the next sessions and a new round of debate began speaking as a critic who is used to seeing daring and difficult work fail to find an audience , i was heartened by the passion and braininess of the debate the harrowing sixth season of buffy was , as tamzin cook , one of the speakers , noted , quite painful to watch somehow , buffy has found viewers willing to take the journey what i 've seen on the web , said carol o sullivan , is that fans , the younger fans , have rejected it because it s become something that has gotten too dark and complex but older fans have been converted because they 've seen , 'hey , this is something really substantial' for two days in norwich , no one was arguing buffy the vampire slayer upn , tuesday , 8 pm eastern drawing \( ron barrett \)

fragrant harbor by john lanchester 342 pp new york a marian wood book g p putnam s sons 2595 in the fall of 1935 the ss darjeeling arrives in hong kong from the deck a european man surveys the colony with wonder heung gong fragrant harbor , observes the chinese woman beside him the harbor , the man ca n't help noticing , is filthy , and not exactly sweetsmelling either chinese joke , she explains there are n't many jokes , chinese or otherwise , in john lanchester s new novel , and this is n't the only way in which it differs from its predecessors fragrant harbor feels plump where they felt slim , and sincere where they were satirical its main characters are not memorable deviants , like tarquin in the debt to pleasure , or mockable innocents , like the eponymous hero of mr phillips they are , on the whole , gentler souls and the world they inhabit is one in which traditional virtues like love , honor , duty and decency are allowed out without wearing quotation marks but lanchester does n't let us into this uncharacteristic realm right away it s a place that belongs to the past , to that fall of 1935 the novel begins in the less fragrant near present , in the unlovable person of a journalist named dawn stone it s hong kong in the mid90 s , and dawn is rattling off the story of her career , from her first lowly job on a provincial british newspaper to her present elevated position working for a shady chinese media magnate oddly camp descriptions of her wardrobe pepper her account of her climb to the top this is a woman who , before stepping onto a junk for another day of expatriate b y \( boozing and yakking \) insists on telling us that her trousers were joseph , in an alltooeasilystainable cream but then , just as we 're settling into enjoyable loathing , dawn disappears she does n't reappear until page 328 , and then only as a necessary screw in the delicate engineering of the plot turn page 63 and the story begins all over again , but this time we 're in an entirely different place , in the warm , capable , unironic hands of 22yearold tom stewart tom was born in faversham , kent , in 1913 his entire family died of influenza shortly after world war i only tom , his brother , david , and their grandmother survived together they run the family pub , the plough in the tradition of literary siblings , the brothers are a study in contrasts david is stocky and bluff , tom bookish and dreamy one day a plough regular announces that he s moving to hong kong the map is red if you 're british you can go anywhere in the world tom is inspired he sells his share of the pub to his brother \( the money to be paid in installments , nicely oiling a wheel of the plot by ensuring that a regular parcel of cash will turn up whenever things get sticky \) , and sets sail for hong kong on the ss darjeeling life on board is initially uneventful the noisiest individual is a bluff yorkshireman named marler , who lectures tom s table on the 40 years man and boy he has spent building up his business with my own salt sweat at marseille , two sisters join the boat sadly for the young men on the ship , these sisters are missionary nuns , not members of the legendary fishing fleet \( the unkind slang for single young women traveling east in search of a husband \) sister maria is roughly tom s age , tough and delicate at the same time quickwitted not so much pretty as perfect she is also chinese sister benedicta we need not worry about , as it is maria with whom tom falls in love how does this falling in love come about \? marler and sister benedicta get into a row about the morality and usefulness of roman catholic missionaries sister maria , anxious , in her quickwitted way , to prove that the church is an excellent teacher , declares that she can take tom and have him able to pass muster in cantonese by the time the ship reaches hong kong the wager is on tom and maria spend many hours in the library together he acquires the rudiments of the language and conceives a passion for his teacher , though not , as far as we are told , a physical one maria and i had spent so much time together it felt as if we could read each other s minds , tom confides \( sadly for the prurient reader this does indeed seem to be their primary mode of communication \) finally the boat docks at hong kong tom gets a job as a hotelier and maria goes to her mission in mainland china they wo n't see each other again for four years fragrant harbor is not an enormous novel , but it feels like one it is bursting with ideas lanchester takes on almost every major theme and succeeds with most of them race , class , love , war , the fall of rulers and the rise of the ruled the novel s sharpest insights are into the nature of success , its best passages careful dissections of how a disenfranchised community of poor refugees turned the colony into one of the richest societies in the world lanchester s grandparents like tom came to hong kong in the 30 s , and he grew up in the territory he s at ease with its unique culture , and undaunted about conveying the complexities of the relationship between the gweilos the term means ghosts or foreign devils and the cantonese
david ditzel had a prestigious research job at sun microsystems in 1995 but was spending too much time in meetings that did n't matter much to him i did n't like where things were heading , and i did n't believe in the vision , so i became demotivated , he is quoted as saying in a new book i had to force myself to go off and think of something new he quit his job and founded transmeta , which has a radical new approach to making semiconductors mr ditzel is an example of a hip , hot and happening innovator , or h3 , portrayed in the book , new ideas about new ideas insights on creativity from the world s leading innovators , by shira p white , a new yorkbased consultant \( perseus publishing , 26 \) the term h3 may make readers roll their eyes , as ms white acknowledges , but do n't let the instant clich deter you her book which she wrote with g patton wright , whom she describes as a writing coach and mentor is filled with insight about the creative process and is presented most engagingly it is precisely in these tough economic times , she contends , when innovation has a black eye because of the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the collapse of incubators like idealab , that true innovators keep pushing ahead with a search for leap innovation much ink has been spilled on the topic of innovation , but ms white approaches the subject in a fresh way , partly because of her background and training she had been a painter but decided to get a master s degree in business administration at new york university ms white tells how she butted heads with one professor of management of information systems the professor gave the class an assignment ms white came up with a novel solution , but got a d the reason , she remembers the professor saying , was that it was n't the answer the professor was seeking the business mind , it seemed to ms white , was closed to creative solutions since getting her degree , ms white has led something of a dual life she has served as an instructor at the pratt institute and a lecturer at new york university s school of visual arts she also started a consulting business , spwi the letters are her initials , plus i for innovation which helps companies innovate for new ideas , ms white interviewed a mix of 100 artists and sculptors and architects as well as business leaders at america online , corning , emc , enron , genzyme , ibm research , imclone systems , microsoft , palm , progressive insurance and others obviously , at least one of these companies has been too creative ms white met and quotes enron s former chairman , kenneth l lay , and former chief executive , jeffrey k skilling , discussing their pursuit of creative people for their staff and their expansion into new lines of business she was able to adjust many of her references to enron because much of the news about the company s collapse happened just before the book went to press this month the fact remains , however , that the company was in many ways an innovator , coming up with a new market for trading commodities and for hedging , among other things imclone , another company that figures prominently in the book , has encountered problems in trying to have its new anticancer drug approved by the food and drug administration and her praise of corning , a leader in fiber optics , and idealab , the technology venture capital firm , overlook some harsh realities corning lost 55 billion last year and idled many factories because of the global glut in fiber optic cable , and investors in idealab have sued its founder , bill gross , accusing him of squandering their money but none of that detracts from the overall message that ms white offers as was the case with mr ditzel , the best innovators find it hard to work in an organization that is too wedded to the status quo in traditional organizations , people who have investments in the 'old model' are not always happy to see new talent coming along with a bright and shiny new design , ms white writes typically , the need to change is in conflict with the need to stay the same , she adds she says the best way for top executives to encourage innovation is to spot the talent in the company , then give these people enormous room to run and expose them to other influences , whether art or different scientific disciplines the point is to create what she called a spark soup of data and thoughtsharing from which new ideas emerge new things do n't tend to come out of heavy organization , she writes some executives , like corning s former chairman , roger g ackerman , even allow ideas they do n't like to percolate they also encourage innovators to play around with their mistakes the company , she argues , has a newidea culture elsewhere , she writes that true innovators do their best work when they have emotional connections to others in their research unit ms white quotes mr gross , of idealab , as arguing that researchers should be organized as tribes doing battle against other tribes that allows for greater intimacy , better communications and more camaraderie , the author says reflecting her artistic background , ms white writes that too many executives attempt to make decisions strictly by the numbers the numbers , like returns on investment , often do n't capture mushy stuff like the quality of a company s employees and the value of brands and customer bases , she says one surprise in the book is that ms white finds creativity in companies that are n't widely known for innovation progressive insurance , welch foods and capital one financial , for example progressive , now the no 4 insurer in the country , has turned auto insurance upside down by figuring out ways to offer lower rates in many cases and changing the way accident victims repair their cars rather than giving a customer an estimate to take to a repair shop , which encourages both the customer and repair shop to pad the bill , progressive takes charge of the repairs and has them done at a lower cost the company s chairman , peter lewis , told ms white that he got some of his best ideas when he swam with a tape recorder poised at each end of the pool i 've solved most of my problems at the end of the workday , in a somewhat altered state of consciousness , mr lewis said aside from the broad lessons on creativity , the book offers compelling personal accounts of how brilliant people create new things the sensational design that frank gehry developed for the guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain , started when mr lewis of progressive insurance hired the architect in 1989 to design and build his dream house i started playing with movements , making shapes that are dynamic and have a quality of movement to them , mr gehry said in the book one thing led to another , and the design morphed into a museum many creative people play with ideas and concepts that suddenly blossom , ms white concludes her innovators often pursue projects in unrelated spheres of life , all at the same time sometimes they need immersion in the spark soup at other times , they need isolation to work all night on new inspirations new ideas has an inspirational quality to it , but not in a crass lose 10 pounds in five days way even if the technology bubble has popped and enron has crashed , american creativity is n't over no one can put innovation in a bottle , but we can keep learning about how to do it better ms white s book will encourage readers to do that photos a new book advocates creative processes like the one behind the guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain \(

bangkok , aug 24 a leader of myanmar s military junta said this week that democracy would not come quickly to the country , the former burma , and that when it did it might look quite different from democracy in the west such a transition cannot be done in haste and in a haphazard manner , said lt gen khin nyunt , the thirdranking member of the junta coming three months after the release from house arrest of the prodemocracy leader , daw aung san suu kyi , the general s remarks were a reminder that her freedom did not signal the significant changes some people had hoped for since her release on may 6 from 18 months of confinement , mrs aung san suu kyi has been allowed to travel widely and to meet with her supporters , something she had been barred from doing for more than a decade but the confidencebuilding talks she had been having with the generals before her release have not resumed , nor have there been the substantive policy talks she predicted the junta has continued to free small groups of political prisoners , but the slow pace has drawn the first critical comments from mrs aung san suu kyi since may more than 1 , 000 political prisoners are estimated to be in detention until all our political prisoners are free , none of us can say that burma is now truly on the road to democratic change , she said in a videotaped statement in his speech last monday , general khin nyunt made it clear that the government s fundamental positions had not changed with the release of the opposition leader the world is full of examples where a hasty transition from one system to another led to unrest , instability and even failed states , he said the democracy that we seek to build may not be identical to that which prevails in the west but it will surely be based on universal principles of liberty , justice and equality this is essentially the same position the junta has stated since coming to power in 1988 it justified repression by saying that moving to democracy was a delicate process that required time the government demonstrated its determination to keep a tight grip on the country this week by arresting 21 students in its first major crackdown since it freed mrs aung san suu kyi three were arrested apparently for starting an unauthorized literary group and one for distributing prodemocracy pamphlets general khin nyunt s position was given added weight by an endorsement from the visiting malaysian prime minister , mahathir mohamad we are aware that the process of change must be gradual , said dr mahathir , who has been encouraging the generals in their new , more open stance a united nations envoy , razali ismail , struck an optimistic note when he paid his eighth visit to myanmar two weeks ago mr razali , a malaysian diplomat close to dr mahathir , predicted unspecified major changes in the year to come he said that the junta would begin substantive talks with mrs aung san suu kyi very soon and that there was a possibility that she would be allowed to travel in asia early this month , mrs aung san suu kyi endorsed some foreign assistance for myanmar after she met with foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi of japan , a japanese spokesman said mrs aung san suu kyi does not oppose foreign assistance which will reach really needy people , but in that process transparency and accountability should be guaranteed

beijing , nov 28 just as beijing prepares to open its first governmentsponsored suicide prevention center , a new study about suicide in china paints a grim picture of a large and unaddressed public health problem china has one of the highest suicide rates in the world , particularly among women it is the only country where suicides among women outnumber those among men , and one of the few where rural suicides outnumber urban suicides in a study being released this week in the lancet , researchers working in china place the blame for the high number of deaths on the ready availability of lethal pesticides and rodent poisons in rural areas , as well as the absence of mental health services in much of the country the study s authors , dr michael phillips and dr zhang yanping , wrote that the ready availability of pesticides and rat poison in rural homes made selfpoisoning an option for people who are experiencing acute and chronic stress of 519 suicides the researchers looked at , 62 percent were accomplished by drinking pesticides or rat poison , 20 percent were by hanging and the rest by a variety of other methods drinking pesticide is a particularly lethal form of suicide attempt , since the physical symptoms , like labored breathing , come on quickly and are hard to treat in small rural hospitals in previous papers , dr phillips , a psychiatrist at the huilongguan hospital in beijing , has estimated that 287 , 000 chinese kill themselves each year , making it the fifthlargest cause of death in the country in addition to the epidemic of rural suicide , depression and suicide have become an increasing concern in china s cities , as its citizens cope with the stress of displacement and change in their rapidly developing society pop psychology books , like who moved my cheese \? which deals with handling change , are best sellers here , and counseling centers are proliferating until now , the deep social stigma attached to both suicide and depression has prevented the government from mounting a systematic response in the past , academic conferences organized to discuss the problems were held behind closed doors , and activists who dared to raise the issues risked losing their jobs but that attitude has clearly softened , and this week dr phillips and his colleagues are officially opening the beijing suicide research and prevention center , which is financed by the beijing city government the center s plans include depression hot lines staffed by nurses , depressionawareness campaigns and an effort to place psychiatrists in at least some of the city s emergency rooms now , patients rushed to emergency rooms after unsuccessful suicide attempts are treated medically for their symptoms but do not see a psychiatrist because none work there , dr phillips said once patients are medically stable , they are simply released without treatment or therapy changes in the cities will take a long time to filter down to the countryside , where suicide rates are three times as high in the lancet paper , dr phillips and his colleagues urged china to develop basic mental health services in rural areas and to foster the development of support networks but efforts to control access to lethal pesticides would be a more effective first step , they said
minneapolis , may 12 for the yankees , it was nine innings of target practice they took aim on everything at the metrodome , and when they were finished with their 104 romp over the twins today , they had hit almost every mark in a span of nine batters in the fourth and fifth innings , the yankees hit five home runs that was more than enough support for mike mussina , who worked into the eighth as the yankees won their sixth game in a row , completing a perfect road trip all of a sudden you get one guy going , and then another guy and another guy , and before you know it , the balls are flying out of the ballpark , jason giambi said that s nice to see that s what this team is capable of doing facing rick reed in the fourth inning , jorge posada cleared the 23foothigh wall in right field robin ventura followed by blasting one 40 feet higher into the first row of the upper deck the next inning , nick johnson s laser struck a giant hamburger on a billboard spread across the facing of the football press box in right derek jeter then smoked a line drive into the seats in left jack cressend relieved reed , and two batters later , giambi smacked a 431foot moon shot that disappeared into the upper deck one thousand , nine hundred and eighty one feet worth of homers had sent the yankees on their way to an 18hit barrage that deflated the metrodome crowd of 26 , 165 the endangered twins drew 105 , 357 fans for the weekend series but saw only yankee victories the fans here are used to seeing mussina \( 52 \) at his best mussina , who struck out nine and walked none , is now 182 against the twins , the best record of any active pitcher against any team \( minimum 15 victories \) mussina had no explanation for that , but he knew where to give credit for today s decision the guys came in today and really hit the ball tremendously , he said they hit the ball out of the park , drove the ball in the gaps today was a day for the offense but it was a road trip for the pitchers in sweeping the devil rays and twins , the yankees got 12 scoreless innings from their bullpen and a solid outing from their starter every game i could n't be more pleased with our pitching on this road trip , manager joe torre said posada , who added two doubles to his homer and went 4 for 5 , was most pleased with the yankees' twoout hitting four of the five homers came with two outs , and posada said the yankees are playing their best baseball of the year good things are happening , he said we 've got to keep doing it the way we 've been doing it i think it was very important what we did with two outs , not giving atbats away , concentrating a little bit more and getting guys in the yankees also hoped that johnson s home run could help him find his stroke johnson , a rookie first basemandesignated hitter , went 2 for 5 today and has 7 hits in his last 50 atbats torre acknowledged before the game that there would come a time when the yankees must decide if they should send johnson to the minors to boost his confidence johnson believes he will hit it s just a matter of time when it s going to happen , he said and today s game might have been the start it s got to help , torre said i still think we 've got a ways to go he needs to get into a rhythm he s swinging out of his shoes still i 'd rather see that than poking at the ball , but somewhere in between there is the real nick johnson hopefully , this week , we 'll find him torre would like to see the yankees play more fundamentally sound they swept the trip despite several base running and fielding adventures , and they must get more out of rondell white when he rejoins the lineup on tuesday after torre rested him for two games here but at 2414 , the yankees are 10 games over 500 , a level they did not reach last season until the middle of june they still trail the boston red sox in the american league east , but they are encouraged we 're playing good baseball , but not great baseball , giambi said that s the nice part , because you know , sooner or later , it s going to click over it s definitely a positive point of view to say boston s been playing unbelievable and we 're right there , and i still do n't think we 've played our best baseball yet inside pitch sunday s victory was the 1 , 500th of joe torre s managerial career only 16 other managers have matched that total the last 600 have been a dream , said torre , who is 606401 for the yankees the lefthander andy pettitte \( elbow tendinitis \) threw from partway up a mound in tampa , fla , on sunday and was able to throw all his pitches pettitte will throw off a mound tuesday and will need one more mound session before starting a rehab assignment or throwing a simulated game photo catcher jorge posada watching his solo home run in the fourth inning he was the first of five yankees to hit homers against the twins \( associated press \) \( pg d4 \)
nbc was close to a deal last night that would bring television s biggest hit comedy , friends , back to the network for another season , its 10th , executives close to the negotiations said last night the talks continued past 9 pm in los angeles last night , with both sides saying they expected to finish a deal that would reverse a year of expectations that the current season would be the last one for friends the network is expected to agree to pay the highest price in television history for a 30minute show , as much as 9 million an episode , to bring the show and all six of its stars back , eclipsing the almost 7 million nbc is paying this season nbc pays about 10 million a year for the onehour drama er and has paid as much as 13 million for the show , but the price of friends per halfhour is higher the enormous price reflects the importance of the show to nbc , which for most of the last two decades has built a significant portion of its appeal to advertisers around having programmed television s toprated comedy nbc cannot hope to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the 9 million it is expected to pay for each episode of friends but the strength of the show at 8 pm is integral to the high ratings , and therefore profits , delivered by the rest of nbc s thursday night lineup nbc also has failed for most of the past five years to add any new hit comedies to its schedule , so the extension gives nbc yet one more year to develop a replacement for friends keeping friends on the air for one more season , even at so inflated a cost , would be a coup of sorts for jeff zucker , the president of nbc entertainment the show was given no chance to come back after last year s tough negotiations , which brought the salaries of each of the stars to 1 million an episode but mr zucker said as early as last summer that he had not completely given up hope of retaining the show for another season and the performance of friends in the ratings , where it is the no 1 show among the young adult audience most prized by advertisers , only intensified mr zucker s desire the negotiations have been driven largely by the desire to have things settled before the start of the holiday season the show s creative team also did not want to extend the talks into next year because they needed to make plans to write the rest of this year s episodes , and had to decide whether to work toward a finale for the series now that decision has been put off for yet another year as early as the beginning of this season in september , some of the show s cast and creators expressed sadness that the end was drawing near that sparked a glimmer of hope that the show might defy expectations and return the cast s future plans remained a factor for years one or another of the show s stars have made forays into films , hoping to establish new careers there none has been fully successful , however , which is one reason the show has been able to keep them all on board most recently , jennifer aniston , critically lauded for roles in movies like the good girl , has begun to emerge as a potential film star she has completed one starring role with jim carrey and is currently shooting another film with ben stiller but representatives of the show s stars said this week that the ensemble remained close and wanted to continue working together still , that sentiment did not solve an apparently insurmountable complication the changes coming in the financial underpinnings of the show the show s studio , warner brothers , a unit of aol time warner , has counted on syndication money from local television stations that had contracted to buy the show s repeats to help pay the production costs of 9 million to 10 million an episode , well above the 7 million fee nbc has paid the local stations had committed to pay about a total of 4 million for each episode produced this season , leaving warner brothers with a hefty profit that revenue stream , however , was almost certain to reduce significantly at the end of this season as the stations' deals with warner brothers came to an end the stations do not have to buy any of the new episodes , and indeed have a significant incentive not to if friends were to end this season , secondary deals for friends repeats would have begun next season the perepisode price for this socalled second cycle drops sharply , as much as 50 per cent for some stations , according to an executive on one side of the deal so warner brothers could not count on syndication money from stations to cover any shortfall for any additional seasons of friends nbc was going to have to pay for the full cost of next year s episodes
xinguara , brazil the recruiters gather at the bus station here in this grimy amazon frontier town , waiting for the weary and the desperate to disembark when they spot a target , they promise him a steady job , good pay , free housing and plenty of food a quick handshake seals the deal but for thousands of peasants , that handshake ensures a slide into slavery no sooner do they board the battered trucks that take them to work felling trees and tending cattle deep in the jungle than they find themselves mired in debt , under armed guard and unable to leave their new workplace it was 12 years before i was finally able to escape and make my way back home , said bernardo gomes da silva , 42 we were forced to start work at 6 in the morning and to continue sometimes until 11 at night , but i was never paid during that entire time because they always claimed that i owed them money interviewed recently in his hometown , barras , about 600 miles east of here , mr gomes da silva said particularly troublesome workers , especially those who kept asking for their wages , were sometimes simply killed i ca n't read , so maybe a halfdozen different times i was ordered to burn the identity cards and work documents of workers who i had last seen walking down the road , supposedly on their way out , he said we also found heaps of bones out in the jungle , but none of us ever talked about it brazil was the last country in the americas to abolish slavery , in 1888 , and forced labor for both blacks and whites continued throughout the 20th century in some rural areas but government authorities admit that despite a federal crackdown announced seven years ago , contemporary forms of slavery in which workers are held in unpaid , coerced labor continue to flourish the reasons range from ranchers in cahoots with corrupt local authorities to ineffective land reform policies and high unemployment perhaps most important , though , is the growing pressure to exploit and develop the amazon s vast agricultural frontier , in part to supply foreign markets with two prized goods timber and beef in the jungle west of here , fortunes are being made clearing the forest and harvesting mahogany and other tropical hardwoods , including jatoba and ipe the united states is the main importer of brazilian mahogany , and though logging has been permitted only in 13 designated areas , greenpeace , the advocacy group , has listed nearly 100 companies it says deal in illegal mahogany to meet a growing demand from american furniture makers furniture companies like ethan allen and l j g stickley say their mahogany comes only from suppliers that advise us that they comply with responsible forest practices , as ethan allen interiors inc of danbury , conn , put it in a statement but the companies also acknowledge that they do not have independent monitors and do not believe that they should have to determine the origin of imported wood we cannot do the job of the brazilian government , said aminy audi , an owner of stickley , a big buyer of brazilian mahogany in manlius , ny , for its own stores and a manufacturer for other brands we have to believe the certification , and we have had no reason to believe otherwise brazilian government statistics indicate that aljoma lumber of medley , fla , near miami , was the largest importer of brazilian mahogany in the united states in 2000 asked about slave labor in the amazon , the company s vice president for hardwoods , romel bezerra , said that there is no such thing these days , and insisted that his company s mahogany came from legal sources brazil has put in place many , many regulations , with export licenses and stamps all over the place , he said they have established strict controls on logging and cutting and transportation and export , so it is impossible to ship mahogany illegally but the brazilian government has estimated that as much as 80 percent of amazon timber comes from illegal sources , according to a confidential 1997 report in booming mill towns like this one , dealers openly resell , copy or simply counterfeit the government certificates needed to export timber when a shipment of mahogany reaches the port of bel m for shipment to the united states , government inspectors have no way to determine its origin as the trees have fallen , there has also been a huge expansion in cattle ranches that raise grassfed green beef brazil s commercial cattle herd , the largest in the world , generally does not eat manufactured feed or synthetic supplements that makes brazilian beef especially attractive in europe and the middle east , where fears of mad cow disease are still strong exports of brazilian beef , fresh and processed , grew 30 percent in 2001 , to 1 billion , according to government statistics slave labor in brazil is directly linked to deforestation , cl udio secchin , director of the ministry of labor s special antislavery mobile enforcement team , said in an interview in bras lia there are more and more cattle ranchers who want to increase the size of their herds , but to do that they need more space , so the clearing of land is a constant

miami , oct 29 about 200 haitian refugees jumped off a stranded wooden freighter this afternoon into the shallows off key biscayne , lunging through chestdeep water in a scramble to evade the coast guard and the police and to complete their desperate journey to miami with news helicopters capturing them live on national television , dozens of haitians , many in their sunday best , flooded onto a causeway leading to miami , about a mile away , as police officers converged many refugees tried to jump into passing cars and pickup trucks , begging for rides parents dropped children from the boat into the arms of other refugees and rescue workers a pregnant refugee was taken to the hospital , the police said the boat arrived about 3 30 pm just off the rickenbacker causeway , which links miami to key biscayne , an affluent barrier island community the miami police closed the causeway for about two hours , clogging rushhour traffic as they searched for refugees under a bridge and in bushes a lot of them were trying to get off the bridge and use any vehicle at their disposal to do so , said delrish moss , a police spokesman we will never know how many got away at a makeshift command post , officials from the immigration and naturalization service processed dozens of detained haitians , many wrapped in yellow blankets the refugees were put on buses and taken to detention centers coast guard representatives said that the haitians were generally in good health but that some suffered from dehydration none were believed to have drowned petty officer anastasia burns said the coast guard had two aircraft and 12 vessels trying to find refugees we 're doing a search of the entire area to make sure no people are left on the water that we may have missed , petty officer burns said we are conducting a search effort to make sure we 've rescued everyone we have no reports of injuries or fatalities yet when asked how a boat full of haitians could have come so close to shore without being detected , a coast guard spokesman said the freighter was typical of those that clog the shipping lanes off miami , and thus did not stand out the way an overcrowded passenger boat or raft might have one of haitians , yolette baptiste , a woman with two children , said she had paid someone to make the trip we were at sea for eight days , ms baptiste said in creole just before a police officer ordered her onto a bus witnesses described watching a heartwrenching struggle for freedom it was very frightening to see , said mayra vidal , 44 , who lives on key biscayne and was driving on the causeway when she spotted the boat ms vidal said the children caught her attention , and one in particular stuck out in my mind this little girl in a party dress with two bows in her hair , she said it broke my heart they dressed her up to celebrate marleine bastien , executive director of haitian women in miami , a haitian advocacy group , described similar scenes the children that we saw were shivering , cold and hungry , ms bastien said in miami s little haiti neighborhood , people took to the streets with signs demanding that the detainees be allowed to remain in the united states that is unlikely under a bush administrative directive that does not apply to refugees of any other nationality , haitians seeking political asylum are held in detention centers pending the dispositions of their cases all others are to be returned to haiti civil rights advocates and a growing number of lawmakers from both parties have criticized the policy as discriminatory the immigrants' advocates said that today s events were powerful evidence of just how dire life in haiti had become haitians will still risk their lives to make it here because things out there are so bad , said cheryl little , executive director of the florida immigrant advocacy center it s very difficult for them to apply for political asylum , and it s very unfair fortunately , cubans do n't have to go through that by united states law , cubans picked up at sea are returned to their country , but those who make it ashore are permitted to remain immigration service officials did not return calls for comment today , but the agency has long said that the policy of detaining the haitians is necessary to deter thousands from taking to sea in rickety rafts and flooding south florida , or dying en route photo police officers detained haitian refugees yesterday on the rickenbacker causeway in miami the refugees' boat had run aground , and they began coming ashore near hobie beach \( associated press \) map of miami highlighting the rickenbacker causeway
it was too early to pop open the champagne , but ordering a celebratory slice at the local pizza parlor did not seem out of line giddiness over imminent good times faded , however , when a colleague pointed out that the price of pizza suggested that the subway and bus fare would be raised before too long huh \? beware the pizza connection , he said , and he was n't talking about a drug ring he had revived a forgotten variation on the interplay of markets , new york style strange though it may seem , the cost of a subway ride has traditionally paralleled the price of a pizza slice \( we 're talking here about a regular slice mozzarella and tomato sauce , with none of those fancyshmancy toppings that muck around with one of civilization s great achievements \) call it , if you will , the fasel corollary , named for george fasel , a vice president at bankers trust who made the link in a 1985 article on this newspaper s oped page he got it right in 1960 , for example , the fare was 15 cents so was a slice of pizza i do believe there is some kind of historical correlation , said gene russianoff , a leader of the straphangers campaign , the subwayriders advocacy group it was n't difficult to get him waxing lyrical about his boyhood in the early 60 s , when he could venture forth with a dollar in his pocket , take two subway rides , buy two pizza slices and a 10cent soda , and still have 30 cents left in the early 1970 s , the fare rose to 35 cents so did pizza through the years , the increases went more or less in tandem just before the price of a subway token last went up , in 1995 , it stood at 125 , lagging behind the 135 typically charged for a slice obviously , it was time for a fare increase thus did the 150 token come to be it remains at 150 but pizza prices have not stayed put in fact , the pizzatoken gap is so large these days that it is hard to see how the subwaymeisters can hold out for long the greaseateria around the corner from home on the upper west side charges 175 in midtown , pizza parlors routinely charge 190 and even 2 with that kind of market pressure being brought to bear , how can the 150 fare survive much longer \? the problem is especially acute when you consider that new york city transit expects an operating deficit this year of 255 million , in large measure because few new yorkers actually pay 150 far from it , said albert o'leary , spokesman for new york city transit with all the discounts created in recent years , he said , we realize 106 on the average fare the pizza connection is not new yorkers' only worry what if the jets , who play today in the first round of football s postseason , go all the way to win the super bowl \? that is n't very likely to happen this is a team that has not even made it to the super bowl in 33 years but should jet lightning strike , the stock market could be headed for trouble in 2002 , despite its splendid run in those first five days historically , stocks have fallen in the year of a super bowl victory by a team from the old american football league like the jets the advice here is to choose your rooting interests wisely bear this in mind , too after every world series appearance by the mets in 1969 , 1973 , 1986 and 2000 wall street fared poorly the next year you think this is silly \? fine but do you have another explanation for the crash of '87 \? the far more frequent presence of the yankees in the world series usually leads to rises in the dow jones industrial average but the dow has also tended to do even better when the yankees lose the series so their defeat in november , however painful , may be another sign that wall street will sparkle this year with the subway fare , gov george e pataki has ruled out an increase in 2002 this is , remember , an election year ah , but what about 2003 \? that s a bit far down the road for predictions but the way things are going , the next governor , whether mr pataki or his democratic opponent , may see no choice but to raise the fare there is an obvious way out , though the state could restore traditional parity by giving pizza makers subsidies to lower their prices anyway , it s something to chew on
a few years ago , robin hardy was taking home about 300 a week as a secretary in riverside , calif barely enough to cover the essentials soon , she found herself paying for gasoline , car insurance and groceries by credit card as the bills piled up , her finances spiraled out of control mrs hardy was about 6 , 900 in debt when she received an email pitch two summers ago from a company offering to negotiate with creditors to lower her debt with consumer debt at an alltime high , people like mrs hardy are being deluged with phone calls , email messages , television and radio commercials and letters peddling various forms of credit repair , credit consolidation and debt counseling some services offer effective , affordable ways to manage or consolidate debt , but experts warn that many others can lead already desperate customers into deeper financial problems there are legitimate firms out there , but there are a plethora of companies that fall into the nonlegitimate category , said jennifer larabee , a lawyer at the federal trade commission in los angeles as barbara anthony , the director of the northeast office of the ftc in new york , put it during any downtick in the economy , you 're going to find an increase in the con artists who take advantage of people in difficult financial circumstances mrs hardy , now 38 , said she received a sales pitch that offered her hope when you 're drowning and you ca n't get your head above water , she said , this made you feel like there was an honest way to get out of trouble mrs hardy responded to the email solicitation and eventually spoke with a telemarketer in phoenix he chatted with her about her church and promised that she would emerge from the program in 16 months or less with perfect credit , she said at his urging , she added , she signed a contract with jubilee financial services of downey , calif , in august 2000 a year later , though she had paid jubilee some 4 , 000 , none of her debt had been reduced , she said creditors were still hounding her , and with the interest and late charges that were accruing on her accounts , her debt more than doubled , to about 15 , 000 jubilee representatives were difficult or impossible to reach , she said , and they had no answers about her accounts her credit in ruins , mrs hardy filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in december ms larabee of the ftc said , this particular company told consumers that they could negotiate their unsecured credit card debts and that consumers would end up paying pennies on the dollar last month , the agency filed a civil suit in federal district court in los angeles against jubilee , contending that the company misled clients the case is part of a nationwide sweep announced by the ftc on sept 5 called operation nocredit the agency and state law enforcement agencies have filed 43 actions against what they call telemarketing schemes involving advancefee credit cards , credit repair , payday loans , debt adjustment and debt negotiation all of which can gravely hurt a victim s credit malcolm mcneil , a los angeles lawyer who represents jubilee and its president , john e gustavsen , said jubilee has succeeded in reducing about 7 million worth of client debt over the last several years those who have filed complaints , he said , have usually not held up their end of the financial bargain mr mcneil would not comment on mrs hardy s situation as the case proceeds , the assets of jubilee have been frozen and it has been forced out of business but more than 1 , 400 consumers put their trust in jubilee , and at least 2 million that is supposed to be in their accounts is missing , said adrian stern , an encino , calif , accountant who is serving as jubilee s courtappointed receiver my feeling is the numbers will continue to climb the more we learn about this case , mr stern said i 've talked to people who just scraped together the last of their money , mailed it to jubilee last month and now they 're totally out of luck mrs hardy s experience is typical , ms larabee said she paid a 199 enrollment fee and agreed to have 250 deducted from her checking account every month she said she was told that the money would go into an account that jubilee would use to pay off her creditors and that she was not to pay any creditors herself two creditors filed suit against mrs hardy in late 2000 , but she said that jubilee telephone counselors told her to ignore the subpoenas a month later , when her wages were garnished because she had not gone to court , she decided that she had been taken they were taking 25 percent of my pay before taxes , she said of the garnishment i did n't make that much money you could end up where you 're on the street mrs hardy sued mr gustavsen in smallclaims court and won he appealed twice but eventually agreed to drop his appeal and refunded her 4 , 000 it may seem a small victory , considering that the bankruptcy will remain on her credit report for seven years mrs hardy , who was married a year ago and is now working at a new job that pays considerably better than her last one , said she would prefer to put the incident behind her but felt compelled to speak out
the drug giant pfizer inc has agreed to acquire the pharmacia corporation for 60 billion in stock , making it by far the most dominant drug maker in the world , according to executives close to the deal the transaction , which was approved yesterday by the boards of both companies and is expected to be announced today , these executives said , would be the largest of the many recent mergers in what remains a troubled and fragmented industry drug companies , under intense pressure from politicians , employers and managed care companies to limit price increases , are having a hard time finding breakthrough products that would assure the robust earnings growth investors demand pfizer s acquisition of pharmacia , resulting in a company that would still control only 11 percent of the global market , is likely to hasten the industry s continued consolidation page a13 the merger would create a behemoth with 48 billion in projected sales and many of the nation s most widely used drugs pfizer which already owns zoloft , the antidepressant lipitor , the nation s most widely prescribed cholesterollowering drug and viagra would also gain control of pharmacia s celebrex and bextra , two highselling arthritis drugs , and detrol , a drug that treats bladder problems pharmacia , formerly pharmacia upjohn , is also the maker of the nicorette gum smokers use to help them quit , the rogaine baldness treatment and luden s throat drops executives close to the deal said that by creating economies of scale , the merger would help pfizer to limit price increases pfizer is already being conservative about raising its prices , they say , noting that it has increased its price for lipitor only modestly since acquiring it in the 2000 acquisition of warnerlambert pfizer s headquarters would remain in midtown manhattan pharmacia is based in peapack , nj it is unclear how many of the combined company s 150 , 000 employees would be let go pharmacia recently completed the purchase of att s former headquarters in basking ridge , nj it is unclear what would happen to its plans to relocate 2 , 500 employees there the pharmacia acquisition would lengthen pfizer s lead as the largest drug maker in the united states and would vault it to the top spot in europe , japan and latin america pfizer s proposed acquisition requires approval by regulators in both the united states and europe pfizer currently has about 8 percent of the global market , while glaxosmithkline , the secondlargest drug company , controls 73 percent analysts and investors have long speculated that many pharmaceutical companies would be engulfed in a rash of mergers , leaving only a handful of gigantic survivors but so far , the largest expected mergers have not materialized , analysts said , because the companies and investors have questioned the longterm benefits pfizer s deal could pressure rivals like glaxosmithkline , which has been struggling to discover enough new drugs to make up for those now losing their patent protection , to make acquisitions simply to remain competitive glaxosmithkline s chief financial officer , john coombe , said last month that his company had been eyeing bristolmyers squibb , itself plagued by problems pfizer s proposed acquisition of pharmacia would help sustain its growth , the executives contend , because 11 of its 12 combined blockbuster drugs will be protected by patents through 2010 its pipeline of drugs in late stages of development would be expanded with several promising pharmacia drugs , including eplerenone , a new category of treatment for cardiovascular diseases parecaxib , an injectable athritis treatment and cdp870 , another drug that treats rheumatoid arthritis with an enlarged research and development budget , pfizer hopes to discover and develop more new drugs faster than its competitors the combination would have nearly 120 new chemical entities in development and 80 socalled drug enhancement projects the deal would also introduce pfizer to two markets it has never been in before cancer treatment and ophthalmology analysts have questioned the value of the drugs pharmacia has in development although the company s pipeline contains a number of interesting new products , peter norman , a pharmaceutical consultant and analyst , wrote in a recent report , none have clear blockbuster potential a swirl of controversy surrounds one and possibly two of pharmacia s top selling arthritis drugs , celebrex and bextra last month , express scripts , one of the largest pharmacy benefitmanagement companies , said that celebrex and a rival merck drug , vioxx , were being overly prescribed and have only a narrow benefit over older drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen , which are available in generic and overthecounter versions for a fraction of the price express scripts said it was recommending that its clients , which include many employer health plans , require patients who are not at risk of ulcers to try generic pain relievers first , possibly denting sales of celebrex and bextra , which is similar washington lawmakers have been vocal in recent months about rising drug prices and their cost to uninsured senior citizens and states that have to pay escalating medicaid bills but the deal will probably be approved by regulators because the companies have few overlapping drugs the only possible overlap may be between pharmacia s detrol and a competing drug that pfizer is currently developing executives close to the transaction expect the deal to be completed by the end of the current year the executives said they expected the deal to create as much as 25 billion in annual savings by 2005 they expect savings of 14 billion in 2003 and 22 billion in 2004 the savings will come from cuts in administrative costs , purchasing , manufacturing , distribution and research and development pfizer s absorption of warnerlambert was widely admired as a model of how to fully exploit an acquired portfolio of blockbuster drugs pfizer s chairman and chief executive , henry a mckinnell , who conceived of the deal , would run the combined company fred hassan , pharmacia s chairman and chief executive , would become vice chairman of pfizer and get a seat on the board under the deal , pfizer would trade 14 of its shares for each share of pharmacia , according to the executives that price of 4508 a share , based on friday s close , represents a 38 percent premium over pharmacia s stock price of 3259 pfizer shareholders would own 77 percent of the combined company , the executive said , while pharmacia s shareholders would own 23 percent prior to the completion of the deal , pharmacia plans to proceed with its previously announced spinoff to its shareholders of its remaining stake in monsanto , the executives said as a result of the spinoff , pharmacia s shareholders would actually receive the equivalent of about a 44 percent premium , they said pfizer also plans to announce today that it will expand its 10 billion stock repurchase to 16 billion , a measure that may help stabilize the value of its stock after most merger announcements , the acquirer s stock at least temporarily declines pfizer was advised by lazard and bear , stearns company and represented by the cadwalader , wickersham taft law firm pharmacia was advised by goldman , sachs and represented

karachi , pakistan , june 14 a huge car bomb exploded outside the american consulate here today , killing at least 11 people and wounding at least 26 in the most vivid demonstration yet of an expanding terror campaign aimed at foreigners and the government of president pervez musharraf none of those killed were believed to be americans , but five workers inside the heavily fortified building were slightly wounded the bomb shook the ground , blew out windows in the nearby marriott hotel and sent fragments of metal from shattered cars flying for hundreds of yards , leaving a threefoot crater in the asphalt and a gaping hole in the consulate s thick outer wall police investigators said they suspected that the bomb was set off by remote control and that the occupants of the car were themselves victims it was the second carbomb attack in this violent and chaotic city in less than a month in may , a bomb outside the sheraton hotel killed 11 french engineers working on a submarine project for the government and three other people in what is believed to have been a suicide attack the level of destruction and sophistication in the bombings may point to links between local militant groups and rogue members of al qaeda who have infiltrated the country after being routed from neighboring afghanistan they share a disgust for general musharraf for bending to american pressure to end support for islamic militants in afghanistan and in kashmir , the disputed muslim region that has brought india and pakistan to the brink of war news agencies received a statement claiming responsibility for the bombing from a previously unknown group , al qanoon , which investigators suspect may simply be a new name for militants who have regrouped after being driven underground in recent government crackdowns the attack came one day after a highprofile visit to pakistan by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , who had come as part of an american diplomatic campaign to ease tension over kashmir and who had expressed concern over the threat of terrorism to pakistan s government in washington , the state department said it would reassess how many americans to keep in the country it reduced the staff of its embassy and consulates and ordered all dependents to leave after a grenade attack in march at a church in islamabad killed five people , including two americans this is a vivid reminder of the fact that our nation is at war , said the white house spokesman , ari fleischer terrorists will use whatever means are at their disposal , no matter how despicable , to harm americans and others in houston this afternoon , president bush called the attack the work of radical killers and said you know , they claim they 're religious people , and they blow up muslims they have no regard for individual life he then told reporters , with some anger in his voice , we will continue to hunt them down , and seek justice privately , though , mr bush s aides are increasingly concerned that the bombings are a sign that general musharraf s power is eroding , and that both al qaeda and militants pressing for control over kashmir are willing to challenge him the method of today s bombing was reminiscent of the attacks on american embassies in africa in august 1998 , which killed more than 200 people and were attributed to al qaeda since then embassies and consulates around the world have added fortifications the police moved quickly today to identify the vehicles and their occupants at the scene of the attack by reconstructing the traffic flow from witnesses and debris on the scene , and by tracing license and vehicle identification numbers , they focused on a 1981 toyota corolla belonging to a driving school that carried four women , including the school s owner her three passengers had just completed the course and were returning from an office where they had picked up their licenses , the police said we think the bomb was planted in the car , said an officer on the scene , assistant superintendent imran shaukat someone planned this really , really well the car was blasted into fragments , which rained down across a nearby park along with tree branches , license plates , bits of tire tread and dead birds investigators said a second possibility was a white suzuki van that was traveling parallel to the toyota its passengers were a young woman and her uncle , who were distributing wedding invitations the american consul , john bauman , said an automobile tie rod pierced the roof of his home 300 yards away , on the other side of the park a second fragment landed on his lawn , almost hitting his gardener we have blood in the driveway , he said altogether , 13 cars and 5 motorbikes lay bent and shattered one car was flung across the road and flattened against the side of a small gazebo in the park among the shock absorbers and exhaust pipes were a shoe , a tiny grey child s sandal , a motorcycle helmet and a rubble of pulverized concrete and glass rescue workers collected body parts to be sent to the morgue crows wheeled and cawed overhead the explosion struck just after 11 o'clock on a still , hot morning , and it was the earsplitting sound that witnesses recalled most sharply

mombasa , kenya , nov 30 the traumas of their fellow muslims in the middle east may be unfolding hundreds of miles away , but here in the mosques and madrasas of this humid east african port city , the pain feels close to home in the days after terrorist attacks aimed at israeli civilians here left 16 people , including 3 suicide bombers , dead , the city s muslim leaders assert that the military and political calamities that have beset the islamic world over the last year or so have fueled resentment among the city s muslims much of that resentment is born of a widespread belief among kenya s muslim minority that they have long been the victims of discrimination at home while none of the city s islamic leaders publicly praised the attacks on an israeliowned hotel and an israelichartered airliner , many blamed both israeli and united states policies , saying they made such acts inevitable that anger , expressed in many interviews with local muslims since the attacks , appears to lend support to the claims of some kenyan officials that the militants who came here wanting to kill hundreds of israelis may have found more than a few local friends willing to help indeed , the rage expressed here appears to have been fueled at times by some of the city s religious leaders , who often make the sufferings of their religious brethren the subject of friday sermons perhaps more important , the resentment among muslims on the streets of mombasa suggests that the turmoil and suffering of their coreligionists in places like afghanistan and the middle east resonate even in the islamic world s backwaters muslims here see what is happening in palestine and afghanistan , said sheik juma ngao , a prayer leader in mombasa they naturally blame this on israel and its supporter , america the last year has been especially volatile for mombasa s muslims , who are much more visible here , where they make up considerably more of the city s population than the 10 percent in the country as a whole local clerics have staged many demonstrations over the american bombing in afghanistan , israel s campaigns in the west bank and the possibility of an american war with iraq while the anger has usually been focused on the united states and israel , it has also strained relations with the country s christian majority last november , after a number of protests against american bombing in afghanistan , a mob surrounded and stoned the mombasa pentecostal church , shattering windows and the 30foothigh glass cross imbedded in the church facade in the same period , battles between predominantly muslim and christian tribes , ostensibly over land rights , led to dozens of deaths in the nearby tanariva region relations have since improved , but christian leaders here say the attacks on thursday seemed to confirm their fears about the extremist views of some local muslims the christian leaders described those muslims as quite conscious of their small numbers , and quick to take offense getting along with the muslim community is not easy , not easy at all , said the rev john kamau of the holy ghost catholic church in mombasa i think here the muslims have something of an inferiority complex they are very sensitive about their religion they feel that they must constantly be affirming its superiority in the mosques , muslim prayer leaders complain that they have been the victims of official discrimination by the christiandominated governments that have led kenya since its independence in 1963 several muslim leaders charge that top government appointments have been almost exclusively reserved for christians , particularly under the 24yearlong rule of president daniel arap moi the muslim leaders said , for instance , that none of the area s seven district commissioners , who serve by appointment from nairobi , is a muslim muslims have never enjoyed the same rights as christians do in this country , said sheik ali shee , a mombasa prayer leader known for his fiery sermons local sources said sheik shee was among those questioned by the police about possible knowledge of the attacks on thursday in an interview , sheik shee denied an oftheard charge here that he had praised the attacks on the israelis and described the accusations as propaganda being spread by the israeli and american governments they are the enemies of islam , he said i have been fighting for the rights of muslims , and therefore i am not popular yet for all the current turmoil , mombasa gives off a mostly tolerant air in the narrow streets of city s old town , muslim and christian shop owners work side by side much of the city s laidback attitude is owed , residents say , to its history as a port city , open to many cultures the skyline in mombasa is traced not just by churches and mosques but by hindu temples and a giant structure named fort jesus , built by the portuguese in the 16th century the muslims are said by locals here to have arrived here as early as the eighth century , and kenya s coast has absorbed waves of arab immigration from yemen and oman intermarriage , while not especially common , is not unheard of a local shopkeeper named muhammad ali explained that he had no problem with his own wife s being a christian , and in fact considered the matter so unremarkable that he claimed never to have asked which church she belonged to we africans have our own culture , he said , no matter what religion we are even as they try to apprehend those behind last week s attacks , the kenyan authorities have said they want to do so without frightening local muslims this is not a witch hunt , katana ngala , kenya s minister for lands and settlement , said at a memorial service today for the victims of the attacks also at the memorial service was muhammad sheik achen , a local muslim who had come to mourn he said he was afraid that the attacks would besmirch the reputation of his faith our religion does not allow this , he said it s bad for islam photo two men who are members of kenya s muslim minority looked out on the indian ocean port of the old town of mombasa \( francesco broli for the new york times \)
an administration staffed with aggressive corporate executives might normally be expected to embrace cuttingedge solutions to the country s energy problems especially when those solutions are accessible and affordable yet such is the bush administration s ideological suspicion of anything resembling topdown government that it recoils from using timely federal regulation to encourage technological advance the obvious example has been its reluctance to pressure detroit for more fuelefficient vehicles a more recent example is its decision last week to roll back clintonera energy efficiency standards for airconditioners seven states have sued to reverse the decision , and one of them , california , is seeking to impose its own , stricter standards that is a course that new york s governor , george pataki , should consider at the end of his term , after six years of consultation , president bill clinton approved a regulation requiring a 30 percent efficiency increase for central airconditioners \( not the window units most new yorkers are familiar with \) the bush administration put the rule on hold and then last week imposed its own , lesser standard of a 20 percent increase that s more of a difference than it seems , economically and environmentally by 2020 , the lower standard could cost consumers an extra 1 billion a year to run their airconditioners it could also result in extra greenhouse gas emissions , equivalent to the annual output of 17 million cars most manufacturers have the ability to produce the more efficient units but except for the secondlargest maker , goodman manufacturing , none of the big companies wanted to proceed with the clinton rule they argued , and the bush administration agreed , that the clinton standard would make airconditioners too expensive for lowincome families and discourage others from replacing older systems in actual fact , the upfront cost difference between the 20 and 30 percent standards is about 100 per unit an amount that could be recovered through electricity savings in three to five years many states had hoped that congress would come to their rescue by mandating the 30 percent increase but a provision requiring such an increase lost narrowly in the senate california has thus decided to proceed on its own to the higher standard , which will require a federal waiver attorneys general in a halfdozen other states , including new york s eliot spitzer , have chosen to sue on grounds that federal law prevents government from rolling back existing standards we hope they prevail in some parts of the country , airconditioners of all kinds account for nearly onethird of the electricity consumed during peak demand periods the highest possible standards are clearly in order
oak park , ill , jan 28 when the leathery old body of gregorio fuentes , ernest hemingway s fishing companion and confidant , finally gave out earlier this month in cuba , the sadness spread back here to the chicago suburb where hemingway was born and raised there was the sense of an era ending , a door closing hemingway s youngest sister survives , as does one of his sons , but few others now alive can claim to have known him well the necrology is kind of ominous , with two of his sons passing away in the last year or so and now gregorio , said scott donaldson , president of the hemingway society it reminds you of how far back in time he was he s been dead for more than 40 years now hemingway always admired and often wrote about men like gregorio fuentes , whom he found wise , courageous , close to nature and blessed with innate nobility during the years that hemingway spent in cuba , when he evolved from a gifted writer into a mythshrouded giant who dominated and defined a generation , he spent many afternoons on his boat in the company of fuentes but even in recent years , when he was much sought after by tourists , fuentes kept his employer s secrets he liked to tell stories , but he was also pretty circumspect , said scott schwar , executive director of the hemingway foundation here , who met fuentes several times during the last years of his life he never really got into gossiping , although he certainly would have been able to hemingway and fuentes were bound together by a passion for fishing the open sea formed the backdrop for a great literary career and for the enduring hemingway legend , a legend that some scholars now say is nonsense fuentes was a born seaman who rode out four hurricanes , swam through sharkinfested waters to rescue a drowning man and could feel in his bones precisely where the biggest marlin , sailfish and tarpon would be running , or so hemingway asserted in a 1949 article , hemingway said that his own role on their boat was to hook the prey and then gradually work him closer and closer and then in to where gregorio can gaff him , club him and take him onboard fuentes was born in the canary islands sometime between 1897 and 1899 there are different accounts of how he met hemingway , one having to do with a storm in the gulf of mexico from which the two men found shelter together in any case they struck up an acquaintance , and around the time hemingway settled in cuba in 1939 , he hired fuentes as his boatman i know that he would rather keep a ship clean and paint and varnish than he would fish , hemingway once wrote but i know too that he would rather fish than eat or sleep the boat on which the two spent countless hours , the pilar , was 34 feet long , made of american black oak and had a cruising range of 500 miles hemingway paid the wheeler shipyard in brooklyn 7 , 500 for her in 1934 , 3 , 000 of which was advanced by arnold gingrich , editor of esquire , as payment for future articles the writer and actor george plimpton had less than happy memories of one fishing expedition on the pilar we were out all day and did n't catch anything except a barracuda , he recalled it cut somebody s hand i forget who and it was a real mess , blood all over the hold much serious fishing was done aboard the pilar , and much else as well jeffrey meyers , a hemingway biographer , recently described it as kind of a floating whorehouse and rum factory as well as a fishing boat fuentes never said anything like that , but he did offer a few glimpses of hemingway s drinking habits he had inclusive tastes but favored gordon s gin above all whenever possible he drank only from freshly opened bottles on many of their trips , fuentes told stories that he had heard in seaside towns around the caribbean , and some of them may have worked their way into hemingway s fiction he claimed to have been a model for the weatherbeaten fisherman in the old man and the sea , a claim that some biographers say is at least partly true the old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck , hemingway wrote of his fisherman , words that could easily have described fuentes the blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deepcreased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords but none of these scars were fresh they were as old as erosions in a fishless desert during most of the 20 years when cuba was his home longer than he lived anywhere else hemingway presided over a hilltop estate called finca vig a , where hummingbirds flitted among the mango trees he rose early and spent mornings at work , standing at his typewriter wearing a favorite pair of oversized moccasins for lunch he would sometimes visit la terraza in nearby coj mar , where his boat was moored , or drive to havana , a few miles away , to visit one of his two favorite bars , the floridita or the bodeguita del medio nights were for reading or entertaining as often as possible hemingway broke away from his work to answer the call of the sea , which meant the call of fuentes and the pilar
some things never go away there are events that cast shadows so enduring they defy the laws of nature new york has an implacable ghost like that , called attica it is the name of a town and a prison 30 miles east of buffalo but it is also shorthand for rivers of blood , spilled at the prison 31 years ago and yet to be cleansed by now , you ca n't help but wonder if they will ever be cleansed attica was back in the public eye this week state hearings were held near rochester to let former prison guards and their families retell the worst episode of their lives and its long aftermath what they want , they said , is for new york state to finally step up to the plate and treat them with the dignity they believe has been denied them for three decades i cannot tell you all the hurt that we 've felt over how this has been handled , said ann valone , whose husband , carl , was an attica guard who was shot to death deanne quinn miller understands completely her father , william quinn , was the first attica casualty she was 5 years old then the state has not done right by the families , ms quinn miller said in a telephone interview i think it s so obvious i do n't know why it s not obvious to more people so much time has passed that some background is essential just bear in mind that attica , with 43 dead , was the bloodiest single clash between americans in a century on sept 9 , 1971 , attica prisoners rioted , seizing control of an exercise yard and taking guards as hostages william quinn was clubbed to death carl valone became one of several dozen hostages what began as a riot turned into a fullthroated insurrection lasting four days some inmate demands reflected the overthetop radical oratory of the times but other issues overcrowded cells , bad food , poor medical care and rigid censorship were deemed legitimate even by state correction officials for sure , saints were in short supply among the inmates during the siege , three of them died in grudge killings the need for the authorities to reassert control was clear but how they did so became the issue on sept 13 , state troopers led the way into the occupied yard with guns blazing , firing indiscriminately when the smoke cleared , 39 people had been killed 29 prisoners and 10 hostages it was , in the words of a disillusioned state prosecutor named malcolm bell , a turkey shoot once the prison was retaken , troopers and guards brutalized the inmates , clubbing them and forcing them to crawl naked over broken glass one man had a screwdriver shoved repeatedly into his rectum as if all that were not enough , officials tried to bury the truth they said the inmates had killed the hostages , slitting their throats as autopsies soon showed , it was a flatout lie troopers killed everyone that day , in the name of the state that lie has reverberated across the decades it established mistrust , and it fed a belief , shared by inmates and guards , that the state was not about to accept responsibility for its actions criminal cases and lawsuits dragged through the courts at last , two years ago , about 500 former inmates and their relatives reached a 12 million settlement with the state 8 million for them , the rest for lawyers naturally , former guards and families of the dead hostages had a question what about us \? mrs valone s situation was typical she got a oneshot payment of about 27 , 000 , three times her husband s annual salary over the years , she also received 120 in workers' compensation every other week what she did not realize almost none of the families did was that she had forfeited her right to bring a wrongfuldeath suit against the state bills to improve the compensation have been proposed in albany , only to be rebuffed as too little , too late now the families have formed a group called the forgotten victims of attica they seek 30 million or more in reparations , a figure that seems improbable , given the history there are other demands , the main one calling for an official apology that , too , may be a tall order the hearings this week gave them a chance to tell their stories to a panel that will report to the governor all signs suggest he is well aware that these are angry people who feel they put their faith in the state , only to be clobbered they just do n't get it , ms quinn miller said of state officials at this point , you do n't even have to pay me anything just say you 're sorry
hello \? alexander graham bell did not invent the telephone \? well , according to assemblyman gary guear , a democrat from mercer county , that is the case in fact , mr guear sponsored a resolution , approved last month , that recognizes antonio meucci , an italian who immigrated to new york , as the talking telegraph s true inventor decades before bell received his patent in 1849 though most historians attribute the invention to bell , a movement is under way to recognize mr meucci proponents say the florentine was discriminated against because of his limited english and his inability to come up with the patent fees mr guear said that based on 10 minutes of research on the internet , he was confident that the telephone was the brainchild of mr meucci but he did not sound so confident when pressed meucci was instrumental in the invention of the telephone , said mr guear , who modeled his resolution after one passed by the house in june for their part , two greatgrandsons of bell are having nothing of mr guear s endeavor there were dozens of others who helped in inventing the telephone , but none of them produced what bell did , and nobody patented it before him , said one of them , hugh muller , 70 , who lives outside ottawa at the time bell was trying to get a patent for his own telephone in 1876 , the luckless mr meucci was denied a hearing on the ground that his records had been lost , according to the united states patent office the resolution brings to light just another italianamerican who played a significant role , said mr guear , whom some accused of political pandering and wasting valuable legislative time mr muller was not prepared to have any of it , however we were somewhat offended by the legislation and the way they presented it , he said it s not necessary to besmirch someone s good name that s just pretty shabby politics bell s other greatgrandson , grosvenor blair , 74 , who divides his time between bernardsville and nova scotia , also dismissed the resolution i'm just flabbergasted that new jersey would do such a dumb thing , mr blair said the house of representatives is another matter samantha jane cooper photo did antonio meucci beat alexander graham bell to the phone \? \( garibaldimeucci museum \)
wavemaker ii by marybeth hughes 202 pp new york atlantic monthly press 23 marybeth hughes s first novel takes place over the course of about two months' time , from memorial day until aug 1 , 1964 the marshals looked like ordinary men , it begins they were not in good shape , they did not have wary eyes their man was not handcuffed to either of them , and when the steak was served they ate with appetite during dinner , the lawmen also , it turns out , drink the beer they are offered and afterward the scotch they eat corn on the cob in a yard full of old trees holly , sycamore , oak , pine from where the marshals sit , they can look down the long slope of the yard to a channel deep enough for pleasure boats to come back and forth and dock in the slips all the houses in the neighborhood have such a slip at this one is a boston whaler hughes is a writer of dexterity and imagination , with a great feel for sensory images the opening scenes in wavemaker ii do a swift job of describing an entire eastern seaboard setting where privilege and money seem to be meeting a case of whitecollar crime they also provide an effective introduction to the novel s cool narrative tone , establishing hughes s penchant for the airy , noncommittal listing of minute details , a technique that slyly challenges her readers' assumptions in this way , she guides us into a skillfully charted plot about the complex nature of loyalty , letting the story s point of view float from one character to the next since the marshals' perceptions lead off , we see the al fresco party from a detached if slightly ironic perspective the lawmen are in some ways in charge , yet , culturally and socially , it is clear that they are at a definite disadvantage their hostess , kay clemens , 30ish , blond and beautiful , has the selfassurance of the born rich wearing a chinese silk jacket with frog closures that allow for an occasional glimpse of her lacy bra , she graciously serves the marshals their scotch her husband , will , turns out to be the man who is not wearing handcuffs he is on a brief visit home from prison , having been convicted of an asyetunspecified offense while their two children , bo , who is in first grade , and his 9yearold sister , loulou , play in the grass , will and kay are allowed to slip inside the house , but they are soon interrupted by shouts and footsteps bo , it becomes clear , is desperately ill an ambulance is called and kay rushes out to ride with her son to the hospital the marshals drive will there as well , not realizing that their charge has fortified himself with pills from his son s huge supply almost forgotten , loulou goes home with the neighbors the emergency , it appears , is not entirely unexpected all of this has happened before the narrative then shifts abruptly , as it will throughout the book , to a luxurious new york apartment overlooking the metropolitan museum of art another gathering is in progress , this one presided over by a lawyer named roy , who stands next to a reproduction of rodin s hand of god , looking through a telescope big enough to spot pluto and musing on various people in his life , mostly women , including his mother , muddy cohn and so , abruptly , the beans are spilled , even if the reader has paid no attention to the dust jacket of wavemaker ii the roy of this novel is not just any roy but joe mccarthy s chief counsel , the red hunter who helped send the rosenbergs to the electric chair that roy cohn hughes imagines him touching the reproduction rodin , demanding the attention of his guests and telling them a storybook tale about a romance between a beautiful rich girl and her devoted but penniless suitor , explaining how the two fall in love and get married how after the honeymoon in bermuda , will clemens is introduced by kay s father to roy cohn the young couple have what cohn calls the perfect setup two kids , girl , boy , a house on the water , everyone s happy then the boy gets sick a kind of sick we barely know about that s when a representative of the united states attorney s office approaches will and asks him to testify against cohn despite his family obligations , will refuses roy suggests \( with only a couple of dramatic embellishments \) that this is simply because will is too decent to lie in retaliation , will is locked up in federal prison roy s audience is highpowered and well connected , and , sure enough , his version of the story appears in the next morning s newspapers in a matter of hours , the privacy of the clemens family has been shattered and the story they 've been hiding behind will is away on business , bo is in the hospital being tested for various allergies has been replaced by something painfully public from here , the novel shifts back and forth , tracking the family as it s tugged in and out of the spotlight we hear will s thoughts in prison as he reconstructs his hearing \( roy was n't there no need , he said , this is just routine , a little hassling from our friends \) we see kay negotiating with cohn s office for money and a hotel room , dealing with her own exhaustion \( and her sexual needs \) as well as the grim procedures her son must endure chemotherapy , a spinal tap , torturous examinations we glimpse will s mother when she visits from the bluecollar suburbs , share her feelings of helplessness and despair we even watch bo in the activity room of the hospital s pediatric clinic , letting herman , the experimental rat , out of his cage at least one of them , bo thinks , should be allowed to escape invoking the compassion that most of the book fends off , loulou s chapters are the scariest and most painful to read a chubby , unpopular girl , she is miserable and lonely , desperate for attention of almost any kind in other words , headed for serious trouble we also hear often from roy cohn , as well as from kay s neighbor , gert like joan didion , hughes keeps her distance , allowing her characters' thoughts to reveal the past and move the story forward , minus authorial judgment how much do we need to know about roy cohn in order to truly get what hughes is up to \? the book takes place at a time when the mood of the country has changed and cohn s patron , senator joseph mccarthy , has been dead for seven years it was during this period that roy cohn the actual one claimed that robert kennedy and robert morgenthau were conducting a personal vendetta against him , charging him with bribery , fraud , conspiracy and corporate manipulation there are many plot twists and turns in wavemaker ii , as well as characters who drop in for a chat and then like the marshals are never heard from again cohn , of course , fascinates , and hughes gives him a chance to show his better side he emerges as a man of impetuous if inconsistent devotion to his friends , thuggishly blunt in his methods above all , he is sentimental , even sometimes sanctimonious he loves the flag he loves america and motherhood he wants the government to look after sick children none of this sloppy highmindedness cleans his slate nor is it meant to but it does reveal his weaknesses and vulnerability we know that roy cohn will later die of aids , and hughes drops hints about his sexual inclinations in her depiction , he becomes as human as he is controversial the book concludes with far less damage to the clemens family than might be expected and we leave them with loulou safely perched on the bow of wavemaker ii \( cohn s pleasure boat and an unfortunate if apt choice for a

the conquerors roosevelt , truman and the destruction of hitler s germany , 19411945 by michael beschloss illustrated 377 pp new york simon schuster 2695 when the battered german armies trapped in stalingrad finally surrendered in january 1943 , it became clear that the allies russia , britain and america were certain to win world war ii but then what \? how would the victors root out fascism , end the cycle of german wars and secure the peace \? to these questions president franklin d roosevelt had no ready answers , and it was not in his character to gnaw at problems in a methodical way rather he would wait until inspiration came to him from wherever it is that ideas hatch in the meantime his policy was evasion so , rather than confront america s allies over war aims immediately , roosevelt instead persuaded his friend winston churchill to join him in a pledge to fight on until germany s unconditional surrender these words were the principal fruit of the 10day meeting of churchill and roosevelt at casablanca in january 1943 , and they predictably failed to satisfy stalin , who wanted the democracies to open a second front on the mainland of occupied europe stalin s objection was echoed everywhere would n't the demand only make the germans fight harder \? but once uttered , unconditional surrender was carved in granite , and behind its bulk roosevelt took shelter for the next two years time enough to decide what to do with germany when the war had been won roosevelt was never more himself than at casablanca his inspiration caught churchill by surprise , but he went along , and the two men never wavered thereafter no deals would be made with nazi germany it is roosevelt brilliant , charming , unpredictable and dying who dominates michael beschloss s vigorously written history of postwar planning beschloss says he began the conquerors a decade ago , set it aside and returned to it when new archives opened up the delay gives the book additional impact it arrives at a moment when americans are again confronting a tangled question of war and peace how to remove a dangerous enemy from iraq and build in its place what never existed there before , a stable democracy posing no threat to its neighbors the problem strikes many observers as insoluble , but it is no more daunting than the one facing roosevelt 60 years ago only half the challenge was germany s history of militarism just as difficult were his quarreling advisers ordinary americans thought of roosevelt as a rock , serene and confident , but he was a cipher to the men who worked with him none ever knew his deepest plans , or what he told anybody else or when the presidential back would turn and they would be asked to step down beschloss is the author of half a dozen works of history with a special focus on how american presidents run the government and make decisions , and along the way he has learned to write with ease , confidence and a lively sense of character and scene the conquerors is built almost entirely around the conversations of high american officials trying to decide what to do with germany two broad general ideas were on the table a plan by roosevelt s old friend and secretary of the treasury , henry morgenthau , to break germany up into several small , pastoral states of yeoman farmers and a more conventional proposal to get germany quickly back onto its feet as a bulwark against the territorial appetite of a victorious soviet union the son of a rich businessman , morgenthau fled the world of commerce for life as a gentleman farmer in upstate new york , where one of his neighbors was the future president they became friends , morgenthau worked hard in roosevelt s political campaigns , and in 1933 roosevelt surprised the world by naming him to run the treasury department morgenthau was the only jew in roosevelt s cabinet , or among the president s friends , and his tenure was unremarkable until the man who had celebrated his marriage , rabbi stephen wise , brought him vivid reports , freshly arrived from switzerland in the summer of 1942 , of the nazi campaign that would come to be known as the holocaust the killing of jews was no secret to governments or international organizations , but despite widespread knowledge of the basic facts few officials or religious leaders or even private citizens grasped that a radical new form of evil had entered the world morgenthau had little success in pressing the government to do something about it even a proposal to bomb the rail lines carrying trainloads of jews to auschwitz was rejected as a distraction from the war effort failing to halt or even slow the horror , he determined to ensure it would never happen again , and that , in his view , meant ending germany s power to make war once and for all to aides he described a germany stripped of its industry as something like the usedup areas of nevada deserts where only ghost towns , rusting machinery and abandoned mines remain
homeland security is about to come closer to home for residents in western connecticut maj gen william a cugno , adjutant general of the state military department , is honing plans to expand the army national guard presence at fairfield hills in newtown with the formation of a military canine unit , new training and administrative facilities and a recruiting center the dogs and their handlers will be available for deployment anywhere in the world to respond to terrorist acts and will also protect the region , general cugno said the dogs will be trained to detect explosives and drugs and perform searchandrescue operations the unit will accommodate six dogs to start with an 18dog capacity with 2 million in federal funding , general cugno plans to renovate a halfdozen dilapidated buildings at fairfield hills , the former connecticut psychiatric hospital that closed in 1995 he plans to use the former storehouse , at the foot of trades lane , for an armory , which will be used to train guardsmen , not to store weapons , he said the former machine shop will be converted into administrative offices the former piggery , on seven acres of state agriculture department land , deeded for animal and agricultural use , will become a military working dog unit the training facilities may contain a chemical decontamination unit to prepare guardsmen to respond to a chemical or biological attack , general cugno said but , he added , no chemicals will be stored anywhere at fairfield hills the guardsmen in this unit will be specialists in clean up and rapid response if , god forbid , there were ever an event of chemical warfare , general cugno said if an adversary used chemical weapons against us in a war environment , the soldiers would know how to detect and minimize the effects , based on knowledge and training in decontamination another building will become an indoor training center for the second company governor s horse guard , military dogs and soldiers the second company , already headquartered in the former hospital dairy barn , occupies 65 adjacent acres the former slaughterhouse will be used as a feeding and comfort station for soldiers general cugno is the only adjutant general in the country who commands two cavalry militias , the first company governor s horse guard in avon plus the second company in newtown we are fortunate to have such a facility , colocated with the horse guard , and sandwiched between new york and boston , general cugno said it will be an asset to other law enforcement agencies , to the governor , and to the region , in the war against terrorism it will contribute to the local economy with the creation of six fulltime jobs it also will be the first defense department military canine unit under national guard command , general cugno said the united states military department s main dog facility has its headquarters at lackland air force base in texas dog units also are located at military bases across the country , but none is under the reserves , he said plans for a heightened national guard presence at fairfield hills have been under way for more than a year , but have grown in importance based on lessons we learned sept 11 , general cugno said he intends to maintain the farm ambience and to preserve the original design elements in buildings he converts to military use , including the piggery s gambrel roof this man is a mover , said julia wasserman , a state representative who represents newtown he has done nothing but good things at fairfield hills the canine unit will be far enough away from habitation that i do n't envision any problems whatever he does here , he does with precision and good judgment it s all positive and good for the town and the state fairfield hills state hospital opened in 1932 on 800 acres and housed more than 3 , 000 patients during the 1950 s designed to resemble a college campus rather than an institution , the hospital included a fullyworking farm that supplied food to patients and staff representative wasserman has been actively negotiating with the state for redevelopment since 1992 ms wasserman initiated legislation that deeded 300 acres to the state department of agriculture in perpetuity two years ago , ms wasserman secured 650 , 000 in state funding to refurbish the horse guard facilities , when general cugno first took over during the 1980 s , the state allocated 120 acres to the department of correction for the ward a garner correctional institution , a high security prison , which opened in 1992 , over the protests of residents and town leaders who did not want it in newtown the objections have receded , as the town annually collects more than 1 million in payment in lieu of taxes from the state ms wasserman objected when the doc wanted to convert one of the hospital buildings into an arsenal to store weapons , but said she supports the general s plans to build an armory for training newtown has a 39 million contract with the state to purchase 186 acres and the buildings on the main campus ms wasserman also has negotiated the transfer of almost 200 additional acres to newtown , for a total of about 370 acres under town control the state still controls more than 400 acres
when president bush declared on monday that the nation was waking up with a hangover after the economic boom of the last decade , he could not have known how much more pain was on the way by week s end the stock market had plunged a further 7 percent , reaching lows it had not seen since 1998 one of the week s biggest losers was aol time warner , a company whose stock has been in virtual free fall all year in an attempt to turn around its own flagging fortunes , aol time warner announced a major management shakeup , designed to take the company in a new direction and undo the damage of a merger that now stands as one of the biggest blunders in corporate history of all the giddy corporate moves of the 1990 s , none now look more wrongheaded than time warner s decision to sell itself to aol in a deal that put a higher value on the nowstruggling internet service than on time warner s vast stable of bluechip media properties after years of fumbling to come up with an online strategy , time warner decided to thrust itself into the new economy by combining with aol unfortunately for time warner shareholders , the ceo , gerald levin , chose precisely the wrong time to make his move with aol stock near its peak , he accepted a deal in which his shareholders were given just 45 percent of the combined company , even though time warner s divisions produced some 80 percent of the revenues the credo of the combined aol time warner was synergy , the idea that the companies would be greater than the sum of their parts because each of the divisions would help market the others but the dream never materialized the fastgrowing aol online service was supposed to be the juggernaut that would cause the whole company to grow at 30 percent a year it turned out that aol was unable to sustain its own growth rate , much less carry time warner aol time warner has taken a beating since the two companies combined the stock has plummeted in january management was forced to announce a 54 billion good will writedown , a stunning admission of just how bad things had gotten to turn things around , stephen case , the company chairman , and richard parsons , the newly installed ceo , will need to win back the trust of wall street with this week s personnel changes , mr parsons who himself came from time warner forcefully reasserted the dominance of time warner culture within the merged companies he accepted the resignation of the chief operating officer , robert pittman , who came from the aol side , and divided mr pittman s job between don logan , head of the time inc magazine division , and jeff bewkes , chairman of hbo tellingly , the aol online division will now report to mr logan , who has spent his career in print and once said the internet gave new meaning to the term 'black hole' mr logan and mr bewkes are expected to decentralize operations and emphasize strong media content shareholders may welcome the new direction still , two new appointments do not make a turnaround mr parsons has yet to enunciate a clear vision of where he wants to take aol time warner before anyone gets too excited about the restoration of time warner culture , it is worth remembering that it was time warner management that blundered into the aol deal in the first place

among the homemade signs exhibited by fans at some of the ballparks recently in which the majorleague players threatened to strike , the one in pnc park in pittsburgh , where the pirates play , was particularly eyecatching play 4 the love of the game this is part of the fairy tale that some fans like to believe that players ought to play simply for the love of the game the fact is , they are professionals , and from the time professional baseball began , in 1869 , with the red stockings of cincinnati , the most accomplished baseball players played for money that is literally the name of the game it is axiomatic , however , that if you do n't love something to begin with , you are not going to work to the degree it takes to excel , unless you are on a chain gang some fans simply leave their sense of reality behind when they go to a ballpark , giving little truck to the notion that these players are wageearners , breadwinners , adults want simply love of the sport \? go to a high school game what these fans project to a great extent is jealousy i got into a conversation the other day with a guy who sold stationery for a living he resented the players why \? they make too much money , he said what s too much \? i asked they make more in one time at bat than i do in a week would you trade places with them \? absolutely and if someone told you you were making too much money , what would you tell them \? i 'd tell 'em it was none of their damn business but some fans believe they have a proprietary interest in the players' business it is their toy and if there is a threat that it may be taken from them , for however long , they grow petulant after all , the players should be happy with whatever they get , forget that this is america and we are living in a freemarket system , the same system that they live in but fans never seem to resent the money that owners make no one hangs a sign for george steinbrenner own 4 the love of the game ballplayers are businessmen like steinbrenner and murdoch of the dodgers and eisner of the angels and whoever is running the aolbraves and the tribunecubs , etc i love it when some fans said that if the greedy players struck that they would n't come back to baseball anymore why not \? if you enjoy going out to a game on a nice summer s evening with your family and friends , and watching skilled athletes ply their craft in dramatic fashion , who are you hurting by staying away \? what is this thing called revenge \? what is this thing called shooting yourself in the foot \? some fans are also suckers for the owners' whinings the owners have the audacity to badmouth their product , which takes the form of players and then they want fans to continue to love and cherish and idolize the players and come out to the ballpark that s a terrific method of advertising the game it was like steinbrenner a few years ago trying to strongarm new york city to build him a new ballpark in manhattan and him saying that the bronx is such a dangerous place people are afraid to come to yankee stadium so many did n't his threats died down , he built a strong team , and the yankees are setting attendance records in of all places , the bronx incredible about 30 years ago , the fare in new york city taxicabs went up a little a guy i knew was appalled never taking another taxi , he said at the first drop of rain , he was running around trying to hail a cab some fans say , the ballplayers are making so much money and it s terrible because school teachers and garbage collectors and firemen and policemen do n't make anywhere near as much and they are more deserving because they teach and protect and maintain sanitation , if not sanity \( maybe psychiatrists are underpaid in this regard , too \) this nation obviously puts a greater premium on entertainment than we do on almost anything else but you never hear a complaint that tom cruise , for example , is making 20 million for a film and it s disgraceful and cruise has it made in comparison to a ballplayer he never has to deal with a fastball under his chin , or a runner barreling in to break up a double play all he has to do is memorize some lines and kiss beautiful women most fans played baseball as children some still see it as a children s game and except for some excuse or other , they 'd be in uniform out there i grew up in chicago with a fellow named jimmy nelson he was an outstanding high school player and a shortstop at northwestern , batting 333 in the big ten in 1961 jimmy signed with the twins , but never made it past class aa \( like michael jordan \) i asked jimmy what happened you ca n't imagine how good a majorleague player is , he said , even the last guy on the bench is a great ballplayer i generally respect the professional ballplayer , respect his skills and determination and , necessarily , his passion i respect what it took for him to reach the heights he has i root for him if i like him as a player , not for how much money he earns or thinks he ought to earn from where i sit , it s the tooth fairy that does it solely for the love of the game photo fans expressed their views at wrigley field on friday some fans believe they have a proprietary interest in how much the players earn \( reuters \)
does experimental dance have to be intimidating \? not according to headlong dance theater of philadelphia , which likes to lace its cerebral offerings with sly humor in subirdia , the troupe s latest piece , the culture of birds is mirrored in 1960 s suburban america , complete with miniature houses and white picket fences the dance portrays the antics of a single woman and two couples , with the men fighting over yards and swapping wives we think of birds as being monogamous , but there s a lot more partnerswitching than you realize , said amy smith , a director of the company the concept of the home is also important birds will fly 2 , 000 miles to south america for the winter , then come back and nest in the very same tree they were in the year before headlong is clearly not your typical dance company directed by david brick , andrew simonet and ms smith , all wesleyan graduates , the troupe performs from april 4 through april 7 as part of the dance theater workshop s around town spring season at the duke on 42nd street the three works on the program are quite different , but all are in keeping with the troupe s motto that intelligent experimentation can be compelling and , in some cases , hilarious for such a dance , st r w rs , an enchanting homage to the george lucas film , the company won a 1999 new york dance and performance award , or bessie when headlong creates a dance , one of the directors oversees it but all three are deeply involved in the creative process in subirdia , the most lighthearted work on the program , the job fell to ms smith , 30 , whose father , macklin smith , is a nationally known birdwatcher with the help of 50 s and 60 s cocktail music by martin denny bird calls and all ms smith brings a swinging lawn party to life the piece is more than simply funny all of the characters in it seek escape , notably heather murphy , who as the single woman is an outcast envied by the wives and lusted over by the husbands she finds solace after she is visited by a mysterious astronaut , with whom she performs an ethereal pas de deux right out of swan lake i basically stole the choreography and altered it , ms smith said in the ballet , the man and woman rarely face each other even though it s romantic that was one of the things i liked about it when the spaceman actually appears , they share a magical floating moment it s enchanting the two remaining dances on the program represent the past and future of the company one , impossible dance , a trio , features improvisation while the dancers talk to each other the second , gracelessness , a quintet set to music by rick henderson , depicts desolation and loss but as the directors delve into more serious material , it is apparent that their intrinsic theatricality will render their work just as entertaining gracelessness has none of the frivolity of subirdia , but is just as smart directed by mr brick \( mr simonet , 32 , is in it \) , the haunting work began as a formal exploration of contact improvisation there are some pretty weird images , mr brick said people end up in odd body positions with their heads in each other s crotches mr brick , 34 , uses that awkwardness as a point of departure he was also inspired by pieter bruegel s drawings , particularly the grotesque big fish eat little fish , in which a giant fish is split open to reveal dozens more dancers disappear only to reemerge among a tangle of body parts eventually , mr simonet and nichole canuso separate from the group and , as a further test of where contact improvisation can go , mr simonet becomes blind in the last third of the work by shutting his eyes in keeping with headlong s talking tradition , mr simonet is guided by ms canuso s voice it feels like a wild roller coaster ride , mr simonet said i physicalize the experience of trust this work is more vulnerable it s easy for us to get by on cleverness , but this feels risky headlong may be moving toward more rigorously experimental territory , but it is doubtful that the company s basic mission will change i do think , 'is this going to be just like one of those bad , arty experiences that alienates the audience \? ' mr brick asked in mock horror but are we so selfserious \? i feel we 've developed so many skills as collaborators , and real ideas about what dance means and we really do care about if the audience gets it headlong dance theater the duke on 42nd street , times square , april 4 through april 7 photo andrew simonet , david brick , christy lee and nichole canuso of headlong dance theater performing subirdia in philadelphia in january \( cylla von tiedemann \)
peter olson , the chairman of the random house division of the media company bertelsmann , once accepted a challenge to a shotdrinking contest from a young executive new to bertelsmann colleagues discreetly filled mr olson s glasses with water , and he drank the young man under the table asked about the story last week , mr olson responded , i do like to win mr olson s competitive instincts have become the subject of much speculation in the book industry as random house , the largest consumer publisher , has carried out a round of cost cuts , including scores of layoffs among editorial , marketing , sales and administrative staff \( random house has not disclosed the exact number \) although last year was by all accounts a poor one for book sales , no other major publisher has cut back so pervasively mr olson has maintained that random house is simply planning prudently for a long spell of dark days ahead , and he is just speaking frankly about it but speculation about his motives among rival publishers , agents , authors and others in the industry has centered on random house s parent company , bertelsmann , its bottomline approach to compensating division heads like mr olson , and its plans for an initial public offering some time in the next few years mr olson s gloomy forecasts have seemed increasingly anomalous in the last few weeks david shanks , chief executive of the secondlargest publisher , the penguin putnam division of pearson , recently told the trade magazine publishers weekly peter olson has been quoted in the press concerning a severe downturn we do n't see that we also have an aggressive budget for next year , he added yesterday , jane friedman , chief executive of the harpercollins division of the news corporation , said everybody took a hit this fall in the adult trade business , but when i see a recovery , which is what i see , i am looking forward to making my aggressive budget and being profitable but last week , mr olson stood by his reasoning he was a lawyer , banker and finance executive for bertelsmann before taking over its north american books division he said that the cutbacks reflected only a hard look at the state of the book market and that his strategy had nothing to do with instructions from bertelsmann s headquarters the layoffs were not influenced in any way by our parent company or its ipo , he said , the cost reduction program that we have now initiated was conceived by us to meet our targets this year and going forward in a changed environment there is no doubt that the environment changed after september 11 he also implied that publishers who claimed to avoid making cutbacks were either insufficiently candid or overly optimistic mr olson began warning as early as last june of an industrywide decrease in book sales we are anticipating tough times , he said we are prepared for a recession that may be very protracted and very difficult if we have been somewhat too harsh in our assessment , we benefit from a lean cost structure i would rather be in a position of having moved too early than too late from 1997 to 2000 , mr olson said , publishers enjoyed unusually good times , partly because the phenomenal growth of online booksellers helped invigorate interest in book buying the ride ended in 2000 as both the economy and the online bookstores stalled the problem set in , mr olson said , when the protracted election distracted book buyers mr olson said the evidence of random house s own best sellers suggested that it was not the only company suffering slow sales in 2000 , random house published 169 books that made the new york times bestseller list in 2001 , it published 203 but each best seller sold fewer copies i can assure you that we did n't have a corresponding increase in sales , he said to adjust to the diminishing prospects , mr olson said , he mandated budget reductions at each division but he said he left the details of the cuts to the president of each group , like doubleday , broadway , the random house trade group or knopf mr olson declined to comment on the depth of the cuts but he did say that twothirds of the savings came from areas other than layoffs or pay cuts , and that fewer than 10 percent of random house s employees lost jobs random house employs about 1 , 300 people in new york and 3 , 000 people around the country , including its sales force several editors at the company estimated the total size of the budget reductions at more than 10 percent some at the company estimated that out of more than 100 editors in random house s many divisions , nearly a dozen lost their jobs not even the most profitable divisions were spared the cuts in some places , the reductions were trivial , like shipping fewer packages overnight and photocopying on both sides of the page editors were also told to cut expenses for lunches with authors or agents , business travel to conferences or meetings with writers , and extra perks for authors like flowers or bottles of wine if you are reducing some of your travel and entertainment that is not going to have the least effect on your author , mr olson said

lawrenceville back in grade school we had the instinctive dignity to know that it was wrong to vote for ourselves no matter how high the office , not for bus monitor , not even for class head of the march of dimes the closest you honorably could come to putting down your own name was to engage in a little honest logrolling you would agree to vote for your best friend if he would vote for you \( obviously math was n't a strong point at that age \) did we ever suspect , even back then , that our friends might doublecross us and vote for themselves \? and if they did , did we wonder what awful future lay in wait for selfvoters \? is it possible that some of them ended up here in new jersey , repeatedly clicking on their own name in the njpoliticscom online poll for the most likely republican candidate for governor three years from now \? the poll takes as its premise the evidence that governor mcgreevey s popularity is slumping and that the race to be the challenger will be intense and it offers a list of 26 names to choose from plus the everpopular none of the above all you have to do is click on the name of your choice , hit vote , and wait for the page at the polling site to open with the results so far our online polls are meant to be for entertainment purposes , since they are surely not scientific , writes wally edge , the fictitious name of the publicityshy genius who is behind njpoliticscom but i'm always amazed how seriously people take them yes , political people in new jersey take wally s web site very seriously , and if there is any way to turn service offered as a lark for politicsbesotted readers into a serious contest , the site s online polls are the way among past results , 63 percent of 1 , 265 votes cast said rudolph w giuliani could beat senator robert g torricelli in this fall s united states senate race , and 72 percent of 4 , 800 votes cast decreed that bret schundler had won the first gubernatorial debate against mr mcgreevey the rest of the electorate probably did not agree , because mr schundler got smushed by mr mcgreevey but now here is mr schundler again , setting a blistering pace in the site s online gubernatorial poll since it went online at 10 am last sunday , mr schundler had \( at last count on wednesday \) collected 12 , 605 votes , vastly more than polls had ever generated in total before , according to the site and there s more robert d prunetti , the mercer county executive and a man not widely known outside republican circles in much of the state , had been birddogging mr schundler s lead for days until falling decisively into second place with 8 , 624 for several days , third place belonged to state senator diane b allen , but her spot was recently taken over by the state party chairman , state senator joseph m kyrillos jr , with 8 , 546 votes ok , who is doing all this voting \? we set the editor tool to prevent people from multiple voting , wally edge explained in an email message but many of our readers have figured out a way around that it s the old clickandreload , and within the new jersey political community , there are hundreds of clickersandreloaders who spent an inordinate amount of time attempting to influence our polls but i'm not complaining , since it means added traffic for this web site ! the tipoff , the message continues , is that more votes come in than there are users logged on to the site some hopeful pols send out emails directives ordering staff members to get on clickandreload duty so in the interests of science , your reporter voted for none of the above 20 times and determined that , even with a highspeed cable modem , it took an average of 20 seconds to vote once and reload that means that mr schundler s supporters spent the equivalent of 4 , 146 hours , or 172 days at running up his vote tally i saw it two days ago , mr schundler said on wednesday i did vote for myself , once i did n't call anyone else , but obviously it was nice to see diane allen said she did n't know about the poll until a sergeantatarms showed her a printout , with her then in first place , on the senate floor i voted for myself , she said , but no , i did not tell anyone else to mr prunetti also denied cooking the tally until you called , i did n't even know this thing was going on , he insisted some of the people i work with said they 'd seen it , though i asked them , 'well , did you at least vote for me \?

it s the sorry season pun intended all sorts of prominent people are busy apologizing for their mistakes many more could be doing the same , and maybe will some day if they get in enough trouble public apologies , it would seem , come only when all else fails the sorriest public official around is , of course , trent lott , the republican senate leader who said that the nation would have been better off if strom thurmond had been elected president when he ran as a segregationist in 1948 mr lott talked himself into so much trouble that he has had to try to talk himself out of it and may have set a new record time and time again in the past week this past week was also when cardinal bernard f law resigned as archbishop of boston after months of criticism for his handling of sex abuse claims against priests henry a kissinger also resigned as chairman of the new commission investigating the sept 11 attacks , saying he felt he had to step down if continuing to serve meant he would have to disclose his business clients cardinal law apologized mr kissinger did not apologize for failing to recognize before he accepted the appointment that he would have to reveal his client list no apologies from him none either from pete rose , who would have to admit to many instances of wrongdoing , including betting on baseball , to be considered eligible for the hall of fame or from republican senators who carefully waited to object to mr lott s remarks until president bush led the way with a strongly critical statement or , for that matter , from democratic senators who gave their fellow democrat , robert g torricelli , a pass for ethical lapses earlier this year , until he looked as if he would lose them their committee chairmanships they found their voices when mr torricelli of new jersey dropped out of his reelection race in october , when his ethical problems looked as though they 'd cost him his reelection to the senate endangering the democratic majority in the senate which democrats lost anyway in the city , the public has gotten no apologies from those corrupt judges in brooklyn who dared to sit in judgment of others , or from the politicians who got them their jobs nor has the public gotten any apologies for the inconvenience and tension caused by the threat of a transit strike the city has been on edge for weeks , the public discourse even got overheated when roger toussaint , the president of the transit union local , told the mayor to shut up when will he say he s sorry \? nor has he or anyone else apologized for bringing the city which has been through more than enough trauma to the brink the union need not have insisted all these weeks for a new settlement on the expiration date of its old contract the metropolitan transportation authority could say it s sorry for failing to anticipate the seriousness of the strike threat , for alienating the rank and file , for letting the contract expire in the christmas season where was the leadership \? there is an answer waiting everything went on hold pending election day gov george e pataki could make the admission that the transportation authority which he controls could have begun serious negotiations with the union long ago but everything of any political or fiscal significance went on hold during his reelection campaign the governor as candidate was opaque about the state budget gap and the likelihood of a transit fare increase and never even entertained the possibility of a strike not that he has become more forthcoming since he said at a news conference with mr bloomberg yesterday , for instance , what he was not doing he was not involved in the transit talks the willfully uninvolved presumably have nothing to be sorry about since they did n't do anything mr bloomberg , new to the job and to politics has tried to be a cheerleader , even selecting his own strike symbol a bicycle a 24speed bike with all the trimmings that cost him 663 respectfully , a symbol worth dropping if the mayor was trying to connect with the average new yorker , he might consider that there are probably not many average new yorkers who can buy a bicycle like that , or risk cycling through tunnels and across bridges in bad weather and traffic and without the benefit of a city security detail not a big deal in the apology sweeps , though mr bloomberg will have to do better than that actually , much worse

in the early days of the nfl s steroid testing , players found some creative ways to cheat one was a system in which a pouch of urine usually from a teammate who did not use a performanceenhancing drug was taped to the upper back of the player under his shirt a tube ran from the pouch , down the middle of the shoulder blades , and ended between the player s legs a switch at the bottom of the tube activated the device and presto steroidfree urine ready for testing it s ingenuity like that that got us to the moon professional athletes will take drastic measures to improve their performance on the field the nfl began testing players for steroids in 1987 under commissioner pete rozelle , and now conducts 10 , 000 steroid tests a year on 2 , 000 players and college prospects most of the tests are random to try to catch the cheats off guard it is a formidable , though not perfect , system a league official estimates that one or two players per team use steroids and do n't get caught but the key word here is test football does it with full cooperation from the players' union so the nfl watches in partial amusement as other sports go through the steroidtesting blues to test or not to test that football endured for years with the steroids issue hanging over major league baseball s allstar game last night like a nasty rain cloud , baseball , along with some other sports , are at the crossroads football reached years ago and here is what football learned that baseball must heed testing for steroids is the only way a league can keep a modicum of credibility the international olympic committee and the ncaa are among the sports organizations mandating testing for steroids without testing , an entire sport risks becoming marginalized , its athletes constantly under suspicion , their achievements called into question dr john lombardo , the nfl s chief adviser on steroids , said , if you have a sport without steroid testing , then that sport is subject to questions when it comes to integrity issues in other words , the public knows that baseball does not test its players for steroids , so when that hulking outfielder smacks a 450foot home run , was it his athleticism or the drugs that made the ball sail so far \? professional sports have entered into a new realm the age of power everyone is pumping up some , of course , do it legitimately , without drugs in the past , tennis players were rarely confused with body builders , but serena williams looks as if she could benchpress a small automobile the sturdy frame of tiger woods , a workout maniac , has others on the pga tour staying overtime in the weight room in baseball , accusations are flying that the balls are n't the only things juiced there is no better evidence of how power has taken over the game than the blackandwhite images of the recently deceased ted williams and his elegant swing he is considered by many to have been the game s best pure hitter , but compared with today s sluggers , williams , even when he was young and strong , was built like a twig what often happens in any intensely competitive environment is a pushing of the envelope steroids are the dangerous equalizers and it was just a matter of time before steroids started invading sports not previously associated with bulking up baseball players want to win at all costs as much as football players do when football first began punishing players for using steroids , in 1989 , 13 players were suspended , according to the nfl since then , the league has suspended 35 players for steroid use the nfl has suspended one player for steroid use so far this year it suspended three in 2001 , none in 2000 , four in 1999 and two in 1998 are the low numbers in recent years because players are using steroids and beating the tests \? or have the nfl s testing procedures scared off the cheats \? it s impossible to know for sure , of course players maintain , though , that there is definitely a deterrent factor it is easy to understand why a first failed steroid test results in an automatic fourgame suspension lombardo compared drug testing to a cheat sitting in a room filled with open windows by testing for steroids , many of the windows close and the cheat has fewer escape routes baseball needs to close its shutters because the draft is getting unbearable photo john lombardo \( ohio state university \)
tokyo there s just one thing that most americans and osama bin laden seem able to agree on that the attacks on the world trade center arose somehow from islam whether the purest form of islam or the most perverted , it so enveloped the hijackers in religious zeal that the centrality of islam to the attacks is hard to deny so let me try it is easier to try that here in east asia the kind of defiant and violent antagonism to the west that we now associate with islamists was for centuries linked instead to places like japan , korea and china the vocabulary of the rejectionist movements varies with the country and the time the koran in today s saudi arabia , kim il sung ideology in today s north korea , and a mix of confucianism and secular xenophobia in the japan , china and korea of the 17th through 19th centuries but these religions and ideologies seem to reflect something deeper frustration at the humiliating choice faced by oncegreat civilizations heartsick at the pressure to discard bits of their own cultures to catch up with the nouveaux riches in the west east asians killed those who came to them , of course , rather than taking jet planes to kill infidels in their home countries but the \( sometimes feigned \) superiority of 17thcentury japanese , koreans and chinese , the allout rejection of westernization , the glorification of their own culture , the brutality inflicted on those perceived as prowestern all these are remarkably parallel with osama bin laden and those like him in the islamic world today today westerners come to japan and soak naked in the glorious outdoor hot springs but similar pools were used to torture christian missionaries francisco de jesus , a spaniard , suffered fairly typical hospitality after his arrest in 1629 he was executed by being plunged into a boiling pool for 33 consecutive days richard cocks , a 17thcentury english visitor to japan , described the country as the most puissant tyranny the world has ever known , adding about the treatment of japanese christians , who were seen as a fifth column for europeans i saw 55 of them martyrized at one time in miyako among them were children of five or six years , burned alive in the arms of their mothers yet none of this was really about religion indeed , hideyoshi , the japanese ruler who first banned christianity , supposedly had earlier toyed with the idea of becoming a christian himself , deciding not to when he learned that he would then be limited to one wife rather , it was about social conservatives trying to protect their way of life from a western onslaught of course , the faith of al qaeda s warriors runs deep and makes it easier to accept martyrdom but muslims have no monopoly on suicide tactics think of all the japanese kamikaze pilots in world war ii when i lived in egypt in the early 1980 s , i often heard in the voices of antiwestern muslims a mix of emotions pride in their past civilization , frustration at their present poverty , scapegoating of the west that echoed when i moved to asia and talked to north koreans or hardline chinese communists unfortunately , antagonism to westernstyle change leaves countries lagging further and further behind i once came across a 19thcentury chinese account of a goldsmith who challenged the powerful craft guilds by flouting their rules so he could boost production and gain market share the other goldsmiths were outraged , so 123 of them banded together to punish him one had the bright idea that if they bit him to death it would not be a crime , since no one bite could be shown to be the fatal one thus each goldsmith took a bite out of the entrepreneur , and none were allowed to leave without showing bloody gums it was an early setback to chinese economic reforms eventually , asia did transform itself , of course , beginning in japan in 1868 with the meiji reforms , which ended feudal rule and led to widespread japanese modernization in country after country , contempt for the west became something closer to a bear hug , or at least of all things practical the islamic world today is ripe for its own meiji period , and it should find the experience of asia reassuring the lesson of the far east is that it is possible for a troubled civilization to regain its footing only by integrating sweeping change into its society , and that this embrace of modernity does no dishonor to a national heritage
agilent technologies may have lost some of its finest employees when it cut its work force by 8 , 000 last year because of weak sales and profits but it made sure that it did n't lose contact with all of them the company , a hewlettpackard spinoff that makes testing and measurement equipment for the telecommunications industry , has established an online alumni network to maintain ties with former workers around the country and vice versa this is our way of keeping the door open to bring some of these people back in the future , said wendy miller , a senior director for global talent at agilent , who helped set up the network last summer we 've been forced to let go of some really great workers so far , at least 10 percent of agilent s former workers have logged on to the network , according to ms miller some chat via email with former coworkers and bosses , she said , while others browse company news reports or receive tips on r sum writing a few have found job leads , although none have yet been rehired by agilent online alumni networks like agilent s are gaining popularity , career experts say although the job market is tight right now , many companies have not forgotten how things were just two or three years ago , when they could not find enough qualified employees yesterday s talent crunch has taught us all something , said barbara marchilonis , director for career services at drake beam morin , a career services and jobsearch company based in boston companies have a much stronger desire now to maintain a sense of community that they can tap into in times of expansion of course , that may mean future savings when companies are ready to expand again selectminds inc , a new york company that builds alumni networks for large businesses , including agilent s , calculates that fortune 500 companies would save 125 million a year , on average , in recruiting costs if 10 percent of their new hires were former employees it estimated that new hires were 40 percent less productive than rehires during the first quarter of work alumni groups have been especially popular in industries like high technology , where nearly 700 , 000 jobs were cut in 2001 , and in pharmaceuticals , where mergers have led to corporate restructurings , experts said when pfizer bought warnerlambert two years ago , it set up an alumni web site for 2 , 000 displaced workers about 1 , 500 of them keep in touch through the network , according to robert todd , pfizer s vice president for human resources for integration i get requests from former workers every day asking how to log on , mr todd added he said none of the former workers had been rehired so far online networking can be a gold mine for people seeking new opportunities after all , the people you 've worked with in the past know your talents better than anyone else , said marjorie brody , who runs a career consulting firm in jenkintown , pa she advises clients to use such services to track down former colleagues and bosses , then to develop a plan for staying in contact it could be as simple as saying you 're going to email five people a week just to touch base , or that you 're going to set up a lunch with a former coworker once a month , she said you never know when one of them might have a job lead that you 'd be perfect for stephen sutter , a former product engineer for agilent who now is president of createability concepts , a company in fort collins , colo , that creates communication devices for people with disabilities , regularly taps into agilent s alumni site to find temporary help he recently hired a former worker to critique his new marketing plan , and another for some computer programming i do n't have time to babysit people or sift through a bunch of r sum s to weed out the

employee in the product management division at lotus development , regularly taps into the networking site that she and two former colleagues set up after ibm acquired the company in 1995 she said she decided to accept a position three years ago at a technology company in boston after finding that two former lotus workers were employed there i use the network to do my own detective work , said ms gunst , who now runs her own marketing consulting business she , in turn , is approached regularly by former lotus employees seeking advice on all kinds of issues from starting their own consulting businesses to setting up their own web sites , she said online networking has many unwritten rules the first is never to criticize the company for which you once worked , ms brody said the rule applies , she added , even if you do n't want work for a company again the world is small , ms brody said , people know people , and your words could come back to haunt you experienced networkers also know that they should not wait until they need a job to contact their former colleagues it sounds a little artificial if you call someone after not speaking to them for six years and say , 'got any job leads for me \? ' ms brody said ideally , you want to contact people when you do n't need them , and build the relationship from there if a former coworker helps you find a job , follow up with a note and a thankyou gift , ms brody said do n't just drop them like a hot potato , she added , or they 'll never help you again photo carole gunst and reed sturtevant , exemployees of lotus development , at a boston restaurant ms gunst helped set up a worker network after ibm bought lotus \( rick friedman for the new york times \)

you can call it christmas week if you like , this span of days between christmas and new year s day but in new york city , this inbetween season is really new year s week it has all the human frenzy of the days before christmas but none of the pressure of a santa claus deadline the clock is still ticking relentlessly , but toward a new holiday denouement from every quarter of town , tourists and the idly curious have been drifting into times square to see what there was to see , which was other people looking around for something to see locals who had places to go took to the streets because the sidewalks had been seized by gridlock someone would point toward the spot where the new year s eve ball will fall into 2003 , and almost instantly dozens of people tilted their heads back and pointed skyward , as if superman had just taken off from the cond nast building cameras flashed and whirred and digitally digested the scene some people balked at crossing into other people s shots , while some strode into the camera s view as if this were their moment at last it s easy to forget what a visceral city new york is , how its blood roars in the ear the tourists who wander times square , guidebooks in hand , seem stupefied by the congestion , the noise , the neverending sideshows workers handing out samples of an artificial sweetener brought the house down on one corner , as if artificial sweetener were the age s newest miracle in this inbetween week , the main event is just trying to get around with your selfimportance intact it will come to a standstill tonight , when all eyes stare upward , when everyone gives up and gawks
washington , july 29 an american attack on iraq could profoundly affect the american economy , because the united states would have to pay most of the cost and bear the brunt of any oil price shock or other market disruptions , government officials , diplomats and economists say eleven years ago , the persian gulf war , fought to roll back iraq s invasion of kuwait , cost the united states and its allies 60 billion and helped set off an economic recession caused in part by a spike in oil prices for that war , the allies picked up almost 80 percent of the bill today , however , as the bush administration works on plans to overthrow saddam hussein , the united states is confronting the likelihood that this time around it would have to pick up the tab largely by itself , diplomats said unless the economic outlook brightens , the government could well find itself spending heavily on the military even as the economy recovers falteringly from last year s recession senior administration officials said mr bush and his top advisers had not begun to consider the cost of a war because they had yet to decide what kind of military operation might be necessary whatever choice is made , experts say , the costs are likely to be significant and therefore may ultimately influence the size , scale and tactics of any military operation already , the federal budget deficit is expanding , meaning that the bill for a war would lead either to more red ink or to cutbacks in domestic programs if consumer and investor confidence remains fragile , military action could have substantial psychological effects on the financial markets , retail spending , business investment , travel and other key elements of the economy , officials and experts said if oil supplies are disrupted , as they were during the 1991 gulf war , and prices rise sharply , the economic effects would be felt in the united states and around the world all of that could present a complicated political problem for president bush , both in the congressional midterm elections in november and as he manages a war and looks ahead to his reelection campaign in 2004 i think a good case can be made that voters will want to understand the case for a war or any kind of extended military action better than they do now because the economic considerations are considerable , said kim n wallace , a political analyst for lehman brothers in washington saudi arabia , kuwait and japan divided the cost of the 1991 war with the united states , but today none has offered to assist with financing a new military campaign in fact , each has signaled that it is not eager to be asked , diplomats say just open a map , said a member of the kuwaiti royal family in close consultation with washington afghanistan is in turmoil , the middle east is in flames , and you want to open a third front in the region \? that would truly turn into a war of civilizations , he added if mr bush decides on a largescale invasion plan for iraq involving as many as 250 , 000 troops , as some commanders advocate , the country would face a significant military mobilization and callup of reserves as early as this fall to be ready for a military campaign early next year james r schlesinger , a member of the defense policy board that advises the pentagon who held senior cabinet posts in republican and democratic administrations , said he believed that the president would opt for a significant ground presence in iraq he said he did not think that fear of economic instability by itself would cause the united states to refrain from trying to unseat the iraqi leader my view is that given all we have said as a leading world power about the necessity of regime change in iraq , mr schlesinger said , means that our credibility would be badly damaged if that regime change did not take place the persian gulf war cost 611 billion , according to the congressional research service , of which 484 billion was paid by other nations the house budget committee s democratic staff said that in 2002 dollars , the cost of the war was 799 billion , providing a very rough benchmark for what a conflict of similar dimensions might cost today representative john m spratt jr of south carolina , the senior democrat on the house budget committee and a member of the armed services committee , said the united states would come up with whatever money was necessary but he said planning for a war now would have to recognize the nation s deteriorating fiscal condition and the need to address other priorities while it s not beyond our means , we ca n't have it all , mr spratt said since there is no surplus in the budget from which the cost could be paid , there will be tradeoffs , making initiatives like medicare drug coverage harder to do , and there almost certainly will be deeper deficits and more debt james a placke , a former senior diplomat specializing in the persian gulf and now a senior associate of cambridge energy research associates , said the market reaction to any invasion of iraq was at best uncertain given the marked lack of enthusiasm for this venture , i would n't think the market reaction would be very good , he said

why here \? scientists say a mosquitoborne disease like west nile is bound to be somewhat random dr raoult ratard , a louisiana epidemiologist , takes a metaphysical approach the universe is lumpy , right \? dr ratard said it s the same with pointe coupee everyone is trying to understand why there s so much virus in this one little place and absolutely nothing 10 miles down the road we just do n't know that s the way things are this slice of cajun country , 50 miles north of baton rouge , looks like many other parts of lower louisiana parts that have not reported a single west nile case it is lush , rural and very wet there are countless swampy bayous , a nice wide stretch of the mississippi river running along the eastern edge of the parish , and the 14milelong rootbeercolored false river mosquitoes love water , and there are loads of them here real and imaginary when you walk into somebody s yard and you hit that grass , you can feel them , said bernadine st cyr , a new roads councilwoman cpl don ramagos of the pointe coupee sheriff s office remembers hunting in the woods and feeling as if somebody had jabbed him in the neck with a hypodermic needle this skeeter was so big you could mount it , mr ramagos said , holding his fingers inches apart local officials have been besieged trying to deal with the problem their nightmare started on july 29 when mr bonaventure checked himself into pointe coupee general hospital , freckled with rash mr bonaventure , 6 feet 3 and 280 pounds , had a monster headache and a low pulse people had warned me about bug spray , but i did n't use it , he said i guess i was hardheaded then a few horses got the virus and ran around like they were drunk , said miles brashier , a state agricultural expert a few days later mr padgett staggered into his doctor s office i could n't hardly see , he recalled west nile virus , discovered 65 year ago in uganda , can infect people , horses and birds most people who catch it do not know it on rare occasions , it causes headaches , fever , severe brain swelling and even death , especially among the elderly that is why there was such concern when ms tyson showed up at the hospital on aug 3 , barely conscious and mumbling about her past her daughter thought it was a reaction to some new medicine ms tyson spends her afternoons on her porch along the false river , and dr leblanc , her physician , immediately suspected she had been bitten by an infected mosquito i thought we were going to lose her , he said while ms tyson began to slip into a fog , dozens of other pointe coupee residents streamed into the hospital they complained of fever , headaches and confusion over the next few weeks , the ninebed emergency room was full august happens to be peak mosquito season because of hot , muggy weather pointe coupee is one of those sweetly distilled places where many people never move away and most know each other people here have not lost the fine art of leisure , or gossip even before several west nile patients left the hospital , word was out that they had the disease there were even rumors that the high school football coach had caught it \( he had n't \) parish officials had few resources to combat the outbreak they sent firefighters to grocery stores to pass out pellets that kill mosquito larvae they borrowed money to rig three old pickups with rudimentary spraying equipment the west nile epidemic seems to be subsiding , with no reported cases in pointe coupee in the last two weeks but there is a new problem , whirling up the gulf of mexico isidore , a category 4 hurricane , is pounding the caribbean and may hit louisiana this week its drenching rains will bring more mosquitoes and probably more virus ms tyson , who is recovering well in a nursing home , is not too worried at least not about the mosquitoes west nile is like chickenpox once you have had it , you are immune for life i just want to go back to my porch and watch the boats go by , ms tyson said today it s heavenly photos i could n't hardly see , ervin padgett says of the august day that he was felled by the west nile virus in pointe coupee parish in louisiana laverne tyson is recovering from the west nile virus in a nursing home , where her son , grandson and greatgrandson visited her yesterday she entered an emergency room aug 3 mumbling and barely conscious \( photographs by jaclyn mccabe for the new york times \) \( pg a21 \) map of louisianna highlighting new roads new roads is the parish seat of mosquitoplagued pointe coupee \( pg a21 \)
crawford , tex , aug 18 there are many ways to judge how different president bush is from the man he succeeded in the white house one is where this president chooses to spend his vacation on the dry and secluded flatland of his ranch near here , a cultural world away from the whitewine swillers of martha s vineyard , as mr bush put it last week in a tart putdown of the island where bill and hillary clinton spent their summers but an equally revealing contrast came in the form of a list , issued by the president s aides friday night , of the 160 friends , family members and supporters who have enjoyed overnight stays in the white house in the first 20 months of this bush administration if mr clinton s overnight list spoke volumes about his presidential style from the glamour of his guests to the ignominy of the use of the lincoln bedroom as a fundraising tool the bush list , like his choice of this sleepy furnace of a town as a getaway spot , suggests just how lowkey and unostentatious mr bush has sought to appear the white house family quarters during the clinton years could , on some nights , resemble the sidewalk outside the academy awards , or at least a toptier book publishing party in manhattan the clintons opened their doors to an eclectic parade of celebrities from academia , business , politics and film life in the white house today would seem as different from what it was during the clinton years as crawford is from chilmark , mass george w and laura bush have played host to the golfer ben crenshaw , the country music performer larry gatlin and kinky friedman , the texas singersongwriter and author mr bush has partied into the night ok , until almost 10 with college buddies from yale , and friends and golfing partners from texas beyond mr crenshaw and mr friedman , the ranking personalities would probably include gov george e pataki of new york and john engler , the departing governor of michigan the only celebrity you see there now is when you turn on the television in your bedroom , one of mr bush s friends said today , overlooking the obvious exception of the host this friend , characteristically of mr bush s regular overnight guests , was protective of the president s privacy , and said he wished not to be identified by name none of which is to say that mr bush easily as prodigious a fundraiser as mr clinton , which is saying a lot has not opened up a few white house bedrooms to big campaign contributors the fact that mr bush s aides put out the list on a friday night in august signals that this was not exactly a story the white house wished to lead the evening news still , a review of both lists suggests that mr clinton was more energetic and systematic in enlisting the white house in his fundraising efforts beyond that , this is one case where money might be beside the point , or at least not the only point the bush list provides a glimpse into what has been a very shuttered white house , and is evidence of the extent to which mr bush has tried to change the tone mr clinton s guests recall ambling evenings filled with an assortment of dignitaries , intellectuals and celebrities , often going late into the night it was not unusual to see mr clinton lead guests to the white house mess for a latenight snack and for some intense discussion on any one of a number of weighty problems by contrast , mr bush keeps his nights short and simple dinner by 7 , coffee on the truman balcony and bed by 10 , with a decided preference for smaller groups than was common under mr clinton the evenings are notable , a few of mr bush s guests said today , for their lack of pretension or gravity several said that except for the agents outside the room , they could have been having dinner in almost any dining room in america anyone who puts on airs and tries to get puffed is going to get punctured mighty quickly , david sibley , a republican former texas state senator and a close friend of mr bush s who has stayed both at the white house and at mr bush s ranch here , said by cellphone as he headed for church this morning whether it s his house in dallas or it s the white house , they are very much the host and hostess kinky friedman is n't exactly a hollywood type , mr sibley observed donald etra , a los angeles lawyer who was a classmate of mr bush s at yale , said he had spent four nights at the white house , including one night when he and mr bush had dinner alone because mrs bush was in new york the president showed up in workout clothes , and the two men ate in the dining room before heading up for a cigar on the truman balcony i think he craves normalcy , said mr etra , who describes himself as a liberal democrat \( on a second visit , mr etra spent the night with his wife and four children , and brought his 9yearold daughter into her parents' room after she complained about being frightened in the middle of the night she popped up at 7 the next morning and said , 'i was fine i just wanted to tell my friends i had slept in the lincoln bedroom , ' he said \) another guest , gov john g rowland , republican of connecticut , said tonight that during his visit , mr bush gave him a tour of the second and third floors of the living quarters , stopping to show him the president s exercise room after that , it was downstairs for a white house dinner for governors we did the dinner , and we were all in bed by 10 o'clock , mr rowland said with a laugh oh yeah , i think that is the rule if the clintons expanded their social boundaries during their years in the white house , the bushes chose their guests based on past friendships and allegiances though , not surprisingly , in a few cases these are the same people who happen to be inclined to write checks mr etra is one of a handful of fraternity brothers from yale who have spent the night at the white house another is roland betts , an owner of the chelsea piers sports complex in new york and an investor with mr bush in the texas rangers mostly , though , there were texans , including figures from both political parties the bushes invited pete laney , the democratic speaker of the texas house , as well as jan bullock , the widow of lt gov bob bullock , a democrat who was close to mr bush he also invited antonio o garza , a longtime ally , whom he named last month as ambassador to mexico it s pretty rare to see that there are any strangers or people that he does n't know , said dan bartlett , mr bush s communications director were there any people who had the privilege of spending a night in both the clinton and bush white houses \? at least two , in fact , but so far they are n't talking former president george bush and his wife , barbara photos larry gatlin s name is among the bigger ones on the bush guest list \( hiroyuki ito for the new york times \) the golfer ben crenshaw has been a guest at the white house \( agence francepresse \)
albert schussler , the wealthy executive at the center of a widening bribery scandal over tax assessments in new york city , apparently did not discriminate among luxury hotels , battered garment center buildings , mcdonald s franchises and skyscrapers , as long as he got his fee , according to investigators mr schussler , who was a tax consultant to dozens of property owners , paid city tax assessors millions to slash his clients' annual property tax bills , prosecutors said none of the owners , who considered mr schussler a friend and a shrewd tax expert , have been implicated in the scheme , and many of them are still reeling from the news of mr schussler s indictment this week on federal racketeering charges , along with 17 current and former tax assessors still , his work on their behalf stretches from lower manhattan through the upper east side to harlem and resulted in illegal tax cuts worth at least 160 million over the last four years , according to james b comey , the united states attorney in manhattan a look at the 545 properties in manhattan that were involved in mr schussler s scheme indicates that some of the city s wealthiest and most powerful owners and developers leonard litwin , stephen l green , the late stanley stahl , burton p resnick , sheldon h solow were multiple winners in what prosecutors have described as a tax sweepstakes the bamford , the stratford , the pavilion and the lucerne are all luxury highrise apartment buildings on the east side of manhattan that are owned by mr litwin s glenwood management company , and each got illegal tax breaks , according to investigators so did two towers owned by mr solow , including 9 west 57th street , the 50story skyscraper that offers spectacular views of central park and some of the highest office rents in the city the office buildings owned by mr green , chairman of the publicly traded sl green realty , are more modest , but he has at least 16 properties on the list there are nine properties owned by mr resnick s family , including a downtown development site and an apartment house at 422 east 72nd street cohen brothers realty has five buildings on the list , including 622 third avenue and 750 lexington avenue , the 33story tower clad in blue glass and granite at 59th street perhaps the largest beneficiary of the operation was one of mr schussler s real estate partners , mr stahl , who died in 1999 at age 75 he owned at least 16 properties in manhattan that are on the list mr schussler , mr stahl and jesse krasnow , another real estate investor , were partners in the landmark ansonia hotel mr schussler and mr krasnow also run a company , leffertsfore , that manages buildings they own , some of which also received illegal tax breaks , according to investigators few of mr schussler s clients and friends were willing to discuss him but the quiet 85yearold executive , who once was a public tax assessor himself , traveled in the highest circles of the real estate industry in a city where skyscrapers are king he s been suspended from all activities , said steven spinola , president of the real estate board of new york , the industry s influential lobbying organization mr schussler s ties to his real estate brethren were social and political he is a fundraiser and the interim president of the american friends of the israel philharmonic orchestra , while judith resnick , the wife of mr resnick , chairman of the real estate board , is a director mr green , who was a prime fundraiser for his brother mark s unsuccessful mayoral campaign last year , solicited 10 , 000 from mr schussler , his wife , claire , and another family member , according to a report issued by the green campaign they 've all told me they had not the slightest inkling of any wrongdoing on the part of schussler , said howard j rubenstein , a publicist who represents mr green , mr resnick and mr solow they were all stunned when the accusations were made some owners said that mr schussler charged a flat retainer for his services , ranging from 200 , 000 to 400 , 000 for a portfolio of buildings taxes represent the largest single cost of operating a property in new york , so owners are keenly interested in tamping down the city s annual assessment i recommended schussler because he was a good guy and he delivered , just like my lawyer , said one major property owner i did n't know about any bribery according to the indictment , mr schussler offered bribes of thousands of dollars to city tax assessors for 35 years in exchange for reducing assessments on particular buildings this year alone , the city expects to raise about 85 billion in property tax revenues mr spinola of the real estate board acknowledged that the taxes were cut on some buildings , but he said many others on the prosecutor s list seemed to be at the proper rate i think he ran a scam , mr spinola said he used his knowledge to scare his clients into believing that taxes were going up and he had to go in and fight real hard to deal with it
the struggling apparel maker levi strauss company dealt a blow yesterday to tbwa chiat day by dismissing the san francisco office of the agency after four years of working on north american advertising assignments for the flagship levi s jeans brand spending was estimated at 60 million tbwa chiat day , part of the tbwa worldwide division of the omnicom group , strove mightily to land the assignments in january 1998 as the worldwide creative executive , lee clow , led the creative pitch in a pair of levi s the agency had worked diligently , with varying results , since then to keep levi strauss as a client it hired a top creative executive , chuck mcbride , from wieden kennedy in portland , ore , to develop campaigns that would resonate with the younger consumers who have increasingly given short shrift to levi s jeans in favor of newer brands deemed more fashionable or stylish but levi s sales and market share in the united states , its home market , continued spiraling downward , despite a continuous skein of changing campaigns , including a television commercial featuring a singing belly button no kidding and an online promotion to pick a levi s spot to appear during super bowl xxxvi on feb 3 the creative part of the account is being consolidated , effective in 90 days , at bartle bogle hegarty , an agency with a reputation for nontraditional , risktaking work the london office of bartle bogle has produced levi s ads for europe for 20 years its singapore office has produced levi s ads for asianpacific markets for five years the bartle bogle office in new york , opened in 1998 , will handle the north american creative assignment as a result , it plans to increase its staff of 62 employees it will be the first time that advertising for the levi s home market will be produced outside san francisco , where levi strauss is based the consolidation , which came unexpectedly , demonstrates the growing interest among global marketers in reducing the number of agencies with which they work , seeking more effective and efficient campaigns that is important for levi strauss because the american levi s business has been deteriorating for more than five years indeed , the levi strauss decision came soon after the adidas division of adidassalomon consolidated its global account at tbwa worldwide and an agency in amsterdam , 180 , that had produced some european campaigns for the adidas athletic footwear and apparel brand the adidas account has billings estimated at 80 million to 100 million while we are disappointed that we will not be continuing to work for levi strauss , said tom carroll , president for the americas at tbwa worldwide , we understand that in an age of global brands , more and more companies are choosing to consolidate their efforts around the world , and we have been on both sides of this equation recently executives at levi strauss said the levi s consolidation was unrelated to issues like a potential conflict with the clothing sold by adidas this decision was made on a more strategic level , like moves to consolidate worldwide marketing , manufacturing and retail operations , said robert hanson , president for the levi s brand in the united states at levi strauss while we 're pleased with the creative work produced by tbwa chiat day , he added , we wanted to leverage the proven track record bbh and i have had in europe as levi strauss develops a global branding strategy for levi s jeans when mr hanson was president for the levi s brand in britain and europe , he and bartle bogle collaborated on assignments like the successful introduction of engineered and staprest jeans this is certainly a longheld dream of ours , said cindy gallop , president at the bartle bogle new york office , who helped open the singapore office with levi s as a founding account it comes at a very pleasant time , she added , as the agency celebrates this year the 20th anniversary of the opening of its first office , in london , also with levi s as a client asked the direction for the work in the united states , ms gallop replied in other parts of the world , what we 've managed to do is communicate that levi s is a brand with an american heritage and a global appeal , as the original and definitive jeans and clearly the leader in the marketplace that will hold true in a lot of the global brand strategy levi s wants to move to mr hanson said the global strategy would include reestablishing the levi s brand as the category leader and as the definitive source for denimjeans innovation because it is the originator of the category , dating to the first jeans made by levi strauss himself in the 19th century we are an american iconic brand , and when the brand has done the best , he said , it has been identified with values of jeans like sexy and strong and the zeitgeist of american culture the media planning part of the levi s north american account is also moving to bartle bogle from tbwa chiat day the media buying assignment will remain at omd in new york , owned by omnicom bartle bogle , which is 49 percent owned by the bcom3 group , also creates european campaigns to sell the dockers brand of casual pants made by levi strauss a bartle bogle commercial for dockers once ran in the united states , but none of its asianpacific or european commercials for levi s jeans recipients of many creative awards have appeared in this country needless to say , that is soon to change when tbwa chiat day won the levi s account in 1998 , bartle bogle was among the finalists the agency bested that move ended 68 years of levi s advertising from the san francisco office of foote , cone belding , now part of the fcb group division of the interpublic group of companies , which still creates american campaigns for dockers and another levi strauss brand of pants , slates mr mcbride , who is now the executive creative director for north america at tbwa chiat day , will soon turn his attention to adidas
in these last few days before new york city schools open for another academic year , something strange is in the air a sense of calm , good will and even optimism about the future of public education in the city early september is usually a time for dire predictions about the school year to come , as politicians , educators and others with a stake in new york s sprawling school system air their grievances and dodge the blame for whatever problems threaten the opening of school last year , for example , harold o levy , then the schools chancellor , ordered 150 million in cuts just days before school started mayor rudolph w giuliani had refused to hand over money that mr levy was counting on , because he thought that the chancellor was allowing administrative waste he s just trying to get attention , mr giuliani scoffed after mr levy loudly predicted disastrous consequences a year later , for the first time in recent memory , the usual suspects do not have the usual reasons to complain nor , significantly , are they looking for any mayor michael r bloomberg has won direct control of the school system , the prize that eluded mr giuliani and several of his predecessors the politically fractious board of education was abolished in july , and as a result , mr bloomberg alone got to choose the new chancellor , joel i klein meanwhile , a new contract has awarded raises to the city s 80 , 000 teachers , eliminating their longeststanding gripe mr bloomberg and randi weingarten , the teachers' union president , have studiously avoided attacks on the school system this summer in fact , at a news conference on wednesday , the mayor went so far as to say that new york city already is , incidentally , the nation s best largecity school system that statement alone , compared with mr bloomberg s rinkydink candy store assessment of the school system last spring before he won control and mr giuliani s oftenstated desire to blow up the system , speaks volumes about how quickly things have changed then there is chancellor klein , who has said little since starting work on aug 19 after a succession of chancellors who took to the airwaves at this time of year to detail the demons they faced overcrowding , teacher shortages , fights with the mayor and the like mr klein s silence has contributed to this year s subdued tone maybe the peace and quiet mean that the school system , freed from the political infighting that plagued it for years , finally has the ingredients for drastic improvement or maybe it means that the powers that be , having won their personal battles , have lost interest in drawing attention to deeper problems they may find harder to solve either way , a new question looms as the school year begins will all this optimism become a selffulfilling prophecy \? or are the recent changes only a small , largely symbolic first step \? it s not just a matter of taking away the politics , said robert berne , vice president for academic affairs at new york university and a longtime observer of the school system it s a matter of channeling all that energy that was previously illused in trivial squabbles and using it for more bold change just how mr klein and mr bloomberg will channel that energy remains to be seen most educators agree the system s needs are pressing only 39 percent of the system s 11 million students can read and write at grade level even fewer meet standards in mathematics the dropout rate has climbed in recent years , and overcrowding remains the bane of hundreds of city schools while the new teachers' contract and the flagging economy helped new york recruit a record number of certified teachers this year , severe shortages remain in math and science and in a school system where most new teachers leave within five years , educators say , mr klein will have to provide considerable training and support to hang onto the 8 , 300 newest recruits mr bloomberg has kept his plans for combating these problems under wraps partly because he is still forming them , observers believe , but also because announcing an agenda invites sometimes crippling criticism even mr bloomberg s selection of a chancellor was kept secret until the day of the announcement , which was extraordinary in a city where previous chancellor searches almost always got bogged down in politics and rancorous public debate likewise , mr klein s decision not to announce specific goals or grant interviews during his first month on the job has helped keep the usual dissent at bay this apolitical way of doing business is , of course , part of a larger change that mr bloomberg is trying to effect in new york joseph p viteritti , a research professor at new york university , said that while it was too early to gauge the effect on entrenched problems like low test scores , the intent was admirable i'm more optimistic about the chances for improvement now than under the old system , where every decision was a political one , said mr viteritti , who wrote across the river politics and education in the city \( holmes meier publishers , 1983 \) whether in the end it will eliminate politics to the point where it makes the system unaccountable is a question that many people are going to ask but so far it s too early to say so far , mr viteritti said , the public does not seem to mind the sea change he pointed to mr bloomberg s surprise appointment of mr klein and the fact that there were few rumbles of protest those by the rev al sharpton and city councilman charles barron of brooklyn among a handful of others which quickly died bloomberg seems to have at least the tacit approval of the public to proceed this way , mr viteritti said , because people were so disgusted with how entrenched in politics the whole education process had become this new system permits the chancellor to make decisions based on the merits and not get sidetracked by political considerations that have nothing to do with the end result not only that , but the quiet way in which mr bloomberg and mr klein have run the system so far could help cure the deeply entrenched cynicism that new yorkers feel toward the schools , said noreen connell , executive director of the education priorities panel it almost creates a feeling of trust , because they are n't giving us a lot of empty rhetoric , said ms connell , whose organization , monitors for problems in schools when you have a chancellor who gets into office and says every child will read , then you hear some pathetic story about a kid who ca n't read by high school , people become inured and cynical on the other hand , ms connell noted , since mr bloomberg is the first mayor to take control of the schools since john v lindsay in the 1960 s , few people in city government have the kind of institutional knowledge about the school system that mr bloomberg should be able to draw on now that he is in charge for over 100 years the mayor controlled the schools one way or another , so there was some level of expertise , ms connell said now there s none i'm interested in how this huge gap in knowledge about the school system will play out mr berne , of new york university , said that to succeed , mr bloomberg and mr klein would have to win the cooperation of the business community , nonprofit groups , parents and the teachers' and principals' unions education is different from other city services in that it requires a community conversation , mr berne said failure to share longterm vision , failure to win support of various constituencies , failure to have a proper airing of controversial issues , could in the long run be detrimental the broader resources of new york are required to turn this thing around drawing
newark , april 26 the federal investigation of essex county executive james w treffinger is focusing on three areas that county officials may have been bribed by a sewer repair company , that political supporters may have been hired for noshow county jobs , and that a link may exist between political contributions and county contracts , lawyers familiar with the case say mr treffinger , who was considered the frontrunner for the republican nomination for united states senate , withdrew from the race this week , just days after his office was raided on april 18 by federal agents he has denied any wrongdoing , and his lawyer , john arseneault , would not comment on the investigation a spokeswoman for the federal bureau of investigation , sandra carroll , and officials with the united states attorney s office also would not comment but the lawyers familiar with the inquiry sketched a threepronged focus that is also reflected in a batch of new warrants that led to searches of other county offices on tuesday the warrants sought records of department heads who supervised nine fulltime and parttime employees whose records had been sought in the earlier search of mr treffinger s office and that of his county administrator , ronald h manzella people familiar with the workings of essex county government said those department heads would have personnel records and time sheets that might indicate how some of the employees in question were hired , and whether they had worked the hours for which they were paid for the most part , the allegations in the essex case are the stuff of more traditional political corruption investigations , the lawyers said and although the inquiry into possible bribery involves the irvingtonbased sewer repair company united gunite , the allegations about the company are not as dramatic as those swirling around a federal case involving united gunite s dealings in paterson in the paterson case , prosecutors say company officers provided money , home improvements , female companionship , vacations and other perks for some officials in exchange for contracts mayor martin barnes was indicted in february on charges that he sought and accepted such gifts from the company s vice president , gerald free , in exchange for county contracts mr barnes has pleaded not guilty and is to stand trial later this year mr free pleaded guilty to bribery charges and is cooperating with investigators the essex inquiry appears to be looking into united gunite s political contributions to county officials , rather than gifts and hard cash , say some lawyers and county employees familiar with the investigation the lawyers said united gunite had agreed to assemble and disguise 10 , 000 in illegal corporate contributions to benefit mr treffinger s unsuccessful 2000 race for the republican senate nomination as the price of getting contracts for millions of dollars in county sewer repairs it was not immediately clear whether investigators believed that mr treffinger sought the contributions directly or whether others did so on his behalf lawyers who have become involved in the case differed on whether investigators had evidence that mr treffinger and mr free ever met and talked directly other companies with county contracts that were specified in search warrants included gourmet dining services , lawyers familiar with the case say since 1990 , the familyowned company has been awarded the food service contracts in most essex county facilities until two years ago , the county executive was allowed to award those contracts as he saw fit , county officials said but a change in state law now requires a competitive bidding process as well as approval by the county board of freeholders , said joseph n divincenzo jr , the board s president according to campaign finance reports , gourmet dining donated 1 , 000 to mr treffinger s senate bid in 2000 in addition to seeking records about the food service in county offices , fbi agents searched the company s food service operations at seton hall university in south orange daniel cohen , the lawyer for gourmet dining , would not comment on the fbi warrants another company named in the search warrants was century 21 construction company of clifton , whose long history of county work includes serving as construction manager on riverfront stadium , home of the newark bears minor league baseball team , a 30 million project financed by essex county and newark lawyers familiar with the warrants said investigators were seeking information related to the company s contract to demolish buildings on a 271acre tract that the county sold to developers last month for a luxury housing development in march , a group made up of mr treffinger , mr divincenzo and the county s improvement authority director , william abele , approved the sale of the land in the socalled hilltop project to k hovnanian northwest companies and roseland properties for 60 million anthony fusco , the lawyer for the century 21 company , said that no documents from its offices had been subpoenaed and that officers of the firm had not been questioned by investigators he said that company officers had made contributions to mr treffinger s campaigns for county executive and the senate over the years , and that he was assembling details in anticipation of contact by investigators
sydney , australia , oct 30 making an opera about the making of an opera house may seem like artistic or architectural navelgazing but there was enough drama in the creation of the sydney opera house to justify setting it to words and music and performing the backstage story onstage at the opera house itself as the eighth wonder , a 1995 production revived two years ago now an emerging epilogue to that drama is worthy of a new finale the opera house s architect , joern utzon , of denmark , won 10 , 000 in 1957 for his design , but left sydney in 1966 after six years of what was to become a 14year construction saga he was seemingly overwhelmed by financial and managerial disputes about budget blowouts and design debates mr utzon said he was fired some critics still say he quit most of the challenges and problems of his plans , which he left behind , were solved , except some departures from his internal layouts the site of a derelict trolley car depot was transformed into a national icon with a global image , and all became the stuff of drama in the allegorical opera , the architect is portrayed as an artistic hero summoned from the old world to the new by cultural aspirants , but ambushed by philistine provincial bureaucrats mr utzon , now 83 , has , astonishingly , never seen his monument in person members of a new generation of sydney officials have persuaded him to revisit the past , urging him to come back for the sake of posterity , as one of them put it so mr utzon is working on plans for the building s renovation and expansion and on fixing some omissions and errors on the interior he has been assured that this time his drawings will be followed we are reuniting the man with his masterpiece for creative renewal , said joseph skrzynski , a merchant banker who is the chairman of the trust that administers the building , which is owned by the state of new south wales after 36 years there is reconciliation , he said of mr utzon s agreement to guide a sixstage program of renovations , additions and improvements estimated to cost 30 million during the next three years plans include opening a theater foyer wall to views of the adjacent harbor , an early idea of mr utzon s that was never carried out because of expense and time considerations the building s original budget was 10 million , but the final cost , paid by lottery ticket sales , was about 50 million still , the cost was considered a bargain because the opera house was to generate billions of dollars for the entertainment and tourism industries at the opera house s opening in 1973 , the official speakers did not mention mr utzon , a silence eventually recognized as an injustice , as the building won renown for itself and sydney in a sense , sydney is embracing the phantom of its opera house , and mr utzon wrote recently this is a wonderful opportunity the building is an inseparable part of my life mr utzon has decided against a finalcurtain return to sydney , preferring to save his time and energy for drafting plans that the australian architect richard johnson and engineers will detail for construction in 20035 mr utzon is also contributing to a master plan for the conservation of the building during the next half century mr johnson said , after several recent visits to mr utzon , he does not want the new work to replicate the first plans , but wants it in the context of his original ideas although mr utzon will not be physically present in sydney , his presence will be felt his son , jan , also an architect , is working with mr johnson , and his daughter , lin , a designer , is preparing a vast foyer tapestry with a bach fugue theme sketched by her father the title of the eighth wonder , with music by alan john and libretto by dennis watkins , refers , irreverently , to claims by many admirers of this sailroofed opera house that its audacious shape and monumental scale give it historic importance the opera house is certainly a marvel one encyclopedia describes it as a splendid winged folly after nearly 30 years it still inspires wonder as to how it was built to seemingly float on the edge of the harbor , like a gigantic cluster of mysterious seashells left by the tide or spinnakers hoisted to catch sydney s prevailing northeasters many architectural critics say sydney \( population four million \) , or all australia for that matter , has no other building of such international distinction citizens are fond of some modest sandstone remnants of the georgian and victorian eras , but these evoke nostalgia rather than pride the architectural historian kenneth frampton , of columbia university , has called the opera house one of the primary monuments of the 20th century and rates it as far more significant than frank gehry s guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain few cities have cultural centers as their signature landmarks , but mr utzon s zigzag roofline quickly became sydney s signature , an international image that was incorporated into the logo of the 2000 olympic games in sydney nonetheless , the building does not always work as well as it looks the outside , faithful to mr utzon s design , is more successful than the inside , which was improvised by other architects who were told to simplify and expedite after his departure problems with space , access , acoustics , a cramped orchestra pit and inadequate restrooms have long irritated some performers and audience members such complaints are common enough at modern cultural centers \( the pompidou center in paris , for example \) , but despite the opera house s faults , it is efficient and successful none of its problems , real or exaggerated , detract from its popularity it is one of the busiest performing arts centers in the world , home to a total of seven national and local arts companies , and usually enjoying a full house it is not only a big building \( 600 feet long , 380 feet wide , 220 feet high \) , but also big business its four performance spaces can seat a total of 4 , 179 people each year 2 , 200 events \( opera , orchestras , theater , dance \) sell a total of about 18 million tickets another 275 , 000 people take the guided tour , and several million other tourists simply walk around the fiveacre waterfront site , gazing up from boardwalks to the soaring arches \( made of one million dawnpink tiles and 26 , 000 tons of concrete slabs \) despite this landmark s popularity and ability to bring in money , there has been turmoil recently simone young , the music and artistic director of opera australia , which is based at the opera house , was involved in a budget dispute her contract was not renewed when she asked for an extra 15 million to hire more musicians and singers the latest premiere at the opera house was on friday with the musical drama lindy , about an infant who disappeared in the australian desert , snatched , its mother said , by a dingo , or wild dog in a 1988 film version of the events , a cry in the dark , meryl streep played the mother , lindy chamberlain , who was jailed for murder but later acquitted , leaving the baby s disappearance a mystery as usual , the sydney opera house is staying in the headlines photo joern utzon designed the sydney opera house in 1957 , left the project in 1966 , a year before this picture was taken , and is now overseeing

southampton on a typical day at the tuckahoe school , rebecca capatosto serves breakfast to more than 30 children who come to school without any and hands out warm coats to those who lack them not the normal duties of a school nurse if these kids leave tuckahoe with one thing , i want it to be the knowledge that there are people who care about them , ms capatosto said tuckahoe , one of long island s smallest districts , is struggling to serve a disproportionate number of children from nearby welfare motels and the lifeboat is nearly swamped , said the interim superintendent , richard t olcott unceasingly cheerful , ms capatosto said she is coping but will need help if the number of underprivileged children rises private donors and community organizations have pitched in and the district funds the remaining costs , with dr olcott estimating 300 , 000 to 500 , 000 is spent caring for the motels' children the tuckahoe school has 328 children in prekindergarten through eighth grade , including 27 homeless children none of the homeless children were originally from the district we are happy to have these kids , dr olcott said nobody needs what schools give more than they do but when it approaches 10 percent , instead of us having a positive influence on them , they start to have negative influence on us with the number of homeless families across suffolk more than doubling since 1999 , the suffolk county department of social services is struggling to keep up with the demand for emergency housing and depends more and more on motels , said dennis nowak , the department s public relations director in 1999 , the department counted an average of 249 homeless families last month , there were 570 , including about 1 , 400 children most are in shelters , but as of last month some 191 families were in 14 motels at a monthly cost of 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 per family , mr nowak said and half of those motels and half of the families in motels are in southampton town , where the tuckahoe school is , though nearly all came from western suffolk most of the 27 homeless children at the tuckahoe school are living in the southampton bays or olympia motels , both on montauk highway in southampton it is disproportionate , but we canvassed nearly every motel in suffolk and these are the only ones willing to do business with the county at this time , mr nowak said it s no accident that half the county s welfare motels are in southampton motels in the summer resort are mostly empty in winter , and their owners more inclined to welcome the revenue but last year s canvassing included montauk , and not one montauk innkeeper was willing to accept homeless families , mr nowak said the reliance on southampton s motels has left tuckahoe with more than its share of health , emotional , discipline , truancy and scholastic problems , dr olcott said rowdiness on the school bus that serves the welfare motels has gotten so bad the district installed surveillance cameras student lockers will soon be fitted with locks for the first time parents have started complaining about a spread of bad language and attitudes , with some driving their children to school rather than allow them on the bus ms capatosto said the school had an outbreak of lice last year and ringworm this year dr olcott said more and more children show up without their homework done we have remedial programs , he said we have special ed we can do that for 5 or 10 extra kids , but we ca n't do it for 25 as a result , he threatened last month to file a lawsuit against the county , but later decided to try negotiating he said talks were promising , but we 're reserving the right to proceed through the courts along with the nearby hampton bays district , tuckahoe filed suit over the same issue in 1992 , settling a year later when the county agreed to make its best effort to resolve the imbalance in placement of the homeless the economy improved and homelessness dropped , but last year s economic slump has once again dictated the need to address this , said kevin seaman , a stony brook attorney who represents dozens of schools , including tuckahoe kate ventura , director of the state technical and education assistance center for homeless students in central islip , said the problem would be worse if federal law did not allow homeless children to attend either their original school or one near their emergency shelter a majority of the families in tuckahoe opt to stay in their school district of origin because they do not intend to live permanently on the east end , she said suffolk s largest homeless shelter , known as help suffolk , is in the south country school district in brookhaven town it houses 76 families and sends some 200 children into schools there , ms ventura said she said south country is much larger and able to absorb them more easily if tuckahoe decides to sue again , mr seaman said he would argue that the county violated the 1993 settlement by not finding some other form of emergency housing what has the county been doing for the past 10 years \? he asked rhetorically using the same model nothing s changed mr nowak said the settlement permits use of motels when the county has an unforeseen rise in need i would suggest a 100percent increase in three years constitutes an unforeseen rise , he said we 've worked diligently to add shelter space and just cannot keep up with that crush of applications the county also contracts with 35 nonprofit agencies providing 380 spaces in facilities ranging from group homes to apartment buildings but the poor economy and highpriced real estate are conspiring to keep the homeless in shelters for longer the average stay was 4 to 5 months in 1999 , but has risen to 11 months now , he said photo on a typical day , rebecca capatosto , the tuckahoe school nurse , serves breakfast to 30 homeless children from motels on montauk highway in southampton she also hands out warm coats to those who need them \( deirdre brennan for the new york times \)

mayor michael r bloomberg signed legislation yesterday raising new york city s property tax rates for the first time in more than a decade , during an unusual earlymorning bill signing and public hearing at city hall no one testified for or against the 185 percent property tax rate increase which is expected to raise an extra 837 million this year for the city at the public hearing some tax opponents said that nobody testified because the hearing was held so early in the morning at 7 30 am on the monday after the thanksgiving weekend aides to mr bloomberg offered two reasons for the early hour they said that the hearing had to be held early so that the new law could be taken to albany and registered with the secretary of state as quickly as possible , to allow the city s january tax bills to be sent out and they said that the mayor had a busy schedule yesterday mayor bloomberg said that the absence of people testifying about the bill suggested that most new yorkers understood that the city needed to take tough steps to close a budget gap that had grown to 1 billion this year and a projected 64 billion next year well , there was nobody that came this morning and wanted to testify , he said later in the day i think that that says that most people understand the fact of the matter is we have a national recession , we have a law that requires us to balance the budget the tax revenues were n't there the effects of the property tax increase will depend on where people live people living in an average singlefamily home will see their tax bills rise to 2 , 024 from 1 , 853 people in an average coop will see their bills go to 2 , 931 from 2 , 683 people in condominiums will see an average rise to 4 , 939 from 4 , 521 the increases will be larger next year , when they will be in effect for a full fiscal year instead of half a year people only occasionally comment at the public hearings that precede bill signings but members of several industry and civic groups said that they thought the timing of yesterday s signing discouraged testimony on the tax increase was n't that in part the purpose of having it at 7 30 in the first place , not to have people comment \? asked john doyle , the vice president for government affairs at the real estate board of new york , a trade organization that fought the increase but there were a number of people present to watch the signing of a second bill updating the city s electrical code , although none testified about it mr doyle was actually the only person in the city to testify officially against the increase when the city council approved the increase on nov 25 , after giving the public only a few hours' warning of when they planned to do so , its finance committee heard testimony from just eight people mr doyle opposed the increase , while seven advocates for children and other groups whose services were being protected from budget cuts testified in favor of it the council approved the increase by a vote of 41 to 6 aides to mr bloomberg said that they scheduled the bill signing for 7 30 am yesterday for two reasons they said that by law , the mayor must wait several days after the council passes a bill before signing it into law and they said that while they could have technically held the billsigning ceremony on sunday , they thought it would have been even less accessible to the public during the holiday weekend so they held it at 7 30 am because it fit the mayor s schedule and would allow them to get the bill to albany quickly the bill , which was sent to albany in the care of a city official via an amtrak train that left new york city at nearly noon , was not registered at the secretary of state s office until 2 45 pm aides said that it took the city s law department more than two hours to process the bill before its journey to the capital by yesterday afternoon the higher tax bills were provided to mortgage servicing companies , which handle the bills for about 450 , 000 homeowners beginning today , the bills will be mailed to people who pay their property taxes twice a year , whose bills are due jan 1 , and then to those who pay quarterly , whose bills are due on jan 15 the bills will be sent with a note about an 185 percent increase in your taxes effective january 1 , 2003 , which is needed to help close the city s budget gap it was an unusual bill signing the mayor and several of his top deputies sipped from coffee cups throughout the ceremony the councilman who had introduced the bill at the request of the mayor , david i weprin , chairman of the finance committee , was absent speaker gifford miller and several other councilmen were present , though mayor bloomberg described the tax bill last week as probably the largest property tax increase in the history of the city after he signed it into law , taking care to use several ballpoint pens , he wondered whether to follow through on the city hall tradition of passing the pens out to colleagues i'm not sure anybody wants one of these pens , he said , giving them to the council members present

onetime syndicated series that shared the talentcontest format wednesday s twohour finale of the series attracted nearly 23 million total viewers , better than any other show this summer as well as previous summer hits like abc s who wants to be a millionaire and fear factor on nbc only the blockbuster cbs hit survivor performed better in its first season the success of american idol was partly fueled by relentless promotion by fox , but it also received huge attention from competing media outlets , including cnn and even the today show of nbc news , which had weekly features about the show , including an exclusive arrangement for the first interviews with the contestants fox executives said the show proved that the network , known in the past for more outrageous fare like temptation island and when animals attack could generate enormous ratings for a program that was completely advertiser friendly , as sandy grushow , the chairman of fox entertainment , put it advertisers are going to be knocking down doors to buy into this show , mr grushow added , citing its results with the younger viewers that advertisers pay a premium to reach this is a huge show for the network and the corporation fox , which is owned by the news corporation , suffered audience declines during the last season and has been a soft spot in the company s overall performance without disclosing specific figures , the network said the show was already profitable from its summer run fox will also share in the money generated by the fame of the individual performers their careers will be managed by a company called 19 management , which is owned by simon fuller , the same man who created the show in england \( and is the impresario behind acts like the spice girls \) ratings for american idol grew throughout its threemonth summer run , but they exploded over the last three weeks the peak was reached in this week s two telecasts , when the finalists , justin guarini and kelly clarkson , vied for the title that victory came with a recording contract from rca records , which will be produced by the music industry executive simon cowell , who became a celebrity himself on the show as the meanspirited talent judge more than 40 million watched some part of the finale wednesday night , the biggest total for an entertainment show in fox history the average audience of just under 23 million for the night of programming was only fractionally less than the record for a night of fox entertainment programming , which was set in 1991 by episodes of the simpsons and beverly hills 90210 among fox s main audience groups , the show fared even better it reached 30 percent of the audience between the ages of 18 and 49 the highest share ever for a fox show with that group and did even better among those from 18 to 34 , by posting a 35 share during the last halfhour , the show reached almost half the female teenage viewers in the country all those viewers are extremely desirable for most advertisers in addition to the regular sponsors , cocacola and ford motor , which had extensive product placements during the series , there were commercials from companies like directv domino s pizza gap inc \( old navy \) hershey foods johnson johnson \( acuvue contact lenses , neutrogena \) levi strauss procter gamble \( cover girl \) sprint tmobile , formerly voicestream and yum brands , formerly tricon global restaurants \( kfc \) cocacola created a special commercial that ran near the end of the twohour show , before the winner was declared , which saluted the two finalists with the words good luck kelly and justin from your friends at cocacola also during the finale episode , there were numerous commercials for movies and current dvd releases from film studios like columbia pictures , disney , dreamworks , mgm , new line and paramount , in addition to 20th century fox , the sibling of fox fox sought to take full advantage of the large audience , using the show to promote its new series for the 200203 season like cedric the entertainer presents and girls club indeed , gail berman , the president of fox entertainment , said , our goal beyond finding an advertiserfriendly reality series was to build a platform to launch our fall shows fox will try to take more immediate advantage of the show s popularity by bringing back the 30 participants from the singing contest for a special concert show in las vegas on sept 23 the week before , on sept 17 , a single by ms clarkson is expected to be released , while her fulllength cd will come out on nov 26 a

washingtonbased charity , champions of hope , to perform the national anthem next week during a sept 11 commemoration at the lincoln memorial fox executives made a point yesterday of distancing themselves from that decision , which has spurred some criticism for mixing marketing with a day of mourning none of the officials would comment on the record , but one senior fox executive said the decision seemed unwise because it could be seen as exploitative i hope she reconsiders that one , the senior fox executive said the next edition of american idol may incorporate some changes to the format it is possible that the show could expand to two separate hours a week instead of a onehour show followed by a halfhour the next night fox executives said they had learned from the experience of abc s millionaire , which suffered from overexposure when the network put it into the regular prime time lineup and played it as many as four times a week they said they would instead emulate cbs s handling of survivor , which has played successfully in limitedrun editions the last two seasons photos friends of the american idol winner kelly clarkson , from left , mary mcconnell , april shaw ,

the poet and philosopher dante alighieri lived seven centuries ago , and his magnum opus , a long narrative poem , combined metaphysics and current events into an allegory of human sin , suffering and redemption not exactly a recipe for a pop culture hero , is it \? yet at various times during the 19th century , a kind of dantemania seized the theaters , art galleries and concert halls of europe instead of the greek gods and heroes who were the favorite subject of the aristocracy , the new middleclass audience preferred stories from the great humanist writers whose works bracketed the renaissance dante and shakespeare on friday at avery fisher hall , the american symphony orchestra , conducted by its music director , leon botstein , will perform two rarely heard works by wellknown composers , each a product of that dante boom liszt s symphony on dante s 'divine comedy' and rachmaninoff s oneact opera francesca da rimini as a source for stageworthy plots , dante s commedia \( not called divina commedia until at least 200 years after his death \) is no match for the shakespeare canon in fact , since the characters the poet encounters were mostly real people , as familiar to his first readers as o j simpson is to us , he rarely tells their stories at all but merely alludes to them and meditates on their sins none of which has prevented numerous librettists from elaborating a few lines of the poem into a fouract opera and labeling it after dante \( way after \) donizetti s pia de' tolomei and puccini s gianni schicchi were produced more or less in this manner dante does linger a bit over one story in canto v of inferno , the poem s first section led by the shade of virgil down to the second circle of hell , the poet observes the souls of illicit lovers \( including tristan and isolde \) , buffeted by howling winds he beckons one couple , who turn out to be francesca da rimini and her brotherinlaw paolo caught enjoying their first kiss , inspired by a reading of the story of lancelot and guinevere , they were murdered by francesca s husband the poet is so overcome with grief and pity for the pair that he swoons and falls like a dead body if any subject could be expected to fire the romantic imagination , this 13thcentury tabloid headline of starcrossed lovers was it so many writers and musicians seized on it that it created a francesca craze , in mr botstein s words between 1823 and 1848 alone , at least 21 different operas on the subject were composed and staged this phenomenon could not have escaped notice by the pianist and master showman franz liszt , who kept listeners well supplied with dazzling keyboard fantasies on hit tunes from current operas the opera audience was his audience , mr botstein said recently early versions of liszt s sonata after a reading of dante , for piano , date from this period in 1856 , when he had retired from recital tours and was conducting the weimar court orchestra , he realized his longplanned dante symphony as a companion piece to his faust symphony of two years before the dante symphony is an ambitious work in two movements , inferno and purgatorio , with a suggestion of dante s paradiso in the heavenly chorus that concludes the second movement the inferno movement , like the dante sonata , shows a romantic fascination with the hellishly macabre and grotesque , strongly contrasted with the youth and tenderness of francesca , the most innocent of sinners for his infernal scene , liszt borrowed orchestral effects from berlioz \( muffled timpani and bassdrum rolls \) and made up some of his own \( deep clarinet trills , labeled blasphemous laughter \) he even considered including a wind machine but decided instead to depict the winds of hell musically , by a swirl of chromatic scales the harmonies produced by such scales , here and in other liszt works , may well have influenced wagner s later operas the symphony s purgatorio movement , though slow and meditative , is fundamentally optimistic , depicting the soul s hope of a higher state one possible reason for the symphony s neglect is that large sections of purgatorio seem rather lax and disjointed , without much going on musically , as if one were listening to a movie soundtrack without the pictures that s just what it is , almost liszt originally imagined a multimedia performance of the work , with magiclantern projections of commedia illustrations by his contemporary bonaventura gemelli no such presentation ever happened , but mr botstein suggests that 19thcentury listeners had the ability to call up mental images on their own as they listened , a skill largely lost in the visually saturated society of today the conclusion of the dante symphony lends a touch of suspense to the american symphony concert on friday , since liszt vacillated on how to end the piece , leaving the conductor two choices liszt originally ended it in a blaze of heavenly glory , fortissimo when wagner heard this \( by his account \) , he shouted at liszt no , not that ! away with it ! no majestic deity leave us with the fine soft shimmer liszt supposedly replied you are right it shall be as you wish but the piece was published with the loud ending and a note in the score , during a hushed passage a few bars earlier , vielleicht hier schliessen \( maybe end here \) some conductors do just that , but mr botstein says he plans to play the loud ending , which he calls very lisztian he reserves the right , however , to change his mind during rehearsals
boston jeremiah e burke high school earned a dubious distinction in the spring of 1995 it became the first massachusetts public high school in recent memory to lose accreditation in the opinion of an independent panel of educators , burke was failing its students who numbered more than 1 , 000 , nearly all black in measurements of everything from the number of working water fountains \( almost none \) to standardized test scores over the next six years , the school used an infusion of nearly 5 million from the state and the city to cut average class sizes \( to 20 , from 34 \) and to offer an array of new courses \( including advanced placement physics and calculus \) in just four years beginning in 1996 , those remedies helped raise average test scores among ninth graders seven percentile points in reading , to the 40th percentile , and an enormous 39 in math , to the 64th , compared with a national sample the burke , as it is known in its dorchester neighborhood and throughout the rest of boston , regained its accreditation in 1998 , sparing itself the final , most drastic step in the nonaccreditation process closing its comeback has been honored repeatedly , most recently just last month in atlanta , where laura bush looked on as the school received an inspiration award from the college board as one of the nation s most improved high schools at a time when hundreds of schools risk being designated failures under the federal government s no child left behind act \( championed by no less a figure than mrs bush s husband \) , the burke s experience is a vivid example of how a school can use its own public humiliation as motivation to begin to turn itself around there is , however , another lesson here , and it is far less inspirational like an alcoholic , a school that has escaped the label of failing can never let down its guard nor can the community that supports it if they do , they risk losing all they have gained indeed , as darrius sutherland , a 17yearold burke senior , stood near mrs bush on that podium in atlanta to accept the college board award on behalf of his school , he knew something that the first lady most likely did not there were fresh signs that the burke was in trouble as a result of state and city budget cuts at the beginning of the school year , burke high school had to eliminate the jobs of 12 of the 24 teachers and aides it had hired over six years to spur its comeback , including two in math and one in computer science barring intervention by the superintendent , the remaining 12 positions could be cut by next school year already class sizes have ballooned to 30 , and disciplinary incidents are up by a quarter from last year when he returned from atlanta last month , mr sutherland learned that the school had been emptied by two fire alarms while he was gone , both a result of pranks while i was out making that speech , talking about how far we 've come , they were taking steps backward up here , said mr sutherland , a railthin young man who is applying to the university of texas and to clemson , among other colleges the school s headmaster , carol bradley moore , has vowed to fight the cuts , but the burke s political leverage has slipped since 1995 the school obtained additional resources then partly because parents and community members had sought out the federal office of civil rights to put pressure on the city but the agreement that federal monitors helped arrange was only for five years , and it expired in 2000 the burke may also be suffering for its recent success , however relative on the state s new battery of standardized tests known as mcas and introduced the year the school got its accreditation back 42 percent of burke students passed the english test earlier this year , compared with 10 percent in 1998 36 percent passed the math test this year , compared with 7 percent in 1998 those numbers remain well below citywide averages , but at a time when the state is trying to close a budget gap that by some estimates is as much as 4 billion , the burke may not be deemed so needy anymore then again , the school has received much attention for its progress not only has it been saluted by the college board , but a number of urban educators have visited its campus seeking to replicate its turnaround thomas payzant , the schools superintendent in boston , said he was very worried about stunting progress at the school , but feared he could spare it only so much i'm trying to strike that balance , mr payzant said , between being sensitive to the particular history of the burke and , in this context of great fiscal uncertainty , trying to minimize the impact on them while doing the same for the 133 other schools in the city drawing \( david suter \)
beijing , july 25 in one of the biggest stock market debuts anywhere in the world this year , shares of the hong kong unit of the bank of china began trading publicly today they promptly fell 47 percent on heavy selling by hong kong residents the initial price for the offering was set last saturday since then , markets around the world have weakened , and the hang seng index , the main barometer of hong kong stocks , has fallen by 43 percent , so today s movement in the bank stock caught up with the broader market still , the offering , which raised 195 billion hong kong dollars \( 25 billion \) , was a milestone for china , the first international stock listing by a mainland bank in it , the stateowned bank of china sold 22 percent of the shares in its hong kong unit , which is the territory s largest lender and its secondlargest taker of deposits the chinese government has been actively selling stakes in stateowned enterprises even when stock markets have been weak , in the hope that partial private ownership will improve the business practices at the companies china telecom , the nearmonopoly provider of fixedline phone service in southern china , is preparing an even larger initial public offering for later this year about a third of the shares in the bank of china offering were set aside for retail investors living in hong kong to buy at a 5 percent discount the rest were sold to institutions and foreigners at full price the discount allocation , a common feature in large privatizations around the world , prompted a frenzy of activity over the last three weeks residents filed 385 , 000 applications for shares , a huge number in a territory of 68 million people trading opened today near the full offering price , 85 hong kong dollars \( 109 \) a share , but the price eroded during the day , to close at 810 hong kong dollars , barely above the discount price retail investors paid analysts said the bank of china and its underwriters had been lucky that financial markets in new york rebounded so strongly on wednesday the hang seng , which lost heavily before the american rebound on wednesday , inched down only 09 percent today the timing was quite fortunate given what happened in the us markets overnight otherwise the results could have been quite a bit worse , said patrick vizzone , a director of commercial economics asia , a hong kong consulting firm local corporate and institutional investors were not so lucky more than a dozen companies that are trying to expand in mainland china and want to impress beijing , led by the standard chartered bank , agreed in advance to buy large blocks of stock in the initial public offering instead of waiting to buy it from retail investors during the early trading large institutional investors around the world were also buyers some through a private placement of the stock today in the united states on the expectation that the stock would soon be included in the hang seng index and in a widely followed index published by morgan stanley capital international traders said the stock fell despite heavy buying by the underwriters to support it the lead underwriters were goldman , sachs ubs warburg and bank of china international holdings , another arm of the parent bank in beijing because of strong demand in the days before trading began , the underwriters actually sold 15 percent more shares than the bank of china initially sold , with all of the extra shares going to institutional investors they must cover the difference within 30 days , either by buying shares in the open market or by having the bank of china issue more stock to them at the institutional price despite the firstday drop , investors still valued the hong kong unit of the bank of china higher than american institutions like j p morgan and citigroup , as measured by the ratio of stock price to book value yet 95 percent of the unit s loan assets are classified as nonperforming , even after the government took some bad loans off its books that is nearly twice the average for hong kong banks and six times that of american banks none of the proceeds of the offer will remain in the hong kong unit as fresh capital it will instead go to the parent bank , whose nonperformingloan burden is higher still henry lee , managing director of the hendale group , a hong kong money management company , said the crucial question now was whether the stock would fall below 8 hong kong dollars a share if they break that , it may not come back up above that level soon , he said if it does fall that far , the bank of china risks antagonizing hong kong residents despite the retail discount although trading was fairly heavy today , equal to onesixth of all the newly issued shares , many people at one hong kong brokerage office were holding on to their stakes wait and see is my approach , and i 'll only sell it when it goes up to 860 , said chan yeeting , 52 , who described herself as a housewife it s a longterm investment for me photo liu mingkang , center , chairman of bank of china , toasts with members of the hong kong exchange \( reuters \)
martinsville , va for most of its recent life , this small town in the foothills of the blue ridge mountains has had a hard time luring new business the textile and furniture factories closed or migrated overseas , and martinsville was simply too isolated to attract others after sept 11 , officials here and in some other small towns hoped that this very liability could be transformed into something valuable to sell corporate america safety which is why a threestory granite building abandoned two years ago by a bankrupt textile corporation was recently turned into what martinsville is calling a disaster recovery center in the vision of the town s planners , the center , smelling of fresh paint and new carpeting , would hold copies of vital electronic databases for big city companies that could lose their information in terrorist attacks it s for companies who need a remote offsite location for data recovery and data backup services , said thomas l harned , director for economic development in martinsville it could be terrorism , hurricane , flood they like to have sites that are physically remote from their main operations we are actively working with some potential clients to develop that as a marketing niche for this area but for all its efforts , martinsville may wait a long time for new business arising from the threat of terrorism , even as the national economy starts to turn around while some new businesses have moved to town , none have come out of fear of attacks in an otherwise fastgrowing state , martinsville s population sank 46 percent in the 1990 s , to 15 , 416 , and unemployment is about 20 percent at the same time , the fear of attack is so remote here that no guards , badges or metal detectors control access to public buildings , and visitors roam them uninspected and unimpeded that atmosphere , some corporate relocation consultants say , should , in theory , be an enticement to some companies looking for security there s more focus on risk natural disaster risk and humaninduced risk , said dennis j donovan , director of global site selection services at the wadleydonovan group , part of the grubb ellis company we are being instructed by our clients now to look at the proximity to nuclear power plants , other electrical generation facilities , natural gas pipelines , water treatment plants , bridges and major tourist facilities some companies might also weigh the rising cost of property insurance in places considered exposed to terrorism , some experts said premiums being charged building owners in new york city have soared since the attacks it s a riskmanagement issue , said jim schriner , a partner and relocation consultant at deloitte touche , the accounting firm before sept 11 , mr schriner said , property insurance was a minor consideration now it could be a heavy burden for tenants of skyscrapers and businesses near military installations , for example nobody thought it was possible to lose an entire building or to lose access to your building , mr schriner said but how far away companies will be willing to go remains an open question , as some entrepreneurs have found in kingston , ny , only an hour and a half up the hudson from new york , alan ginsberg , who owns 25 million square feet of abandoned ibm buildings , envisions selling much of it to companies for data storage immediately after sept 11 , the phone was ringing off the hook , mr ginsberg said people we had never heard of were asking about a data center , he said but nothing materialized they decided to stay in new york or go to new jersey with the recession apparently over , mr ginsberg said , interest in the site is picking up , but he still has no new tenants in the only occupied office in martinsville s newly renovated building , tommy rogers , former director of technologies for bassett furniture industries , is leading the city s effort to establish the disaster recovery center with a good disaster recovery plan , mr rogers said , a company in richmond or arlington , va , or closer in greensboro or raleigh , nc , would transmit copies of all its data to a computer it would install here an employee at the faroff office , mr rogers said , would not even know he s communicating with another site martinsville and other small towns were initially wary of appearing to exploit the tragedies in new york and washington and have courted new business gingerly we 'd never try to market an area to the detriment of another , said mr harned , martinsville s economic development director but i think our message is implicit when we talk about the quality of life , public safety is a part of it in bottineau , nd , population 3 , 000 , officials have been speaking the same language the attacks made everybody stop back and look at our country as a whole , said dean ihla , executive director of the bottineau chamber of commerce what may have been perceived as isolation in the past is safety and security photo tommy rogers , who is leading the effort of martinsville , va , to store copies of vital electronic databases , and david reeves , who is managing the building

garden city , ny , feb 6 although nassau county residents already pay among the nation s highest property and sales taxes , some people are proposing yet another tax on personal income a coalition of civic groups has been pushing for a county income tax for a couple of years , as a way of lowering onerous property taxes but the debate has heated up in recent days as nassau struggles to close a staggering budget gap , which the new county executive , thomas r suozzi , says could reach 428 million in four years today , mr suozzi steadfastly refused to rule out , or rule in , an income tax everything is on the table in seeking solutions , mr suozzi said today in an interview he has agreed to meet soon to hear the advocates' pitch for the income tax , though he would not say whether he was seriously considering the concept one of mr suozzi s fellow democrats , lisanne g altmann , chairwoman of the county legislature s budget review committee , today released an analysis of potential income tax revenues she had requested from the office of legislative budget review it s a fairer way if it s coupled to a rollback in property taxes , she said already there are skeptics and outright opponents who reject the idea as unacceptable , not to mention political suicide an income tax would require state approval , which the governor and legislature would be reluctant to grant , especially since they are all up for reelection this year although mr suozzi imposed a tax increase and reassessment when he took over as mayor of deficitridden glen cove eight years ago , most politicians here doubt that he aspires to have an income tax as one of his first major accomplishments as county executive an income tax may be a much fairer , better tax , but i think the public would go nuts over it , said a longtime democratic party figure , speaking only on the condition of anonymity intriguingly , a working families party official , donald shaffer , said that at a candidate screening last spring , mr suozzi said he supported the idea of a progressive income tax in principle , and was seriously considering it mr suozzi s aides said then that they would follow up on the issue but never called back , mr shaffer said mr suozzi would not comment on mr shaffer s account none of the resistance has stopped the incometax advocates they include a variety of religious , charitable , political and civic groups like the long island council of churches , the health and welfare council of long island , the long island progressive coalition , the long island neighborhood network , the new york state tenants and neighbors coalition and the working families party they say that a small income tax would produce enough revenue to cut the county property tax , with enough left over to help bail nassau out of its budget crisis why shift from the property tax to an income tax \? the proponents contend that an income tax based on the ability to pay is fairer , alleviating the burden on retirees and others with limited incomes also , as income rises over time , tax revenues will also rise without changing the tax rate a leader of the incometax advocates , lisa tyson , said the coalition had lobbied democratic and republican legislators and found many of them interested , although often skittish politically the coalition s proposal calls for a 025 percent tax onefourth of 1 percent on taxable income , and a 1 percent tax for income over 100 , 000 the county share of the property tax would be reduced onefifth the coalition estimates that most homeowners would have a net savings
kabul , afghanistan , feb 22 in a corner of this ruined city , a group of british soldiers paused from their peacekeeping duties to remember their fallen compatriots who had come to conquer decades ago about 100 british soldiers looked on today while an honor guard lay poppy wreaths before the graves of soldiers killed during the british empire s futile efforts to subdue the afghans in the 19th and 20th centuries the ceremony was rich in historical paradox , with the invaders returning as peacemakers , and the peacemakers summoning a nostalgia for the days when their military prowess secured them a foothold in nearly every corner of the globe a gurkha band played magisterial tunes , a pair of chaplains blessed the honored dead , and none other than maj gen john mccoll of britain , the head of the multinational force trying to preserve order here , gave a stiff salute local afghans , shut outside the cemetery , peered over the high walls and from windows and rooftops , sitting in silence as the british prayed aloud and sang god save the queen i would n't dwell on the irony , general mccoll said i would focus on the peace and the progress that allows us , as christians , to be here i would dwell on the tolerance and freedom that we 've achieved here that allows each to go about his own business many of those who were recalled today , like wouldbe conquerors before and after them , died violently at the hands of the afghans , whose victories in the first and second angloafghan wars in the 19th century helped cement their reputation as a fierce and unconquerable lot after several tries the british gave up the cover of the program for today s ceremony showed a lithograph of an exhausted and bedraggled dr william brydon , the only survivor from a force of 17 , 000 british troops who tried to retreat from kabul in january 1842 the afghans slaughtered the rest , firing at them from crags and passes lining the route the kabul graveyard formed part of the british military cantonment between 1839 and 1842 , during the first angloafghan war only 158 of the british who died during the angloafghan wars are buried in the cemetery here , known locally as the white graveyard for the exclusive presence of western dead a handful of the gravestones , cracked and broken during a hard freeze in 1978 , were reassembled and set against the cemetery s southern wall one of them read , in memory of cecil h gaisford , lieut 72nd highlanders , killed in action in asmai highlands , dec 1879 unlike many countries , britain frequently left its soldiers who were killed in foreign wars buried in the countries where they fell each year , the british government spends considerable sums to maintain military cemeteries overseas , mainly for soldiers killed in the two world wars since arriving here in december , the british have begun refurbishing the white cemetery , digging a new well to water the dying grass and paying the impoverished custodian , rahimullah , for the first time in years the cemetery was hit by rockets during the long years of civil warfare here , and it is greatly in need of repair to help defray some of the costs , soldiers took up a collection at the ceremony in a few minutes a british military beret was stuffed with american dollars despite the political sensitivity of its current mission to afghanistan , the british soldiers allowed themselves to indulge in a bit of nostalgia , with readings from a text about the afghan wars that seemed written in an era when the imperialist enterprise was unburdened by selfdoubt one passage concerned sgt j a drummond and lt s t john forbes , who were killed on dec 13 , 1879 , by afghan warriors known as ghazis the sergeant was shot down , and lieutenant forbes rushed forward to save his body from mutilation , one of the soldiers at the ceremony read aloud after cutting down a ghazi , he was overpowered and killed before the highlanders could save him not a man of the ghazis who turned back escaped they were shot and bayoneted on the rocks sergeant drummond and lieutenant forbes are buried in the kabul cemetery a ghurka bugler played last post and reveille , and the assembled crowd was silent for two minutes to remember the dead much of the service involved in bestowing upon the living and the dead a holy sanction for their efforts the two chaplains , one catholic and one anglican , read aloud prayers and inspirational texts blessing those at hand one of the most moving came not from the bible but from high fantasy the rev david steele , the anglican chaplain , read a passage adapted from the lord of the rings , extolling the soldier s thankless task of protecting his country the speech seemed to resonate with the soldiers assembled in the graveyard , who are working to hold together this fractious city after so many years of anarchy and death lord god , we are soldiers in order to protect peace and freedom the nation would have known them little but for us , mr steele said to the group what safety could there be in quiet lands , or in the homes of simple men at night , if we soldiers were all asleep or gone \? photo a british soldier saluted

washington , april 26 in an email message sent last year while the bush administration was formulating a national energy policy , a senior energy department official posed this question to a lobbyist for a major natural gas interest if you were king , or il duce , what would you include in a national energy policy , especially with respect to natural gas issues \? the message was sent by joseph kelliher , who was a political appointee in the energy department last spring , mr kelliher was a major contributor to vice president dick cheney s energy task force mr kelliher s invitation for input was seized by the lobbyist , dana contratto , who responded with an array of proindustry proposals the email exchange was released on thursday night by the energy department in response to freedom of information act lawsuits brought by judicial watch and the natural resources defense council both groups had sued the bush administration for records about white house energy policy jeanne lopatto , a spokeswoman for the energy department , described mr contratto as an expert on natural gas issues he has a fine reputation for independent thinking , ms lopatto said the administration had two basic choices on how to develop a national energy policy it could close its doors and shut its ears and turn off its phones and write a national energy policy in isolation , or it could consult with experts , listen to the public and incorporate the good ideas and reject the bad ideas mr contratto , a partner with the law and lobbying firm crowell moring , suggested several new initiatives , including that the administration endorse an increase in the gas transmission operating pressures with higher pressures , more gas moves , mr contratto wrote in the march 22 , 2001 , message obviously , some pipelines could not handle such higher pressures , but new pipelines could be built to move more gas at such higher pressures ms lopatto said that none of mr contratto s suggestions were incorporated in the national energy report the memorandums with the reference to mr kelliher s request for information had been released several weeks ago , but at that time mr kelliher s invitation for suggestions had been whited out of course , i'm glad that the energy department corrected their previous error , said sharon buccino , a senior lawyer at the natural resources defense council i wish that they had done it right the first time , in compliance with the judge s order and before the senate passed its energy bill ms lopatto said mr kelliher s email messages had been inadvertently redacted by the justice department a federal judge had ordered the departments of commerce , energy and transportation to release the documents earlier this year the messages were part of the batch of 400 pages of documents that were released late thursday by the energy department
it has been three summers since james houghton took over as artistic director of the venerable eugene o'neill theater center in waterford , a universal model for play development centers that is time enough to test the prophesy that mr houghton made at the time the o'neill is about to be born again , he announced in his second summer as executive director here , howard sherman is convinced that the center is reborn indeed while mr houghton has n't changed his prediction , he has been busy changing the way things were mr sherman succeeded george white , who founded the o'neill in 1964 the following year , mr white began the playwright s conference , the center s mainstay , with lloyd richards , its first artistic director clearly , both mr houghton and mr sherman carry the torch of creators who stayed around a very long time being venerable comes at a price in the case of a 37yearold institution , the cost can be creakiness , burnout , fatigue , a falloff in attendance at events held for the public talk about creakiness or in this case , exclusivity and the dusty chill of academia , why abide by the designation conference \? mr sherman means to redefine a forbidding word no one can think of a better overall word for our program , he said we 're not a festival we 're not about performance we 're about process we 're open , we 're welcoming and we 're here , so come to the conference and participate through the years , the o'neill has expanded its vision of the arts now 25 years old , the national music theater conference is presenting three new musicals next month and the puppetry conference completed its 12th year on june 15 a suspended cabaret program is being rethought howard is getting the word out , about what goes on here , mr houghton said , with a resulting increase in attendance when they talk of the future of the o'neill , creating networks , cultivating resources , carrying out new programs , are mr houghton s and mr sherman s most recurring phrases their favored words , immersion , interacting , broadening and renewing this summer , informal onehour talks by the resource of the day make up the second part of a twohour lunch break one afternoon two weeks ago , that resource was august wilson , many of whose nowclassic plays were born at the o'neill and nurtured by mr richards , his longtime collaborator among other recent playwrights who lunched and talked , were a r gurney and horton foote in addition to the established national theater institute , an accredited semesterlong undergraduate course for students , other new programs have begun residencies , often referred to as retreats , are offered to high school teachers in the state and to trustees on the boards of regional theaters across the country when , inevitably , there is talk of the endangered state of the arts , live theater is invariably relegated to the highest ranks of victimhood , but mr sherman does n't want to hear it the experience of a group gathering to see and hear another group tell a story is powerful , he said it s about the words and the music we have movies and books and theme parks we 're always battling an evergrowing list of new options , but none have the immediacy of theater at its most fundamental level how many thousands of years have we had it \? oddly , one word mr houghton may not want to hear is development seeking the essence of creation , he said writing must be celebrated before rewriting sets in we want to allow our plays to evolve , rather than develop , he said with so many play development centers around , writers have become conditioned to write for others , to respond to the response there is too much feedback the experience should be organic , primarily visceral , free flowing the play is the experience the writer is at the center too many systems have been in place for too many years they 're not working we 're killing our playwrights by making everything too clear we need a shift that will make an impact over time , a way to allow the play to speak for itself conceding that play submission was known as a cold process at the center , mr houghton has radically revised the selection procedure for this summer s conference , 700 plays were submitted there were multiple readings of each by 80 theater professionals the number of plays was winnowed down to 150 , then 45 , finally to 15 remaining public performances of these playsinprogress end next sunday in the early days , mr houghton said , playwrights were just invited to come up here s where john guare began 'house of blue leaves' and lanford wilson , 'lemon sky' mr houghton is reinstating such invitations , limited to two or three a year august wilson , who is writing his newest play , gem of the ocean at the center , is one of four writersinresidence this summer so is the 21yearold playwright julia jarcho they serve each other , share their writing , mr houghton said with one a major force , the other a beginner , the work of two generations is informed by how the other sees the world it is all in the act of and for the art of playmaking here we can put aside the chaos , the craziness of our ordinary lives when things go awry and get screwy , because a playwright or a director or an actor gets , let s say , overly zealous , he said we need a balanced view of the act of creation and concentrate on why we all got into this in the first place for tickets to remaining performances at the o'neill center , call the box office \( 860 \) 4431238 photos clockwise from top mat smart , left , a playwright , with steven williford , a director james houghton , left , and howard sherman of the o'neill center taking part in a discussion august wilson reading his new play \( photographs by a vincent scarano \)

los angeles churches sometimes channel their spiritual message informally through a few touchable details in september , the cathedral of our lady of the angels opened in downtown los angeles , and parishioners are already reaching out to the small chinese turtle , the spreadwinged chumash condor and the other figures on the great bronze doors at the entrance , created by the los angelesbased sculptor robert graham visitors tentatively rub the archaic religious symbols in an instinctive gesture , as though making physical contact with wonder some bring their fingers to their lips for a devotional kiss mothers have lifted their babies to the reliefs so that they can feel the church , which was designed by the spanish architect rafael moneo the talismanic gates , made for this , the first roman catholic cathedral to be built in the united states in 40 years , invite visitors into an intimate relationship with the sacred a monument within a monument , mr graham s 25ton gates are made up of a pair of 15foottall decorated doors centered at the bottom of a larger pair that are 20feet tall and 30 feet wide the turtle , condor and some 40 other figures associated with ancient cultures occupy the smaller doors , along with a halfdozen tablets depicting various virgin marys from different latin american cultures the virgin of guadalupe , with her thornless roses , prays above the virgin of the rosary of chichinquira she in turn reigns in two panels opposite the virgin of loreto , who , in her flaring dress , hovers above flying angels both sets of doors pivot independently beneath a bronze tympanum , a recessed space that that frames mr graham s interpretation of the virgin here she is a serene and regal eightfoottall figure that leans forward , eyes closed , arms outstretched , palms up in an attitude of spiritual surrender she floats above a luminous crescent moon , under a gilded circle that glows like a halo in the dependable southern california sun mr graham has given the virgin ambiguous features , nearly as multicultural as los angeles itself a caucasian nose , asian eyes , african lips , thick american indian hair she has none of the aristocratic fragility that is often depicted in european paintings this new virgin of the americas might be local , just off the boardwalk at venice beach , or fresh from the fields in the central valley with this image and his array of ancient religious symbols , mr graham ties this 21stcentury church both to catholic traditions and distant mythology the gates are a rosetta stone suggesting translations of faith between cultures lorenzo ghiberti s 15thcentury gates of paradise at the baptistry in florence , italy , are perhaps the best known bronze gates in a long and venerable catholic tradition but in the last 100 years , the tradition has retreated , a casualty of increasingly secular times and withering economics sculptors can no longer afford the artisans needed to produce laborintensive bronze doors mr graham s gates represent four years of work by an unlikely , cigarsmoking artworld figure who subcontracts much of the labor to computer labs mr graham , 64 , earned his pop art credentials in the 1960 s sculpturing wax figures romping on beds in miniature erotic tableaus encased in acrylic boxes in the 1970 s , he switched mediums , and sensibilities , creating with a clinician s eye anatomically perfect , genitally detailed female bronze figures he often portrayed his models with pretzellike limbs , or standing rigid in almost pharaonic poses if seen in natural light , the figures seem ready to spring when he digitized his clay sculptures to translate them to the larger scale necessary in public work , mr graham brought an ancient medium into the 21st century reacting against the commercial gallery scene and what he calls a floating world of objects unrelated to their location , mr graham took on public commissions that gave context to his sculpture recalling the great murals he saw as a child growing up in mexico city , and the frescoes he admired in italy early in his career , mr graham wanted his work to be seen and understood by a wide audience , not just the cognoscenti in 1984 , he created his first nationally prominent sitespecific public sculpture , the two male and female figures that topped a gateway through which the olympic flame was carried into the 1984 los angeles games his belief that art could and should have content beyond its own form was confirmed in 1999 , when his monument to charlie parker in kansas city , mo , was considered as a repository for parker s remains as a reliquary , the monument gained importance , said mr graham , sitting in the haze of his own smoke in his venice studio , looking prophetic in his mane of thick , wavy gray hair a pair of bronze angels that never made it to the cathedral tympanum lay on a table in a roiling heap of baroque drapery and limbs cardinal roger m mahony , archbishop of los angeles , awarded mr graham the commission for the doors in 1998 , commending him not only for his work in the public realm but also for his exceptional sensitivity to the female figure
turin , italy , june 11 paolo fresco likes being no 1 or no 2 to explain why , he quotes , as he often does , his former boss john f welch jr if you 're no 1 or no 2 , mr fresco said today , picking at fish in a fiat corporate dining room , when you get a cold , no 5 and no 6 get pneumonia since fiat s car division was far from being no 1 , he linked it two years ago with the industry leader , general motors now , taking a chapter from mr welch s manual on conglomerates , he intends to use fiat s profitable businesses , like financial services and electrical power , to nurse fiat auto back to health mr fresco put in four decades at general electric , climbing the corporate ladder to be vice chairman under mr welch before joining fiat as chairman three years ago he realizes that as a conglomerate built around an auto business , fiat is an anomaly the only other such company is mitsubishi of japan asked about the corporate logic , he replied , from the point of view of a conglomerate , none but the company started 103 years ago as a carmaker , he said , so first and foremost it was a car business , and then a conglomerate the car unit delivers 45 percent of fiat s revenue , he said but is it necessary \? obviously not whether fiat and its principal shareholders , the agnelli clan , will ultimately exit the car business is the subject of intense speculation these days by mr welch s rules , mr fresco , who assumed the additional role of fiat s chief executive on monday after paolo cantarella resigned , should have dumped fiat auto long ago it turns out fewer than three million cars a year , well behind firsttier players like gm , ford motor and toyota , and it has not reported a profit since 1997 a loss of 429 million euros \( 407 million \) in the first quarter underscored its weakness clearly , the agnelli family wants to keep it anyway if they can i see a unified front , mr fresco said of the family , nobody rowing in a different direction he described gianni agnelli , 81 , the family patriarch , as fiat s point of reference , our spiritual leader if fiat auto is neither no 1 nor no 2 on its own , he said , the alternatives is either to exit the industry or to find a way to participate in market leadership together with the agnellis , he said , he decided that by joining a confederation of automakers around gm including suzuki , isuzu and now daewoo maybe we could get the best of both worlds we believe it gave us the benefits of global leadership , he said , and our independence under the agreement signed in march 2000 , gm exchanged a 57 percent stake in itself for a 20 percent stake in fiat auto and gave fiat a put option that can require gm to buy the remaining 80 percent of fiat auto after 2004 leaving its signature industry would be no simple matter for fiat jobs , and hence politics , in italy would weigh heavily even now , the italian parliament is holding hearings on fiat s future bruno tabacci , a deputy who is chairman of the hearings , estimated in a recent interview that in the last 10 years , fiat received 5 billion in government subsidies and research and development aid there are other intangibles , like the agnellis' attachment to tradition in one sense , the family is already moving out of the car business in recent years , umberto agnelli , gianni agnelli s younger brother , has diversified the family s investments outside fiat and italy , most notably in france ten years ago , fiat accounted for 80 percent of the agnellis' holdings now it is less than half , and fiat auto is onequarter asked about the differences in doing business in america and italy , mr fresco reflected for a moment in america , he said , business is based on simplification forget the details , go to the nuts and bolts of it if you have an issue , you do your homework , you go to the issue , you do it and in italy \? he smiled i made my statement last month , fiat auto s chief executive , giancarlo boschetti , outlined turnaround plans involving cost cuts and cooperation with gm but the core of the strategy by mr boschetti , a marketing expert , is an overhaul of the way fiat sells cars , including a three year plan to spend 450 million euros to strengthen the sales effort in 50 major european cities asked if this was fiat auto s last chance , mr fresco hesitated , then replied with characteristic diplomacy , it s fair to say it s an important moment to see whether we can survive independently in his presentation , mr boschetti stressed the alliance with gm the companies are combining their engine and transmission businesses in europe , buying parts and supplies jointly in europe and latin america , designing shared basic car components and chassis , and trying to merge their consumer finance arms but when asked about recent reports suggesting that gm may want fiat to exercise the put option early , mr fresco replied , i'm not getting the same signal indeed , gm s own european business is having a tough time it lost 767 million in 2001 , and gm took a charge in the first quarter for the cost of turning it around for the moment , said john lawson of schroder salomon smith barney , gm s message to fiat appears to be you do what you feel you have to do to fix this business to make fiat s other divisions leading players , mr fresco went on an early acquisition rush , buying new businesses for fiat s comau factory automation unit and teksid foundry business in 1999 , he paid 43 billion for the case corporation , the heavy equipment manufacturer , and combined it with fiat s new holland farm machinery company some of fiat s , and mr fresco s , challenge stems from luckless timing after the case acquisition , the global market for construction equipment collapsed adding to fiat auto s internal weakness , important markets in brazil , poland and turkey went sour at the same time that sales were withering in its home market , where it does 60 percent of its european business you were dealt a bad hand , mr fresco was recently told by mr welch , who is now on fiat s board and speaks regularly by phone with mr fresco and when you picked up your new cards , they looked worse a recent review of fiat s finances by major creditrating agencies prompted the company to negotiate a 28 billion financial reorganization with its most important creditor banks mr fresco said the review by the rating agencies was prompted not so much by a deterioration of fiat s financial position as by the greater attention being paid to possible offbalancesheet debts after the enron debacle under the terms of the bank deal , mr fresco pledged to cut in half fiat s net debt of 66 billion euros over the next year a planned sale of shares in the ferrari sports car business and a sale of a 14 percent stake in a utility owned with lectricit de france will make good about twothirds of the pledge , he said achieving the rest is a reasonable target that fiat could reach without any problem the company s biggest challenge , mr fresco said , is to accelerate operating cash flow this is , and continues to be , our priority no 1 , he said as fiat streamlines and mr fresco fills both its top jobs , the chief executives of fiat s operating companies will be the ones most responsible for meeting that challenge either they do it , mr fresco said , with an unitalian bluntness to rival mr welch , or they 're not doing their jobs photo the challenge for paolo fresco will be whether he can bring to bear the lessons he learned at general electric on the corporate culture of fiat \( gughi fassino grazia neri , for the new york times \)
the house energy and commerce committee is planning to step up its scrutiny of global crossing s business practices in light of the company s acknowledgment that employees at several of its offices had shredded documents after the securities and exchange commission began investigating the company in february the committee had already been gathering information about the company and will probably schedule global crossing hearings soon , a spokesman for the panel said the same committee has also held hearings on business practices at enron , arthur andersen and the biotechnology company imclone systems we 're intensifying our investigation of global crossing to include a closer look at the allegations of document shredding , said ken johnson , a spokesman for representative billy tauzin , chairman of the committee global crossing initially acknowledged the document shredding in discussions last week with lawyers for several ohio pension funds that are suing the company , lawyers involved in these discussions said the lawyers said they had been told that the document destruction at offices in rochester , toronto , montreal , detroit and minneapolis had taken place after the sec began its investigation in early february that inquiry began just days after global crossing , a communications company , filed for bankruptcy protection the sec and the justice department , which began its investigation a short time later , are trying to determine whether global crossing entered into sham networkaccess transactions with other communications companies in an effort to inflate revenue improperly ralph ferrara , a lawyer from debevoise plimpton , which is representing global crossing , said over the weekend that he was confident that no documents relevant to the investigations had been destroyed but he qualified that assertion by saying he could not be entirely certain because the documents in question were gone we take these allegations very seriously , said tisha kresler , a spokeswoman for global crossing , and are cooperating fully with the house energy and commerce committee and all other agencies who have opened investigations we have provided the house energy and commerce committee and other agencies with extensive documentation at their request and continue to work with them to resolve any questions they may have the energy and commerce committee began an investigation into the business practices of global crossing in march after accusations surfaced that the company had used sham transactions to increase revenue and mislead investors about the state of its finances a second house panel , the financial services committee , has already held one hearing in march on global crossing s business practices and is considering seeking additional information on the reports of document shredding those reports have come from lawyers for the ohio retirement system , a group of pension funds that have filed a lawsuit accusing global crossing executives of misleading investors we 'll review the shredding information and then we 'll decide what to do , said peggy peterson , a spokeswoman for the financial services committee besides the disclosures to the ohio pension funds , a current employee and a former employee at global crossing said in sworn statements that they had reason to believe that documents were also shredded in february at global crossing s headquarters in madison , nj other employees , implicated in those allegations , said in their own statements that they had not shredded documents the employees' accusations , and the denials , were made during questioning by lawyers for the ohio pension funds and by global crossing s lawyers after investigators for the ohio attorney general s office uncovered the shredding accusations one of the employees at global crossing s headquarters who denied in the court filings that he had shredded documents was steven m scro , a project manager and soninlaw of joseph perrone , global crossing s executive vice president for finance but an electronic message sent by laura ponticello , director of human resources at global crossing , to john comparin , executive vice president for human resources , appears to raise questions about mr scro s testimony in the message , which was part of a filing submitted last week at the united states bankruptcy court in new york , ms ponticello said that documents in the office of wally dawson , an executive who left global crossing in january , were shredded by an assistant to mr dawson , sharon wolff , on jan 21 and jan 22 , which was after mr dawson left the company and about a week before global crossing filed for bankruptcy protection mr dawson was not available for comment we have reviewed every incident thoroughly , said ms kresler , the global crossing spokeswoman , including concerns raised by employees about disposal of documents after wally dawson left the company based on the results of this review to date , none of the documents involved appear to have any relevance to pending litigation or governmental investigations it was mr scro who brought the matter to the attention of ms ponticello and mr perrone , according to ms ponticello s email message , which was sent on feb 15 if true , ms ponticello s account would appear to weaken mr scro s testimony , in which he said the only shredded material he saw at global crossing had been packing paper used in shipping boxes responding to the questions raised by mr scro s statement , ms kresler said during an extensive interview on june 17 , 2002 , which resulted in a 146page deposition , steve scro was asked many questions about document retention questions about the shredding of documents by wally dawson s assistant , which occurred approximately six months earlier , never came up in that interview
northrop grumman indicated to trw s top management yesterday that it would be willing to raise its bid for the company in hopes of finally securing a deal after being rebuffed for months , executives close to the negotiations said yesterday if northrop proceeds with the new offer , worth about 58 a share , or 72 billion , it would be the second time that it has raised its offer since it bid 59 billion in february for trw , the military contractor and auto parts maker based in cleveland northrop s suggestion that it would raise its offer comes as trw is holding discussions with the general dynamics corporation , bae systems of britain and the raytheon company about a possible deal for trw s military assets , the executives said , though none of the suitors have yet made formal binding bids trw s nonauto businesses generated 62 billion in sales last year indeed , analysts and even some participants in the auction suggest that trw is simply trying to drum up the appearance of interest from rivals to put pressure on northrop to raise its offer a banker for one company in talks with trw said as much trw wants us at the table , the banker said are we interested \? sure we are but the chances of a deal for us are low he added , you can bet we 're not going to give up the chance to look at trw s books northrop s new offer is intended to spur talks , the executives said , and possibly quell talks that trw is having with northrop s rivals a deal with bae systems would most likely face tough scrutiny from regulators and military officials in washington , who may be concerned about a foreign company making missiles and satellites for the united states bae has already begun to lobby pentagon officials for approval of a possible deal in london , shares of bae rose 825 pence , to 34925 pence analysts said a deal with raytheon was even less likely raytheon shares fell 54 percent , to 3875 , yesterday as investors signaled their opposition general dynamics represents the greatest threat to northrop because it could easily raise financing to make a competitive offer
the singers in anonymous 4 have discovered in their 16 years as a touring earlymusic vocal ensemble that fame has its pitfalls and that they are not always what one expects there s the problem of being identified with what we sing , said marsha genensky , one of the four singers in the group , which is best known for its performances of medieval sacred music but is expanding in other directions as well when we 've gone to spain , we 've found that people do n't believe that we 're not nuns because how could we possibly sing this music if we 're not nuns \? recently the singers received a letter complaining about a publicity photograph in a brochure for music before 1800 , the early music series at corpus christi church , where anonymous 4 is presenting la bele marie songs to the virgin from medieval france , on sunday afternoon in the picture , three of the singers johanna maria rose , susan hellauer and jacqueline horner are standing ms genensky is seated , and although she is wearing slacks , the writer expressed dismay that her sitting position was unladylike because we 're singing about the virgin mary , they feel it s inappropriate , ms hellauer said ms horner added , there are people with too much time on their hands as medieval music groups go , anonymous 4 has always been a bit unusual when the group was formed in 1986 , taking its name from the scholarly designation for the unknown author of an important medieval treatise , gregorian chant and early polyphony were performed almost exclusively by men men s voices , after all , were heard in public church services at the time this music was composed women s voices were not but ms hellauer , the ensemble s musicologist , has pointed out that public services were only part of the picture nuns in convents would have sung the music at their own services the growing fascination with music of the abbess and composer hildegard of bingen over the last two decades has added weight to that assertion and , not surprisingly , hildegard has had a prominent place in the group s repertory so even though none of the anonymous 4 singers have taken the veil in the cause of authenticity , they have been able to offer a historically grounded argument for their particular blend of timbres success with recordings that blend has also been resoundingly successful on recordings the group performed for five years before they began recording for harmonia mundi france but their debut disc , an english ladymass , sold 40 , 000 copies within two months of its release in 1992 , an extraordinary figure in a corner of the record industry where a disc that sells 15 , 000 copies is considered a hit since then sales of an english ladymass have topped 220 , 000 , and the group has made a dozen more discs for harmonia mundi \( as well as one for sony classical \) two years ago harmonia mundi announced that the group had sold a million recordings worldwide in a way , anonymous 4 uses a strategy from the pop world to promote its recordings its programs are rehearsed in concert before they are taken into the recording studio once the disc is released , they tour with a program based on it , sometimes alternating with programs that promote earlier recordings as well their concert on sunday , for example , is essentially a live rendering of their latest album , also called la bele marie in past years the group has expanded on the music in its programs by adding poetry and narration between selections , and probably will do that in the future but for la bele marie , it is performing the music as it is , with no readings and no intermission if there is a new twist , it is that for the first time each singer takes a solo turn for all its success , anonymous 4 has not relaxed the rigor of its approach to programming and performances the bele marie program , for example , was tried in several forms before the group recorded it usually , one person is the shepherdess of a particular program , ms hellauer explained , and for this one , that was me it started out as a notre dame program , and in its first version it was called 'paris 1200' when we performed it , we included a long narrative poem from the 13th century called 'the owl and the nightingale' that talked about the conflict between very staid , placid church music , and the new , ornate , flashy , soloistic church music of around 1200 the poem goes back and forth the owl is the old monk , the chanter , and the nightingale is the virtuoso singer , and they argue about which kind of music better leads you toward god a hard group to satisfy the battle was illustrated by an alternation of chant and organum , a style of polyphony in which one voice sustained a chant melody , around which the other musical lines were more freely varied in a signature touch , the group selected the polyphony exclusively from works mentioned in the treatise by the theorist anonymous 4 but it did n't hang just right , ms hellauer said we never felt it was totally us
you can pick any number of starting points to this tale of a town trying to reconcile the need for new school offices with preserving scarce parkland the texaco heiress ruth lapham lloyd s generous sale in the mid1960 s of her family s stately waveny house and the more than 300 acres of surrounding land to the town of new canaan , a portion of it designated for school purposes only the 25yearold odyssey of school district offices from one illsuited location to another the selection in 1999 of a controversial onethirdacre piece of land that cuts into what is now waveny park for a proposed 9 , 200squarefoot school administration building but the essence of the story was succinctly presented by jackie potdevin , a new canaan resident , in a recent letter to the new canaan advertiser that said how did we get to the point where two of new canaan s prized assets , the education system and its smalltown rural feel , were pitted against each other \? there can be no winner in a vote such as this but on friday there will be a winner new canaan voters will determine the fate of the planned building in a referendum by either voting no to overturn the town council s 168 million appropriation for construction or yes to ratify the council s decision also at stake is the nearly four years of work involving eight site evaluations for a suitable home for the school offices in a town that is presently 93 percent developed in unifying the school department s fragmented resources and meeting projected school needs in a new building , the relocation study group said the town would save almost 200 , 000 annually over 20 years versus leasing the same amount of space should the voters overturn the appropriation , the entire issue of relocating the school offices would return to the 12member town council for reconsideration , first selectman richard bond said it would a very difficult thing to do , he said it s kind of like we 've already been there and done that serious opposition to the proposed site , known as site 1 , began last summer when a group calling itself hands off waveny objected to the location , which is adjacent to the east side of new canaan high school near the corner of farm road on south avenue we all agreed that it was n't an acceptable site because it s one of the most wellused sections of the park , but we wanted to work with the town s vision for a building , said richard stowe , a member of the group a lot of people like me feel that waveny park is being chipped away at a building committee , appointed by the board of selectmen , requested a study of two alternate sites suggested by hands off waveny , but ultimately deemed the sites unsatisfactory on jan 9 , the town council voted unanimously to appropriate the money enter cameron hutchins , a senior copywriter at a company in norwalk that builds web sites mr hutchins , 43 , said his opposition to site 1 kicked in with the council s vote you 'd be hardpressed to find a bigger fan of the schools than me , he said , but to me the town never proved the absolute necessity of destroying 17 , 000 square feet of public land for a new school building largely through wordofmouth , he found others who shared his concerns , including mr stowe , and founded the new canaan referendum in order to force a referendum on the issue , mr hutchins and 50 or so others passed around a formal petition , putting him in an unwanted role i am so not a public person , he said i'm in a quandary , because this pits two of the things i like best about this town against each other its parks and woodlands and the school system but to me , it s not a school issue , but a development issue when i grew up here , town fathers were town fathers they always did the right things , mr hutchins said i do n't think that s the case here everyone agrees that the school district s current office space is n't ideal , but this solution is overkill mr hutchins s group collected 995 signatures by the feb 15 deadline , more than enough to force a referendum in keeping with the everexpanding points of contention , even the date of the referendum and the minimum number of voting hours are at issue opponents say the noon to 8 pm voting time will make it difficult for the town s many new york city commuters to cast ballots the town council could have scheduled the vote for saturday , the last date available to them , but in this town , people clear out on weekends , said george baker , the town councilor to overturn the town council s 168 million appropriation , opponents must collect a majority of the votes and an amount equal to 15 percent of the town s electorate , which in this case is 1 , 740 no votes a key element of the debate centers on a 1974 agreement between the town and the board of education in which 19 acres of waveny land was swapped with land deeded to the board the board agreed to maintain the land in its present state for purposes of nature study and general conservation only the town now maintains that the agreement was invalid because it contravened ruth lapham lloyd s original deed restriction that her land be used for educational purposes only although the selectmen voted on june 19 , 2001 , to , in effect , reswap the twoacre parcel that was to be the site of the proposed administration building , mr bond said the 1974 agreement was not a legal document the town had no right to do that mr baker said in my mind that swap was totally void the only enforceable restriction on the books is that the building has to be used for educational purposes that interpretation is consistent with mrs lloyd s original intent , said hudson stoddard , who as chairman of the school board called on her in the mid1960 s to suggest that she give part of her estate for a new high school her original intent was to be helpful in providing grounds for the high school , and hence there was an educational purpose to her gift from the beginning , said mr stoddard , who has lived in new canaan for 56 years ruth lapham lloyd , who died in 1984 , had seven children , but none of them live in new canaan as for reaction to proposed building site , the viewpoints vary i do n't see any reason not to put it here it s school property , said lainy krohley , who uses the walking trails regularly i 'd have to reroute my walk , but if it s for the greater good , that s ok joe riggs , a longtime resident who was preparing to take his golden retriever for a walk in the park , said i 'd rather they found a different location , but it s not a big thing in my life this is a very socially conscious town anything that impinges on the town as it is and people get very involved although selectwoman judy neville predicted that friday s vote would be close , she said she had no idea what might happen if the appropriation was overturned i do n't know if you go back to the drawing board , keep leasing space or what , she said that would be a whole new set of problems and a whole new set of doors to go through photos richard stowe , who is opposed to using waveny park land for a proposed school administration building , standing where the construction would take place on friday , the residents will decide retain the walking trails , or use some of the land for new offices \( photographs by chris maynard for the new

the sexual abuse scandals in the roman catholic church reached the highest levels of the archdiocese of new york yesterday , when the archdiocese announced it had ordered the suspension of the monsignor in charge of fundraising after he was accused of having an improper relationship with a minor 20 years ago the monsignor , charles m kavanagh , was ordered not to act as a priest and was removed from his positions as the archdiocese s vicar for development and pastor of st raymond s church , the archdiocese said st raymond s , in the parkchester section of the bronx , is among the city s biggest and most prominent parishes as vicar for development , monsignor kavanagh is one of the archdiocese s most powerful clerics he was involved in the planning for the annual alfred e smith memorial dinner , a prestigious gala that has drawn politicians up to and including campaigning presidential candidates , several archdiocese officials said he also oversees the annual cardinal s appeal fundraising drive , which is currently under way , and has worked closely with cardinal edward m egan at the same time , he has presided over st raymond s , which has a school noted nationwide for its basketball program the charge that led to the suspension was made by a man who said he had a relationship with monsignor kavanagh as a student at cathedral preparatory seminary , once the archdiocese s main high school for young men headed for the priesthood , said the archdiocese s spokesman , joseph zwilling monsignor kavanagh , who turns 65 on monday , was rector of the seminary from 1977 to 1985 he was assigned to st raymond s in 1988 and was named vicar for development in 1994 the man reported the allegation to the archdiocese late last week after first going to the manhattan district attorney s office , mr zwilling said the report was the first time the archdiocese had learned of the allegation , he said the archdiocese took action against the monsignor after receiving more information from the complainant , he said mr zwilling declined to provide further details of the allegation he would not disclose the monsignor s whereabouts or say whether the monsignor denied the charge the district attorney s office would not discuss the case in a policy announced on may 15 , the archdiocese said that once it had reason to suspect abuse had occurred , it would consult with the appropriate district attorney and take action against the priest as warranted , including removing the priest from his assignment the archdiocese said last month that at least six other of its priests had been suspended , without identifying them , after the archdiocese began handing over files of past allegations to prosecutors on thursday , a visiting priest from india working at a harlem church was suspended after his arrest in a 1999 sexual abuse case in brooklyn none of the other accused priests have held as much influence as monsignor kavanagh in addition to the alfred e smith dinner , he handled such things as the logistics for prominent figures attending cardinal john j o'connor s funeral in 2000 mr zwilling declined to comment on what effect the suspension might have on the cardinal s appeal , whose goal is 15 million , at a time when cardinal egan is struggling to bring archdiocese finances under control as of midmay , the appeal had raised 82 million when the cardinal came into the job , the deficit in the archdiocese s budget was 20 million monsignor kavanagh said last month in an interview with the new york times that it had been halved i would imagine this is a tremendous blow to the archdiocese s fundraising efforts , said the rev walter modrys , pastor at st ignatius loyola on the upper east side and a skilled fundraiser himself gee whiz , your top fundraiser is in trouble fellow pastors expressed dismay about the latest development in the priest sexual abuse scandal , which has been roiling the catholic church nationwide for the past four months it gets worse and worse i do n't understand it every day , said the rev john grange , pastor of st jerome s church in the mott haven section of the bronx he had a position of great influence and importance and trust , father grange said , referring to monsignor kavanagh with the money situation being as it is , i do n't know of anybody who had more of a burden on his shoulders mr zwilling said no decision had been made on what steps the archdiocese might take regarding the monsignor he said the monsignor would continue to receive his priest s stipend for the time being the rev john duffell , of the church of the ascension on the upper west side of manhattan , wondered about the suspension s fairness you almost hope the punishment could be leveled after the facts were determined , he said according to the cardinal , this is the policy that has to be in effect because this is what the people want i wonder if that s really true is n't somebody innocent until proven guilty \? monsignor kavanagh , who was born in manhattan , was an outstanding basketball player at cathedral college , said father grange , who attended the college with him he studied for the priesthood in rome and was ordained in 1963 the monsignor was one of only a handful of top officials kept on by cardinal egan when he succeeded cardinal o'connor as archbishop in 2000 , and he frequently accompanied the cardinal to fundraising events in the interview last month with the times , monsignor kavanagh described his pitch to potential donors this is our work we are healing and ministering to their city but it costs money your contribution will be used to do good monsignor kavanagh expressed sympathy for the young victims of sexual abuse by priests , but also concern that innocent priests would be falsely accused , or at the least tarred by association with the guilty he is a prominent figure in his own right in the bronx he is a founding member of the bronx clergy task force , which was formed after the amadou diallo police shooting case to improve relations between residents and the police the monsignor also led the drive for a 12 million , 60 , 000squarefoot community center in parkchester , helping secure a taxfree city bond of 7 million to 8 million
havana , jan 13 the plaza of the revolution stands quiet the government newspapers are making nice the president has refrained from uttering a single denunciation on the subject in the balmy capital of this hemisphere s last communist outpost , the arrival at the united states naval station at guant namo bay of the first suspected terrorists from the war in afghanistan has been met with a collective shrug over its own longstanding discomfort with the american presence on the island , the government of fidel castro has publicly signaled its acceptance of the decision by the bush administration to imprison hundreds of suspected al qaeda members at the american base on cuba s eastern tip in cafes and private parlors , many havana residents are echoing the government s line , but often with a little twist they say they do not like the idea of hardened terrorists being imported to what they regard as sovereign cuban soil , but they agree that this is not the time to make a fuss america is bringing these prisoners here , and it is impossible for the cuban people to fight it , said jaime jim nez , a havana university student nobody in the world wants these guys cuba does n't want them either but we have no option mr jim nez made his remarks as the second installment of suspected terrorists were reported to be bound for the island aboard an american cargo plane the first group of 20 prisoners , cuffed and shackled , arrived late last week they are expected to be followed by several hundred other suspected members of al qaeda , who will be imprisoned in makeshift cells while they await their still uncertain fates like many cubans here , mr jimenez said his concern was the security around guant namo bay what if these people come into cuba \? mr jim nez asked between sips of a mojito at a bar in the city s el vedado neighborhood no wonder they do n't want them in america according to granma , the state newspaper , the cuban government has offered to improve medical and sanitation services in the area around the base and has promised not to erect any obstacles to america s plan to imprison the suspected terrorists there we are willing to cooperate in any other useful , constructive and humane way that may arise , the government said the naval station at guant namo bay is one of the many points of contention in the two countries' difficult relationship the united states leases the base under a 1903 agreement that was renewed as a perpetual lease in 1934 , nearly three decades before mr castro seized power the cuban government objects to what it calls the abusive conditions imposed by the treaty , but any amendment to the lease agreement requires the consent of the united states as well in the statement printed this weekend , the cuban government said an elemental sense of dignity and absolute disagreement prevents it from cashing the 4 , 085 checks sent to cuba as annual lease payments by the united states government it is unclear what prompted cuba , which itself is on the united states list of states that sponsor terrorism , to go along with the american activities at guant namo one reason may be a desire to ease its current economic difficulties tourism , one of the country s largest earners of foreign currency , has dropped sharply since the sept 11 attacks since then , the cuban peso has lost nearly 20 percent of its value against the dollar we have sugar , we have cigars , but none of them earn as much as tourism , said jorge rodr guez , a 30yearold medical technician after sept 11 , we lost a lot of tourism although many cubans echoed mr rodr guez s sentiments , it remains a difficult task to gauge public opinion in a country as tightly controlled as cuba in a havana paladar , one of the many privately run restaurants that have sprung up here , one of the employees began explaining himself i have opinions that i express outside , and those that i express behind closed doors , he said a coworker pulled the man aside , and after a moment , he returned i am sorry , i cannot speak to you , he said

washington , april 11 on its web site , the interior department features a video prepared by a lobbying group that was created to promote exploration for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge anyone who downloads the 40second video can see the refuge s white , barren coastal plain in the dead of the alaskan winter it is an image that interior secretary gale a norton prefers rather than the summertime scenes of caribou , snow geese , musk oxen and other wildlife to the south in the refuge s brooks range , the sort of image used by environmentalists who oppose the bush administration s plan to allow drilling on the plain the dueling visions have been used freely in a fierce lobbying battle over the administration s proposal , already approved by the house and nearing a vote in the senate but the interior department s dissemination of the prodrilling tape was challenged today by a democratic lawmaker , representative edward j markey of massachusetts , who said the department appeared to be violating a law that forbids federal agencies to use certain kinds of publicity to support or oppose legislation pending in congress an interior department spokesman said , however , that a department lawyer had concluded that distribution of the video was legal seeking an explanation from ms norton , mr markey told her in a letter today , it would appear on the face of it that your use of your official office to promote this industrysponsored video in an effort to influence congress to drill in the arctic refuge is precisely the kind of activity that is prohibited by law that law expressly prohibits agencies from distributing any film presentation designed to support or defeat legislation pending before the congress , although it has been interpreted more broadly by government ethics offices it does not apply to the lobbying routinely done by cabinet members , but is read as barring participation in mass mailings , letterwriting campaigns and other grassroots activities like those of arctic power , the group that prepared the prodrilling video in an interview , mr markey said the interior department was becoming a cinema house for lobbyists the interior department should not be spreading oil company propaganda any more than the department of energy should be promoting enron stock , he said it s not their job founded in 1992 with the goal of winning government approval for drilling in the refuge , arctic power includes on its board oil industry officials , other business executives and alaska union leaders the state of alaska , which would earn increased oil royalties if drilling was permitted in the refuge , is arctic power s largest source of money , having given it 175 million but the group is also financed by oil and gas companies , labor groups and private citizens last year it hired patton boggs , a powerful washington law firm with offices in anchorage , to lobby congress ms norton s adviser for alaska issues , cam toohey , is arctic power s former executive director ms norton has done more with arctic power s video than post it on her department s web site in late february , she sent copies to network news organizations with the suggestion that they broadcast it in a letter to the nbc anchor tom brokaw , ms norton wrote , enclosed is a betacam tape , which you are free to use , showing the north slope of anwr in the winter the only time when energy exploration would be allowed under the president s plan i think it is important , the letter said , that you have video of the actual part of anwr being discussed , so that your viewers can have a more accurate understanding of the issue frequently during the energy debate , i have watched television programs feature video that resembles anwr s brooks range although the brooks range is in fact far south of the coastal plain to which the drilling would be confined , environmentalists reply that road building and other activity associated with the exploration would have adverse effects that would spread deep into the refuge in any event , the spending of government money to support campaigns related to pending legislation is generally considered a violation of the law that congressman markey cited today mark d pfeifle , the interior department spokesman , said the department had conducted a quick analysis of the costs of preparing copies of the arctic power video and sending them to news organizations the dubbing charges of the anwr video 9581 , he said postage to send the anwr videotapes 4355 informing americans what the real alaska north slope is like in the dead of winter priceless mr pfeifle also challenged mr markey s suggestion that the interior department s web site link to the video was illegal he said a career lawyer at the department had concluded that it would not violate the law asked if there was a written opinion to that effect , mr pfeifle said there was none mr markey s chief of staff , david h moulton , said it was telling that the interior department had decided to showcase an image promoted by a group whose message coincides with the industry s usually being captured by the industry means incorporating their views into yours in an unquestioning way , mr moulton said but it does n't normally also involve using public resources to distribute and publicize material provided by industry arctic power officials argue that environmentalists have exaggerated drilling s potential for damage and have underestimated the amount of oil in the refuge , which , the group says , has the potential to be the largest oil field in the world mr pfeifle , the interior department spokesman , said ms norton herself was tired of seeing misleading videotapes on network news programs the typical tape is of a green expanse of land populated by caribou herds , but it is nowhere near the area that would be explored for energy , he said in fact , the showing of this videotape is irresponsible , and it is totally inaccurate it was for that reason , mr pfeifle said , that ms norton decided to send copies of the arctic power video to network news organizations in her letter to the networks , ms norton wrote , winteronly exploration is just one example of the president s commitment to impose the toughest environmental standards ever applied to oil production
in the months after nearly 2 , 800 people died in the terrorist attack that destroyed the world trade center , the bush administration pledged 214 billion to address the emergency the extraordinary allocation of federal disaster relief , while less than local elected officials had petitioned for , was meant to reassure , restore and restart an emotionally and economically ravaged new york city and surrounding region more than 15 months later , some 45 billion to 5 billion has made its way from washington to new york significant sums of money were made available almost immediately , and they made possible early progress in providing for victims and establishing a sense that the city could rebound roughly 600 million was sent to cover the costs of the monumental task of cleaning up the site an additional 401 million has been distributed to some 10 , 000 downtown businesses to keep them afloat and 493 million in taxfree bonds have been approved to help finance major construction projects , including three residential complexes around ground zero but many victims , elected officials , business executives and others are both confused and angry about why , more than a year after the most serious terrorist attack on american soil , less than a quarter of the federal government s promise of financial assistance has been realized , why hundreds of millions of dollars that are in the hands of new york officials have gone unclaimed , and why firm decisions have yet to be made on how additional billions of dollars will actually be spent the explanations , based on an examination of financial filings and interviews with government officials , real estate experts , watchdog organizations and downtown residents and business people , are varied some 1 billion of the 214 billion in aid , it turns out , will buy insurance for the companies that conducted the cleanup , which they would use to defend themselves against any lawsuits aides to some new york elected officials who have tracked the money also believe that some of new york s promised millions have gone to victims and institutions in pennsylvania and washington , the other two sites of devastation wrought by terrorists on sept 11 moreover , federal officials never intended to deliver another huge chunk of the money some 5 billion to rebuild the transportation network downtown for years , determined to wait until there was a fully formulated plan no one doubts that the government will make good on its pledge but the jobs that such a project would bring and the tangible benefits to the city remain far off further , many businesses and residents were shocked to learn that hundreds of millions of dollars in grants available to them were subject to federal taxes , a fact that both reduced the real value of that aid and discouraged some from taking advantage of it many people have also failed to realize that about a quarter of the total aid package some 55 billion was made up of tax breaks , not real dollars so the ultimate value of that portion is the subject of great debate , with some economists and real estate experts in the city worried that it is largely an illusion distrust among the government agencies involved in controlling the aid , and selfconfessed bureaucratic missteps by the federal emergency management agency , which is in charge of channeling nearly 9 billion to new york , has also led to delays in payments and disillusionment among potential recipients and finally , some of the money has not made its way to new york because local and state officials have not figured out exactly how to take advantage of all the available types of aid other bids for financing certain projects 90 million to help assess the longterm health of thousands of trade center rescue workers , 980 million to reimburse the city and state for the cost of deploying its uniformed forces and future fire department training , have been stalled you can look at the trees , and see many things that should have been done better or quicker , said senator charles e schumer , a new york democrat who has been involved in negotiating the aid packages but if you look at the forest , it s a large and unprecedented sum of money that s basically being used in the way that it was needed and intended the spending of the money has been far from perfect , but over all , it s been pretty good determining precisely how much money has made it to new york and actually been distributed is difficult an examination by the new york times of the dozens of sources and uses of the promised 214 billion in disaster aid found significant disparities in accounting for the money , both among the federal officials handling it and the organizations , people and institutions in new york and the region receiving it the white house s office of management and budget has one set of figures for how much has been given , and congressional staff members have a different set , and there is some belief that double counting has occurred beyond that , the number of government agencies and organizations involved in the effort is daunting , and the money was appropriated in different pieces of legislation indeed , a tabulation by the times of the total amount pledged by various federal agencies adds up to only 213 billion
belfast , northern ireland , oct 13 jas mooney is the son of a belfast man whose pub was bombed repeatedly in the 30 years before the 1998 northern ireland peace agreement , when sectarian violence took on such a sense of permanence in this society that it was referred to simply as the troubles today , mr mooney , 38 , is the director of a chain of sleek downtown bars staffed by young roman catholics and protestants working side by side , and bearing an architectural feature unthinkable during that violenceprone time the bars all have long street fronts made of glass as open , confident and quietly defiant as his businesses' facades , mr mooney s attitude is a reflection of what this capital city has started to become since the irish republican army and its counterpart protestant paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1997 and the peace agreement was signed a year later notably , it is the same face that many of belfast s residents are turning toward the latest setback in that peace process the expected shutdown on monday of the northern ireland assembly , the centerpiece of the accord intended to parcel power equally between the province s protestant majority and its roman catholic minority the impasse is the worst in the fouryear history of the crisisridden agreement , and it has prompted expressions of concern from politicians and other opinion makers about an end to the path toward a permanent peace , and a return to the violence of the past but belfast is having none of it the overall feeling is not one of fear , it s one of frustration , said petra devitt , 27 , a marketing manager for a bar , bistro and nightclub complex in part of an old paint factory that draws nightly blocklong lines to a onetime nogo area in downtown belfast most of the people i know will be saying , 'let s just get on with it , and do n't pay attention to those political eejits , ' ms devitt said the irish slang version of idiot , more affectionate than accusatory , suggests someone distracted and ultimately harmless on monday , britain will declare the northern ireland assembly suspended , a step it is taking after the legislature s protestant members said they would resign their posts on tuesday to protest continuing ira activities while the clandestine guerrilla group s political wing , sinn fein , remains a participant in government a walkout by the protestants would have ended the powersharing project a suspension of the assembly , something that britain is resorting to for the fourth time , puts it on hold and carries the promise of future revival people in the streets , shopping malls and cafes around belfast voice real regret that the experiment in local government is coming to a halt , but few argue that the progress made up to now will be reversed or that the organized violence of the three decades leading up to the peace agreement will return there s no panic reaction this time , said david dunseith , 56 , the host of northern ireland s leading radio talk show , in an interview on saturday the evidence for that does n't come just from the calls , but i saw people on the way home tonight in my supermarket and all they 're saying is 'c'mon , we 've got to pay for our groceries and get on with it we 're not afraid' that s what s on their minds mr dunseith , whose daily program talk back , on bbc northern ireland , gives vent to the polar opinions of his ulster listeners , said he had not had a single caller as the crisis unfolded in recent weeks who thought the ira would use the current shutdown as cause for returning to violence i go back to the dark days in belfast when there was anarchy on the street , clattering armored cars all around the place and nobody went out , he said i guarantee you that there will be thousands of people out in downtown belfast tonight , and they wo n't be discussing the peace process , how long the suspension will last or when we get new assembly elections a decade ago , downtown belfast was a place people avoided because of assassinations , abductions and bombings today , it is an urban showcase of newly sandblasted monuments and clock towers oncederelict warehouses and factories converted into hightech office buildings and luxury apartments and restored courthouses , banks and indoor markets from the victorian period , when belfast was called the second city of the empire , and looked like it as the population gets younger , the old prejudices are becoming dated manus mcconn , 40 , owns two restaurants in belfast s university district that employ students , and he said , i 've watched the generations come through here , and with each one there is a noticeable thinning of bigotry belfast remains a city with catholic and protestant workingclass communities demarcated by painted curbs , irish or british flags and walls covered with menacing twists of concertina wire and murals portraying masked gunmen and militant slogans paramilitary gangs enforce street discipline among their own by vigilante attacks and punishment beatings that can leave victims permanently maimed some protestant housing projects have become the scenes of violent turf wars and drug disputes
you should n't have jumped that subway turnstile , but it s too late for regrets you were caught and sentenced to community service now comes the hard part do you resign yourself to spending the weekend picking up trash along the highway and hoping none of your friends cruise past while you 're wearing that orange traffic vest \? or do you try for a more genteel punishment , say , planting bulbs in central park \? last year , some 65 , 000 people were sentenced to community service in new york city for offenses like shoplifting , drunken driving and possessing marijuana but not all community service sentences are the same choose the short stick and you could do your time scraping human feces off the concrete beneath the harlem river drive overpasses if you 're lucky , you could end up stuffing envelopes and sipping tea at the charity of your choice so , lawyers and recidivists say , it pays to know your options first of all , do not try to cheat some people come in here and lean on the table with a 50 bill , said ellen castillo , who is in charge of community service sentencing in the manhattan district attorney s office others try to pay someone to do their community service for them , ms castillo said leona helmsley tried this after serving a prison term for tax evasion in the early 1990 s , and when the judge discovered her fraud , he sentenced her to 150 additional hours you 're much better off arriving punctually for your appointment with ms castillo or one of her cohorts , who are charged with signing you up for menial labor in the city s parks , highways and subways , and making sure that you do it they will try to accommodate your preferences , so be ready to voice them whatever you do , avoid something called homeless removal this involves dismantling the temporary shelters along the highway put up by homeless people \( the police remove the people \) and cleaning the areas they have been using as latrines that s a bad one , said derrick faulk , an official at the city s transportation department who supervises community service crews as for the subway beat , that s bad too , said amaury correa , 23 , who has done two community service stints this year , one on the east side s 4 , 5 and 6 subway line and one on the franklin d roosevelt drive , for stealing and marijuana possession cleaning up down there all day forget about it sadly , you may not have any choice if you jumped a turnstile , since the court employees try to match the punishment to the offense if you sprayed graffiti on a subway car or a city housing project , you may well end up cleaning it yourself , ms castillo said you 're also out of luck if you have a prior felony conviction you will be cleaning in the jails , another nasty assignment the highway cleanup details are a little better , but far from ideal these are the ones most reminiscent of oldfashioned southern chain gangs picking up trash or cutting weeds along the city s major arteries , with a steady diet of carbon monoxide working in the parks is far more pleasant , several offenders said it s shady , and the work is mostly sweeping and raking , sometimes even pulling weeds and planting flowers another favorite is landscaping , a new option added in the past year it includes pruning and planting shrubs along canals and highways in brooklyn and staten island the trouble with all of these outdoor activities , for many new yorkers , is the shame factor it s really embarrassing , said pete , a long island resident who wanted to avoid the shame of seeing his last name in the newspaper he was sweeping the pavement in tompkins square park on a recent summer morning after being sentenced for drunken driving everybody knows what you 're here for , he said , even the kids one solution is to request a posting where you 're not likely to run into friends or family many of the parks department sites are in staten island , a safe bet for some manhattan residents if your offense requires you to stick with subways , you can ask to clean the yards , which are generally in remote parts of queens , brooklyn and the bronx you can also request an indoor job , but there are no guarantees i asked to work in a clinic , said james , a medical resident who had been sentenced for drunken driving , as he mopped a filthy bathroom floor in the parks department building in tompkins square park i do n't understand why the da s office does n't allow people to do something more appropriate to their skill level the ugly truth here is that money \( for legal advice \) can help community service may appear to be one of the great leveling experiences of modern life , like jury service or highway reststop bathrooms but if you 're willing to pay for it , a lawyer can propose a custom sentence with a charity or nonprofit group , said judge judy harris kluger of manhattan criminal court if you 've been sentenced to a federal crime which usually involves a much larger chunk of community service in addition to possible prison time you can even pay a consultant to arrange a more imaginative and fulfilling way to pay your debt to society one of the best known consultants is joel sickler we try to take advantage of someone s talents , and the needs of the organization , said mr sickler , the director of client services at the national center on institutions and alternatives , a nonprofit organization in alexandria , va , that researches sentencing and prison reform mr sickler arranged for the manhattan artist peter max to teach art classes in schools for the children s aid society , after mr max was convicted of tax evasion he has worked out similar stints for a gallery of other celebrity clients , including ms helmsley and michael milken for some people , community service can be a revelatory experience robert f kennedy jr worked at the natural resources defense council as part of a lengthy community service sentence after being arrested for drug possession in the early 1980 s , and went on to join the organization as an environmental lawyer for everyone else , it is not clear whether community service is more or less effective than jail at reducing recidivism , experts say it started out as a boutique sentence for whitecollar offenders , and has evolved only over the past two decades into a standard sanction for people whose crimes merit something more than probation and less than prison even now , fully onethird of those sentenced fail to show up , and many of them lose the option to perform community service and end up serving jail terms , judge kluger said sometimes i wonder if this is an effective deterrent , said john mccants , a transportation department employee , as he watched over a group of farebeaters and potsmokers whacking weeds in the hot sun along the harlem river drive sometimes it just looks like the easy option not going to jail in theory , community service saves the city money by avoiding jail costs but it is hard to be sure , since many of those who are sentenced would have been let off with no punishment in an earlier era , said douglas corry mcdonald , the author of a book on the origins of new york city s community service program is it going to stop me from stealing \? asked marie , a selfdescribed crack addict , as she clutched a broom and prepared to sweep

kaliningrad , russia avenir p ovsyanov was only 20 but can still recount in exacting detail how in 1957 he helped destroy this city s german soul following orders from local soviet bosses , mr ovsyanov s military engineering class bored hundreds of holes in the ruins of the city s 13thcentury castle , packed them with dynamite and began blasting away 700 years of history it is perhaps a fitting twist of fate that now , as director of the region s historical preservation department , mr ovsyanov s job is to protect or recover , as is more often the case the art , culture and history lost first by war and then by soviet rule many years have passed , and i am different , said mr ovsyanov , who is now 65 now i protect old ruins this is my penance for the misdeeds of my youth a joke used to the make the rounds here before the soviet union collapsed in 1991 in kaliningrad , people said , there was no history between adam and potsdam , referring to the site of the allied conference in 1945 that ceded the formerly german territory to the soviet union now , half a century after the potsdam conference , kaliningrad , with its surrounding undulating hills and marshlands , is gradually beginning to recover its past in so doing , it is raising questions about whether this region of 900 , 000 inhabitants is russian or german at heart some have even suggested restoring the old german name of k nigsberg until april 9 , 1945 , when the soviet army seized it , this region was german territory , part of east prussia its capital , k nigsberg , had long been a center of german commerce and culture , best known as the hometown of the 18thcentury philosopher immanuel kant after the war , the soviet authorities sought to erase all traces of german history that had not been destroyed by british air raids in 1944 and soviet shelling a year later in 1946 , they renamed the city and the region after mikhail i kalinin , the former senior soviet leader , who had just died and happened to be next on the list to be honored what germans remained were expelled , and the region was repopulated with russians , many of them refugees of destruction elsewhere for 46 years , kaliningrad was a restricted military zone , the home of the baltic fleet , but the collapse of the soviet union opened it up and the city s old character has slowly begun to emerge kaliningrad s main cathedral , first built in 1333 and badly damaged during world war ii by british bombs , has been undergoing a renovation and now looks much as it did before the war on the site of the old castle , which was not finally leveled until 1968 , archaeologists sponsored by the german magazine der spiegel are excavating the foundations to see what , if anything , can be saved aleksandr papanin , a writer and cultural historian , said kaliningrad , like all of russia , had to come to terms with history after the end of the soviet union only it was different here in russia , it was like a return to prerevolutionary history , he said here , it was like a return to prewar history the question now is where to stop efforts to restore the old castle or at least preserve its ruins in some sort of historic park have clashed with plans for kaliningrad s most famous soviet monument the concrete block known formally as the house of the soviets most people simply call it the monster begun in 1972 , the building stands unfinished , a decaying hulk visited by addicts and drunks that overshadows the drab concrete plaza where the castle once stood there have been several attempts to turn it into a hotel or business center , but none have progressed its very ownership is a matter of intrigue it is jointly owned by the city , the region and a shadowy company registered in panama , midi phi holding corporation the possibility of a lucrative redevelopment seems to have halted any talk of simply tearing the monster down it is a part of our history , too , said tatyana l kondakova , the city s chief architect then there is the city s name in july , a local activist began an internet campaign to restore the old one , k nigsberg the notion has support , including from people like mr ovsyanov and some elected officials , who note that other places once named after kalinin have since changed them back , like the city of tver , northwest of moscow but the campaign prompted furious protests , including from the region s governor , vladimir g yegorov true patriots of their country , those to whom this amber land is dear , will live and work in kaliningrad , mr yegorov told the interfax news agency those who do not like this name , which has already become a part of russian and world history , may go to other places photos german lutheran churches in kaliningrad that were closed by the soviets are being reopened by the russian orthodox church the unfinished house of the soviets , also known locally as the monster , was built near the site of kaliningrad s ruined

at first , jeanne heifetz thought she had merely tripped over one of those quirks that occasionally worm their way into standardized tests words were missing from a book excerpt she was familiar with on a regents english exam but when she discovered a second extensively altered excerpt , she began to wonder , if there were two , could there be more \? was something sinister afoot \? so , driven by curiosity and her antipathy to the exams , she rounded up a batch of recent regents tests , which new york state requires public high school students to take to graduate , and started doublechecking the excerpts that serve as the basis for questions what she found astonished her in a feat of literary sleuth work , ms heifetz , the mother of a high school senior and a weaver from brooklyn , inspected 10 high school english exams from the past three years and discovered that the vast majority of the passages drawn from the works of isaac bashevis singer , anton chekhov and william maxwell , among others had been sanitized of virtually any reference to race , religion , ethnicity , sex , nudity , alcohol , even the mildest profanity and just about anything that might offend someone for some reason students had to write essays and answer questions based on these doctored versions versions that were clearly marked as the work of the widely known authors in an excerpt from the work of mr singer , for instance , all mention of judaism is eliminated , even though it is so much the essence of his writing his reference to most jewish women becomes most women on the regents , and even the polish schools were closed becomes even the schools were closed out entirely goes the line jews are jews and gentiles are gentiles in a passage from annie dillard s memoir , an american childhood , racial references are edited out of a description of her childhood trips to a library in the black section of town where she is almost the only white visitor , even though the point of the passage is to emphasize race and the insights she learned about blacks the state education department , which prepares the exams , acknowledged modifying excerpts to satisfy elaborate sensitivity review guidelines that have been in use for decades , but are periodically revised it said it did not want any student to feel ill at ease while taking the test after making her discovery , ms heifetz contacted most of the affected authors or their publishers , and found them angered that their words had been tampered with without their consent word circulated among groups concerned about censorship and literary affairs , and an assortment of them , including the national coalition against censorship , the association of american publishers , the new york civil liberties union and pen , jointly sent a letter on friday to richard p mills , the state education commissioner , calling for an end to the practice the groups , which plan to hold a news conference tomorrow , condemned the editing as intellectually dishonest and a form of censorship that distorts the content and meaning of the works testing students on inaccurate literary passages is an odd approach to measuring academic achievement , the letter said the modifications to the passages ranged widely in the chekhov story the upheaval , the exam takes out the portion in which a wealthy woman looking for a missing brooch stripsearches all of the house s staff members students are then asked to use the story to write an essay on the meaning of human dignity a paragraph in john holt s learning all the time is truncated to eliminate some of the reasons suzuki violin instruction differs in japan and the united states , apparently not to offend anyone who might find the particulars somehow insulting students are nonetheless then asked to answer questions about those differences certain revisions bordered on the absurd in a speech by kofi annan , the united nations secretary general , in addition to deletions about the united states' unpaid debt to the united nations , any mention of wine and drinking was removed instead of praising fine california wine and seafood , he ends up praising fine california seafood in carol saline s mothers and daughters a daughter no longer says she went out to a bar with her mother on the regents , they simply went out in an excerpt from barrio boy , by ernesto galarza \( whose name was misspelled on the exam as gallarzo \) , a gringo lady becomes an american lady a boy described as skinny became thin , while another boy who was fat became heavy , adjectives the state deemed less insulting when i saw that , ms heifetz said , i really thought they had lost their minds in undertaking her exploration , ms heifetz was in part motivated by her low regard for the exams , which have long provoked controversy over their worth and prevalence , though she said she had always assumed that they were correctly prepared rosa jurjevics , her daughter , is a senior at the urban academy laboratory high school , a small school on the upper east side it belongs to a consortium of 32 schools that educate largely poor children and that oppose the regents exams the consortium had a waiver that excused its students from taking the exams until last june , and it continues to battle the education department over the issue the latest round of the twoday regents in english will be administered to seniors on june 18 and 19
rosal , colombia , aug 29 with the full support of the colombian president , the united states has begun what american officials say will be the biggest and most aggressive effort yet to wipe out coca growing a round of aerial spraying to kill colombia s mammoth drug crops , which resumed here a month ago , is part of a new phase in the war on drugs that hopes to reverse years of setbacks as coca has continued to spread drastically american officials said that if the expanded program was sustained , it could at last make substantial inroads against colombia s coca growing with the approval of colombia s new president , lvaro uribe , the american plan calls for more crop dusters operating more hours and with none of the restrictions that officials say hampered spraying programs in the past here in the guamuez valley , the world s richest cocaproducing region , the effects are clear the crop dusters have returned , flying low and leaving a fine mist of gray spray in colombia s cocagrowing heartland fields of brown , withering coca bushes , whose leaves are used to make cocaine , remain in their wake look at all this it was all fumigated , complained one farmer , diomar montenegro , 49 , as he stood in a field of wilting coca bushes in this hamlet in southern colombia i cannot do this anymore they have put me out in the street it is a refrain american officials are happy to hear in the last largescale spraying of this region , a twomonth onslaught that ended in february of last year , the united states said it would concentrate on industrial size plots american and colombian officials pledged that small farmers would be spared if they agreed to stop growing coca voluntarily in exchange for modest government benefits in reality , many small farms were sprayed but the spraying ended earlier than american officials had hoped , because andr s pastrana , then the president , forbade some missions for fear of further alienating peasants in the midst of delicate peace negotiations with leftist rebels the result was that 80 percent of the crops sprayed in this province , putumayo , were replanted , and cocaine trafficking to the united states continued unabated now , president uribe is allowing united states officials to plan missions wherever and whenever they see fit , and there is no pretext that small farmers will not be hit american planners say they intend to cover as much acreage with defoliant as possible to stop the replanting of coca what keeps them from going back to growing coca is the spray plane , and only the spray plane , said an official at the american embassy who works on the antidrug programs the coca fields are enormous and there are a lot of different owners , and you just have to rub it all out that is the only way you are going to make this work the goal , american officials say , is to kill up to 300 , 000 acres of coca this year , 30 percent more than was sprayed last year with more crop dusters arriving , american officials say the fleet will increase from 12 to 22 by next spring the state department hopes to double the acreage sprayed next year , killing so much coca that replanting cannot keep up but despite the rosy predictions , drug policy analysts and some lawmakers in washington warn that the intensified program could just cause coca planting to spread to a wider area that phenomenon has already taken hold after a decade of americanbacked spraying fumigation has an effect , but we would argue it s an effect of displacement , said klaus nyholm , who oversees the united nations drug control program s office in colombia the next question is where will the coca go from here \? indeed , though the united states has spent 17 billion since 1999 in colombia to stamp out drugs , the amount of coca in colombia has increased 25 percent from 2000 to 2001 , according to american estimates based on images from satellites and projections by analysts united nations figures actually show a small decrease in coca cultivation in that period , a discrepancy due to the different satellitebased methods used to ascertain the size of plantations but the united nations also says that coca plantings large enough to be measured were found in 22 of colombia s 32 provinces in 2001 , up from 12 provinces in 1999 reports this year by the general accounting office , the research arm of the united states congress , and the state department have concluded that americanfinanced efforts to wean farmers off coca by offering them benefits had also failed in many cases the colombian government failed to deliver the benefits promised to farmers , while many farmers who pledged to eradicate their coca simply did not comply after nearly 2 billion , our policy in colombia has accomplished little , said senator patrick j leahy , the vermont democrat who is chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the appropriations committee and who has criticized american policy toward colombia community leaders here say aerial spraying has further impoverished people who turned to coca because it was the only viable moneymaking option farmers also say the spraying has caused a scarcity of food , since their legal crops , planted alongside coca , also die in spraying operations furthermore , though the united states contends that the herbicide used here is safe , warning labels on the product caution against using it near people and say it can cause vomiting and other ailments the spraying has raised the concerns of some environmental groups i'm worried because it is absolutely indiscriminate , said nancy s nchez , a human rights advocate who is working with the provincial health department to determine if there are any negative effects from spraying there has been no real evaluation of the effects of fumigation the state department is expected to submit a report to congress on wednesday on the potential health effects of the spraying under a provision sponsored by senator leahy , congress has required that the department , in consultation with the environmental protection agency , certify that the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment american officials involved with the program vow not to retreat , saying that the fact of the matter is that coca farmers are engaged in an illegal activity the new phase is evident on any given sunny day , when as many as a dozen planes spray up to 3 , 700 rolling acres so far , since spraying began in this province on july 31 , about 45 , 000 acres of coca has been hit , about a quarter of what has been sprayed nationwide since the start of the year at first , it looks like nothing has been dropped , said blanca l pez , 31 , whose coca was sprayed two weeks ago but then you go and see the effects the leaves start to turn and are just left black now her field is filled with dry , dying stalks of coca , and she worries about her plantains , bananas , yucca and other crops this is a disaster , she said now we do not know what we are going to do

fate was always rather cruel to the marquis de sade , even in death , though all he asked for was an unmarked grave in a rustic setting all traces of my tomb will disappear from the face of the earth , he wrote in his will , just as i hope all traces of my memory will be erased from the memory of men but when donatienalphonsefran ois de sade died in 1814 at age 74 , at charenton , a french asylum for the insane , his son arranged for the usual roman catholic rites , and he was buried in the cemetery there , his grave marked by a cross a few years later , sade s corpse was dug up and his skull taken away by a doctor , who wished to study it the 21st century has not erased the traces of this aristocratic revolutionary and provocateur , who spent almost all of his adult life incarcerated for sex crimes , blasphemy or pornography not his exuberant libido , or his extravagant intellect , or his mark on the bloodiest , most turbulent era of french history , spanning louis xv and xvi s reigns , the revolution , the terror and napoleon s empire on the contrary , sade s demoniacal cultural energy seems far from spent on friday , the marquis will make yet another remarkable entrance , this time in the captivating movie sade , directed by beno t jacquot and starring daniel auteuil in what some french reviewers have called his best performance far from forgotten , about a quarter of sade s enormous creative output has survived , and his books , published by grove press since the 1960 s , continue to sell juliette , justine philosophy in the bedroom , the 120 days at sodom these are bizarre , voluminous , still shocking catalogs of sexual pathology alternating with vociferous morality lessons at the metropolitan museum of art , the exhibition surrealism desire unbound is now displaying homages to the divine marquis , an idol of the surrealists arcade recently published letters from prison for the first time in english , revealing a very different sade often charming , tender and introspective and the muchpraised biography by francine du plessix gray , at home with the marquis de sade , and rikki ducornet s exquisite modernist novel , the fanmaker s inquisition , were both recently reissued in paperback philip kaufman s enthusiastically received movie quills , with geoffrey rush , was adapted by doug wright from his play of the same name in 2000 , and last month the long unfindable kitsch legend de sade \( 1969 \) was released on dvd it stars keir dullea as sade and john huston as his libertine uncle , abb de sade roger corman is listed as an uncredited director \( tagline he made evil an art , virtue a vice and pain a pleasure \) why does he merit our interest \? asked simone de beauvoir in must we burn sade \? , her extraordinary 1951 essay the fact is that it is neither as author nor as sexual pervert that sade compels our attention it is by virtue of the relationships which he created between these two aspects of himself if he is remembered , it is n't only because his name was given to a perversion \( witness the relative obscurity of the lesser known half of sadomasochism , leopold von sachermasoch , author of venus in fur \) the marquis has come to be credited for exploring themes and articulating concepts that would be taken up again a century after his death by nietzsche and freud and he is seen as a precursor of the surrealists and the existentialists , to say nothing of what some cultural critics call the modern imagination his arguments and he never ceased to argue touch upon every current controversy personal freedom , privacy , violence , abuse , incest , abortion , pollution , class , money , privilege , the corruption of institutions , the absence of god , the role of nature and the dilemma of gender but even beyond these conceptual categories , sade s creative work reveals the most primitive humanity hate , rage , greed , avarice , unquenchable lust , gluttony , jubilant fascination with waste , the furious compulsion to lacerate , pierce , despoil , violate , annihilate and vast systems of ideas constructed to justify its expression one need only follow the news to see the relevance of sade s obsessions and the pervasive sadomasochism of everyday life no , not s m dinner cafes featuring waitpersons dressed in leather and carrying fancy cato'ninetails , but the despoiling of children s innocence , the gross abuse of the weak , the politics of cruelty and numbness the marquis s texts make an ideal voiceover for the reports of wife beating , of slashings and burnings and rapes and also of the brazen chicanery of the powerful , the ruinous machinations of financiers , the embezzlements , the armies of homeless literature can rarely match everyday news of the world for horror and pain , but sade provided us with illuminating tableaux vivants 18thcentury closeups of the action in reading his work we find an echo of the eerie , opaque feeling many of us experienced watching the tape of osama bin laden and his friends cheerfully recalling the handiwork in the world trade center attacks why the opacity \? and what is the powerful discomfort about \? perhaps in part the implosion of inexpressible outrage , but also the bizarre voyeuristic fulfillment of seeing how the malefactor laughs
at first , the idea of following a single material through the weird , disjointed world of the brooklyn museum of art for the third installment of this series did n't seem especially promising the museum dwells in what might be called a state of glacial flux , plagued by financial problems , unending rehabilitations and space constraints that keep huge chunks of its collection in storage for years on end right now , the museum s complex floor plan is riddled by even more detours and closed galleries than usual the reconstruction of its grand staircase on eastern parkway is under way \( to be completed in 2004 \) , and half of its egyptian galleries are in the final throes of reinstallation \( reopening in april \) the staircase project also involves burrowing under the museum to install the apparatus that will finally enable brooklyn to climatize its older galleries , when it has the money so i set out a bit nervously , which may be why , like a newly hatched duckling , i imprinted on the first thing i saw at the entrance to the museum s african galleries near the lobby it was a gorgeous 19thcentury fibula , or cape clasp , from morocco made of intricately worked silver and enamel and set with carnelian it looked as if it could hold down a tent metal , i thought excitedly why not metal \? eureka well , duh given that the first of these articles followed ceramics through the metropolitan museum of art and the second explored textiles at the american museum of natural history , metallurgy was obviously next it is one of the crucial transformations of earthgiven materials that made human progress possible civilization s big bang basics , as they could be called , developed at different times , in different orders , all over the world , with different results the precolumbian peoples of south america , for example , never abandoned stone tools , reserving metalwork primarily for luxury and ceremonial items since ceramics and metallurgy involved fire and an alchemical transformation that must have struck early humans as miraculous , they figured importantly in creation narratives , with metalsmiths in particular often doubling as shamans and priests the meshing of religion , economic might , social and political status and daily usefulness is especially potent in metals because of their inherent beauty and durability in its rawest state metal has always had high market value and quickly became the most common form of currency the durability that made it so eternally useful helped many metal objects survive where ceramics shattered and fabrics rotted but value also eradicates objects and therefore history metal things were , and still are , continuously melted down to make other metal things following metals and metalwork through the brooklyn museum teaches one a lot , but hardly everything about the history of the family of malleable , ductile materials , whose bestknown members include iron , silver , gold and copper and whose most widely used alloys , especially in early times , are bronze \( copper and tin \) and brass \( copper and zinc \) the brooklyn metal route largely sidesteps western painting and sculpture and passes through nearly every open gallery in the museum although the points of interest include no overwhelming caches of objects to peruse , masterpieces show up regularly but part of the allure of the brooklyn museum at the moment is its combination of quality and spartanness you may sometimes feel that you are really prospecting , or on a treasure hunt metals can play starring , supporting , purely decorative or exceedingly minor roles yet because of metals' supreme shapeshifting capacities , a few , diverse objects can tell a material tale that encompasses an array of colors , of shapes and textures \( not to mention physical strength and weight \) , of purposes and meanings and of skills and aesthetic priorities with some huge gaps , the path here crosses nearly three dozen centuries and even more cultures , from chinese bronzes to spun aluminum , from new kingdom egypt to jazz age new york \( after all , no steel , no skyscrapers \) and of course the unfolding narrative concerns the sleeping giant that is the brooklyn museum and its considerable wonders , both present and potential africa and the americas i opted to begin my zigzagging metal hunt near the middle of brooklyn s recently renovated african galleries beyond the berber fibula , and not simply because of their proximity to the lobby the objects date from the 16th century to the 20th , and while wood predominates , the metals on hand here are among the most varied anywhere in the museum they range from the superfine elegance of a cast gold pendant of a coiled snake eating a toad to a sturdy wood kakongo power figure whose chest bristles with rusty nails and knife blades it makes sense that the only uses of found metal objects at brooklyn are in works from africa , where modern sculpture began \( looking closely reveals that many of the carved wood figures on view are adorned with iron pendants or wire earrings that combine found and made elements \)
cabo san lucas , mexico , oct 27 they want their economic borders to be more open they want their actual borders to be more secure they want to keep out terrorists , guns and bombs they want to speed in tourists , trade and data the 21 nations of the asia pacific economic cooperation today ended a summit meeting of world leaders with formal statements that showed how much the united states s campaign against terrorism is influencing the global agenda the nations , including the united states , china , russia , indonesia and japan , hold nearly half the world s people and control more than half its trade the strengths of american power were clear in a series of promises and proposals to make most of the rest of the world as secure from hijackers and bombers as the united states is trying to be the united states drafted and the conference adopted measures to heighten the security of millions of shipping containers , bolster the cockpit doors of international passenger and cargo airliners , and strengthen customs and border posts the united states also pushed for , and won , the first multinational agreement aimed at monitoring charities and moneytransfer offices suspected of financing terrorist organizations we will jointly work to deny terrorists access to the world s financial system and use the money trail to locate and apprehend terrorists , the conference s final declaration said the declaration acknowledges that terrorism threatens free , open and prosperous economies , as well as international peace , security and economic sustainability none of this would have been written before sept 11 , 2001 it escaped the attention of no member of this group devoted to world trade that the main target that day was the world trade center few failed to feel the secondary economic shock waves of the attack and few fail to acknowledge the american imperative against terrorism , or its warning that no nation is safe from the threat but weaknesses in the american agenda against the axis of evil also showed president bush persuaded no nation to condemn north korea or use economic sanctions to coerce it into abandoning its nuclearweapons program he won no new support for his proposed united nations resolution on iraq the conference s main declaration mentioned neither iraq nor north korea as a specific problem in a separate text , the leaders agreed merely on telling north korea to give up nuclear weapons programs they made no formal statement of any kind about iraq the conference called for the abolition of agricultural subsidies , which protect american farmers from market forces but hurt peasants in places like mexico in the end , some of the asian and pacific nations like indonesia , the site of a bombing this month that took roughly 200 lives , and the philippines , also hit by terrorist attacks remained as concerned with the economic causes of terrorism as with its economic consequences the leaders of those and other developing nations at the conference suggested that poverty remained a root cause of political violence , and that rich nations owed it to themselves and others to address it the war against terrorism is going to be long , difficult and borderless , said the president of the philippines , gloria macapagal arroyo security impedes prosperity , but at the same time , poverty feeds extremists that concern about poverty as a source of terrorism moves few in the white house , though some members of the administration , notably secretary of state colin l powell , have acknowledged it as legitimate the bush administration realized after the sept 11 attacks that south and east asia would be major fronts in its campaign against terrorism they saw , as one intelligence official put it a year ago , a concerted effort by bin laden and his people to expand their activities in indonesia , malaysia and the philippines , and began mobilizing against it many of the administration s efforts at this conference arose from that mobilization as rodolfo severino , secretary general of the association of southeast asian nations , said , the economic outlook for those nations does not now hinge on trade agreements or tourism campaigns rather , he said , it depends on what the terrorists do next

mother said \) , and three divorces ms whiting has been with her fourth husband , jack wrangler , a cabaret writer and director , for 25 years , but the relationship was not without adjustments mr wrangler , at the time ms whiting met him , was a star of pornographic movies , predominantly gay ms whiting , however , is of the donotcomplain , getonwithit school her hairdresser makeup man is leaving just as the reporter arrives , and perhaps that is what it will be put on a happy face or it may be something simpler that ms whiting , as she maintains , is a chronic optimist a few years ago , she had a stroke she also broke her knee a few years ago in a fall on a new york city sidewalk in her own apartment she walks slowly , with a hand out , as if needing to know where she can find support ask her about that stroke , and she 'll dismiss it five and a half years ago , while singing in phoenix , she got off the stage and found she was slurring her words a bit , but there have been no lingering effects , she says as for her leg , she uses a cane in bad weather ask her about the lawsuit she and her husband filed after she broke her knee , a notorious lawsuit in which they asked for a total of 3 million in damages , claiming loss of conjugal fellowship and sexual fulfillment , and she 'll deny they made those claims none of that s true , she 'll say , before girlishly segueing into a story about the handsome doctor who treated her in the emergency room , who told her she 'd be awake when he fixed her leg and they could talk about her singing then , i do n't think it had anything to do with jack , it was just a certain way the lawyers put it according to news reports , he sued for 1 million i guess it was there in her autobiography , it might as well be spring , ms whiting has talked about the difficulties of her early days with mr wrangler , of trying to convince him that he was too good to make pornographic films these days , she prefers to talk about music , about the old days in hollywood the night she and mel torm and judy garland and martha raye and mickey rooney were sitting around her mother s house , and johnny mercer called up and asked if he and harold arlen could come over and play some tunes from a picture they 'd be working on the picture was blues in the night the song was my mama done tol' me , as it was then called the gang made mr mercer play the song maybe nine times , and when it was over , ms whiting and ms garland raced to the piano to see who could learn the lyrics first now , she laughs , do you understand why she says she has had a happy life \?

a note with the signatures of ted williams and two of his children dated november 2000 , declaring their desire to be cryonically preserved upon their deaths , was filed with a florida court yesterday in the battle over williams s body the written pact represents the newest chapter in john henry and claudia williams s fight with their half sister , barbara joyce williams ferrell ferrell wants their father s body returned from a cryonics facility in arizona and cremated as he specified in his 1996 will williams , the former boston red sox slugger , died july 5 to me , this note is the end of the road , said robert goldman , the lawyer for john henry and claudia williams the judge has to rely on the paper unless somebody can prove that it s disingenuous the note was written in blue ink on a scrap of paper , goldman said , and dated nov 2 , 2000 , in his hospital room at the university of florida in gainesville , where williams awaited an angiogram and surgery to implant a pacemaker the creased , smudged and stained note reads jhw , claudia and dad all agree to be put into biostasis after we die this is what we want , to be able to be together in the future , even if it is only a chance john henry williams left the note , which was not notarized , in the trunk of his car , then discovered it sometime later , goldman said they did n't say , 'let s take this document and put it in a safe place , ' goldman said they were running back and forth , hoping their father would get better in a statement , john henry and claudia williams said our father knew , as we did , that our decision to have our bodies preserved would seem odd , even crazy , to many , particularly those of his generation what happens to people s bodies upon death is largely a matter of religious tradition our father was not a religious man the faith that many place in god we place in science and other human endeavors they continued we believe in the potential for regenerative science to advance substantially in the next 100 years our father was originally skeptical when the subject of cryonics was first broached we talked about it many times but his doubts eased over several months and , they said , his attitude was , 'if there is a chance that we can be reunited in the future , let s take it' the note did not impress ferrell s lawyer , richard fitzpatrick , who questioned its authenticity if the note is the only documentation that john henry and claudia will rely on to contradict the clear terms of their father s last will and testament , he said , then i feel very good about having my client s wishes enforced show us something show us some authenticity , fitzpatrick said candidly , what barbara joyce would have anticipated seeing was a codicil to the will , a formal document , not something with oil stains on it the case is almost certainly headed for trial in the probate division of florida circuit court in citrus county on tuesday , john henry and claudia williams withdrew a motion to the court for mandatory mediation with ferrell judge patricia thomas will have to decide the authenticity of the note , the conditions under which it was signed and williams s mental condition when he signed it she may also consider how much weight to give oral testimony and williams s request for cremation in his will florida law generally lets the survivors determine how to dispose of a body the alcor life extension foundation in arizona , where williams is cryonically preserved , requires presentation of a healthcare power of attorney to accept a body , or , short of such a document , the agreement of a guardian , spouse or a majority of a dead person s children , said ron carmichael , the facility s lawyer rohan kelley , a probate lawyer in fort lauderdale , said that a judge was not bound to agree with the wishes expressed in a will or a note a handwritten note does n't mean the person may not have changed his mind again , kelley said the judge is probably going to assess all the equities in the situation , and the wishes of the decedent , if they can be determined fitzpatrick said he would present witnesses who could testify that williams clearly indicated his desire to be cremated before and after the date of the note it s interesting that a man who had a history of legal contracts would make such an important and unusual decision by putting it on a scrap of paper , fitzpatrick added the appearance of the note yesterday came with a motion for partial summary judgment filed by john henry and claudia williams , seeking to declare that the executor of the will has no further role regarding the disposition of the body and asking if judge thomas has any jurisdiction over the body , which is no longer in florida after filing the motion , goldman unleashed a verbal attack against ferrell and her relationship with her father , who disinherited her in his will she was trouble in life for ted , goldman said in a conference call he could not stand her he used terms i could not use on this phone fitzpatrick denied goldman s characterization and said her relationship with her father prior to being banned by john henry was a good one a natural , normal relationship none of his children were close to him throughout their lives , and all were closer to him toward the end of his life goldman said it would be hard to imagine ted williams confiding in ferrell a desire to be frozen until medical science could revive him he would no more confide in her on any subject , he said , much less a private one john henry told his half sister about the plan last year upon their father s death , she said that he told her of his plan to freeze him and to sell his dna to produce little ted williamses in their statement , john henry and claudia williams denied that any such plan existed unfortunately , we must defend ourselves against hurtful charges that we intend to profit from this decision , either by cloning or selling dna , they said that is not true photos john henry and claudia williams say this note , made public yesterday , proves ted williams chose cryonics over cremation \( reuters \) \( pg d1 \) ted

of fame induction , his troubled life became public , and he told the atlanta journal and constitution because of all this publicity over my situation , people treat me like i'm dying or something and i do n't want their pity things in general , they 're getting a lot better at the time , the pittsburgh postgazette reported that webster was homeless , unemployed , deep in debt , beset with medical ailments , lacking health insurance , in the midst of divorce , in the care of a psychiatrist and on medication , and involved in a complex lawsuit over real estate investments but webster tried to reassure people that his life was not as damaged as it seemed i do n't think it s anybody s business , he said of his problems i'm not destitute and responding to reports that he had lived in his car for 18 months , he told the st petersburg times from time to time , yes , i did sleep in my car and stay in my car there s a broad definition of what living out of your car is and yes , i slept in a train station one time i had some things to think through i was n't broke i was n't in danger i was just out of gas , tired and exhausted , and that s as far as i got that day in 1999 , webster was

asadabad , afghanistan , aug 23 after months of frustration , american commanders appear to have concluded that osama bin laden is probably still alive and moving between mountain hideouts somewhere on a 250mile stretch of the border between afghanistan and pakistan the hunt for mr bin laden and his top lieutenant , ayman alzawahiri , has proved to be as murky as the silted rivers flowing through these inhospitable mountains nearly a year after sept 11 , and nearly nine months after mr bin laden s associates delivered their last videotape of him discussing the attacks in new york and washington , hard facts about the quest are elusive but some american officers , speaking privately , say the assumption driving the manhunt is that the men are alive they cite afghan and pakistani intelligence reports , mostly sketchy , that have spoken of mr bin laden and an entourage of several dozen moving more than once since the american bombing of the tora bora mountains late last year some of those reports , the officers say , have suggested that the fugitives may have moved through the mountains on horseback , probably on cloudy nights to elude aerial surveillance the region being searched covers four provinces kunar , nangahar , paktika and paktia and the adjoining pakistani tribal areas at the time of the biggest american ground battle of the war at the shahikot valley , 100 miles southwest of kabul , in march american commanders said qaeda and taliban fighters , who resisted american troops for 11 days , might be protecting mr bin laden and mr zawahiri but after the battle , no trace of the qaeda leaders was found united states military spokesmen said some qaeda men appeared to have slipped through mountain passes toward pakistan a spokesman for the american command , lt col roger king , said special forces units deployed to bases like the one at asadabad were working on the assumption that applying pressure on any possible hideout was the best means of exposing their quarry i 'd say it s a reasonable conclusion that we feel that if bin laden is alive , we 're providing enough pressure to make sure he keeps moving , colonel king said it s easier to spot a moving target the special forces units leading the hunt move by helicopter or in camouflaged humvee jeeps , often followed by clusters of helmeted soldiers clutching assault rifles operating deep in tribal areas where suspicions of outsiders run high , the soldiers show an edginess that hints at the hazards and the importance of their mission twice in august , the americans opened fire on afghans in the asadabad area , killing five men on one occasion , the americans acted after a man in a passing vehicle appeared to be aiming his rifle at them the victims turned out to be relatives of a local tribal chief with past taliban connections , but many here say the americans killed men with no current links to islamic militants who is on whose side , whom to trust , whom to regard as a potential enemy has been a conundrum for the americans from the moment they arrived mostly the americans have relied on local tribal leaders , but relations with them can be fickle on wednesday evening , surrounded by some of the most powerful men in asadabad , hajji rohullah wakil , a tribal leader , said it was possible that al qaeda was regrouping in the mountain fastnesses but mr wakil said he had his doubts and had passed them on to the special forces , who set up a base here several months ago i told them , 'if there are al qaeda , tell us and we 'll take care of them , ' mr wakil , 42 , said as he sat on a pile of mats in his compound , in the satisfied afterglow of a dinner for a new regional governor as if to prove the futility of the american quest , he added , it s been three months , and they have n't caught any al qaeda a few hours after that conversation , american soldiers made a surprise swoop in asadabad , and their target could hardly have been a bigger surprise mr wakil and 11 of his associates , all of whom were tied up with plastic handcuffs , were loaded aboard a helicopter and whisked off to the american military headquarters at the bagram air base , north of kabul american troops on both sides of the border have dropped leaflets urging the people to turn in any qaeda terrorists who seek refuge and proclaiming the 25 million reward that washington has posted for mr bin laden one pashtolanguage pamphlet handed out in torkham , a pakistani border town , read the taliban and al qaeda have devastated your country they are your , and our , enemies , so help us arrest them in public , american commanders continue to say what they have for months that mr bin laden and mr zawahiri may be alive , or they may be dead , and that if they are alive , they may be in afghanistan or in pakistan those statements form a pattern of understatement adopted after the failure last year to find any fugitives at tora bora the pentagon believed then that it had the qaeda leader trapped in the caves southeast of jalalabad , but failed to find any trace of him after pulverizing the caves with waves of b52 bombing
new rochelle after 27 days of nervous waiting and watching , the eggs finally started to rock by the end of the school day , two of the six eggs were showing small cracks , and the children in donna conte s thirdgrade class left school with an extra spring in their step the next morning , cullen martin woke up an hour early and was the first one at school ashley gallin said she sprinted downstairs after getting out of bed , yelling to no one in particular today is hatching day ! indeed , it was mrs conte s class is one of four at daniel webster magnet school in a gracious suburban neighborhood here that tries to hatch chicken or duck eggs every year , part of a curriculum that 4h , the venerable farm education program , offers to scores of public and private schools in westchester county it would be an understatement to say that , for the third graders , the hatching experiment is the highlight of the school year but with the promise of new life fuzzy , yellow and impossibly adorable comes peril one year the electricity went off throughout the school and not a single egg hatched to make matters worse , one of the eggs exploded all over senta f stich , principal of daniel webster and an intrepid former biology major , as she tried to show the children how the chick had developed i ruined a beautiful blouse , she recalled , smiling weakly is n't 4h a country thing with cows and oversize pumpkins , blue ribbons and state fairs \? not entirely it began that way a century ago , but across the united states , 90 percent of 4h clubs are now in urban and suburban settings westchester has an active 4h network , with thousands of children involved in schoolbased academic projects and many others enrolled in some 30 clubs , each with a different focus while most of the clubs are rooted in science , many have nothing to do with agriculture or cooking , the traditional twin pillars of 4h it does n't matter what the content is , said maryjo gallo , director of the 4h youth development program , which is part of cornell cooperative extension in westchester it s the process of learning how to set goals and documenting how they have met those goals in mount vernon , there is a club devoted to sport fishing , while next door in yonkers , there are clubs focused on clowning and mathematics farther north , in yorktown , is a club centered on dog obedience and here in new rochelle , there is a quilting club anyone with a curiosity about a certain topic or hobby can start a 4h club generally , two to three adults , usually parents , work with groups of 5 to 10 children about a quarter of the clubs are based in the schools , while the rest are in the community we exist with volunteers , said mrs gallo , whose office in valhalla operates with only three fulltime staff members whatever the content of the club , the children have a chance each summer to show off their newly acquired knowledge and skills at the 4h fair , to be held this year on july 13 and 14 at muscoot farm , the 777acre county park in somers it s about celebrating their accomplishments , mrs gallo said the climax of the 4h year , the fair draws thousands of participants and visitors as ribbons are awarded to the best exhibits but 4h is quick to point out that the competition tries to avoid pitting youngster against youngster we do n't support competitive judging , mrs gallo said we use a danish system so that if you sew a pillow , it is not compared with the pillow next to it but compared to a standard in westchester , as elsewhere , 4h reaches the most number of children more than 11 , 000 this year through its schoolbased curriculums , which win rave reviews from educators who have come to rely on the projects to fulfill their science instruction the 4h curriculum materials are phenomenal , said mrs stich , daniel webster s principal they 're very clear they have good concepts and they meet the national standards for science there are a number of academic programs for which schools can buy materials from 4h , often for a fraction of the cost of comparable teachers' guides sold through commercial publishers children can gain handson experience from a curriculum on hydroponics , the science of growing plants in a nonsoil medium like fiber or water , an increasingly common agricultural practice these days another program , charlie chestnut , instructs students in botany , conservation and genetics as it explores the threatened american chestnut tree but by far the most popular schoolbased program is the incubation and embryology project the hatching of chicks and ducklings this spring , about 200 teachers picked up eggs from the 4h offices in valhalla in midapril , mrs conte arranged six duck eggs four rouens and two pekins in a circle inside an incubator , set at 100 degrees , and numbered each with a magic marker the students watched as she turned the eggs three times a day during the 28day incubation they also studied the eggs as they were periodically candled , or examined in front of a light , keeping track of the progress in their egg diaries
hutchinson , kan , july 5 annika sorenstam and juli inkster were in familiar territory , and laura diaz was delighted to join them inkster and sorenstam know how to win the united states women s open , how to handle a difficult course like prairie dunes country club that can break a golfer s will halfway through the tournament , only three players remained under par , and the twotime defending champion , karrie webb , failed to make the cut it has been that kind of tournament unforgiving and unrelenting , with little mercy shown for mistakes sorenstam and inkster showed why they are past open champions , and diaz showed why she may be ready to break through the three were tied for the lead at oneunderpar 139 after today s second round , with michele redman and shani waugh tied for fourth place at even par sorenstam , who won the open in 1995 and '96 , shot a 69 today inkster , who won the 1999 open , and diaz shot 72 s diaz is looking for her first major after earning her first two lpga victories this year with 36 holes of difficult golf remaining , none of the leaders felt overconfident , because too many things can happen it s tough out there , said inkster , who had a double bogey on her second hole and bogeys on her final two holes you 've got to hit fairways if you do n't , you 're going to scramble to make par but i did n't panic out there i fought that s what you 've got to do out here for anyone looking for a favorite this weekend , look no further than sorenstam , who has won 6 of her 12 starts on the lpga tour this year a player who wins that much is not fazed by much , but not even sorenstam was immune to the hazards of prairie dunes the wind was stronger than it was thursday , occasionally swirling about 20 miles an hour sorenstam , diaz and inkster all played in the afternoon , when conditions were most difficult , and sorenstam ended her day with a bogey on her final hole , no 9 , missing a twofoot putt sorenstam s putting has not been at its best this week , which may open the door a little wider for the other players overall , i'm happy , sorenstam said after a round that included three birdies and three bogeys that last putt looked like it hit something and jumped to the left i 'd like to putt a little better i made some good putts , but it s not as clean as i 'd like it to be luckily , i'm hitting it really well , and hitting a lot of fairways i'm not complaining neither was diaz , a 27yearold former star at wake forest who has developed into one of the lpga s best players after two titles this year , the next step in diaz s progression would be to win a major , but she did not want to look past saturday there s a lot of golf left to play , and i 've had a pretty good year , diaz said hopefully , i 'll be able to draw on all of my threeandahalfyear experience on the lpga tour to get me through the next two days this course is extremely difficult it ranks right up there with the most difficult course i have ever played inkster , waugh and diaz began the round sharing the lead at three under par , but it became clear early that scores would be higher today many players were shaking their head at various times , trying to keep bogeys from piling up you 're going to make bogeys in this type of championship , sorenstam said but if i make birdies , i'm fine that s my attitude this week whoever wins will have to remain mentally strong , because as the greens become harder and the fairways become faster , the course will become even more difficult there was no rain in the weekend forecast , and the wind was expected to blow on saturday the way it did today that meant the weekend would be a challenge , but many things have gone sorenstam s way this year , and she hoped that trend would continue i obviously feel very strong physically and mentally , sorenstam said i'm playing as good as i can i'm in a position i want to be in for the weekend photo juli inkster is tied for the lead with laura diaz and annika sorenstam after two rounds \( reuters \)
sacramento in the new , wideopen global marketplace , chinese garlic and apples are pushing out their california competitors mexican asparagus and raspberries are crowding the shelves of grocery stores , and the state is embroiled in a tomato war with canada over accusations of unfair trade california s status as the world s superpower of agriculture is being tested on all sides , even in the state s own supermarkets , prompting farmers and politicians here to question how they will continue to prosper agriculture is the top industry in the state farmers and ranchers , who consistently outperform hollywood s entertainment barons and silicon valley s technology tycoons , earned 27 billion in sales last year until recently , they thrived largely without the kinds of subsidies the federal government has long given to producers of grain , fiber and fodder but with the advent of open markets guaranteed by treaties like the north american free trade agreement , the state s fruit and vegetable farmers are suddenly interested in federal farm subsidies until now , only the state s rice and cotton farmers have received the cash payments , which mainly go to farmers in the midwest and the south only about 3 percent of the 20 billion in annual federal subsidies have typically gone to california farmers , even though the state is the biggest producer in the country we 've been fiercely independent out here , said william j lyons jr , the state secretary of agriculture but there s now competition in california , and that s really scary after canvassing farmers up and down the state , mr lyons has begun what he calls the first stage of a campaign to persuade the federal government to extend subsidies to the fruit and vegetable farmers of california the main mechanism would be to let them take part in conservation programs that protect the environment by setting aside land , cleaning water and improving farmland by planting buffer strips or creating wetlands we have the largest agriculture industry and one of the most environmentally sensitive , he said we need a farm bill that is more inclusive and addresses better conservation and market enhancement but california s new enthusiasm for broader subsidies to help cushion the shock from global competition has hit a roadblock in washington in recent private negotiations on a final farm bill , lawmakers agreed to continue financing for the traditional commodity crops but to trim proposed conservation spending , saying there is no more money when congress returns on tuesday , house and senate negotiators will meet for final decisions as the bill wound its way through congress , california s two senators made a rare move to flex the state s muscle on the farm bill but to the surprise of many lawmakers , the senators , dianne feinstein and barbara boxer , both democrats , ended up favoring the traditional recipients of commodity subsidies , inadvertently undermining the conservation programs promoted by most of the state s farmers reversing their earlier votes , they decided against limiting individual farmers to 275 , 000 in annual subsidies , saying it would be unfair to the state s rice and cotton farmers without those limits , lawmakers say , more than 2 billion will have to be cut from conservation programs the two senators later said they also wanted to put back money for conservation the dispute over the bill s priorities has ricocheted across the state i feel like the senators caved in , turning their backs on what matters to most of us farmers , said judith redmond , a farm partner of the full belly organic farm outside guinda in the springgreen hills of the capay valley we have done without any government payments , and done well , ms redmond said but we do need help to protect the land , and the riverbanks unlike some of the huge farmers to the south who rely on exports , ms redmond and her three partners are worried about competition for market share in california from their small farm of 100 acres , planted with fruit and nut orchards and interspersed with rows of vegetables and flowers , the organic farmers earn a gross income of 13 million each year they sell to local farmers markets , to restaurants and , increasingly , to town dwellers who buy annual subscriptions for produce delivered weekly whatever the federal government does , the state government is already stepping in responding to increasing fears of competition , gov gray davis is planning a buy california campaign to begin in june in an effort to persuade consumers to demand that the foreign fruits and vegetables in stores be replaced by produce grown in california with help from federal grants , governor davis will try to sell california to californians with 35 million worth of newspaper and magazine advertisements and television , radio and internet promotions over three years , said ralph watts , the campaign s chief executive it may not be the academy awards , but if 'buy california' works we will at least hold on to the market we have here , mr watts said we have gone from a free , unsubsidized farm state to now we are afraid of the global market the program will start during the democratic governor s reelection campaign in a bid for support from farmers , a critical swing vote this is something we 're going to be talking about a lot in the campaign it would be very tough to win the race without the central valley , said roger salazar , a spokesman for the governor , referring to the heartland of california agriculture

campaign to thrive in the global market , said bob pauli , president of the california farm bureau none of us knows where this farm legislation is going to end up , he said we 'd like programs to deal with the ground water problems we have here that help all farmers as a fruit grower and vintner , mr pauli has never received federal subsidies but as president of the farm bureau , he said he understood why the rice and cotton guys are so dependent on government payments , mainly because they have received them since the depression straddling the center are the rice farmers themselves

protect the environment , and it produces the no 1 brand in the domestic organic rice market yet the lundberg family is also part of the oldfashioned subsidy system and received 32 million in payments over the last five years , the 10thlargest sum in california mr lundberg said he did not want any limit on those payments globalization has made all produce more competitive , he said i ca n't say why rice should get subsidies and not vegetables , but it is a question of a stable food supply photos doris day works at the lundberg family farms in richvale , which has been paid 32 million over the

alsea , ore , jan 30 there are wild salmon in rivers across the pacific northwest , fish that spawn in gravel beds and grow in the rushing fresh water then they head deep into the pacific ocean before journeying back to spawn and die in the streams where they were born there are also salmon that complete a similar voyage , though they are born in and return to a different place , a governmentrun hatchery spawned in plastic pails , raised in concrete pools , they are the majority in many northwestern rivers now , as their wild cousins battle extinction but because the wild and hatchery salmon are of the same species , they are at the heart of a legal battle over the issue of extinction , and of just how much should be done to protect and restore the habitat that wild salmon need to spawn the question is this what is the difference between wild fish and hatchery ones \? absolutely none , say some critics of the endangered species act , who contend that federal fish regulators have wrongly looked only at the condition of the wild salmon to determine whether fish in rivers like the alsea , here in the oregon coastal range , should be considered threatened a federal judge largely agrees with them , ruling in september that regulators arbitrarily and capriciously treated the alsea s wild and hatchery salmon differently when listing the wild fish as threatened the ruling , by judge michael r hogan of federal district court in eugene , ore , is being appealed but it has prompted the bush administration to announce a thorough review of the listings for two dozen groups of pacific salmon and steelhead \( another kind of fish , capable of returning to sea after spawning \) in other western rivers and to consider new rules that would factor in the strength of hatchery stock in designating species as endangered meanwhile , the propertyrights group that prevailed in the first round of the fight here is opening a new front this coming week , filing a lawsuit to block protections for fish in the klamath river basin , where enraged farmers were denied irrigation water last summer to protect the wild fish there the group s initial suit was intended to overturn logging restrictions that had been put in place to safeguard the salmon environmental groups say that if the ruling is upheld , it could fundamentally alter the intent of the endangered species act it is supposed to protect creatures in their natural habitat , in the wild , said patti goldman , a lawyer for earthjustice , an environmental group involved in the lawsuit otherwise , ms goldman said , it s like we 're saying that lions in zoos are exactly the same as lions in the serengeti her opponents are happy to use the same analogy that just seems to make our argument , because they 're both lions , said russell c brooks , a lawyer for the pacific legal foundation , a private group that litigates on behalf of property rights whoever is making this statement , i 'd certainly challenge them to go stick their head in the lion cage in the zoo , because that lion is just as wild as the lion in the jungle it s the same species indeed , the two types of coho salmon at issue here are the same species , capable of interbreeding when a hatchery fish veers into the habitat of a wild fish , or vice versa nevertheless , the growing reliance on hatchery fish raises questions about the longterm health of the salmon population hatchery fish are more genetically similar to each other , and they are also more prone to mass outbreaks of disease at the alsea fish hatchery here , run by the oregon department of fish and wildlife , where nearly half a million fish are raised each year , the hatchers are quick to point out that hatchery fish were never intended to replace the wild fish they can complement , but they ca n't replace wild fish , explained tim schamber , the hatchery manager , taking a break the other day from harvesting eggs from winter steelhead , a magnificent gray fish with a shimmering rainbow collection of colors in its scales you can run into a real genetic bottleneck for future fisheries if you do that , mr schamber said , returning to squeezing and pumping fish with air to force the eggs , 3 , 000 per average female , into a bucket but because hatchery fish augment the wild fish and in some cases wind up breeding with them the offspring are called strays it is difficult to make precise biological and physical distinctions between them for that reason , the national marine fisheries service said judge hogan s ruling raised a valid point in questioning why the two fish categories are treated differently the hatchery fish certainly have a role in recovery , and a part to play in an esa listing , said brian gorman , a spokesman for the service , referring to the endangered species act it s time that we articulate what the proper role of hatchery fish is when we make a listing david bayles , conservation director for pacific rivers council , an environmental group based in eugene that is involved in the legal battle , said , the endangered species act was designed to protect habitat for wild fish , not concrete pools for manmade salmon in a wild salmon stream , it s survival of the fittest , mr bayles said in a hatchery situation , everybody survives , and ultimately you 're producing a lot of unfit fish but mr brooks , the pacific legal foundation lawyer , said such protections amounted to a political agenda that had brought economic pain our rivers and streams are teeming with salmon , mr brooks said , yet farmers have been allowed to go bankrupt , businesses are closing and lives are being destroyed while government officials explain away listing fish that really are n't endangered at all among fisheries biologists , there is virtually no support for making hatchery fish the sole source for a river , though in some places , including the snake river in idaho and washington , the returning numbers of wild salmon are so small that hatcheries are the dominant provider of some types of salmon however , biologists differ on just how much of a role the hatcheries should play t charley dewberry , a restoration ecologist , has been studying salmon in knowles creek , on the western slope of the oregon coast range near here , for 20 years his efforts to restore the salmon habitat have been financed by the national forest service , private timber companies and pacific rivers council studying schools of juvenile wild salmon the other day , mr dewberry pointed to areas where logjams had helped create the shady , protected areas where they like to spawn wild coho salmon populations in the oregon coast area are at less than 5 percent of what they were in 1900 , when more than a million fish returned to spawn each year , according to the pacific coast federation of fishermen s associations hatcheries have been around for more than 100 years and have a role to play , mr dewberry said but the longterm aim , he said , should be to restore most rivers and their ecosystems to a condition in which wild salmon can thrive on their own we 've got a patient in cardiac arrest , and that s what the coho situation is , he said so they 're on a heart machine right now but the goal is not to keep your patient on the machine the goal should be to get the patient off the machine photos t charley dewberry , above ,

richmond , va , sept 19 battered women in virginia s 68 shelters designed to hold off abusive spouses and boyfriends are resorting to an old homespun outlet for their fears and frustrations at night in their sanctuaries they are concocting a giant quilt filled with confessional messages of depression and resistance in the common hope for a safer existence mine was a classic selfdestructive relationship , said sheila mandt , a salvation army worker i clung to it i fled across four states , fleeing him , fleeing myself after all the battering at the hands of her former boyfriend , ms mandt said , she decided she had a bigger score to settle with herself so she started the statewide quilting project to bring forth some of the victims she finds hiding , cowering and surviving in solitude and in need of some mutual sign of perseverance i figured quilting , sewing , that s the stereotype of what women do , right \? said ms mandt , 36 , grateful for any sense of irony the public might perceive when the 150by10foot quilt is unveiled this fall exhausted mothers , teenage girls wary of beaus , grayhaired grandmothers slapped around by family patriarchs , plus children and at least one male spouse have been making individualized panels for the quilt to show the public how widespread and dismal the problem of domestic violence remains there is a sad panel commemorating the death of sigrid , a woman who was killed along with her two children by her husband there is a defiant panel celebrating the continuing life of guinette , repeatedly stalked at night , beaten and stabbed , ms mandt said , but still alive enough to contribute to the quilt it s not what people imagine some poor , africanamerican woman with children , dependent and trapped by an abuser , said ms mandt , a native new yorker it crosses racial and economic barriers and can touch anybody she said she has admitted her own past weakness in clinging to a relationship that turned out to be special solely for the chronic beatings she suffered i had all the opportunities in the world and still went down the wrong road , she said i ended up in a relationship that , to save my life , i could n't get out of the police and prosecutor turned me away when i sought help , telling me i was asking for trouble by choosing to stay in that environment i had people at work reduced to laughing at me because of the bruises on my face ms mandt said that when her boyfriend began delighting in describing in detail how he would murder her , she finally mustered the courage to flee to another part of the country in the last decade , she managed a new life , happily marrying a gentle man and plunging into social work she is director of development for the salvation army s richmond region an instinctive organizer , ms mandt comes across all manner of human conflicts and needs in her job but none , she found , are so repetitive and relentless as the battering syndrome that had been quietly haunting her from the life she fled 12 years ago a beating every 15 seconds , a murder every 27 minutes , she said , summarizing the national statistics on domestic violence this is such a routine part of life s fabric that a quilt from the hands of its victims strikes her as a worthy statement ms mandt started the quilt project with help from virginians against domestic violence , a private advocacy group she found eager support from state attorney general jerry kilgore , who became the project cochairman , plus corporate help here from the philip morris headquarters we needed a celebrity so i looked up sissy spacek s address , wrote to her , and got a reply that she 'd be happy to be cochairperson , ms mandt said she is the first to acknowledge that a quilt is nothing much simplicity itself , in fact , tangible and work intensive , but ideal , she says , for trying something creative from the misery being shared in the 68 shelters eventually , the giant quilt is to be divided into 14 quilts that will hang in corporate headquarters that s where the message should go , not in the shelters , ms mandt said battered women already know all about the problem photo sheila mandt , left , a salvation army social worker , and julia pfaff , a seamstress , in ms pfaff s richmond , va , studio on friday with a quilt being made by survivors of domestic violence who live in shelters across the state \( dean hoffmeyer for the new york times \)
baseball has come to this in the first three years of the remaining six guaranteed years of his contract , mike hampton will play for one team and be paid the bulk of his 355 million salary by another team maybe , if a minor miracle occurs , hampton could pitch against that team , the florida marlins , in a game that could decide the national league east championship if commissioner bud selig approves , as structured , the threepronged trade that would send hampton from colorado to atlanta and assorted other players to the rockies and the marlins , hampton could be in the position of pitching for the nl pennant against florida or maybe sometime in the last three years of his contract against the rockies , who will pay smaller parts of his salary those years the marlins and the rockies would n't be making electronic deposits into hampton s bank account on the 15th and 30th of each month of the season , but the checks the braves would be handing hampton would be financed by money they received from those teams selig will scrutinize this complex deal before he approves it before he can consider it , he has to get the details straight everyone has a different view on the deal , one official said i do n't know who s paying what that s something that s going to have to be looked at closely it all seems to be a muddle with all the money involved in the contracts that are being traded , it might take time to sort out who pays what to whom some reports yesterday , for example , said the braves would pay none of hampton s salary in 2006 , '07 and '08 , the last three years the marlins would pay 38 million , the rockies 5 million but a person with knowledge of the deal said that the braves' financial burden would be lighter the first three years , and they would pay the bulk of his salary the last three years an agent not linked to any player in the trade said he heard that same description of the hampton payout , with the braves' total coming to 50 million of the 845 million the pitcher is owed the agent said that by paying less of hampton s salary the first three years , the braves would have greater flexibility to sign one of their freeagent pitchers , tom glavine or greg maddux , to a contract of three or four years when the braves' pending acquisition of hampton became known saturday , it was believed that the braves would not try to sign glavine , who , like hampton , is a lefthander , but would pursue maddux , a righthander if that were so , it would leave the mets battling philadelphia for glavine , whom both teams covet but that might not be the braves' plan at all the braves gave glavine a new proposal friday night , raising their oneyear , 9 million offer to 9 million to 10 million a year for two years and an option for a third year that would depend on how much he pitched in the previous year or two what i'm hearing is they 're giving up on maddux and want glavine instead , the agent said i was told maddux s demands were so high that the braves realized they were n't going to be able to do it if the agent is correct , it will come as unwelcome news to the mets and the phillies it seems highly unlikely that glavine would have any reason to leave the braves if their ultimate offer was close in years and money to the other offers hampton was eager to leave the rockies , but he was not prepared to waive his notrade clause and accept a trade to the marlins his agent , mark rodgers , informed the marlins of that stance , but he also told them hampton would accept a trade to one of several other teams that s what led to the trade with the braves for the rockiesmarlins trade to be completed , charles johnson , the florida catcher , also had to waive his notrade clause there was a report that hampton was paying johnson 1 million for his waiver , but as intriguing as that idea might be , it was not true that would be a first , one player paying another to facilitate a trade , but the players association would never allow it the marlins will pay johnson 1 million to offset the state income tax he will have to pay in colorado that he would n't have had to pay in florida the erroneous report might have stemmed from a conversation a reporter had with hampton s wife , kautia told that johnson would n't approve the trade because the marlins initially balked at giving him 1 million , she said , oh , we 'll pay the million dollars the hamptons wo n't be paying it , but the marlins and the rockies will be paying a hefty part of hampton s salary , making whatever the amount is the most cash ever included in a trade that s why it will draw the commissioner s scrutiny but selig will probably approve it because , as one person involved in the trade said , if the commissioner is intent on teams' reducing their payrolls , this does it for two teams
gygistar won yesterday s dwyer stakes at belmont , but he may not have fulfilled his main objective is he a legitimate contender for top 3yearold races like the haskell and travers \? the answer is , probably not the mileandasixteenth dwyer is the unofficial beginning to the second season for the nation s top 3yearolds and typically brings together lightly raced horses hoping to prove they belong with the cream of the division this year was no exception among the six entered , none had established themselves as a top stakes competitor , but a few had shown potential and none more so than gygistar a gelding by prospector s music , he came in with a 4for5 career record and was impressive in winning the riva ridge on june 8 but he had never won beyond seveneighths of a mile , raising questions about his ability to go a distance despite winning yesterday , those questions seem more relevant than ever gygistar nearly squandered a huge lead in the stretch , winning by a halflength over nothing flat after opening up by six with a furlong remaining the 1 million travers stakes , the saratoga showcase race run at a mile and a quarter , seems beyond his range it was a tough one to get beat in , said nick zito , the trainer of nothing flat , who launched a strong stretch rally that fell just short you can see that horse , gygistar , does n't want to go that far the dwyer was an oddly run race yankee gentleman , the second choice in the wagering , seemed certain to go to the lead , while gygistar figured to sit a couple of lengths behind him instead , yankee gentleman hit the gate at the start and then ducked into the gap by the time the jockey jerry bailey got him straightened out , he was about three lengths off the lead meanwhile , gygistar stumbled a few strides out of the gate and his jockey , john velazquez , said that it scared him , causing him to run off being out front like that was not the plan , velazquez said he just took off on me gygistar opened up on the field , leading by more than three lengths after an opening quartermile in 2372 seconds yankee gentleman made his move approaching the turn and whittled gygistar s lead to a halflength but he had worked too hard to get there gygistar spurted away from his challenger and seemed on his way to an easy victory nothing flat , who was last down the backstretch , was still fourth at the eighth pole but surged with menacing strides to fall just short velazquez argued that gygistar s race was better than it looked he was on the lead so long that he got bored , velazquez said he was just loping along and he did n't want to switch leads that other horse came so wide that he was n't paying any attention to him once he saw him , he gave me something and started running again i think he 'll be better when he has a target to run at the winning trainer , mark hennig , agreed that the victory could have been more impressive i would have liked to see more , but i also would have liked to see the race unfold differently , he said around two turns it probably will we 've got plenty of time to think about his future i might consider the jim dandy or the haskell i do n't know if they have enough horses to go around for both , so we might look at whichever race seems a little lighter owned by william condren , nothing flat is likely to make his next start in the jim dandy on aug 4 at saratoga , where he could earn a trip to the travers though beaten yesterday , he took a big step forward after winning a minor stakes at delaware park in his last start and seems to be getting better with each start he ran a powerful race , zito said going in , i told mr condren that as long as he runs well it will show that he s moving forward gygistar completed the race , which was run over a fast track , in 1 4259 , and paid 420 for a 2 bet to win american style , also trained by zito , finished a nonthreatening third yankee gentleman faded to fifth velazquez , the meet s leading rider with 44 victories , won his third belmont stakes race in just two days on saturday , he won the prioress with carson hollow and the suburban with e dubai he also captured thursday s tom fool with left bank photo gygistar and the jockey john velazquez capturing the dwyer stakes by a dwindling halflength yesterday \( associated press \)
how is it that i became a writer \? it was n't a likely thing for me to have done , nor was it something i chose , as you might choose to be a lawyer or a dentist it simply happened , suddenly , in 1956 , while i was crossing the football field on the way home from school i wrote a poem in my head and then i wrote it down , and after that writing was the only thing i wanted to do i did n't know that this poem of mine was n't at all good , and if i had known , i probably would n't have cared it was n't the result but the experience that had hooked me it was the electricity my transition from not being a writer to being one was instantaneous , like the change from docile bank clerk to fanged monster in b movies anyone looking might have thought i 'd been exposed to some chemical or cosmic ray of the kind that causes rats to become gigantic or men to become invisible i was n't old enough to be at all selfconscious about what had just happened to me if i 'd read more about writers' lives , or indeed anything at all about them , i would have concealed the shameful transformation that had just taken place in me instead i announced it , much to the shock of the group of girls with whom i ate my paperbag lunches in the high school cafeteria one of them has since told me that she thought i was very brave , to just come out with something like that she thought i had a lot of nerve in truth i was simply ignorant there was also , as it turned out , the dismay of my parents to be reckoned with their tolerance about caterpillars and beetles and other nonhuman life forms did not quite extend to artists as was their habit , they bit their tongues and decided to wait out what they hoped would be a phase , and made oblique suggestions about the necessity of having a paying job one of my mother s friends was more cheerful that s nice , dear , she said , because at least you 'll be able to do it at home \( she assumed that , like all rightthinking girls , i would eventually have a home she was n't up on the current dirt about female writers , and did not know that these stern and dedicated creatures were supposed to forgo all of that , in favor of warped virginity or seedy loose living , or suicide suffering of one kind or another \) if i had suspected anything about the role i would be expected to fulfill , not just as a writer , but as a female writer how irrevocably doomed ! i would have flung my leaky blue blobmaking ballpoint pen across the room , or plastered myself over with an impenetrable nom de plume , like b traven , author of the treasure of the sierra madre , whose true identity has never been discovered or , like thomas pynchon , i would never have done any interviews , nor allowed my photo to appear on book jackets but i was too young then to know about such ruses , and by now it is far too late in biographies there is usually some determining moment in early life that predicts the course of the future artist or scientist or politician the child must be father to the man , and if he is n't , the biographer will do some cut and paste and stick on a different head , to make it all come out right we do so wish to believe in a logical universe but when i look back over the life i led until i began writing , i can find nothing in it that would account for the bizarre direction i took or nothing that could n't be found in the lives of many people who did not become writers when i published my first real collection of poetry at the age of 26 real as opposed to the small pamphlet i myself had printed up on a flatbed press in a friend s cellar , as was the fashion among poets in those days my brother wrote to me congratulations on publishing your first book of poetry i used to do that kind of thing myself when i was younger and perhaps that is the clue we shared many of the same childhood pursuits , but he gave them up and turned to other forms of amusement , and i did not there i was , then , in 1956 , still at high school , without a soul in sight who shared my view of what i should , could and ought to be doing i did not know anyone who was a writer , except my aunt , who wrote children s stories for sunday school magazines , which to my snobbish young mind did not count none of the novelists whose books i had read none that wrote for adults , that is , whether trashy books or literary ones were alive and living in canada i had not yet seriously begun to search for others of my kind , to ferret them out of their damp caves and secret groves , so my view at the age of 16 was that of the general citizen i could see only what was made clearly visible to me it was as if the public role of the writer a role taken for granted , it seemed , in other countries and at other times , or so said the potted biographies in the school textbooks this role had either never become established in canada , or had existed once but had become extinct to quote a m klein s portrait of the poet as landscape a poem i had not yet read , but was to stumble upon shortly and to imprint on , much as a newly hatched duck may imprint on a kangaroo it is possible that he is dead , and not discovered it is possible that he can be found some place in a narrow closet , like a corpse in a detective story , standing , his eyes staring , and ready to fall on his face we are sure only that from our real society he has disappeared he simply does not count is , if he is at all , a number , an x , a mr smith in a hotel register , incognito , lost , lacunal writers on writing this article is part of a series in which writers explore literary themes previous contributions can be found at the new york times on the web nytimescom books columns photo margaret atwood says nothing in her early life pointed her to writing \( taras kovaliv for the new york times \) \( pg e2 \)
for the home version of olympic judging , we had no fur coats , no pressure from the french federation , no champagne in the waiting room , no payment for our work and no pretense at objectivity are you going to give michelle a 7 \? my daughter , julieann , asked if i can , i will , my wife , deborah , said the sisters linda harris and debbi saffos completed our sofa panel on tuesday night for the women s short program we handed out marks like parking tickets the chinese food got a 59 for presentation sandra bezic and scott hamilton each got a residual seventenths deduction for their overwrought announcing performances in the pairs competition if you want to play blanche dubois , do it on broadway , not on nbc none of us had judged anything before well , maybe i judged a milking contest in 4h , but holsteins do n't lutz on our panel , linda was most prepared for the big surprise once , a monkey ran out of her neighbor s house and bit her on the leg first up for the television audience was sasha cohen not since oksana baiul has a skater seemed so rapturous on the ice but deborah , hereby known as the michelle judge , could not forget that sasha had buzzed kwan during practice she reminds me of the girl in junior high who was perfect and everyone wanted to be her friend , but secretly you hated her , deborah said we held our marks because sasha skated early , but we all appreciated her speed , flexibility , extension , the complete immersion of herself in the performance one thing , though , drove linda crazy in the kiss and cry lipstick on the teeth , that s a demerit , linda said not a good look , debbi said disqualification it turned out that the lipstick was actually braces no deduction sarah hughes skated next , on tape usually , she appeared graceful and unhurried after sasha , however , sarah seemed slow , cautious and there was the dreaded flutz , which we would have noticed if we were real judges but , hey , do n't blame me i'm from louisiana the only time i ever saw ice , it was at the bottom of a bourbon glass she did n't have any speed , but i like her boot covers , linda said sarah did salvage the youth vote i like slow better , julieann said there was a long break until the next group of contenders i needed a moment to collect myself pressure can leave a judge tense , even one watching on television my hamstring tightened up never before in the history of skating had a person pulled a muscle on the sofa instead of on the ice next was marya butyrskaya of russia , a woman persevering in what has become an event for teenage jumpingjacks we appreciated her sultry maturity , but not her diaphanous , longsleeved , sleeved dress and her hair she appeared to be wearing a barney rubble wig her performance was drowsy , uninspired she did n't have any pizazz , deborah said worst hairdo so far finally , the good stuff irina slutskaya , the applecheeked russian star , had defeated michelle kwan repeatedly this season , but neither skater had performed to her capability perhaps both would in the olympics wait trouble in the warmups for irina her ear had more holes than an enron executive s testimony before congress too many earrings in one ear , linda noticed that s definitely a deduction julieann was not impressed by irina s choice of schubert the music seemed less appropriate for a night of the olympics than for a day of the locusts it s clicking , julieann said sounds like cicadas but even deborah , the michelle judge , awarded high marks for irina s energy and enthusiasm , her technical ambition , her vaulting jumps solid performance , deborah said nice height , good speed too many earrings michelle was next i know what i'm giving her , deborah said if she could have , deborah would have awarded michelle a perfect 60 just for the elegant way she removed her skate guards and the costume everybody loved the royal blue vera wang , the bias cut , the jewelencrusted shoulders well , almost everybody it was a little too much roman tunic for me i could n't tell whether she planned to skate or invade constantinople nobody cared that michelle had performed this same rachmaninoff program at the last olympics she appeared relaxed , not tense as she had four years ago she smiled broadly during her elegant spiral , and seemed to flow like water out of each jump our panel awarded a flurry of 59 s she seemed so confident , debbi said her skill looks more natural than the others not forced what , no 60 s \? her necklace was red and her outfit was blue , julieann said it clashes our panel placed kwan first , cohen second and slutskaya third , followed by hughes and butyrskaya watch out for cohen in the long program , linda said , adding , michelle is still a star , but a somewhat dimmed one julieann had a suggestion could n't they just find one honest judge and let that person judge the competition \? hey , this is figure skating you want an honest judge , try the fifth circuit
memphis james earl ray , a drifter and exconvict , shot and killed the rev dr martin luther king jr with a single bullet here on an april evening in 1968 that is the official story , the reason mr ray spent the last three decades of his life in prison everybody knows it but not everybody accepts it almost as soon as dr king was cut down and even more so after mr ray recanted his guilty plea conspiracy theories abounded some said the assassin was an army sniper mr ray insisted he had been framed by a man named raul , hired by the cia there was even a report that one of dr king s entourage had helped to kill him the authorities have repeatedly dismissed such talk , most recently in 2000 , when the justice department , after an 18month investigation , said there was no evidence that the assassin was anyone but mr ray , and that there should be no more inquiries now , however , the conspiracy theories have stirred to life again at the national civil rights museum , in the former lorraine motel where dr king was shot the museum recently opened an exhibit in a new 11 million wing primarily to document the assassination and the mystery that still surrounds it , at least in some people s minds on display are 200 pieces of evidence , freshly unsealed from police archives the gun the 3006caliber bullet tweezed out of dr king s body a fake passport and guidebook to rhodesia found on mr ray , curious artifacts for an unemployed exconvict supposedly working solo the exhibit , called lingering questions , opened on sept 28 questions are stamped on the wall , in bold letters did ray have help \? did someone else do it \? was the memphis police department part of the conspiracy \? a haunting voice leaks out of a pair of speakers there was this climate of hate it was simply in the air you knew it was going to happen that voice , sad and steady , belongs to coretta scott king the king family believes that mr ray , who died of liver disease in 1998 , was not the killer dexter king , dr king s son , visited mr ray on his deathbed the government killed my father , dexter king told him , not you a spokesman for the king family , which is not officially involved in the museum or this exhibit , said the family appreciated the dialogue mr ray s family said they were finally getting the vindication they deserved visitors are entranced we 're just putting the ideas out there , said the museum director , beverly robertson let s face it a lot of people have doubts about who killed dr king i 've looked at the evidence i 've found it fascinating i still do n't know but peter g beeson , one of the investigators in a 1979 congressional inquiry into the killing , said there was no doubt in his mind , no lingering questions , that mr ray had done it we examined all these theories as carefully as we could , said mr beeson , now a lawyer in manchester , nh the evidence kept coming back to ray i guess you 'll always have those who still want to believe in government conspiracy theories the assassination exhibit will be a permanent addition to the national civil rights museum , which opened in 1991 and traces the story of the movement from 1619 , when the first slaves arrived in jamestown , va , to modern times the museum , which draws about 130 , 000 visitors a year , is financed by donations and grants it includes both the motel where dr king was shot and the rooming house across mulberry street where mr ray stayed federal agents said mr ray , a convicted robber who was on the run after escaping prison , fired the fatal shot from a secondfloor bathroom directly across from the motel but the exhibit hedges on that in the rooming house bathroom , james earl ray is not mentioned however , mr ray s belongings are featured in glass cases one houses a bottle of gillette sunup aftershave , a hairbrush and pair of mr ray s boxer shorts under an agreement drawn up by the tennessee legislature , state police archives gave 200 pieces of evidence to the museum to put on display none had been seen before , because there had never been a trial mr ray s younger brother , jerry , says the fbi knows who killed dr king and it was n't jimmy , jerry ray said i guess this museum thing is good because it shows both sides , the truth and the lies i still want that rifle back , though it s our family s not theirs \( museum officials said the rifle was staying \) several display boards compare leading conspiracy theories with the conclusions of the investigations that have been held over the years these boards really make you wonder , said mary moore , a st louis social worker who recently visited the exhibit and that s ok i think things like this put a stamp of approval on our tradition of questioning the rev fred shuttlesworth , an 80yearold civil rights champion and friend of dr king , agreed it may be upsetting to go through all this again , mr shuttlesworth said but we got to so many things are covered up these days one display board suggests that the memphis police department might have been involved in dr king s murder because police officers cleared away part of the crime scene within hours of the shooting as with the kennedy assassination , the suspicion lives on , no matter what the authorities say there are so many conspiracy theories around dr king s death , you ca n't count them on your hands and feet , said latanya able , a memphis police spokeswoman it s unfortunate we were included photos the rooming house where officials say the shot killing the rev dr martin luther king jr was fired is part of the national civil rights museum beverly robertson , the museum director , where dr king was shot \( photographs by troy glasgow for the new york times \)
prosecutors reconsidering whether harlem teenagers beat and raped a jogger during a central park rampage 13 years ago are also debating whether the teenagers' convictions for other crimes committed that night should be thrown out , according to law enforcement officials the jogger was the most seriously injured of the people assaulted on the night of april 19 , 1989 but eight other people were either accosted or beaten by a pack that roamed the park for an hour , jumping from the shadows to confront runners and bicyclists investigators said it now might be legally unfeasible to let the convictions for the other crimes stand , in light of new evidence that suggests the five teenagers may not have been culpable in the attack on the jogger but though investigators no longer can be sure whether the youths raped the jogger , few of those reviewing the case question whether the teenagers were involved in the other crimes for one thing , many of the police and prosecutors reinvestigating the crimes say , the teenagers were undoubtedly part of the pack of about 35 youths who rampaged through the park that night four of them made videotaped statements in 1989 , some with their parents present , in which they implicated one another in the assaults the teenagers later insisted that those statements were coerced , but each has acknowledged witnessing at least one assault indeed , one teenager , raymond santana , confirmed his role in one of the beatings during his parole hearing in 1994 the videotaped statements were the primary evidence against the teenagers in 1990 , when they were tried in connection with the rape and the other assaults but new evidence , specifically dna specimens and statements from a convicted murderer who says he alone raped the woman , has put the confessions in question if prosecutors decide the confessions were inaccurate about the rape , as some prosecutors now believe , legal experts said the statements would no longer be suitable evidence for the other crimes even if investigators remain convinced that those portions were factual the question is whether , if that new evidence had been known to the jury , would there probably have been a more favorable outcome on the other charges , a law enforcement official said the five convicted , kevin richardson , antron mccray , yusef salaam , raymond santana and kharey wise , have asked in court papers to be exonerated for all the crimes for which they were sent to prison , which ranged in severity from riot to rape all have completed their prison sentences for these offenses the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , is scheduled to respond to the exoneration motion on thursday our clients are innocent , said michael w warren , a lawyer for mr richardson , mr mccray and mr santana there has not been anything demonstrated to the contrary but one of the men who was set upon by teenagers that night says he does not think the slate should simply be wiped clean david good , an engineer who works in midtown , said he was jogging around the north end of the park s reservoir when teenagers throwing sticks and stones chased him you better run faster , he later testified they told him i would n't see why it should be overturned , he said if they did that , and they were clearly in a riotous mood that night , people should have to pay for their mistakes since matias reyes , a convicted murderer , came forward several months ago to state that he alone had raped the jogger , a variety of theories have surfaced about how that crime was actually committed by a lone predator , as mr reyes has said \? by the teenagers first , and then mr reyes in a secondary attack \? by a group that included mr reyes \? little debate has focused on what occurred elsewhere in the park that night between roughly 9 pm and 9 45 , four people were assaulted and four others accosted by a pack of youths in the northeast corner of the park michael vigna testified at trial in 1990 that someone took a swing at him , just missing his head , as he rode his bicycle past a group of teenagers walking south on east drive , near east 105th street a few blocks south , antonio diaz , an unemployed man , was beaten unconscious , according to prosecutors farther south , gerald malone and his fianc e , patricia dean , were riding a tandem bike when they encountered a gantlet of youths who spread across the road and grabbed for ms dean , who was riding on the back seat the couple nearly fell but managed to escape and pedaled away at top speed from several youths who chased after them i was terrified , ms dean testified they were grabbing at my legs and pushing at my shoulder david lewis , a banker , was surprised by teenagers as he ran around the reservoir jogging track , he testified he asked them if they wanted to race 'we 'll race all right , ' came the answer , he said , as several teenagers moved onto the path in front of him he escaped but was hit , hard , on his arm as he ran by , he said
geri barish , like so many other breast cancer survivors on long island , had waited for years for the results of a federal study on what connection , if any , pesticides and air pollution might have on breast cancer on long island so it was no surprise that she was disappointed when the findings of the national cancer institute study were released last week and showed that four chemicals long suspected as potential causes of breast cancer are , in fact , probably not responsible for the island s cancer rate , which is higher than the state and national rates the rate in nassau county is 1156 cases per 100 , 000 women and in suffolk county , the rate is 1182 the state s rate is 1041 cases per 100 , 000 women , and nationally , it is 1095 for new york city , the rate is 972 disappointed but not discouraged , ms barish said we thought this would give us all the answers , but the thing about science is it just raises more questions if anything , she said , she and her fellow advocates for breast cancer research believe now more than ever that more research must be done until the chemicals and pollutants that do cause breast cancer are isolated the study may not have given them the results they had hoped for , but many advocates , politicians and scientists are united in the belief that something in the environment must be to blame for the disease the advocates vowed to continue their fight against the use of pesticides and other environmental pollutants the politicians pledged to seek more federal money for continued research and the scientists who were interviewed promised there would be more studies and reports to come all the parties have also come to the conclusion that while testing suspect chemicals is a useful tool in the search for cancer s cause , developing technology in genetic research also could provide answers they place some hope in techniques that were not available 10 years ago that can now be used to study the damaged cells of women with breast cancer and essentially work backward in an attempt to determine what might have caused the damage the sevenyear , 8 million study released last week was the largest and most comprehensive of its kind and was the cornerstone of the long island breast cancer study project , a 30 million federal effort that includes 12 studies in all results from the study released last week showed that exposure to four chemicals the pesticides ddt , chlordane and dieldrin and polychlorinated biphenyls , better known as pcb s did not result in a higher risk of breast cancer the pesticides were widely used until they were banned in the 1970 s , and pcb s are no longer used , as they once were , in electrical insulation marilie d gammon , an epidemiologist from the university of north carolina at chapel hill and the principal investigator for the study , said she , too , had hoped for different findings when you spend years on research , you always hope that you 're on the right path , she said what we can say now is that we 've eliminated these four compounds , and now we need to systematically look at others ray mcallister , a spokesman for croplife america , a washington group that represents pesticide manufacturers , said , we 're pleased to see this larger , more comprehensive study confirming what other studies have said , and we hope it helps dispel concerns about health risks that might be posed by these compounds he added that while some pesticides have caused cancer in laboratory animals , there has been no research that shows pesticides do cause cancer in humans advocates were quick to point out , however , that dr gammon s findings did not prove to them that all pesticides were safe to me it s still a nobrainer that you should n't use toxic chemicals on your lawn , said karen miller , the president of the huntington breast cancer action coalition they do n't stop at weeds or rodents they enter our bodies she conceded that since other studies have also suggested that the pesticides in question may not be linked to breast cancer , it might be time to look elsewhere all this means is we have to push for more funding to study all the other chemicals that could be causing breast cancer , she said in a separate finding , dr gammon s study showed that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , commonly found in pollutants like car exhaust and cigarette smoke , produced a very modest increased risk for breast cancer we 're not quite sure what to make of that , though , she said it needs to be looked at further and confirmed by other studies she also stressed that these two findings were but the first of many that will come from the study researchers interviewed some 3 , 000 women , about half of them diagnosed with breast cancer they took blood and urine samples from about 2 , 200 of those women in 1996 and 1997 and also took house dust , tap water and soil samples from the homes and yards of about 700 women the results released so far used blood samples from only half of the 2 , 200 women and none of the urine or household samples

following are excerpts from the supreme court decision yesterday that executing mentally retarded inmates is unconstitutionally cruel the vote in atkins v virginia was 6 to 3 justice john paul stevens wrote the opinion chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas dissented the texts of the decision and dissents are online at nytimes com national from the decision by justice stevens those mentally retarded persons who meet the law s requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning , judgment and control of their impulses , however , they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct moreover , their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants presumably for these reasons , in the 13 years since we decided penry v lynaugh \( 1989 \) , the american public , legislators , scholars and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal the consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case whether such executions are cruel and unusual punishments prohibited by the eighth amendment to the federal constitution petitioner , daryl renard atkins , was convicted of abduction , armed robbery and capital murder and sentenced to death at approximately midnight on aug 16 , 1996 , atkins and william jones , armed with a semiautomatic handgun , abducted eric nesbitt , robbed him of the money on his person , drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck , where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash , then took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed in the penalty phase , the defense relied on one witness , dr evan nelson , a forensic psychologist who had evaluated atkins before trial and concluded that he was mildly mentally retarded his conclusion was based on interviews with people who knew atkins , a review of school and court records and the administration of a standard intelligence test which indicated that atkins had a full scale iq of 59 the jury sentenced atkins to death because of the gravity of the concerns expressed by the dissenters and in light of the dramatic shift in the state legislative landscape that has occurred in the past 13 years , we granted certiorari to revisit the issue that we first addressed in the penry case the eighth amendment succinctly prohibits excessive sanctions it provides excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted in weems v united states , we held that a punishment of 12 years jailed in irons at hard and painful labor for the crime of falsifying records was excessive we explained that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense we have repeatedly applied this proportionality precept in later cases interpreting the eighth amendment as chief justice warren explained in his opinion in trop v dulles \( 1958 \) the basic concept underlying the eighth amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man the amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society proportionality review under those evolving standards should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent we have pinpointed that the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country s legislatures relying in part on such legislative evidence , we have held that death is an impermissibly excessive punishment for the rape of an adult woman , coker v georgia \( 1977 \) or for a defendant who neither took life , attempted to take life nor intended to take life , enmund v florida \( 1982 \) guided by our approach in these cases , we shall first review the judgment of legislatures that have addressed the suitability of imposing the death penalty on the mentally retarded and then consider reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with their judgment the parties have not called our attention to any state legislative consideration of the suitability of imposing the death penalty on mentally retarded offenders prior to 1986 in that year , the public reaction to the execution of a mentally retarded murderer in georgia apparently led to the enactment of the first state statute prohibiting such executions in 1988 , when congress enacted legislation reinstating the federal death penalty , it expressly provided that a sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded in 1989 , maryland enacted a similar prohibition it was in that year that we decided penry and concluded that those two state enactments , even when added to the 14 states that have rejected capital punishment completely , do not provide sufficient evidence at present of a national consensus

to mr booker , 32 , and his supporters , the renaissance is mostly a mirage , a revival confined to a few chunks of downtown real estate this race is clearly a referendum on sharpe james , said clifford zukin , a professor of political science at rutgers university at the very least , the race pits two enormously different democrats from different generations but on another level , it is exposing a growing rift between the city s old guard the people who stayed put in the 1960 s , 70 s and 80 s when a quarter of the population fled and those who arrived in recent years , many of them young professionals and academics lured by a resurgent city the newcomers see the promise and the obstacles the veterans see outsiders with no appreciation for hardfought achievements there is an enormous clash of cultures going on , said dennis gale , director of the joseph c cornwall center for metropolitan studies at rutgers university , and a recent arrival as a result , there s a siege mentality , a sort of defensiveness that clash may partly explain why the mayoral race has become increasingly uncivil anonymous literature crudely attacking both men has been distributed through the mail or taped to lampposts last weekend , one or more intruders vandalized a booker campaign office , taking computer discs with voter lists a week earlier , someone threw a hammer through the window of mayor james s bergen street headquarters both campaigns have denied involvement in the incidents it will probably get a lot uglier , said the rev m william howard jr , pastor of bethany baptist church , one of the city s most prominent congregations in a city that is so undercapitalized , where there are so few career opportunities , it s just a sign of how much is at stake surrounded by a fresh crop of town houses , their miniature front lawns newly planted with sod , the mayor reminded a cheering crowd today of what had stood there before rows of red brick housing projects with boardedup windows what a difference we have made , he said , standing beside the governor and a legion of elected officials well look around this neighborhood and see the real progress we have made real progress duplicated in every ward neighborhood in this city newark has undoubtedly made huge strides since 1967 , when riots charred the central ward and pushed the city into a downward spiral of disinvestment , crime and despair in 1986 , when mr james challenged kenneth gibson , among the nation s first bigcity black mayors , he convinced voters that they had been denied measurable progress with a mix of pride and bitterness , mr james still recalls a johnny carson joke that came to symbolize the city s stigma first prize is one week in newark , mr carson had said second prize is two weeks in the last decade , mr james helped build a glimmering performing arts center and a minor league baseball stadium while drumming up the notion , now widely accepted , that newark is a city on the rise empty office towers have been refurbished and acres of empty lots sprout neogeorgian town houses this month s travel leisure magazine mentions newark as a worthy destination , and people here are holding their breath , hoping the governor will deliver a longpromised downtown arena for the new jersey nets and the devils
just below the faint image of a skull and the legend rock hotel presents , an advertisement that has appeared around new york and on the internet lately promises the future of classical music , in your face like never before surrounding the skull , the copy reads new music extraordinary programs and the greatest pianists in the world on their own terms the subject is the rock hotel pianofest , a twomonth series of piano concerts that begins this weekend and runs through dec 14 at a handful of comparatively small halls around new york city all told , it will include about 30 events , from recitals to marathon concerts the man behind the festival , and the advertisement , is chris williamson , who describes himself as a semiretired rock promoter with an abiding interest in classical music mr williamson has lots of ideas about how to reconfigure the classical concert world and is using his festival to test several of them one is to lure new listeners to serious programs of traditional and contemporary music with low ticket prices \( most seats are going for 10 , compared with traditional prices of 50 and up \) he is also promoting fresh talent by presenting young pianists as opening acts for their more famous colleagues the bill mr williamson has assembled would be a draw even if it were presented more conventionally earl wild at 86 , one of the last great pianists of the romantic virtuoso school opens the series tomorrow evening at the ethical culture society also prominent on the schedule is the young french pianist jeanyves thibaudet , who is offering an allsatie concert at the angel orensantz foundation on nov 7 others include poetic individualists like russell sherman and andrew rangell , the contemporary music specialists ursula oppens and roger woodward , and even a couple of composerpianists , philip glass and frederic rzewski the marathon concerts include an allscriabin halloween program by the toradze studio , and the finale , in which 25 young pianists will each play a short work commissioned for the occasion mr williamson said that 65 percent of the tickets for each concert would sell for 10 the rest are priced up to 40 , except mr wild s opening concert , whose top price is 60 mr williamson , who is 50 and lives on a houseboat moored at the 79th street boat basin , concedes that classical music presentation tends to be more reserved but he was intent on catching the attention of potential ticket buyers who are not normally drawn to piano recitals specifically , he wants to reach the listeners who went to the rock , punk , hardcore , alternative and rap shows he used to present at irving plaza and the ritz , and before that at chase park and the jane west hotel you see that skull in the ad \? mr williamson asked i 'd put that in the paper with a date and not even list a band , and we 'd sell out more unusual than mr williamson s advertising style , though , is his business model he is opposed to underwriting concerts with grant money , a standard approach in the classical music world instead he is covering the costs everything from hall rentals to flying the pianists to new york and putting them up himself jon aaron , an artists' manager who is the business manager for pianofest , estimated that the series would cost about 100 , 000 not a lot for the number of performances offered the quirkiness of mr williamson s approach seems not to bother the pianists i saw the ad in the paper , said mr wild , who usually performs at carnegie hall you have to give him credit , because what he s doing takes a lot of guts there has to be a revitalization of the piano series the way it is now , you see the same people playing over and over , and it s lost its imagination so maybe this will give it a bit of a jolt mr williamson is no newcomer to classical music in the early 1970 s , he was a student of the pianist beveridge webster at the juilliard school but his interests at the time were veering in other directions he began spending his time at max s kansas city , the seminal new york rock club of the era , rather than in the practice room , and eventually dropped out of juilliard after managing studio 54 from 1977 to 1980 , he began presenting shows at chase park , a club in soho his principal interest then was english punk bands , but he also presented an early show by madonna from there he moved to the ballroom of the jane west hotel , where he presented bands like bad brains , black flag and social distortion , and to the ritz , where he offered shows by alternative groups like sonic youth , pearl jam and soundgarden he also promoted shows at irving plaza , and he started a record company , rock hotel records , which was associated with profile , a rap label that put him in touch with the managers for several rap performers , whom mr williamson presented downtown at the world , and at madison square garden then things started drying up , he said companies like clear channel began buying up promoters , but i always wanted to be on my own i could n't see myself in a corporate situation and all the stuff coming up the boy bands , for example made me nauseous so i decided to stop and i started playing the piano again

paris , oct 1 as director of hematology at the h tel dieu hospital here , nicole casadevall had seen such cases before a patient in her 60 s had developed pure red cell aplasia , in which the body s germfighting defenses go haywire and attack its own bone marrow , leaving her severely anemic and facing a lifetime of transfusions to survive dr casadevall knew of several diseases lymphoid cancer , rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus that could cause red cell aplasia but this patient had none of them indeed , the woman had regularly been injected with a drug to stimulate the production of red blood cells while she received dialysis twice a week why , then , was she now unable to make any red blood cells at all \? four years after dr casadevall began to investigate this mystery , answers remain elusive but the pattern that she uncovered that her patient was just one of scores in the same condition , nearly all of whom had taken a drug made by johnson johnson has raised doubts about not just the company but about a whole class of drugs that are a cornerstone of biotechnology the johnson johnson drug , eprex , is the marketleading version of a protein known generically as erythropoietin , or epo , that is the bestselling genetically engineered drug ever , and one of the largestselling drugs of any kind in the world epo is given to patients with conditions that hamper red blood cell production usually people being treated for kidney problems , like dialysis patients , or for cancer global sales of epo products exceeded 13 billion last year , with johnson johnson alone accounting for 34 billion of that epo drugs were the company s bestselling pharmaceutical group , providing more than 10 percent of its revenue it was dr casadevall s work in the cloisterlike confines of the h tel dieu , and her publication of the results earlier this year , that alerted doctors and nurses to the problem that alert contributed in part to increased reporting of red cell aplasia , intensifying the questions about johnson johnson s drug of the 141 cases of red cell aplasia reported in epo users , most have involved people taking eprex in europe , canada and australia only a handful of cases have appeared in patients using other brands of the drug , including procrit , johnson johnson s name for the epo drug it sells in the united states johnson johnson makes eprex at a factory in puerto rico but procrit is produced for johnson johnson at a factory in colorado run by a competitor , amgen , which developed the drug regulators and scientists seeking to explain the cases of red cell aplasia have focused on the puerto rico plant , and johnson johnson s competitors mainly amgen of thousand oaks , calif , and roche of switzerland say the problem is specific to eprex , not to their epo drugs those companies cannot help but see opportunity in the tarnishing of eprex s reputation indeed , the problems with eprex could help amgen , which now sells a new version of epo called aranesp in competition with johnson johnson johnson johnson , though , contends that the handful of cases of red cell aplasia in users of its competitors' drugs are evidence that the problem , whatever it is , goes beyond eprex yet j j , the thirdlargest american drug maker , is racing desperately on two fronts to solve the mystery and to salvage its leading pharmaceutical product frankly , i'm not sure we realized when we began just how difficult and complex this would become , said per peterson , the chairman of pharmaceuticals research at johnson johnson but our knowledge is evolving , and we know much more today than we did a year ago dr peterson said the company debated whether to take eprex off the market several times as reports of red cell aplasia multiplied , but decided not to do so , concluding that the drug s benefits far outweighed the risks economics , he insisted , were not a deciding factor , noting that johnson johnson did not hesitate to withdraw a popular heartburn drug , propulsid , when it was linked to dozens of deaths two years ago european regulators , loath to withdraw a drug that has proved valuable for hundreds of thousands of patients , have limited their response so far to recommending changes in how eprex is administered they have advised doctors to give it intravenously rather than through injections under the skin , noting that most cases of aplasia have been associated with injections at the same time , they are appealing to doctors to report any new cases dr casadevall said she agreed that eprex should not be taken off the market when bioengineered epo reached the market a dozen years ago , she said , it changed the lives of patients with kidney disease because epo is naturally produced in the kidneys , when those organs fail people often need to deal with anemia as well as receive dialysis to clean their blood at long last , such patients could live without the risk of anemia , she said it was a revolution

call her the bride who would not budge not for presidents , prime ministers , mayors or celebrities nope , said elizabeth friedland , a lawyer early in september , she scheduled the celebration of her wedding to dr mark meyer , a cardiologist , for last night at the waldorfastoria despite the fact that the hotel would turn into the barricaded , highsecurity site of the world economic forum , ms friedland and dr meyer persisted in their original plans they held fast to their plans partly because they invited almost as many people as did klaus schwab , founder of the gathering at the waldorf well , not quite , dr meyer said on friday our party is about 550 people and there really are n't that many places in new york where you can have that many people but the world economic forum attendees and ms friedland managed to reach a d tente that would make any united nations security adviser proud to accommodate the wedding , after the global health seminar scheduled for last night in the jade room and the middleeast outlook conversation in the astor salon , conference guests went down to the new york stock exchange for a multicultural dining and dancing extravaganza , leaving the waldorf empty for the wedding party , which arrived from temple emanuel at fifth avenue and east 65th street the bride and groom did not have to worry that curious conference attendees say , the boisterous delegation from bulgaria would accidentally stumble in on them the conference visitors at the stock exchange dined at buffet tables featuring food from around the world , from ceviche to spaghetti , and danced to mariachi musicians \( or enjoyed classical violin quartets \) , in an evening intended to symbolize global unity the wedding guests planned to feast on a sylvia weinstock wedding cake large enough to accommodate 500 , decorated with edible white flowers that matched those in the bride s hair ms friedland , who has spent much of the last four years living in europe , had been through a string of unsuccessful relationships dr meyer had been through a string of graduate schools yale law school and yale medical school as well as , he said , my 9 millionth blind date their first date was electric , ms friedland said it lasted until 4 in the morning , dr meyer said courtship was swift two weeks later , dr meyer surprised ms friedland by flying to london , where she lived , for the weekend the next six months , he said , were a blur of blossoming love , transatlantic plane trips and stolen weekends when dr meyer started interviewing for positions in cardiology , he investigated jobs in new york he found none but he moved here anyway it was so against my grain , he said i have always done everything by the book suddenly i looked at myself and thought , 'who is this person who is going to europe for the weekend \? who is this man who is going to live in new york without a position \? ' it was surreal they chose february for their wedding because , the bride said , it was pretty much the only saturday that was available that was not the middle of summer or conflicting with another person s wedding the doctor , confessing to some surprise , said he had never thought he would get married after an engagement of only five months , and then at some point we found out that there would be this other major commotion going on in the city because most of the wedding s invited guests were from out of town and were unfamiliar with new york , ms friedland said she was happy to show them the city at its most vibrant they 're going to look at this city and think , 'wow , exciting' ms friedland , who was speaking on a mobile phone from a car , could be heard speaking to a security guard hi , i'm the bride for the wedding , she said right , you remember me \? i'm getting married here i do n't have to show id again , do i \? i do \? ok , hold on dr meyer added that the enormous guest list also kept them from moving the celebration the other options for that many people were n't available until 2003 , dr meyer said judging from the tone of his voice , there could have been a convention of cannibals at the waldorf , for all he cared elizabeth did n't want to live together before we got married , and i thought , 'i'm 32 and i ca n't wait any longer ! we 're doing it at the waldorf' photo with a wedding at the waldorf , conference attendees were to attend a gala at the new york stock exchange \( michelle v agins the new york times \)

islanders general manager mike milbury , probably the person in the longbedraggled organization with the most to celebrate saturday night , did not even feel the urge to let out a tiny whoop when the team clinched its first playoff berth in eight seasons he had been on the move all night , and as it turned out , he had done most of his whooping two weeks ago he watched half of the first period of the islanders' 54 victory over washington on saturday from his pressboxlevel perch at nassau coliseum he moved to a luxury box for the second period he went to his office for the third period and turned on his television then , well before the end of the game , he drove to his home two miles from the arena , and stayed put i wanted to hang out with my wife and watch it , he said yesterday the islanders' fourgoal lead started to melt and milbury became nervous , so his wife , ginger , suggested that they turn off the tv until 10 pm they turned it back on to see claude lapointe win a faceoff at center ice , then fall on the puck to seal the victory milbury resisted the urge to drive back to the arena to congratulate the team that he had assembled with the help of charles wang and sanjay kumar , the team s owners the moment belongs to the players , milbury said he said that he would also resist the urge to crow to the islanders' fans who chanted mike must go ! at a desolate coliseum last season as the islanders posted the worst record in the nhl i say to them , 'thanks for being interested , ' he said milbury said of the temptation to proclaim vindication there s not a part of me that wants to have anything to do with that why \? because i was just as frustrated as they were milbury , who joined the islanders on july 5 , 1995 , initially as a head coach , was not around for every minute of the drought , but six losing seasons is long enough wang and kumar bought the team on april 26 , 2000 , and pledged to spend money to build a competitive team i could n't be any more grateful , he said milbury hammered out deals before this season to acquire centers aleksei yashin and michael peca , then picked up goaltender chris osgood in the waiver draft milbury said that the threesome s best asset , besides talent , was that none of them had been around for the bad days they were n't carrying any of the baggage , he said it did n't make any difference to them that we had n't won in a hockey millennium the reconfigured islanders were 11111 in their first 14 games and although the season has included some dips , coach peter laviolette s team never lost its way when the islanders whipped the rangers at home march 25 , milbury said he let out a big yell i felt at that time it would have taken an incredible reversal of fortune to keep us out of the playoffs , he said the islanders \( 392784 \) are in sixth place in the eastern conference , but there is not a potential playoff opponent that milbury thinks is too tough the islanders played a disciplined game last thursday to beat boston , the firstplace team in the conference , and are within 4 points of philadelphia , the atlantic division leader as milbury prepared to drive to bridgeport , conn , yesterday to watch the islanders' american hockey league affiliate , he said he felt partly relieved and partly elated then he laughed and added , now i'm hoping that any kind of stretch that people are concentrating on now is on the consecutive years the islanders are in the playoffs not the consecutive years the islanders have not been in the playoffs the islanders are working on a oneyear streak , and their first home playoff game will be the next moment to savor milbury may even stick around the whole game the fans are basically starved for this , he said it s going to be so significant they 've waited so long for it photo by the time the islanders clinched a playoff berth saturday night , mike milbury had left the building \( associated press \)

' i did n't really mean it and he knew it he said , 'you singled me out' i said 'you 're darn right you 're our best player' butler said he needed that talk from his coach he just told me i was playing ordinary , butler said he put a bug in my ear was butler playing ordinary \? most definitely , he said in the first couple of minutes , i had the ball in my hands and they took it i was n't attacking after that , butler rated his performance this way i played a good game he played better than that , said matt doherty , the north carolina coach he s a great player , doherty said he got 19 points in the first half without really forcing anything he is a bigtime , bigtime player i think he also seems like a good kid doherty said the tar heels' effort was good they are quicker and stronger , he said , and sometimes that can be misconstrued as lack of effort on our part but i think our guys were really trying when they really got it going in the second half , that s when i saw some long faces and body language i did n't like but when you are talking about young kids in a setting like this , it s just human nature , and we 've got to battle human nature tony robertson , uconn s shooting guard , saw what doherty saw in the second half , robertson said , the look on their faces seemed to say , 'when is this going to be over \?

the first american recession in a decade has been deemed history almost before it began none other than alan greenspan , in testimony before congress last week , opined that the recent data indicate that the economic recovery is now well under way stock investors embraced this pronouncement as evidence that corporate earnings would soon rebound the dow jones industrial average rose 2 percent last week , to 10 , 57249 , a level not seen since july 2001 but even as investors prepare to bank the share gains that are supposed to result from rising corporate earnings , there is one notsosmall hitch because the average number of shares outstanding at many companies rocketed during the bubble , pershare earnings growth could still disappoint and that could be the case even if the economic recovery is spectacular steve galbraith , chief investment strategist at morgan stanley , has done the math to make this argument to quantify how significant and deleterious share inflation has become at the largest corporations , mr galbraith took into account recent stock splits , option grants and shares issued in payment for acquisitions at companies in the standard poor s 500 in mr galbraith s view , many companies diluted their shareholders' earnings to a faretheewell during the stock market mania because they did not believe that printing shares was the equivalent of printing iou s and when stock prices were flying , shareholders paid no attention to the inflation that was occurring right under their noses that is not surprising it is only during bear markets that the bills for free lunches enjoyed during bull markets come due from 1998 to 2001 , mr galbraith found that share growth owing to options and acquisitions averaged 165 percent annually at telecommunications concerns and almost 8 percent at utility companies information technology companies expanded share base through options and acquisitions by 57 percent in that period although stock issuance has started to slow , many technology companies remain swollen with shares among which company earnings must be divvied from 1997 to 2001 , for example , cisco systems' shares more than doubled , to 73 billion from 31 billion a similar trend occurred at qwest communications , where shares rose to 166 billion last year from 862 million in 1998 stock splits were a major force behind the big increase in share counts at major companies according to mr galbraith , there were almost 400 stock splits at s p 500 companies from 1997 to 1999 for years , splits had been a powerful signal of future gains in a stock from 1995 to 1999 , shares that had split gained more than 40 percent in the subsequent 12 months but in 2000 , that trend was reversed , and companies averaged a decline of 26 percent the year after their split option grants are another culprit in share inflation while many companies brag that their option programs reward rankandfile workers , top executives are the major beneficiaries in 2000 , according to pearl meyer partners , a compensation consulting firm in new york , more than half the nation s 200 biggest companies granted their chief executives what can only be called obscene option packages , those worth 10 million or more nearly 60 percent of chief executive pay that year was delivered through option grants , pearl meyer said mr galbraith considers the outsized share issuance of recent years an ill effect of the stock market mania and says it will take time to reverse the trend the road back to prior peak earnings per share may be significantly steeper than the road back to prior peak earnings , he said put another way , it was a marvelous party welcome to the hangover chart printing more paper average annual growth in shares outstanding , 1998 2001 , because of options granted and acquisitions technology 165 utilities 79 information tech 57 health care 46 financials 32
and then there were none no managerial vacancies , that is after four days of negotiations , the chicago cubs announced last night that dusty baker was their new manager baker landed the job nine days after he and the san francisco giants divorced after a 10year managerial marriage that included the 2002 national league pennant , the giants' first in 13 years earlier , the seattle mariners hired bob melvin to replace lou piniella , who also walked away after 10 years , giving up the last year of his contract to become manager of his hometown tampa bay devil rays baker , whose hiring filled the last of 10 postseason managerial vacancies , split with the giants because of his deteriorated relationship with the team s managing partner , peter magowan when it became a strong possibility that baker would leave the giants , the cubs waited until the world series ended and his contract expired to pursue him neither andy macphail , the cubs' president , nor jeff moorad , baker s agent , would provide details of baker s fouryear contract but a person familiar with the negotiations said baker would make 35 to 4 million a year for a total of 14 million to 16 million with his twoyear , 525 million contract with the giants , baker had been baseball s secondhighestpaid manager his new contract keeps him second , behind joe torre s threeyear , 16 million contract with the yankees baker s contract , said the person with knowledge of it , also includes what he called significant incentives , bonuses based on the team s success he did not provide any details , but even without those bonuses , if baker were to lead the cubs to their first world series since 1945 , the city of chicago would probably give him anything he wanted and if the cubs were to win the world series for the first time since 1908 , the city would give him even more the cubs and moorad agreed to the bonuses , the person said , as a way of bridging the gap between what baker wanted and what the cubs offered asked in a conference call why he wanted to manage a team for which a world series championship is an ancient memory , baker said i love baseball , no 1 , i love challenges , no 2 , and chicago is a very , very good sports town it s exciting san francisco had n't been to the world series in a long time and that was a challenge i like challenges baker , who will manage sammy sosa instead of barry bonds , replaces bruce kimm , who became the interim manager when don baylor was fired july 6 , with the cubs on their way to their third 90loss season in four years baker and baylor are close friends , and they spoke at length in the past week , baker said asked if baylor had told him anything that might have discouraged him from taking the job , baker said , there s always pluses and negatives , but right now i'm trying to dwell on anything that don said that was positive melvin , 41 , received a twoyear contract from the mariners a former catcher , melvin was the arizona diamondbacks' bench coach the last two seasons

ramallah gaza jerusalem hebron these are the familiar battlegrounds of the israelipalestinian conflict now another location has come under siege on the map of desperate contention , a place where the sky is always supposed to be sunny , the air meant to be sweet , and everything is supposed to be aok sesame street four years ago that children s television show began broadcasting an israelipalestinian coproduction , conceived in the afterglow of the 1993 oslo accords the collaboration produced 70 halfhour shows , each one containing hebrew and arabic segments that were broadcast to receptive audiences but under a new coproduction agreement , which now includes jordanians , the project has run into difficulty the name sesame street has been changed to sesame stories because the concept of a place where people and puppets from those three groups can mingle freely has become untenable the original shows were built around the notion that israeli and palestinian children \( as well as puppets \) might become friends now , reflecting the somber mood in the middle east , producers see their best hope as helping children to humanize their historic enemies through separate but parallel stories we 've realized that a goal of friendship was beyond realism , given where things are now , said charlotte cole , vice president of international research for the sesame workshop \( formerly the children s television workshop \) in new york other problems involve practicalities palestinians no longer go to tel aviv to work on the shows as before the creative back and forth taking place in meetings near london and in new york and by telephone and email messages has an eggshell fragility the utterance of every muppet is potentially inflammatory the participants cannot agree on when or even if the completed episodes should be broadcast the israelis want to show them as soon as they are finished , probably early next year we have to find a way to tackle the harsh reality with children , because the grownups are n't managing very well to resolve it , said alona abt , the israeli executive producer but her palestinian counterparts say it would be pointless to broadcast a series promoting tolerance until a peace agreement is signed children in palestine today will not appreciate , understand , absorb and react in a positive way to the goals we want to accomplish , said daoud kuttab , the palestinian executive producer , whose studio at the public television station in ramallah , the west bank town , was damaged by israeli soldiers you 're telling them to be tolerant to israelis when israeli tanks are outside their homes yet the production process has kept going , with a sometimes surreal mixture of good will and apprehension in the current climate we can only try to humanize and demystify , dr cole said , to see that other people play in a playground or that they enjoy being with their grandparents once you have that level of humanity it s so much harder to hate the project has eight underwriters , all american except for the european union and the canadian kahanoff foundation , and they have raised 6 million of the 7 million needed to complete 26 shows from each of the three partners the lead donor is the charles h revson foundation travel logistics have become harrowing since sept 11 for many of the participants , making them anxious about flying or leaving home they are constantly on the telephone and sending email messages to discuss plot lines and characters recently writers and producers from israel , jordan and palestine gathered at the sesame workshop offices in manhattan to brainstorm at one facetoface meeting there , people from the different teams were laughing at one another s jokes during a conference during a lunch break , jill gluckson , the supervising producer from sesame workshop , nodded toward two israelis chatting amiably with a jordanian writer this is a roomful of people who desperately want their children to have a different experience , she said we could all walk away from this , but then what hope is there \? quixotic \? undeniably , especially in a part of the world where many people consider finding humanity in one s enemies a traitorous idea but , dr cole asked what s the alternative \? to risk nothing \? even the first israelipalestinian venture , begun in more hopeful times , required much negotiating , most significantly about the circumstances under which kipi and dafi , an israeli porcupine and monster respectively , would meet karim and haneen , a palestinian rooster and monster the israeli puppets could not simply appear in palestinian territory too reminiscent of israeli settlers they had to be invited then as now , the participants had practical as well as idealistic motives for the palestinians , whose television industry is quite new , the sesame shows have offered an unusual opportunity to learn animation , puppetry and other production skills from the experts at sesame workshop \( the israelis have had their own hebrewlanguage version of sesame street , rechov sumsum , since 1982 \)
faced with an organization unlikely to embarrass itself with a reversal , and with the potential for financial hardship looming , the french skating judge marie reine le gougne has decided to drop an appeal of her threeyear suspension resulting from the pairs controversy at the salt lake winter games if le gougne lost her appeal to the international skating union , her lawyer , erik christiansen , said , she may have had to pay the legal fees and expenses of the isu , the sport s governing body christiansen waived his fees for the appeal , but one estimate put le gougne s potential cost at close to 40 , 000 she could n't risk financial ruin , christiansen said from his salt lake city office yesterday given the bias of the appeals committee , they were only going to rubberstamp their decision in april , the skating union punished le gougne after officials said an internal investigation found evidence that the french skating federation president , didier gailhaguet , pressured her into voting for the russian pair to win instead of the canadians at the olympics that led to the decision to award a second set of gold medals in salt lake city le gougne filed an appeal , contending her fate was determined without evidence or due process at the hearing , the skating union did not call any of the other four judges also selected russia s yelena berezhnaya and anton sikharulidze over canada s jamie sal and david pelletier instead , the council heard from two judges who scored the canadians as the winners the skating union leaders also did not reveal their evidence or explain the method they used to reach their conclusion time and again , the skating union pointed to the one moment le gougne has said she regrets but cannot erase at the review meeting the day after the pairs competition , le gougne sobbed and admitted to being pressured by gailhaguet to favor the russians she later retracted that statement and said those representing the canadian interests had pressured her to side with sal and pelletier i judged with my heart , le gougne said several top officials inside the skating union believed le gougne , but because of public pressure and scrutiny from the international olympic committee , there was no time for a thorough investigation in salt lake city once ottavio cinquanta , the isu president , announced le gougne s improprieties and the gold was draped around the canadians , there was no turning back in her waffling and retracting , it brought to the attention of thinking people that maybe there was more to her emotional outburst than what was on the surface , said claire ferguson , who recently relinquished her seat on the isu council there was pressure on her from other areas that caused everything to get very complicated it would be easier for the skating union if le gougne exited the skating scene quietly , but she promises just the opposite le gougne is writing a tellall book about the machinations of the skating union , though she does not have a publisher yet le gougne was not available for comment yesterday , but in a statement , she said , it is time for the dirty little secrets of the figure skating world to come to light le gougne may attempt a direct appeal to the court of arbitration for sport , but christiansen said it could prove futile because appeals must be exhausted at the internal level first it may sound ironic , but she knows that without her , none of the reforms in skating would have taken place , christiansen said in may , the isu approved a judging system that might limit the potential for collusion and reduce pressure on judges nine scores will be drawn randomly from a panel of 14 judges , without anyone knowing who scored higher for whom
in the debate over edison schools , the educational management company that is about to take over 20 failing schools in philadelphia , edison s supporters and its opponents cite test scores and academic studies to bolster their arguments unfortunately , little of that evidence is as conclusive as it has been portrayed , making an evaluation of edison s sevenyear academic record far more difficult than tracking its plummeting stock price for its part , edison has long used opinion surveys and test scores to make its case nearly 90 percent of parents with children in edisonrun schools , for example , gave their schools an a or b on a survey conducted for the company last year by harris interactive by comparison , 68 percent of public school parents gave their schools the same high marks , according to a 2001 survey conducted by the gallup organization for phi delta kappa international , a research group edison has also calculated that more than 80 percent of its schools have improved on standardized tests by edison s reckoning , the average gains at those schools are larger than those in schools in dozens of the nation s largest school districts any fairminded person sitting down with our test scores and any other large district s test scores would rather have ours , said john e chubb , edison s chief education officer but while edison s simplified academic results have long reassured many investors and politicians , they have not satisfied some testing experts , who caution against making generalizations about the test scores of edison s 75 , 000 students in 22 states it is hard enough , they say , to evaluate students in one district using one standardized test is edison any good \? asked karen bachofer , the assessment director for the san diego public schools , which do not employ edison that question , dr bachofer said , seems very straightforward , but those of us who do it for a living know how tricky it is perhaps edison s most widely cited contention is that test scores at 84 percent of the schools that it began managing before 2001 are improving to calculate that figure , edison took the average annual change in test scores for each grade on each subject tested and arrived at a single schoolwide average if the number was greater than zero , the company rated the school as improving , or positive dr bachofer is among those experts who called that approach generous , because large gains in one subject or grade might mask declines in several others any time you aggregate something down to a single number , she said , the number loses its utility at the schomburg charter school in jersey city , which edison has managed since 2000 , reading scores declined in the second , third and fourth grades when those students were compared with others nationally the losses , were outweighed , however , by the fifth grade s 17percentage point increase edison rated the school s performance as positive the same formula produced similarly glowing results when applied , for example , to schools in the cleveland school district , which has struggled academically in recent years when asked by the new york times to subject its test results over the last five years to edison s method , cleveland achieved comparable results 874 percent of its elementary and middle schools rated positive \( high schools were excluded because edison mostly manages elementary and middle schools \) i have schools that look good by this metric that we 're very worried about , said peter robertson , the cleveland district s chief assessment officer elementary and middle schools in the el paso independent school district in texas , a similar district with no ties to edison , also had similar results when the same standard was applied 81 percent rated as improving dr chubb of edison acknowledged that reducing a school s performance to a single adjective was perhaps an oversimplification , but noted that many states , including california and texas , had similar formulas for grading schools there s no one way to do it , he said h christopher whittle , the company s chief executive , said the great majority of our schools are up in terms of their results the question becomes , 'how much are they up in terms of other systems \? ' that is a complex issue one of the complexities of comparison is that edison manages mostly lowperforming schools , while other districts and states have a range of performances in their schools moreover , students in edison schools start at such low levels that they are more likely to make larger gains than students at better schools edison does indeed assert that its test scores are improving more quickly than those in dozens of large urban districts , including cleveland and el paso this , too , involves a formula that is disputed by some experts to reach its conclusion , edison first separated its own schools' test scores and those of the other districts into two main categories the first were scores on socalled criterionreferenced tests , which establish a passing grade based on the number of questions answered correctly the second were scores on normreferenced tests , which rank students based on how they compare to others who took the test across the nation
nearly everyone who worked the commencement speech circuit this spring talked about sept 11 , whether it was the horror of that morning and its aftermath , or the lessons learned by both the nation s government and its citizens tom ridge , whose cabinetlevel position as director of homeland security did not exist at this time last year , was in hot demand , as were writers like anna quindlen and tom wolfe , who were expected to put the fall s extraordinary events into perspective but like purveyors of comfort food at a roadside diner , the authors , politicians , entertainers , historians and business leaders also served up heapings of timeless advice and anecdotes , recounting their own experiences as young people entering the adult world the rationale behind the selection of some speakers was not immediately obvious , at least to some students the actor alec baldwin was tapped to speak at the fashion institute of technology in new york city , partly because he and the institute s president , joyce f brown , knew each other as alumni of new york university , according to a school spokesman moreover , when dr brown s husband , h carl mccall , who is now seeking the democratic nomination for governor of new york , was running for reelection as state comptroller in 1998 , mr baldwin gave at least one speech on his behalf that was harshly critical of gov george e pataki growing up in new york , mr baldwin told the institute s graduates on may 24 , i remember fit as that place that prevented me from driving crosstown when i headed west on 27th street terrifying times often call for soothing voices , and there was probably none more reassuring than that of fred rogers , who stopped taping mister rogers' neighborhood last year after 33 years , but who still lives on in reruns , as well as in the memories of many of this year s graduates i 'd like to give you the words of one of our 'neighborhood' songs , he told the seniors at chatham college in pittsburgh on may 19 , as if they were suddenly 4 years old again and sitting in front of their television sets hopefully it says what those who really love you are feeling about you today it s you i like it s not the things you wear it s not the way you do your hair but it s you i like the way you are right now the way down deep inside you not the things that hide you not your caps and gowns they 're just beside you but it s you i like following are other excerpts alice hoffman author adelphi university , garden city , ny i'm a local girl i grew up down the street and around a few corners when i was growing up on long island , i never expected to go to college the real world for me was a job at the doubleday factory here in garden city i was hired to file , and i was advised i had better be fast out in the real world the year was 1969 , and at that time employees in my office could not go to the rest room without permission our coffee break was announced by the ringing of a bell women were expected to wear skirts , hosiery , sensible shoes there was to be no talking there was to be serious filing i lasted until lunch at noon , i walked away from my job at the factory and drove directly to adelphi s admission office i began as a nonmatriculated student , but i finished my course work in three years and went to the writing program at stanford university it was a thrill when i sold my first novel , but it was n't the defining moment of my life coming to adelphi was the most important day in my life it is particularly satisfying that my next novel will be published in the summer of 2003 by doubleday james o freedman president emeritus , dartmouth college university of rochester someone once asked woodrow wilson when he was president of princeton university what the function of a liberal education ought to be and wilson replied , to make a person as unlike his father as possible what he meant , i think , is that a liberal education ought to make a person independent of mind , skeptical of authority and received views , prepared to forge an identity for himself or herself , and capable of becoming an individual not bent upon copying other persons even persons as persuasive and influential as one s father the kind of liberal education to which wilson referred is more necessary today than ever because the qualities it nurtures are more imperiled than ever we are immersed in a dotcom digital culture , a social environment of constant stimulation significantly influenced by the mass media and other unrelenting prescribers of opinion and feelings but it is not the media alone who are to blame for the accelerated tenor of our lives telephones , television , vcr s , fax machines , computers , the internet , email , cellphones , beepers and all these forms of instant communication too often create a bewildering barrage of noise and frenetic movement it is almost as if we have surrounded ourselves with such technology in order to avoid suspended moments of silence and contemplation

of preinca vessels , took them safely from peru to raroia , a coral island near tahiti this demonstrated to mr heyerdahl s satisfaction that his theory could be fact he was convinced that polynesia s first settlers had come from south america , and not from asia by way of the western pacific islands , as nearly all scholars thought mr heyerdahl was an ardent exponent of the diffusionist school of cultural anthropology , which holds that cultural similarities between geographically separated societies are not necessarily spontaneous coincidence but sometimes are the result of contacts in antiquity diffusionism has largely fallen out of favor among most anthropologists and historians few scholars at the time and almost none today endorsed the idea that american indians peopled polynesia they discount the heyerdahl hypothesis largely on linguistic , genetic and cultural grounds , all of which point to the settlers having come from the west , not the east the epic voyage , nonetheless , caught the imagination of the world mr heyerdahl was an instant popular hero and his storytelling skill turned the book kontiki into an international best seller that was translated into 65 languages a documentary movie of the exploits won an oscar that was only a beginning mr heyerdahl invested much of his book royalties in further expeditions the most important was a 1970 voyage across the atlantic in a papyrus boat to show that ancient egyptians could have introduced pyramidbuilding technologies to precolumbian americans in 1977 he set out in a reed boat of ancient design to discover how mesopotamian mariners of 5 , 000 years ago might have navigated the indian ocean two years later , mr heyerdahl , well into his 60 s , said in an interview that he was retiring from such seagoing adventures there are no other oceans to cope with , and also i know of no other kind of early boat that has n't been tried by others , he said i have challenged a lot of old dogma , and this has stimulated a lot of discussion and in science you need discussion but he continued writing books , traveling far and wide and defending his theories earlier this year he went to samoa , in the pacific , to inspect archaeological excavations of what could be an ancient pyramid his son thor heyerdahl jr told reuters that his father , until his death , held firm to his belief that intercontinental sea migrations helped spread human culture nor did he let age discourage him from new quests in recent months , he was writing a new book contending that odin , the god of norse mythology , might have been a real king thor heyerdahl was born oct 6 , 1914 , in larvik , in southern norway he once noted that he did not share from birth the affinity for the sea that his norwegian heritage and lifelong work might have suggested all my ancestors came from inland , he said in 1979 i was dead scared of the water as a young man if i had been a sailor , i would have believed that you could n't cross the ocean in the kontiki my ignorance was very lucky young thor s father owned a brewery and his mother was head of the local museum it was her influence that led him to the study of nature and zoology at the university of oslo , he specialized in zoology , as well as geography , but before graduating left on his first expedition to polynesia , in 193738 he went with his bride , liv coucheron torp heyerdahl , to spend a year living as adam and eve , as he wrote , on fatu hiva in the marquesas islands they lived there under primitive conditions , conducting research on the flora and fauna \( they were later divorced \) there he also began to contemplate the question of how the pacific inhabitants reached these widely scattered islands he came to believe that human settlers had arrived with the ocean currents from the east , just as much of the vegetation and animal life had done the time on fatu hiva described in his 1974 book , fatu hiva back to nature , and recalled again in a 1996 book , green was the earth on the seventh day turned him to the study of anthropology he pursued his research in peru , which made firmer his conviction that a group of tall , fair preinca people , under the leadership of the legendary kontiki , sailed westward across the ocean to polynesia
racing against a securities and exchange commission deadline , richard d parsons , the chief executive of aol time warner , certified the company s financial results late yesterday afternoon with the disclosure that its aol division might have inflated revenue by 49 million in a period from the fall of 2000 through the summer of 2002 aol time warner executives said that in the last 10 days the company had learned of three transactions that might have resulted in overstatements of revenue at its aol division the company said the revenue involved was less than onehalf of 1 percent of overall revenue at the aol division over the six quarters in question , but aol time warner executives said an internal inquiry into its accounting continues and could uncover other problems the disclosure is an unexpected setback for the company both the sec and the justice department are already investigating aol s accounting , including the possibility that some of its deals bartering advertising for goods , services or equity might have inappropriately increased its revenue the company said yesterday that the three transactions it discovered involved potentially improper payments from third parties , presumably involving its complicated barter arrangements until yesterday , aol time warner stood by its reported revenue and reiterated that its outside accountants , ernst young , had repeatedly certified its books in a conference call with analysts just weeks ago , mr parsons said of the company s chief financial officer , wayne h pace wayne and i will both sign off as the new sec requirements provide you need n't worry about that investors have anxiously awaited mr parsons' decision to put his signature and personal liability behind aol s accounting in part because of fears that aol may have inflated its revenue in the period preceding shareholder approval of its acquisition of time warner in june 2000 results at many internet companies began to fall during that period while aol s continued to rise , only to plunge after the merger , dragging aol time warner s stock down more than 80 percent shareholders are worried that aol may have misrepresented its prospects not only to investors but to the time warner board the company did not disclose specifics , but an aol time warner executive said yesterday that all of the transactions in question took place after shareholders approved the merger in 2000 in afterhours trading , shares of aol time warner initially advanced as investors reacted with relief that no other , larger problems were revealed still , the company did not rule out further disclosures executives said they had retained lawyers from cravath , swaine moore to help conduct an internal review , which the company expects to complete by the end of the quarter lawyers have said that disclosing the inflated revenue will only increase the company s potential liability in a host of shareholder lawsuits filed in recent weeks and aol time warner s confession to some accounting irregularities will not deter federal investigators from looking for more problems the possibly inflated revenue came to mr parsons' attention when , faced with the prospect of the sec investigation , an employee raised a red flag about a suspicious transaction , which led to the discovery of the two others a company spokesman said none of the transactions had been previously reported in the news media speaking on condition of anonymity , some aol time warner executives sought to portray the problems as isolated they said the issues had arisen from the takenoprisoners culture of aol s business affairs department , which developed many of its complicated advertising deals yesterday , aol time warner confirmed the departure of david m colburn , the head of aol s business affairs division , and executives acknowledged that the newly disclosed accounting problems led to his ouster his assistants were barred from aol s offices after he left so that the company could sort through possible evidence in their files but the disclosures are also likely to increase the scrutiny of the other executives in charge of aol s books at the time , including the chief financial officers j michael kelly and joseph ripp current and former aol executives said aol had maintained a strict system of controls requiring many of its top executives to sign off on all of its new deals , especially the complicated transactions involving barter , and mr kelly was the executive who set up the controls he was named chief financial officer of the parent company , aol time warner , when the merger was completed in january 2001 , but he was demoted back to chief operating officer of the aol division 11 months later after he lost his temper with a prominent wall street analyst the company had also failed to meet aggressive growth projections he helped establish mr kelly was succeeded as chief financial officer at aol by mr ripp , formerly chief financial officer of time inc and then time warner yesterday , the company also disclosed the unusually meager severance package paid to robert w pittman , who resigned last month as chief operating officer of aol time warner most of mr pittman s compensation was in the form of stock options , with just about 1 million a year in salary along with a bonus his contract entitled him to two years of salary as a consultant after departing , but , in an unusual move for a departing executive , he elected to forgo the cash salary in exchange for extending the right to exercise about nine million of his options through september 2007 about 700 , 000 of the options allow him to buy stock at prices from 2250 , and the rest at prices as high as 7344 , so mr pittman is wagering that aol time warner s stock will more than double from its current levels meanwhile , in a memo to employees , mr parsons stressed his confidence in the company and the importance of probity while the amount of revenue at issue in the three transactions is relatively small , he wrote , and while we are still reviewing the accounting for these matters , the mere existence of questions regarding these transactions requires that we take appropriate action there is no room at this company for any unethical behavior , he added , urging any other employees to come forward with their concerns as well
some associates of bill clinton and executives from cbs are involved in negotiations to make the former president the host of a daily afternoon talk show the seriousness of the talks is a matter of dispute among the people surrounding mr clinton west coast friends of his are advancing the negotiations and believe that a deal can be made but his advisers on the east coast said mr clinton was unlikely to commit himself to a daily talk show cbs executives consider the talks preliminary and say that a number of hurdles remain , including a significant difference over money but these executives , as well as nbc executives who have talked with mr clinton , said that he had offered assurances that under the right circumstances he would be the host of a talk show one east coat adviser noted that the former president had a history of sounding agreeable to interesting suggestions , however , and that it did not mean he was committing himself in may , after a spate of reports that he was considering an offer to star in a talk show , mr clinton said he did not think that would ever happen his spokesmen dismissed the reports , saying the former president had only had courtesy meetings with television executives but since then associates of mr clinton have held talks with nbc and cbs , discussing the possibility that mr clinton would be the host of a syndicated talk show , at a salary of 30 million to 50 million a year , the highest fee ever paid to a firsttime talk show host the nbc talks collapsed in midjuly mr clinton s spokesman , james e kennedy , referred all questions to mr clinton s washington lawyer , robert barnett , who , he said , would negotiate any contracts for the former president mr barnett said the president has received an enormous number of offers from broadcast television , cable television , the internet , print and radio we have no immediate plans to make any media deals , and when the time comes a proper announcement will be forthcoming the talks with cbs started up after the collapse of long negotiations with nbc , where the prospect of a clinton talk show first emerged at a meeting on may 1 nbc executives and representatives for mr clinton held several meetings through midjuly trying to work out the terms of a deal dennis swanson , then the head of nbc s flagship station , wnbc , channel 4 in new york , met oneonone with mr clinton in late may and became the champion for the show inside nbc mr swanson quit nbc in july to join cbs as the head of the network s stations , and is now a part of the cbs effort to make a deal with mr clinton nbc executives said they did not question whether mr clinton would agree to do a show if the terms were right i honestly believed he would do it , one nbc negotiator said i never believed his interest was bogus the nbc executives said they were repeatedly assured by mr clinton s associates that he was tired of his postpresidential financial reliance on speaking engagements and that he was enthusiastic about pursuing a new career as host of a talk show still , one consistent stumbling block , first for nbc and now for cbs , has been that the clinton side has not fully made clear what kind of show he would be willing to do the extent to which such a show would deal with public affairs or feature lighter fare , like celebrity interviews the first meeting was held in the hollywood offices of mr clinton s longtime friend harry thomason , a television producer who has been involved in previous media projects with the former president , including his campaign video biography , the man from hope one nbc executive said mr thomason was the driving force in the discussion and was especially eager to conclude a deal quickly they wanted to make a deal before they had a program , the executive said what they were talking about was a talk show but a weird talk show they wanted a public affairs show , but there might be a band still , the nbc side agreed that mr clinton s media skills might make him an intriguing , perhaps extraordinary talk show host you think maybe he could be a force for good , the nbc executive said in between playing the sax or singing with carly simon or whatever he s going to do , maybe he could do some great things though that meeting ended in disarray the nbc executive said he felt as if he were in the middle of a sketch for saturday night live nbc stayed interested enough to continue negotiating the talks became serious enough that nbc s station group held several conference calls to debate the risks and the rewards of signing mr clinton stations in the larger cities in the north generally supported the idea , while some stations in the sun belt questioned it , saying their more conservative audiences would not respond well to mr clinton nbc executives believed that a show starring mr clinton would have the biggest opening week in the history of daytime television they also expected that signing him would would bring on criticism , both because the former president might seem to be selling out to become a performer and the visceral enmity toward mr clinton from conservatives nbc was going to take a lot of heat , one nbc executive involved in the negotiations said but so what \? in the business of television sometimes things are controversial and sometimes that s the best thing that can happen other nbc executives expressed concern that advertisers might be wary of the show because mr clinton had been a polarizing figure one nbc executive said he doubted that , however , adding , i think you sell commercials in his first show for record prices the question , nbc executives said , was the show s staying power and whether it could ever recoup the money the clinton side was then demanding a guarantee of 100 million over two years the price was beyond anything any syndicator ever promised a star the highest guarantee for any syndicated talk show was about 30 million for a proposed show with katie couric , one longtime syndicated television executive said of the cohost of nbc s today in this case , that would n't get you in the room but the profits for a hit talk show can be enormous the genre s leader , oprah winfrey , takes in hundreds of millions a year , and she herself makes as much as 125 million a year from her show , which she owns the clinton associates later came back to nbc with an altered financial structure nbc executives said the new offer included significant backing from a production company that they said was willing to share the costs but nbc backed away from the deal anyway cbs executives said they were still far apart on the financial terms of the deal and were not completely convinced that mr clinton wanted to go through the rigors of being the host of a daily show joel h silbey , a historian at cornell university , said that although other former presidents had written books , given speeches or , like jimmy carter , sought to contribute to public life , none came back into the realm of popular culture but professor silbey said the possibility of a talk show reflected mr clinton s unique personality , noting the former president s close ties to hollywood and his comfort in settings like mtv photo former president bill clinton chatted with youths on july 11 about aids prevention during an mtv forum \( reuters

the security crackdown meant to keep terrorist hijackers out of american flight schools has forced thousands of foreign students to train overseas , weakening the country s global dominance in aviation training , officials in the industry say that shift , they warn , could ultimately mean greater risks for air travelers , because american flight schools are the main source of welltrained commercial pilots for foreign airlines the united states has always made most of the aircraft in use around the world , we produce most of the instructors and we train most of the pilots , said joseph e burnside , vice president for government and industry affairs of the national air transportation association , the trade organization for the general aviation industry but now we 're concerned that we may be losing that market if the government does n't get its act together , students are going to begin training overseas , and that training will be of lesser quality than they would receive in the united states , mr burnside argued there will be an impact on aviation safety worldwide government officials defend the sharpened scrutiny of foreign flight students as a longoverdue effort to rein in a sprawling , loosely regulated system that was easily exploited by the sept 11 hijackers , a third of whom trained at american flight schools for years , many foreign airlines have sent their pilots to the united states for refresher courses , alongside thousands of international students the hijackers took the same course , moving from one small training center to another around the country and taking advantage of the breadth and anonymity of the american flightschool system after the september attacks , congress imposed new restrictions requiring background checks of many foreigners studying at flight schools here , and immigration officials tightened visa requirements but the white house has not yet agreed to the background check procedures , and the justice department , meanwhile , is refusing to let most foreign students or pilots train to fly business jets or airliners as a result , according to flight schools and aviation universities around the country , thousands of foreign students who would normally be studying here are learning to fly overseas several international airlines have moved their training offshore many of the students now being diverted to schools abroad are not those entering as individuals , as the sept 11 hijackers did , but employees of wellestablished airlines who have legitimate careers in aviation several flight schools that catered to overseas students have closed , and most of the largest have laid off employees representative john l mica , a florida republican who is chairman of the house aviation subcommittee , acknowledged that the bush administration was taking much longer than expected to write the rules requiring background checks for foreign student pilots , a delay that is holding up the careers of many pilots and driving them overseas that could backfire on the united states , he said , if pilots get licenses in other countries with no background checks because the process still is n't in place yet , we know that foreign students who have always come here to study are now going to european schools and elsewhere , mr mica said that could make the situation even worse , because if they fly into the united states without any review , we have the risk of people subverting the whole process we 've set up he said that he hoped to persuade international aviation officials to adopt background standards similar to those in the united states , but that it might be several years before the process was sufficiently smooth here to lure the foreign students back a spokesman for the white house office of management and budget , which is holding up the background checks called for in the transportation security act , said the delay was the result of careful review we do n't just rubberstamp rules from the agencies , said the spokesman , trent duffy , referring to the justice department this is a very significant rule , and rigorous regulatory review is a hallmark of the bush administration another government official said the justice department was simply not ready to study the backgrounds of every foreign flight student bad for business in the midst of the administration s internal debate a few weeks ago , china southern airlines , the largest carrier in china , decided to train 150 of its pilots in perth , australia , instead of arizona , canceling a 6 million contract with the international airline training academy in glendale , ariz jeanmarc eloy , the school s owner , had already lost more than half of his international flight students since sept 11 and laid off seven instructors as a consultant to china southern , mr eloy flew to perth after the airline s decision , and was surprised to discover a number of new flight academies that have sprung up recently in australia , along with a bevy of students who would otherwise be in the united states
washington , aug 2 when will iraq have biological or nuclear weapons \? that was the question senators asked again and again during hearings this week on the administration s goal of deposing president saddam hussein and expert after expert gave the same answer we do n't know yet while the answer may be unknowable at present , it is crucial in the minds of many lawmakers as they grapple with when , and whether , the united states should attack iraq administration officials have argued that mr hussein must be ousted soon because of his efforts to develop biological and nuclear weapons , along with the missiles to deliver them to distant countries but most intelligence experts agree that mr hussein does not have a nuclear device yet and while it is virtually certain that mr hussein has deadly chemical weapons like sarin gas and probably some noninfectious biological agents like anthrax , many experts doubt that he has developed infectious viruses like smallpox , or that he possesses the means to deliver any of them long distances in short , the united states simply does not know how advanced iraq s chemical , biological or nuclear weapons programs may be and even some republican senators are suggesting that they want more intelligence before they support a preemptive attack against iraq we need to know much more , said senator richard lugar , the indiana republican who is the ranking member of the foreign relations committee we 're all saying today that we have n't found the evidence , but somebody has to ask , 'why not \? ' many in washington believe that it is just a matter of time before mr hussein obtains such weapons and delivery systems but is that months away , or years \? the question is more than academic , because the administration and congress are considerating whether an attack to depose mr hussein and destroy his deadliest weapons should begin as early as january or , conversely , does the united states have more time perhaps years to build international support for an attack , or even devise other means to remove mr hussein and destroy his weapons \? the question for me , said senator joseph r biden jr , the delaware democrat who is chairman of the foreign relations committee , is , do we have enough time to do this right \? short of an intelligence breakthrough , that decision may ultimately depend on something ranging between an educated guess and blind faith , experts told congress in hearings this week anthony cordesman , a former pentagon official and iraq expert who is now with the center for strategic and international studies in washington , summarized the conundrum this way it is far from clear that anyone will ever be able to answer your questions or know when or where or how these kinds of weapons will be used , he said if we do this , it will in many ways be our first preemptive war we will not have a clear smoking gun one reason for the lack of information is that the united nations stopped weapons inspections of iraq in 1998 before that , inspectors found evidence that mr hussein had rebuilt chemical and biological weapons facilities destroyed during the persian gulf war of 1991 and was continuing his pursuit of nuclear and longrange missile technology on thursday , iraq told united nations officials that it was ready to talk about resuming inspections but administration officials expressed doubts that mr hussein had any intention of allowing a resumption of thorough inspections and suggested that he was simply trying to stave off an american attack our policy remains the same , sean mccormack , a spokesman for the national security council , said today it has been the same since 1995 , and that is regime change for those convinced that mr hussein is not only close to developing biological and nuclear weapons , but intent on using them against america and its allies , no smoking gun is needed caspar w weinberger , defense secretary under ronald reagan , said if people are looking for an excuse for inaction , they can say , 'we must have positive proof that iraq has chemical and biological weapons or even nuclear weapons' but the only real proof that we can really expect under this terminology is if we are attacked nevertheless , a number of senators from both parties suggested that they wanted more evidence , particularly if the united states planned to invade iraq without the support of its allies i think the key here is the existence of the threat , senator lincoln chafee , republican of rhode island , said during wednesday s hearing and there s some dispute though few experts question mr hussein s determination to obtain nuclear and biological weapons , there is a debate about why many in the administration believe he intends to use them against the united states and israel , or is prepared to give them to terrorists richard butler , who led the united nations inspections program in iraq until 1998 , disagrees he argues that mr hussein knows that first use of his deadliest weapons would ensure his own destruction he also asserts that mr hussein guards his deadliest weapons jealously , not wanting to share those things that could make him the most powerful man in the middle east mr butler contends that the united states should push for new weapons inspections , if only to build an international case against mr hussein if mr hussein refuses , or restricts or harasses inspectors , the united states will gain support for an attack , he said but how long does the united states have to build that case \? none of the experts could say for sure exactly what s taking place in iraq is , i guess , a mystery , senator chafee said
melbourne , australia , monday , jan 21 summer heat and sizzle gave way to cool and drizzle today , which meant that the world s best tennis players could no longer see the sky as they played their fourthround matches at the australian open unlike in paris , suburban london or queens , the organizers can close the roof and the players can get on with it at the year s first grand slam tournament shine or rain this year , the highestranked women have been much tougher to beat than the highestranked men , and the trend continued today as jennifer capriati , justine henin and am lie mauresmo all advanced to the quarterfinals capriati , the no 1 seeding and defending champion , defeated rita grande of italy , 63 , 76 \( 11 \) , sweating profusely in the second set when she had to save 2 set points grande , seeded 20th , mixed her shots well , using her slice backhand and approach shots to fine effect grande disrupted capriati s typically bighitting rhythm and kept her lunging and running down the stretch if grande could have made a relatively straightforward overhead at 65 in the tie breaker , she would have forced a third set , but her legs and nerves weighed heavily and she struck the ball into the net on her next set point , at 87 , capriati hit a bold and beautiful backhand return down the line off a second serve for a winner this is part of the game , grande said , before referring to capriati she s no 1 , she took the risk and it worked grande doublefaulted to lose the match after saving the first three match points she faced it s tough to play her , capriati said she does n't give the ball much pace it s not like i can use her pace and make winners it was a real test of my patience i even got into some slicing battles with her earlier , henin made surprisingly quick and impressive work of the powerful but errorprone elena dementieva of russia , 60 , 63 mauresmo struggled with herself as well as the allcourt flair of her unseeded german opponent marlene weingartner before winning , 60 , 57 , 75 while none of the top six seedings remain in the men s event , none of the top eight women have lost here the only casualty was serena williams , who withdrew with an ankle injury the day the tournament began that stark contrast has revived the traditional sniping from the men marcelo rios , no born diplomat , was one of those to take a predictable swing , saying men s tennis is too tough it s not like girls , where they win , one and love , until they 're in the quarters he added , it s like a joke , and i think in men s that s not going to happen there has been evidence to support and refute rios s take in favor martina hingis s 61 , 60 victory over amanda coetzer , or venus williams s 60 , 63 victory over magdalena maleeva , which both came in the fourth round on sunday against williams s compelling threeset victory over slovakia s daniela hantuchova in the third round mauresmo s uneven victory over weingartner and capriati s occasional travails in the first eight days i think this match today proved his comments were pretty wrong , pretty ridiculous , capriati said i think it is interesting enough , williams said i feel that the top players , we take extreme pride in what we do , and each time we gave our personal best when we walk out on the court , no matter whether it s the australian open or if we 're playing in indonesia and i think that really is where we excel we do n't slack at any time , and we do n't just bring our best game to the slams we bring it to every event that conclusion might have elicited some snickers at the wta headquarters , considering how seldom williams plays in events compared with most of her rivals but while she made it clear that she was not about to turn into a road warrior , she did leave the door ajar and also attended the wta players meeting in melbourne before the season i did give more consideration to my schedule , she said but in the fall , my schedule is really going to dwindle down , because i have other things involved and planning for my life those things include her university classes in fashion design for now , williams , who no longer appears troubled by tendinitis in her left knee , has a quarterfinal with monica seles on tuesday seles is 06 against williams , but they have never played in a grand slam event , and seles has traditionally been at her best in melbourne her record here is 422 match points marcelo rios of chile , a former world no 1 who has struggled with leg injuries , reached the quarterfinals with a 75 , 61 , 64 victory over nicolas lapentti of ecuador
washington it is encouraging that the bush administration seems to support the goal of providing prenatal care to uninsured women but the best way to do this is not by extending a children s health program to cover unborn children , as president bush wants to do rather , it is by providing health care directly to pregnant women for the sake of both mother and baby , women need full and appropriate prenatal and postpartum care that focuses on their own needs as they become mothers , as well as on keeping the fetus healthy as a nation , we do far too little to promote good maternal health in 1999 , according to emory university researchers , 430 , 000 pregnant women had no insurance coverage this neglect shows itself when american children are born the united states ranks 27th in infant mortality and 21st in maternal mortality the worst among developed nations unfortunately , the administration s solution extending the child health insurance program , which covers children from lowincome working families , to cover fetuses would set up a long regulatory and legal process and a battle over abortion rights in virtually every state it would create controversy where none need exist , as well as posing puzzling medical questions how does a doctor provide care for a fetus outside the context of providing care for the pregnant woman \? why would a doctor want to \? if a woman develops high blood pressure and diabetes during pregnancy , do we simply ignore her condition unless or until it affects the fetus \? once the woman gives birth , do we then deny her the necessary postpartum care because she is no longer carrying the fetus \? what s really needed is simple an extension of the program , which is often called chip , to pregnant women and an increase in funds to cover this extension now a pregnant woman gets help automatically only if she is still so young that she qualifies as a child herself a few states do cover pregnant women using funds from chip but this requires a cumbersome and lengthy waiver process our proposal would end the red tape and make coverage automatic all over the country and we should do more to improve chip we should change the program s guidelines to reach more children and young people , both by raising the maximum family income allowed for eligibility and by extending coverage to 19 and 20yearolds we should simplify the applications process and remove bureaucratic barriers that keep about eight million children who are already eligible for chip from actually enrolling along with senator richard lugar , republican of indiana , we have introduced legislation that incorporates all of these proposals other bipartisan proposals promote similar ideas we cannot let the critical matter of extending health coverage to pregnant women spiral into an abortion debate this is an issue behind which all of us can and must unite

they are my people \) he wanted them to be aware of where they were in their careers he also added the somewhat cumbersome de montr al to the company s name , hoping to kindle an awareness of the troupe among city officials the city responded by giving it refurbished space in a municipal building to replace its former headquarters in an old garage \( the company has not yet moved into the new space \) mr pankov , born to a family of dentists in skopje , macedonia , was about to continue the family tradition but changed his mind after seeing a performance by the danish dancer erik bruhn then 17 , mr pankov began a year of classes at a private institute , followed by studies at the national conservatory of dance , music and pedagogy in skopje he completed an eightyear program in two for the next 11 years , he danced with companies in the former yugoslavia and germany by 1980 , he had started teaching he later became the artistic director of nederlands dans theater s junior company before going on to head the national ballet in finland , the cullberg ballet in stockholm and finally the ballet du grand th tre in geneva in les grands , he inherited a company whose repertory consisted mainly of short works by some of the most important choreographers in europe and america jiri kylian , nacho duato , william forsythe and george balanchine , to name a few honoring company tradition and those stalwart dancegoers who had stuck with the troupe throughout the hard times , he made story ballets his chief instrument of change mr pankov opened his first season with carmen , an erotic work by didy veldman , a former prot g from geneva set to a fusion of rock music and georges bizet s traditional score , carmen had been choreographed in 1999 for the northern ballet theater in england it joined the nutcracker as the only fullevening production in les grand s repertory popular with audiences , carmen made it possible for mr pankov to attempt his biggest experiment yet , the queen of spades based on the novella by alexander pushkin , the queen deals with gambling its main characters , victims of their own illusions , die spectacularly in action that sweeps back and forth across a 40year period from tzarist russia to the soviet union as interpreted by mr brandstrup , it is a complicated production involving a score based on the tchaikovsky opera of the same name , lavish costumes and special effects by a team of collaborators including the brothers quay , new york animators at a cost of 500 , 000 , it was the most expensive work the company ever mounted the new ballet opened to cheering houses and rave reviews in october well publicized , it caught the public s imagination even before its premiere , ticket sales were so strong that the run had to be extended by the time the first reviews appeared , the season had been sold out and provisions made for return engagements mr pankov was elated he had expected it to take three years to turn around the company during those first years , he relentlessly buttonholed everyone he met spectators , dancers , administrators and even journalists soliciting their ideas and opinions about the company mr pankov s curiosity and directness were disarming his outgoing way was in marked contrast to that of his predecessor , the quiet and circumspect lawrence rhodes the company went through tremendous change in two years , said mario radacovsky , 30 , a former member of the main nederlands dans theater company and now one of les grands s highestranking dancers the company is now more competitive it feels nice to be part of something growing
attock , pakistan when the g8 leaders meet this week , cowering in a canadian mountain resort beyond the reach of organized anarchists , here s a way for them to bolster terrorinfested third world countries like pakistan they should start an international campaign to promote imports from sweatshops , perhaps with bold labels depicting an unrecognizable flag and the words proudly made in a third world sweatshop ! the gentle reader will think i 've been smoking pakistani opium but the fact is that sweatshops are the only hope of kids like ahmed zia , a 14yearold boy here in attock , a gritty center for carpet weaving ahmed , who dropped out of school in the second grade , earns 2 a day hunched over the loom , laboring over a rug that will adorn some american s living room it is a pittance , but the american campaign against sweatshops could make his life much more wretched by inadvertently encouraging mechanization that could cost him his job carpetmaking is much better than farm work , ahmed said , mulling alternatives if he loses his job as hundreds of others have over the last year this makes much more money and is more comfortable indeed , talk to third world factory workers and the whole idea of sweatshops seems a misnomer it is farmers and brickmakers who really sweat under the broiling sun , while sweatshop workers merely glow the third world is already battered by heartless conservatives in the west who peddle arms and cigarettes or who \( like the bushies \) block 34 million desperately needed for maternal and infant health by the united nations population fund so it s catastrophic for muddleminded liberals to join in and cudgel impoverished workers for whom a sweatshop job is the first step on life s escalator by this point , i 've offended every possible reader but before you spurn a shirt made by someone like 8yearold kamis saboor , an afghan refugee whose father is dead and who is the sole breadwinner in the family , answer this question how does shunning sweatshop products help kamis \? all the alternatives for him are worse i dream of a job in a factory , said noroz khan , who lives on a garbage dump and spends his days searching for metal that he can sell to recyclers he earns about 140 a day , and children earn just 30 cents a day for scrounging barefoot in the filth a few feet away from us , birds were pecking at the bloated carcass of a cow , its feet in the air of course , western antisweatshop activists mean well and aim only for improved conditions and a living wage but the reality is that the bad publicity becomes one more headache for companies considering operating in international hellholes \( where the only lure is wages so low that it would be embarrassing if journalists started asking questions about them \) , and so manufacturers opt to mechanize their operations and operate in somewhat more developed countries for example , nike has 35 contract factories in taiwan , 49 in south korea , only 3 in pakistan and none at all in afghanistan if it did , critics would immediately fulminate about low wages , glue vapors , the mistreatment of women but the losers are the afghans , and especially afghan women the country is full of starving widows who can find no jobs if nike hired them at 10 cents an hour to fill allfemale sweatshops , they and their country would be hugely better off nike used to have two contract factories in impoverished cambodia , among the neediest countries in the world then there was an outcry after bbc reported that three girls in one factory were under 15 years old so nike fled controversy by ceasing production in cambodia the result was that some of the 2 , 000 cambodians \( 90 percent of them young women \) who worked in those factories faced layoffs some who lost their jobs probably were ensnared in cambodia s huge sex slave industry which leaves many girls dead of aids by the end of their teenage years the g8 leaders will never dare , of course , begin a prosweatshop campaign but at a summit that will discuss how to bring stability and economic growth to some of the world s poorest nations , it would be a start if westerners who denounce sweatshops would think less of feelgood measures for themselves and more about how any of this helps people like ahmed and kamis
lagos , nigeria as the sun rises over west africa s new moviemaking capital , the surulere district of lagos , the cast and crew of blackmailed form a fourcar convoy to leave for their first day of shooting it s like a dream come true , said nonso diobi , 21 , who had snatched one of the lead roles in blackmailed only two months after leaving his home in southeastern nigeria for surulere , here in the country s commercial capital this is where it all happens , where all the stars are who make big money because they can sell movies i'm not a big star yet but when i am , i will fix a big price since the late 1990 s , nigerian movies have found a place next to offerings from hollywood and bollywood , bombay s equivalent , in the cities , towns and villages across englishspeaking africa though made on the cheap , with budgets of about only 15 , 000 , the nigerian movies have become huge hits , with stories , themes and faces familiar to other africans it is now , according to conservative estimates , a 45 million a year industry serious movies about africa that win awards in the west are usually made by african filmmakers based in paris or london , and resonate little among most africans but nigeria s pulp movies have had a wide influence on african popular culture so much so that they have suddenly made acting an attractive profession in nigeria and have transformed surulere , an otherwise drab neighborhood of twostory businesses and houses , into a crucible of dreams and desires this is hollywood in nigeria , emeka ani , 45 , an actor whose tworoom office in surulere serves as the center for the actors guild of nigeria , said on a recent morning outside , on folawiyo bankole street , a steady stream of eager young men and women paused before the audition notices on two boards they milled around on the street , exchanging gossip and tips , causing traffic jams on the narrow twolane street when a star came by , a crowd gathered in mr ani s inner office , within easy reach of a bottle of brandy , he keeps a file of nigeria s famous actors and a list of guild members , which has grown to 5 , 000 from 500 since its creation in 1996 in the other room , he sells videocassettes of hundreds of movies , which are known here as home videos this is one of the most controversial movies ever made , he said , producing a copy of i hate my village made in 1998 , the movie deals with cannibalism , and the cassette s cover shows mr ani chewing on what is supposedly human flesh christian songs wafted through the office by midmorning , the music had hardened to the dance rhythms of nigerian high life , and the young wouldbe actresses working in his office one in a clingy purple satin dress and one in tight jeans with a silver chain belt were dancing to ollie gee s daddy moh the crowd gravitated to winis , a hotel and restaurant a couple of buildings away from mr ani s that is the hangout for actors , directors and producers they sit in the bar s very low chairs and , under the ceiling fans' deferential spinning , make deals over gulder beer and hot pepper soup if you stay here long enough , someone will talk to you and say , 'come work for me , ' said don olaolu richard , 23 , an actor who , in fact , had just landed a role with the production manager standing next to him , kingsley atoe mr atoe , 33 , had prowled surulere since 7 am to fill eight minor speaking roles and 20 extra spots for love of my life by noon , his mission was accomplished or almost the only role i have n't filled is one for a white man , a speaking role in just one scene , he said , immediately offering it to the reporter interviewing him shooting was starting in a couple of days , in keeping with the frenetic pace of nigeria s movie production with such low budgets , the movies are typically filmed over several days , with just one digital camera the stories are perhaps no different from those found in hollywood movies , though many have africaspecific themes , like ritual killings and witchcraft by all accounts , the first big hit dates to a 1992 movie about human sacrifices , living in bondage it gave birth to the film industry , which is dominated by the ibo ethnic group , said remy ohajianya , an actor who is chairman of the actors guild but the explosive growth occurred after 1998 , mr ohajianya said , when nigerian movies began to be exported all over africa , especially in the englishspeaking countries so many films were being made that , early this year , producers spat out 54 titles in a single week after a fourmonth voluntary recess , the industry has agreed to limit the releases to eight a week a week or two after shooting ends , the movies flood the nigerian market , sold for 215 a cassette and shown to the public for a few pennies in restaurants , video centers or private homes operating as movie houses an average movie will sell about 50 , 000 copies and a blockbuster four times that according to estimates provided by producers and financial backers , the nigerian movie industry now produces more than 400 movies a year at that rate , the producers bring in an estimated 45 million a year but other people , at movie centers , and bootleggers , also capitalize from the movies
in pleading with jurors to spare him the death penalty , rabbi fred j neulander cited the bible , praised his murdered wife and promised to be productive in prison by teaching the illiterate a full transcript of his statement , as recorded by the new york times , is online at nytimescom metro i am here to offer a plea for my life somehow i think it was very fortuitous that yesterday i did not have the opportunity to address you the room was filled with emotion i was filled with emotion and i'm not sure that i could have spoken i'm not sure i could have even spoken , period physically at the end of the book of genesis there s a wonderful , wonderful dialogue between pharaoh and patriarch jacob and because joseph is a grand vizier or whatever title he had , he was certainly the second in command in egypt he was the dick cheney of ancient egypt and because of that most likely jacob has this interview , jacob probably has an audience with the pharaoh and the pharaoh asks a question at the outset he asks , how many are the days of the years of your life \? when he uses that word the days of the years of your life , our great commentators , our great scholars , our great interpreters tell us that there s a message that what s critical is not quantity , but the question is what did you do with the days of your life \? how did you fill your days \? how did you make a difference in the world \? were you selfish or were you generous with your time \? that now is not an issue of the quantity of your years , but it s an issue of a quality of your experience and i would like to use that as a benchmark for that which i speak to you of myself in the past , in the present and in the future if i look at the days of the years of my life before the first of november of 1994 , they were filled with great blessings first and foremost , i had my wife , carol she was a remarkable woman she was bright she had a sense of balance she had the ability to understand people and things so very quickly this was a gracious hostess this was a gracious guest and carol had grit by that i mean fortitude carol neulander , my wife , started a business with no background in business and no training in business she started a bakery with no background in baking and no training in baking and what emerged from her efforts and her vision was unquestionably a bakery that was recognized as second to none in the entire delaware valley great , great grit and carol neulander had class not classy because that does n't even come close when you were in the company of carol neulander , you knew you were in the company of a lady and you behaved like that and yet she was n't distant you could approach her easily and i miss her , and i loved her and i love her now there are those among us who would behind their hands would snicker i have acknowledged for the longest time my behavior that was reprehensible and my behavior that was disgraceful and note that that s a theological word , disgraceful and yet you must believe i loved her and love her starting today there is another sense of the days of the years of my life that will unfold i do not know where i will be quite obviously , i do n't know that but wherever i will be there will be men who cannot read the legacy of illiteracy is striking and very sad and very limiting i would hope that wherever i am , i would be able to teach a young man to read and then to be able to check in the newspaper what jobs are available and then be able to fill out an application and enrich the days of the years of his life that s all i want is that opportunity to teach and that s why i'm here i beseech you , i importune you , i beg of you for that privilege and i promise , i promise that i will do whatever a teacher should do to enrich the lives of people that come in contact with that teacher
rome , march 2 many vatican officials , conservative and liberal alike , say it will take a sweeping reform of the priesthood to stop the pedophile scandals the liberals want better psychological screening and revamped training in seminaries the conservatives shift the focus elsewhere , saying that sexual abuse cases in the church mainly involve teenage boys , not young children , and for that reason they say the priesthood should become less welcoming to gays priests who said this made clear they were not suggesting that gays were any more likely to be pedophiles but they said most of the sex cases being investigated did not fit the classic definition of pedophilia with this in mind , pope john paul ii s spokesman , joaquin navarrovalls , questioned whether ordinations of gays were even valid people with these inclinations just cannot be ordained , dr navarrovalls said in an interview , citing canon law but wading into what he knew was sensitive territory that does not imply a final judgment on people with homosexuality , added dr navarrovalls , a spanish layman who is a psychiatrist by training but you cannot be in this field dr navarrovalls compared the situation of a gay man who becomes a priest to that of a gay man who marries a woman unaware of his orientation just as such a marriage can be annulled , considered invalid from the first , the ordination might similarly be invalid , he said where dr navarrovalls and a number of conservative american priests differ is on the vatican s handling of the sex scandals the vatican response has been so lowkey that a surprising number of the vatican rank and file are still only dimly aware of the crisis in the american catholic church , these priests say for americans here , the scandals back home have been topic a for weeks our bishops are in hysteria , one priest said the law is out the window , and suddenly it s like the french revolution still , he added good will come out of it eventually there will be bloodletting , but we are learning as big as the story is in the united states , you certainly do n't hear about it here among colleagues who are not american , said the rev keith pecklers , a jesuit at the pontifical liturgical institute in rome to the extent that others are aware of it , many tend to write it off as an american problem so there is widespread unhappiness among americans at the vatican , even among conservatives who are usually the least inclined to criticize the hierarchy on this issue , they say the response from rome has been embarrassingly weak several , none willing to be quoted , independently used the word disaster to describe both scandal and response , which they characterized as waitandsee they say that approach is typical of a still italian , largely eurocentric church unaware of the gravity of the situation the pope s spokesman argued that point we 're very well aware of the dimension and implications of the problem , dr navarrovalls said ruefully , very well aware asked if there had been any discussion of the need to formally respond to the american scandals from here , he said not for now they 're working on it there when the pope has something to say to one of his bishops or cardinals , dr navarrovalls said , he delivers the message directly and not through news releases cardinal bernard f law , who has been under pressure to resign over his handling of cases in the boston archdiocese , came to rome six weeks ago and met with the pope privately , dr navarrovalls said until recently , cardinal law was considered the vatican s favorite american cardinal , but that is no longer the case , a number of officials said dr navarrovalls defended the pope s silence on the scandals by arguing that the pope had spoken very explicitly on the general topic of sex abuse by members of the clergy in a recent vatican document but the way the pope communicated his apology to victims of abuse in a paragraph deep inside a document about a bishops' conference of several years ago was also cited as an indication that the church was not addressing the matter urgently without criticizing the pope , people in church circles here express a frustration with the vatican s inability to respond more quickly and less obscurely another reason for the vatican s muted response is that even now the standards for reporting and addressing accusations of sex abuse in the united states are seen as a model that the church would like to export to where such problems have been ignored in western europe , for example , there are no treatment centers specifically for sexually abusive clergy members , and sex scandals of all kinds receive much less attention than they do in the united states the true intention of a recent move to centralize the way accusations of sex abuse against priests are handled , vatican officials insist , is to bring the rest of the church up to american standards now when there s a problem it must be reported to the vatican , dr navarrovalls said this is not going to be a substitute for any legal or criminal penalties but will be an additional guarantee , an acknowledgment of the seriousness of the problem the holy see has thwarted american bishops who want to make it easier under canon law to dismiss predatory priests americans bishops want to be able to decide this on their own , administratively , rather than going through the judicial process spelled out in church law , said one italian canon lawyer at the vatican the judicial process can take years , whereas the administrative decision can be immediate he accused americans of pushing for this change only because tort law in the united states exposes bishops to liability in a way that does not apply elsewhere the painful thing is that it s all about money now , the italian priest said dr navarrovalls said the pope had reacted with pain to the disclosures he has shown tremendous sadness , a very physical sadness that affected his whole body and said , how can this happen \? ' dr navarrovalls said this has been my impression several times photo joaquin navarrovalls says the vatican is aware of the scope of the problem \( associated press \)
it was started in a tenement on the lower east side a handful of immigrant socialists , most of them yiddishspeaking laborers , gathered in the essex street home of sam greenberg , a cloak maker , wanting to find a way to take care of one another through sickness and death as they tried to gain footholds in a formidable country in the process , these newcomers hoped to ease their loneliness quickly their idea , the workmen s circle , caught on people seemed to like joining a group that helped tide them through an illness yet allowed them to sit with friends over a glass of tea and argue a fine point of radical politics within 30 years , the organization gained 80 , 000 members around the country , joined with the garment unions to broaden the rights of american workers and started an early and absurdly cheap version of health insurance and dozens of yiddish schools but as its members prepare to gather in town hall next week to celebrate the organization s national centennial two years too late , but these things do take time they are mindful that the fruits of the group s success have contained the seeds of its decline what it has had to work on in recent years is finding some fresher reasons for going on the descendants of those early founders are no longer workmen in the classic sense , and socialism for a crowd that grew comfortable through capitalism has evolved into a tamer push for social justice some of our members are reasonably conservative and i dare say we have a smattering of members who are very conservative , said dr barnett zumoff , a former president the wider society long ago eclipsed the circle s health benefits and so the 20 , 000 remaining members rely on medicare and managed care while many founders were determinedly hostile to religion , members now include synagoguegoers , even a few hasidim and yiddish is fading on the lips of all but the elderly and a few of the language s younger champions but no one is writing advance obituaries , because , like its followers , the workmen s circle has always adapted decades ago , it threw out the more radical communists and it long ago dropped its resistance to a jewish state but it has become so pragmatic that it is raising money , a notion that would have stirred heartburn among the founding europeanborn socialists who passed the hat only for catastrophic events like a strike when robert a kaplan , director of the fundraising efforts , argued the point with dissenters , they would tell him to the uja , i give from the workmen s circle , i get but now the organization , trying to finance its schools and socialaction programs as duespaying members die off , has raised 6 million and is shooting for 10 million by appealing to its more prosperous members , though leaders point out , we do n't have tisches it has also been making a conscious effort to attract the young anyone under 55 in recent decades , its schools and popular summer camp , kinder ring , have emphasized a gauzier knowledge of jewish culture rather than mastery of yiddish , something that finds favor with families eager to find a secular , but not taxing , way to express their roots while twothirds of its members are elderly , half of its 44 executive board posts are held by people under 55 i do n't want to say younger people are smarter , however there is one thing they 're going to be around longer , mr kaplan said peter and marci pepper are the kind of people the workmen s circle wants more of they did not grow up in circle households the way mr kaplan did , but mr pepper , a federal labor examiner and the 53yearold son of holocaust survivors , wanted to find a way to connect to his late father s shtetl past the peppers put their son , sam , into a circle school when sam turned 13 , mrs pepper said , they had him do a secular bar mitzvah , reading the story of the tower of babel in yiddish and relating it to his grandparents , who when they met each spoke several languages , none of them the same people really do crave that comfort they get with having connection and this is a great place to get that , said mrs pepper , a high school art teacher the workmen s circle , known in yiddish as der arbeter ring , has clearly become one of the last strongholds of yiddish culture the culture of the annihilated east european villages and the immigrant warrens in america as america accepted the new deal , the real raison d' tre of the workmen s circle became the fight against assimilation , said dr emanuel s goldsmith , a professor of yiddish at queens college and the author of a twovolume anthology of yiddish literature they were for the integration of jews into american life , but against assimilation the giving up of jewish identity and that is why they became such staunch defenders of yiddish the workmen s circle building , in the east 30 s , houses not just its offices , but those of the forward , the last of the city s secular yiddish papers , and the folksbiene , the remnant of the city s oncebustling yiddish theater while the three organizations are independent , their boards have many of the same directors
uniondale , ny , july 20 there was less than a minute left in regulation of a scoreless game when the ball reached ronnie fair at the edge of the penalty area fair , a defender for the new york power , failed to control the ball , allowing julie fleeting of the san diego spirit to take it and beat goalkeeper saskia webber webber was able to get her hands on the ball , but she , too , failed to control it , allowing fleeting s second goal of the season san diego s 10 victory tonight before a crowd of 4 , 002 at the mitchel field athletic complex extended the power s losing streak to nine games , a women s united soccer association record , and all but eliminated the power \( 2131 \) from contention for a playoff spot i yelled at ronnie to clear the ball , webber said , referring to fair we were looking for the win and we were getting exposed in the back she added , i got my hands on it but it popped out , and that was it a scoreless tie would have been an appropriate result for the league s two worst teams the power and the spirit \( 484 \) occupy the last two spots in the standing of the eightteam league and are the only teams in the twoyear history of the league to have changed coaches both did so this season the players are evaluated every day , power coach charlie duccilli said when asked whether his players were playing for jobs next year now that his team was close to being eliminated with five games left they have to train hard and play as hard as they can with the united states national team playing norway in minnesota in an exhibition game sunday , each team was missing three players the power was without tiffeny milbrett and its two norwegians , anita rapp and linda ormen san diego was without joy fawcett , julie foudy and shannon macmillan in addition , san diego midfielder shannon boxx served a onegame suspension duccilli moved christie pearce to the middle of the defense and moved wynne mcintosh to right fullback he also put kristy whelchel in midfield , moving her from her customary center back position to try to get control of the midfield none of the changes helped , especially in the first half there was very little coordination on defense and in midfield , and no synergy between the midfielders and the forwards just about every pass from midfield to attack went astray , and the power caused no problems for san diego s defense the power threatened only once before intermission it was in the 42nd minute , when a through pass by emily janss created a breakaway for tammy pearman , but pearman was unable to control the ball and carly smolak came off her line to gather the ball smolak made three saves in her first wusa shutout corner kicks the power and the metrostars of major league soccer will play in a doubleheader aug 7 at mitchel field the power will play carolina at 7 pm , followed by the metrostarscolumbus quarterfinal in the lamar hunt united states open cup the power s next three games are on the road it is at philadelphia on wednesday , at san jose on saturday and at boston on aug 4 the power will close the season with home games against carolina and washington
seoul , south korea , may 7 fifteen years ago , south korea began trying to convert its governmentrun phone monopoly into a nimble , competitive privately owned company attuned to profits rather than politics today , top executives of the monopoly , korea telecom , began the home stretch as darksuited executives spoke today in a luxurious hotel ballroom in seoul , outlining plans to get the remaining 286 percent of the company s stock into the hands of investors by the end of the month , labor leaders in red headbands sat at one table and listened politely afterward , they expressed concerns about job security for their members their attitude is important , because union hostility has so far blocked complete privatization of several other stateowned companies , notably korea electric power one union official , park chul woo , said his organization , representing 38 , 000 of the company s 46 , 000 employees , objected to a provision that would allow korea s conglomerates to buy up to 15 percent of korea telecom he said the union would insist on a limit of 3 percent he and other labor leaders have said that allowing the conglomerates a strong say in korea telecom would produce widespread layoffs lee sang chul , president of korea telecom , said the unions could not hamper his company s plans , as they had at korea electric power and elsewhere we know that 90 percent of our people will vote for privatization , mr lee said after the presentation at the hotel they want security and jobs several conglomerates were interested in buying significant stakes , he said , but none would get enough to exert control over the company s managers or its board , in which independent directors have a majority korea telecom executives said they expected the sale to succeed because earlier sales in june and december 2001 , which together raised 4 billion , went well they want to complete the new sale , as big as the previous two put together , before the world cup soccer finals begin here may 31 it s the right time for us to complete privatization of korea telecom , the company s chief financial officer , nam joong soo , said the economy is doing well , and we need to privatize to complete the competitiveness of korea telecom we need to be profit driven rather than a public enterprise noting that other big privatizations in south korea have bogged down in controversy and labor opposition , mr nam said , korea telecom is some kind of model for privatization , if we succeed , the government will have the confidence to privatize the others
london when i hear the words post structuralism and semiotics both of which i have taught at university level without quite understanding them i reach for my delete button but simpler terms can be baffling too when theater people claim something is realistic , what do they mean \? i ask this after seeing a comedy in which two grumpy , grumbling irishmen saw and hammer the spines and teeth from some murdered terrorists a celebrated musical that aspires to deal truthfully with war and racism and the manhattanbased theater for a new audience s production of shakespeare s cymbeline , which , after a visit to stratford , england , begins previews on tuesday at the lucille lortel theater in new york , where it opens on jan 20 well , at least there are no problems with cymbeline it s the ultimate piece of anti realism , famously denounced by shaw as stagy trash of the lowest melodramatic order but how are we to categorize martin mcdonagh s lieutenant of inishmore , which contains maybe the most graphic piece of human butchery ever seen on a british stage yet invites us to laugh as we witness it \? what are we to make of the national theater s claim that its production of rodgers and hammerstein s south pacific brings a new realism to a romantic show \? maybe the conclusion is simply that realism has become a hopelessly slippery term since it was invented in 19thcentury france to define works more concerned with showing the world as it is than as it should be take south pacific the musical was first performed in 1949 , only four years after victory against japan and some seven years after the particular conflict the show describes had started to go america s way but hard as trevor nunn may try to ensure that his revival captures the authentic feel of a combat zone in 1943 , there is something that thwarts him the romance undermines the realism when the orchestra first strikes up , and several times afterward , documentary footage of tanks and ships appear on a gauze masking the olivier stage this curtain then sweeps back to reveal a beach teeming with rough , sweaty sailors who noisily sing a rude song about the trader and pimp bloody mary in sheila francisco s tough , wheedling performance not a woman to upset jeeps and an antiaircraft gun trundle along beneath the damaged palm trees on john napier s sandandsky set yet somehow menace , danger and the smell of blood are missing and not , i think , just because the enemy is n't yet within firing range could mr nunn have done more to evoke those things , especially when the show s two heroes , the french planter mile de becque and the american marine joe cable , go spying on japanese troop movements on a nearby island \? maybe so but the basic problems derive from the show s very strengths you can try to fill some enchanted evening with edgy , pleading emotion , as philip quast s mile does , but the song is still irredeemably lush you can pack there is nothing like a dame with testosterone , until it becomes a clattering protest against sexual starvation , as the chorus does on the one occasion that matthew bourne s choreographic skills add power to the proceedings but that and the show s other songs are still glorious hums , setpiece tunes so familiar and irresistible that they subvert any attempt to darken the atmosphere then there s the story itself mr quast s mile is far less glamorous than rossano brazzi in the movie or , by all accounts , ezio pinza on broadway in 1949 he s plump , rumpled , even a bit seedy , and clearly sees lauren kennedy s nurse nellie forbush as a means of rediscovering his youth and you ca n't fairly accuse ms kennedy of being too brittle , clean or toothy , because that s what she s meant to be until experience and the fear of losing mile give her character and performance some depth yet there is no escaping the truth their reconciliation to the cute accompaniment of ditesmoi is a broadway reconciliation sweet , touching , not of a world where men kill and get killed but what should one expect of a broadway show mother courage set to music \? in any case , there is one area in which mr nunn s revival does have some bite , and that s the racial one nellie comes from little rock , ark , and feels far too queasy even to reprise i'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair when she learns that mile has two tots by a polynesian woman conversely , an initially unwilling joe has decided to dump his main line fianc e for bloody mary s pretty tonkinese daughter when his death conveniently ensures that marriage and miscegenation ca n't be the result rodgers and hammerstein have been accused of cowardice for failing to pursue that subplot to its logical end , but in their determination to attack prejudice they rode out plenty of criticism , including a southern senator s accusation that the show had an underlying philosophy inspired by moscow mile s riposte to the navy captain who asks him to risk his life for america i know what you are against what are you for \? is a clear enough reference to the nation s failure fully to honor the constitution s promise of equality and then there is cable s bitter ode to hatred you 've got to be taught to be afraid , of people whose eyes are oddly made , and people whose skin is a different shade you 've got to be carefully taught
the yankees continue to insist that mariano rivera s strained right shoulder is not a longterm concern but the shortterm problem is taking longer and longer to resolve , and the club placed rivera on the disabled list for the third time yesterday rivera missed 14 games in june with a groin injury , then missed 15 games , from july 21 to aug 7 , with the shoulder strain this time the yankees put him on the disabled list effective last friday , the day after his last outing , so he cannot be activated before aug 31 it will almost surely take longer for rivera to return he saved two games in kansas city last week but did not pitch in the next three games in seattle general manager brian cashman said rivera was deliberately held out of the seattle games because of his difficulty getting loose when throwing off a mound a magnetic resonance imaging test yesterday showed the same muscle strain , the team said it s an issue that s resolvable , because it s just a muscle strain , cashman said in the last goround , between rehab and postrehab , the timing was n't right so we 'll see how it goes i 've been asked if i'm worrying about the long term or whether he s going to need surgery in the winter none of those things are on our radar screen shoulder pain caused rivera to leave a game on july 20 , and when he tried to throw on flat ground a few days later , he felt more pain and was put on the disabled list a cortisone injection in the shoulder helped now , rivera can throw on flat ground with no problem , a sign to cashman that the shoulder has improved there will be no more cortisone shots , cashman said , and rivera will be prohibited from throwing for 10 days he will eventually report to tampa , fla , for rehabilitation , but cashman said no more medical tests were planned as during rivera s other absences , the yankees will rely on ramiro mendoza , mike stanton and steve karsay for lateinning relief while some veteran relievers have gotten through waivers , cashman said he was still not seeking any trades in fact , cashman pointed to jeff weaver as a strong addition to the bullpen weaver , normally a starter , has allowed only two earned runs in 11 1 3 innings of relief he s shown he can do both and do it with authority , cashman said he s a force , as well we have coverage , but obviously , we 're at our best with mariano rivera converted all three of his save opportunities since he last returned from the disabled list he has 27 saves in 31 chances this season and has a 285 earned run average pitcher mike thurman was recalled
washington , jan 29 president bush told americans tonight that our war against terror is only beginning and sent new warnings to terrorists around the world and to three nations iran , iraq and north korea using unusually strong language , he charged that states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil , choosing a word once used to describe the alliance of germany , italy and japan during world war ii in his first state of the union address , mr bush seemed to be outlining a rationale for future action , if he deems it necessary , not only against terrorists but against any hostile states developing weapons of mass destruction the president stressed the need to act quickly , when the country and the world are united against terrorism and the nations that support it we will be deliberate , yet time is not on our side , he said i will not wait on events , while dangers gather i will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer the united states of america will not permit the world s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world s most destructive weapons in haunting words of warning , mr bush said american intelligence now believed that tens of thousands of potential terrorists have been trained by al qaeda in afghanistan since 1996 and are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs set to go off without warning transcript , page a22 mr bush vowed to use the national unity forged by the war against terrorism toward the twin causes of creating jobs for those worst hit by the recession and promoting a spirit of national service he offered few words of optimism about america s economic outlook , sounding more cautious about the prospects for a turnaround than the federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , did in an appearance before congress on thursday the president appeared both vigorous and confident tonight gone were the deep lines that marked his face during the first month after the attacks more comfortable than ever in the formal setting of the house , he was mostly free of the verbal stumbles that sometimes mark his speech , and he struck tones of deep passion when he talked of the war , its victims and its effects on the national soul mr bush filled the spectator seats with heroes and widows of the sept 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath , symbols of an america that he asserted was already prevailing over its enemies he described a country made stronger by tragedy those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them , he said and he called on all adults to devote two years or 4 , 000 hours of their lives to volunteer activities he talked of an expanded peace corps and a new usa freedom corps , an umbrella organization that will gather existing public service organizations with new ones intended to help guard american shores and rebuild blighted cities but mr bush s calls for lower taxes , expanded trade and new energy production seemed to pale next to the emotional center of his speech , a celebration of america s slow recovery from sept 11 he expanded his definition of america s immediate defensive goals , saying he would soon deal with countries that make the nuclear and biological weapons that terrorists covet he vowed that their efforts to develop nuclear and biological weapons would be stopped disclosing new american intelligence findings , mr bush said that in digging through al qaeda s hideouts , we have found diagrams of american nuclear power plants and public water facilities , along with instructions for manufacturing chemical weapons and maps of major american cities and their landmarks a senior intelligence official , reached after the speech tonight , said the documents came from al qaeda homes and caves in afghanistan , but the official would not talk about when they were acquired or what cities or plants appeared on the diagrams despite the chilling discovery , mr bush tried , mostly through symbolism , to convey the sense that the united states now understands its enemy and feels a new confidence vice president dick cheney sat behind him , making tonight the first time the men have appeared together at a state event since the terrorist attacks and sitting with laura bush were an array of men and women who symbolized the battle , including shannon spann , the widow of the cia officer killed in afghanistan , and the two flight attendants , cristina jones and hermis moutardier , who helped seize a terrorist suspect on a flight from paris before he could light explosives in his shoes but there were subjects mr bush avoided he never uttered the name osama bin laden , who has eluded capture and remains the subject of an intense manhunt but is also a symbol of what remains incomplete in mr bush s campaign in afghanistan nor did he mention the enron corporation , the collapsing energy concern once run by one of mr bush s biggest political supporters , kenneth l lay instead , he talked of the need to revise pension laws so that workers who save all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails and he called for stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements that would make corporations more accountable to employees and shareholders subjects that mr bush never talked about in his past addresses to the country or in his presidential campaign in the democratic party s response , representative richard a gephardt , the minority leader , was far more specific about enron and its many political connections mr bush did not mention the dispute over how to deal with al qaeda and taliban fighters held in guant namo bay , which has divided his administration
shanghai a washington state agriculture official who was touring china a few years ago handed out bright green baseball caps at every stop without noticing that none of the men would put them on or that all the women were giggling finally , a chineseamerican in the delegation took the man aside and informed him that to wear a green hat is the chinese symbol of a cuckold it is the bane of the business traveler in an unfamiliar culture making a comment or gesture that is meant to be friendly but that offends or embarrasses the hosts mocking a man s masculinity is only one of the inadvertent slights that visiting corporate executives and government officials can make in china that serve to emphasize the cultural gaps they are trying hard to minimize happily , such crosscultural faux pas are no longer deal killers globalization has narrowed the cultural divide , and these days the chinese are experienced enough in dealing with foreigners to shrug off indiscretions even stabbing chopsticks into a bowl of rice and leaving them there \( an act of hostility among chinese because it signifies death \) would be laughed off \( nervously \) by locals unless it was done with obvious intent what really matters is a friendly attitude and a patient manner even so , the worst gaffes still leave a bad impression and the right gestures still earn respect one rule of thumb is understand the chinese worldview don st pierre jr , who has spent his adult life doing business in china , recalls a canadian winemaker telling chinese reporters in shanghai that he expected his ultrapremium wine to do well in china because it had done well in japan and the two cultures had so much in common resentment of japan runs very deep in china , particularly in shanghai , which was bombed and occupied by the japanese during world war ii the chinese regard japan s culture as derivative of their own far more ancient traditions and bristle at japanese notions of superiority mr st pierre nudged the winemaker beneath the table , but by the time the man had stopped speaking , the room was quiet enough to hear a champagne bubble burst the damage had been done , mr st pierre said , even though the winemaker had hired an expensive international public relations firm to brief him on what he should and should not say which shows how useful that advice can be , mr st pierre added duncan clark , a consultant based in beijing , says locally hired secretaries are generally a better first line of defense for multinationals he recalled that during his days at morgan stanley in hong kong the firm ordered expensive clocks to give as gifts commemorating the closing of a deal the firm s local staff caught the mistake to give a clock in chinese sounds the same as seeing someone off to his end with thousands of years of accumulated cultural snippets to sift through , an outsider cannot hope to catch every potential pitfall the chinese language is filled with embarrassing puns and unlucky homonyms that at best can cause snickers behind a foreigner s back besides clocks , giving umbrellas is taboo because doing so is homonymous with a phrase that means the person s family will be dispersed books , too , are unlucky presents because giving a book sounds the same as delivering defeat china s many dialects multiply the risks shanghai natives chuckle at va bene , an expensive italian restaurant that recently opened in town , because the italian name meaning it goes well sounds like shanghainese for not cheap color is another cue that can send an unintended message one multinational company giving gifts from tiffany replaced the white ribbons on the famous jeweler s robin segg blue boxes with red ribbons after the company s shanghai employees pointed out that white in china signifies death , while red is lucky and is used for celebrations picking numbers for everything from product prices to telephones is also tricky avoid four , a homonym for death in chinese , and load up on eights , a number that is pronounced the same as making money in the southern cantonese dialect but even an experienced sinologist like mr clark was mystified when his beijing workers objected to pricing a product at 250 yuan it turned out that in northern china , calling someone 250 is to say the person is nuts mr clark s confusion illustrates the regional diversity of cultural quirks in a country as big as china in the south , people tap two fingers on the table to say thanks , but people in the north might think the gesture is just a nervous tic on the other hand , a few generalizations apply across asia most seasoned business travelers from the united states and europe caught on long ago to the tradition of indulging in small talk and meandering toward the main point rather than getting down to business right away they have also come to appreciate the importance of face in asian societies scott seligman , author of chinese business etiquette a guide to protocol , manners , and culture in the people s republic of china \( warner books , 1999 \) , says face is the most important concept for foreigners in china to master it s not that we do n't have a concept of face , but the chinese raise face to high art , he said it s a fragile commodity in china that can easily be lost a person who has lost face , meanwhile , will often retaliate in unexpected , often passive ways the trigger does n't have to be extreme , mr seligman noted you can contradict somebody in front of someone who is lower ranking and cause the person to lose face even the simple act of saying no to somebody can make that person lose face journalists are not immune this reporter once made a gaffe by suggesting in a way intended to be complimentary that a central government official across the table was probably too young to remember some minor event in the past in the context in which it was said , ageobsessed americans would have taken the comment as a flattering suggestion that they looked too young to remember whatever historical reference was being made but in china , where age is revered , the comment made the official and his entourage blanch , apparently wondering whether it was a veiled insult suggesting the man was too junior to warrant respect bob kapp , president of the uschina business council , says his advice on how to avoid blunders in china has not changed in 30 years be modest in demeanor listen well preach little , he says watch how others do things and follow suit photos in parts of china , lowering the rim of your glass when clinking a toast

samuel pepys the unequalled self by claire tomalin illustrated 470 pp new york alfred a knopf 30 who remembers samuel pepys anymore \? of all the dead white males who used to throng the anthologies and the english lit syllabus , pepys \( 16331703 \) is now among the deadest , relegated to footnotes and to trivia questions about the correct pronunciation of his name \( it rhymes with cheeps \) in today s literary climate , there are lots of reasons for benching pepys he was a political chameleon , nasty to the servants , and a serial groper and philanderer but the most compelling may be that he s such an anomaly he comes out of nowhere writing only for himself , in a form of his own invention and he does n't lead anywhere either by the time his work was discovered , a century later , he was a curiosity but not an influence yet the decline in pepys s reputation only makes claire tomalin s engaging new biography all the more remarkable she not only brings him back to vibrant life , but makes a powerful case that he s more central , more relevant , than we ever imagined pepys had two great accomplishments he was the creator , in effect , of the modern british navy , and to this day naval historians so revere him that they regard the other pepys , the literary one , as an embarrassment and a distraction he was also a compulsive diarist starting on new year s day in 1660 \( when he was 26 \) , he faithfully wrote down , in a shorthand code , a daybyday account of everything he saw , felt or heard for the next nine years the completed diary fills six 282page notebooks it s the longest , most personal account we have of life in the 17th century , and also an invaluable eyewitness account of some of the most seismic events in english history the restoration \( pepys was in the boat that went to fetch charles ii from the netherlands \) , the plague of 1665 , the great fire the following year and the dutch raids the year after that bracketing the diary are the years of the civil war and the protectorate \( pepys as a schoolboy watched the king s execution \) and , later , the glorious revolution of 1688 , during which pepys , who remained a staunch jacobite , was briefly imprisoned on suspicion of treason few literary figures have lived through more interesting , or more treacherous , times pepys , as tomalin points out , was hardly the first person to write a diary , but most earlier diaries were written for a specific purpose usually religious \( as an aid to spiritual bookkeeping \) or to record travel and sightseeing it s not really clear what prompted pepys to begin his diary , unless it was just a vague intimation that he was living on the eve of great events , but the diary quickly became its own purpose and justification pepys kept track of everything his assignations , his finances , his business deals , his conversations with the king \( and erotic dreams about the queen \) , his hangovers , his bowel movements and ejaculations , his fears and hopes and imaginings , his frequent tiffs with his wife borrowing a phrase from robert louis stevenson \( who read the diary after it was decoded and published in close to a full version in 1879 \) , tomalin subtitles her book the unequalled self , and suggests that over the course of the diary we can watch the evolution of something like a modern version of selfhood this is certainly true in the sense that pepys held nothing back , but he s also the least reflective and selfconscious diarist imaginable we get none of the soulsearching , the selfexamination the sense of a personality under construction that turns up , say , in boswell s journals , just a generation or two later there s something almost childlike in pepys s essential selfdelight and in his undifferentiated avidity for experience nor is pepys a particularly great prose stylist , certainly not by 17thcentury standards , which prized cleverness and ornament the diary contains numerous set pieces such as the descriptions of the coronation of charles ii \( where pepys got so drunk he passed out and woke up in his own spew \) , of the fire and the plague which he clearly took some time and trouble over but there are great stretches that are written in , well , diaryese up early and to work away to my lord soandso s dine with sir suchandsuch conversation with mr somebody or other was mighty merry and so on , until at the end of a long day he closes with his trademark phrase and so to bed except for tomalin and the pepys professionals , it s safe to say , few people recently have read all six volumes straight through \( if you want to try , they 're on the internet , as part of the gutenberg project there is also a convenient abridgment , edited by robert latham \) for a long time , the sexy bits were expurgated , and most of them turn out to have been written in a kind of codewithinthecode , a pidgin of french , latin and spanish that today reads like the fevered jottings of a horny and nerdy high schooler \( pepys was raised as a puritan , we need to remember \) here he is on nov 16 , 1667 , talking about riding with a servant girl in a coach , and how after great effort he succeeded in making her tener mi cosa in her mano while mi mano was sobra su pectus , and so did hazer with great delight elsewhere he is always trying to toca someone s jupes or thighs , or else attempting to poner his main someplace it does n't belong , as on the awful day when his wife found him feeling up her maid i was at a wonderful loss upon it , pepys wrote , and the girl also
funny how quickly things can change on broadway when the tony nominations were announced less than a month ago , the expectation was that this could easily be one of the most competitive seasons in recent memory , chock full of tooclosetocall races , including the biggest prize of all best musical that was then in the last week , a strong consensus has formed as to who will win come sunday night at 8 , when broadway s elite will gather at radio city music hall to hand out some precious silverplated tchotchkes and draw the curtain on the 20012 season an informal poll of nearly two dozen tony voters reveals , for example , that the anticipated horse race between thoroughly modern millie and urinetown may well be a case of divvying up the awards best musical to millie , best book and score to urinetown \( how it s possible to have the best words and best songs but not the best show is mindboggling , but that s broadway \) similar logic also seems to be in evidence in the race for best play , where many voters say they expect the goat , or who is sylvia \? to prevail , but will give a nod to metamorphoses by giving its director , mary zimmerman , the prize for direction there are also clear favorites in the four leading acting categories , and most of the featured categories as well \( the race for featured actress in a musical is the notable exception \) still , despite the waning suspense , there will be much to celebrate on sunday night there are 33 broadway productions currently playing , and ticket sales for most are at least healthy the league of american theaters and producers reports that the total take for the 20012 season is 6434 million , off from last year \( 6662 million \) , to be sure , but a remarkable accomplishment considering that after sept 11 , some speculated that the entire industry would collapse there are also several races that are still completely up in the air , including both play revival and musical revival the broadcast should also offer some memorable moments not related to the awards there will be a salute to richard rodgers , whose estate is celebrating his centenary , and an ample dappling of celebrities , including presenters like whoopi goldberg , hugh jackman , mary tyler moore , ralph fiennes , liam neeson , harry connick jr and natasha richardson ny1 , the cable television station , will offer oscarstyle redcarpet interviews as theatrical dignitaries arrive at 7 \( the first hour of the actual awards , at 8 eastern time , will be shown on pbs the remaining two hours by cbs \) the hosts are bernadette peters and gregory hines , two broadway pros at the very least , expect some laughs from elaine stritch , who , after nearly five decades as a broadway baby , will almost certainly win a tony for her onewoman show in the special theatrical event category and will more than likely have to be dragged offstage before her speech is done \( her address at the drama critics circle award ceremony was 20 minutes long \) despite the heavy favorites , there is also the equally strong possibility that all of the tony prognosticators , pundits and poobahs are wrong , and that sunday night may have more surprises than a truck full of cracker jacks at the very least , it will be more suspenseful than last year , when a little show called the producers won a record 12 awards compared with that , the 2002 tonys should be a nailbiter early awards the first hour of the tonys is widely considered the most artful portion of the telecast , featuring extended prerecorded segments examining the making and the makers of broadway shows between those episodes , some awards are handed out according to the sampling of tony voters , the early part of the evening is likely to feature some happy moments for the youthful creators of urinetown and the show s equally youthful producers , who brought the musical from its humble beginnings at the 1999 new york international fringe festival to its current home on broadway the current wisdom is that urinetown , a satirical tale of a group of waterparched urbanites in the grip of a totalitarian water monopoly , will win the awards for best book \( by greg kotis \) as well as best score \( by mark hollmann , with lyrics by mr hollmann and mr kotis \) its main competition in both categories is thoroughly modern millie , with a book by richard morris and dick scanlan , and a score by jeanine tesori and lyrics by mr scanlan \( millie is based on a 1967 movie of the same title , about a flapper s fox trot through 1920 s manhattan \) but the consensus is that the creators of millie will have to wait till nearly 11 about the time they announce best musical to get their party started you have to reward 'urinetown' because it s not going to pull off best musical , said one voter , who , like all those polled , spoke only on condition of anonymity so you give them book and score , which they deserve anyway the best races of the first hour are in the design and director categories last year , producers people won all three design categories as part of that night s juggernaut this time , the largesse should be spread around a bit
tokyo , july 24 the last few months have been open season on conglomerates with major media interests , as companies like aol time warner , vivendi and the kirch group have by turns come under fire for poor results , heavy debt loads and strategic blunders but the sony corporation , one of the original media synergy conglomerates , has not been in the cross hairs to be sure , sales have weakened and its stock has suffered down 70 percent from its peak in 2000 but sony managed to avoid being caught up in the waves of scandals , lawsuits , resignations and boardroom revolts that have plagued american and european rivals until now , that is last week sony , which combines japan s largest electronics manufacturing business with a cluster of entertainment properties , found itself accused in the media of the kinds of accounting irregularities that have brought down other prominent companies treating some ordinary expenses as capital costs and managing earnings using a secret reserve fund the company dismissed the accusations , reported in an article in the south china morning post , as groundless , and no evidence of wrongdoing has since surfaced but sony s stock fell sharply all the same , clearly suggesting that investors are dubious about sony s success in weaving hardware and software businesses into more than the sum of their parts analysts have had their doubts from the beginning , when sony bought a music label and movie studio in the late 1980 s their questions about what an electronics maker knew about running a hollywood studio profitably were borne out in the billions of dollars in losses that sony s movie division racked up over the next few years eventually sony turned the unit around , but the company lost a lot of momentum in the process in truth , sony has not had any better luck than aol time warner or the others at getting diverse hardware and software businesses to mesh sony s vast empire now encompasses televisions and tv shows , movies and theaters , cd players and cd s , game consoles and games , and even a bank , yet analysts have trouble quantifying how owning any of these businesses helps any other make money sony s original goal of using recorded entertainment to drive sales of more electronic gadgets has been rendered obsolete by the internet but though sony now appears committed to using the internet to distribute its media wares , it has yet to figure out how to do it profitably sony does not use the word synergy' these days , said hiroshi takada , who covers the company for j p morgan securities in tokyo sony s dream has not changed , but the source of the profits has broadband has arrived , but it s hard to know how to make money off it none of this is to say that sony is in anything like the financial straits of a vivendi , say one of only a handful of japanese companies that issues quarterly earnings reports , sony is expected to report on thursday that it made about 33 billion yen \( 284 million \) in net income for the period ended june 30 it had forecast a small loss it posted a net profit for the year ended march 31 , with gains from favorable currency movements erasing an operating loss its solid core in the electronics and games businesses tends to give sony s results a steadiness that its more volatile media industry rivals lack all three main legs of sony happen to be doing well lately the company s movies , notably spiderman , have had a good recent run at the box office demand for consumer electronics has picked up a bit and playstation 2 game consoles are selling well but analysts say these positive threads are only coincidentally connected there is little evidence , they say , that enthusiasm for spiderman bolstered anything other than movie ticket sales , or that the film s release on dvd did sales of sony s disc players any good its share of a crowded electronics market is not big enough for that likewise , sony does not produce enough films to fill its movie theaters singlehanded , nor does it own enough theaters to make its movies profitable on its own in each business it is just one of many players and must rely on its sister divisions' rivals to thrive the company s defenders often point to games as one major business where software and hardware complement each other the division , which yielded about 70 percent of sony s profits last year , has sold more than 30 million playstation 2 consoles and millions more games to play on them the consoles on their own , though , have been money losers the profit is in the game software and there , too , sony must rely on rival game developers it owns full rights to only about 15 percent of the games it sells , and pays royalties to outside developers on the rest one area where sony has clearly made its diverse businesses start working together is in marketing , where , for example , the spiderman character can be used in advertising campaigns to promote sony tv s and the like but it is very hard to put a number on the payoff for sony if you can mix the brand with movies and music , i can see a savings in crossmarketing , said richard chu , an analyst at ing barings securities in tokyo but it is almost impossible to calculate , because we do n't know what the original ad budgets were people are still waiting to see the real synergies between hardware and software the strategy long ago wore out its welcome with some investors , who have called repeatedly for sony to sell its less profitable divisions rather than keep struggling to integrate them the argument dates back at least to 1995 , when sony s archrival , matsushita electric industrial , abandoned its own foray into software synergy and sold its stake in mca universal studios after racking up huge debts it may have been arrogant of us to believe we could control hollywood as an outsider , one executive said of the japanese experience in california sony s chairman , nobuyuki idei , has replaced the original management team at columbia pictures and has said that he now has won some control over the studio he continually rebuffs suggestions that sony sell it , especially now that it is having a bumper year synergy , though , is another matter it took nearly 10 years since we acquired the different culture , mr idei said recently about the studio , before we started talking positively to each other from the american side of the relationship , the slow integration had more to do with footdragging in tokyo than cultural misunderstanding , executives close to the company said proposals from american executives to merge the united states entertainment assets with the game division or to take sony usa public have been stalled by excess caution and turf battles at sony headquarters , these executives said this has led analysts to wonder whether howard stringer , the chief executive of sony usa , will stay on after his contract expires next year if mr idei is right that the transpacific cultural gap has been bridged , sony may indeed finally be moving closer to its goal of having each part of the company enhance the others' profits various experts say it is more likely , though , that mr idei has simply redefined the goal if sony is successful at providing both hardware and software , said hiroshi kosaka , a professor at keio university who spent more than three decades at toshiba , they will call it synergy' regardless if there is any direct relationship photos spiderman , above , has been a hit for sony , and playstation 2 consoles like the one used at an electronics exposition in may , below , have sold well still , analysts say , sony is a long way from synergy \( photographs by bloomberg news \)
jerusalem , april 30 israel challenged the united nations today by once again blocking a proposed factfinding mission to examine fighting earlier this month in the jenin refugee camp , prompting secretary general kofi annan to consider disbanding the investigative team israeli officials said they preferred the shortterm cost in world opinion of resisting the united nations to the longterm risk of possibly exposing the army to warcrimes trials in what they feared would be a biased investigation as palestinian officials charged a coverup , israel s prime minister , ariel sharon , a former general who has fought in all of israel s wars , invoked his own service as a soldier in declaring that he would protect israel s troops now no effort to doubt us or put us on an international trial will prevail , mr sharon declared he rejected palestinian accusations that war crimes were committed in jenin , saying , we made extraordinary efforts not to harm innocent people to mr sharon and other senior israeli officials , the united nations inquiry is a case of selective investigation , to be followed , they fear , by spurious prosecution why , they ask , does the united nations show no interest in investigating suicide bombings that have killed israelis \? why does it show no interest in investigating israel s charges of ties between yasir arafat and terrorism \? supporters of the inquiry , on the other hand , marveled that the united nations had so far been stymied in its attempt to work inside a refugee camp that is overseen by one of its own agencies , within occupied west bank territory that by treaty is controlled by the governing palestinian authority mr sharon has believed since the united nations created israel 54 years ago that the jewish state would sometimes have to stand alone in a world biased against it , his close associates say his conviction that the jenin operation has been unfairly attacked abroad is widely shared by israelis , and his popularity has rebounded since he ordered israeli forces into the west bank a month ago today he was also banking on support from an ally he has carefully cultivated , president bush israel agreed on sunday to a compromise proposed by president bush to end the armed siege of mr arafat in ramallah partly in the hope that the united states would muffle any united nations criticism , senior israeli officials said but they said mr sharon struck no explicit bargain for american support the united states originated the united nations resolution that set up the factfinding mission in midapril , and gave the inquiry aggressive backing last week but today , in yet another shift by washington , the bush administration offered little more than the wan observation that it could do nothing if mr annan dropped the inquiry we continue to be quite supportive of the idea , said a senior bush administration official but if he decides it is n't worth the trouble , we 're not going to be able to push it on our own american and british officials met in ramallah tonight to work out details for moving six wanted men from mr arafat s besieged compound into a palestinian prison under international guardianship the transfer could take place as soon as wednesday , possibly distracting attention from the fight at the united nations , officials said israel also withdrew its ground forces from hebron , a west bank city south of here that they occupied on monday after palestinian gunmen killed four israelis , including a 5yearold girl , in a nearby settlement mr annan , faced with the latest israeli rejection , was inclined to disband the inquiry team , according to kieran prendergast , undersecretary general for political affairs saeb erekat , the chief palestinian negotiator , appealed to mr annan to stand firm i think this is equivalent to giving sharon the license to do it again , to kill again and to commit slaughter again , he said he said he was consulting with lawyers to see if he could prepare a warcrimes case against israel charges that there was a massacre in the jenin camp have taken on a life of their own , particularly in the arab world we will never forget , and we will never forgive , mr erekat said israel says 23 suicide bombers came from the congested jenin camp it sent troops inside on april 3 in what it called a hunt for the terrorists responsible over the next eight days , israel lost 23 soldiers in housetohouse fighting at least 45 bodies of palestinians have been found so far , most of them apparently men of fighting age palestinian officials have said hundreds of bodies could be buried in rubble left by israeli bulldozers , but excavation so far has not supported those claims today , the group physicians for human rights issued a preliminary forensic assessment of the camp s dead and wounded , raising concerns about the shooting of civilians and blocked access to medical care and calling for an international investigation mr prendergast , the united nations official , said that with every passing day it becomes more difficult to determine what took place on the ground in jenin after meeting today , israel s security cabinet , led by mr sharon , issued a statement saying the united nations had failed to adjust the mission to accommodate israel s concerns as long as these terms have not been met , it will not be possible for the clarification process to begin , the statement read mr annan said he had met israel s concerns israel originally resisted the idea of a factfinding mission but reluctantly agreed to a compromise on april 19 , during a united states maneuver to block a strongly worded arab resolution at the united nations supporting a mission israel s foreign minister , shimon peres , asked mr annan to appoint a mission personally , saying israel had nothing to hide a milder united states resolution was unanimously approved but israeli officials immediately raised objections , saying the people chosen for the mission team lacked military experience and would be inclined to ignore the threat israel felt it faced from jenin on april 24 , israel first announced that it would delay the arrival of the team , which has been waiting in geneva mr peres , who was still seeking a compromise , told israel radio today that he was concerned that the united nations security council might now impose the inquiry on israel we must take into consideration the possibility we will be left entirely on our own , he warned tonight , a caucus of arab nations was drafting a security council resolution demanding that israel immediately cooperate with the factfinding team in bethlehem , 26 palestinian men voluntarily left the church of the nativity today , the largest departure of palestinians from the compound thus far in a siege that is nearly month old the men , looking weary but healthy , emerged at midafternoon and were quickly taken to a nearby israeli military base for identification and questioning none were believed to be militants , and they were all expected to be released soon in the gaza strip , three palestinians , including a 2yearold girl , were killed early wednesday within a span of four hours when israeli troops opened fire on residential areas in the southern town of rafah , palestinian hospital sources told agence francepresse israel said militants had tried to detonate explosives in one incident , forcing them to open fire in hebron , the israeli army said it had arrested 150 palestinians it described as terrorists , including 47 who were on its list of wanted men

no rush , i said but i told her to have something lined up by the end of june with college getting closer , it was time for her to start contributing to her education fund i knew how she felt i worked at my father s dry cleaning business during the summers when i was in high school in connecticut it was across the street from the beach , and all my friends would come over in their bathing suits to use our coke machine i was dying the bureau of labor statistics says 84 million people aged 16 to 19 were employed last summer , up 14 percent from 1991 i bet that a lot of them were pushed into it by parents like me these jobs are part of growing up for many young people , a way to earn money they offer priceless lessons the work ethics you learn as a teen are the work ethics you carry into life , said susan ireland , author of the complete idiot s guide to cool jobs for teens \( alpha books , 2001 \) the idea of working with integrity and thinking of work in a positive way is a valuable experience it will affect the way you perceive work for the rest of your life jeff allen , vice president of aboutjobscom , which owns and operates summerjobscom , a web site geared toward teenagers and college students , said he waited tables and unloaded trains when he was younger you learn the value of money and what it takes to earn money , he said you learn responsibility you learn how the world works all those things made me study a whole lot harder when i was in college i know i did n't want to unload boxcars all my life peter parker , the teenage character who becomes spiderman in the blockbluster movie , jumped into a wrestling ring to earn extra money most teenagers do n't have to go quite that far nicolene durham , 16 , of glastonbury , conn , will work as a counselor at a summer camp in new hampshire this year , the same place she had attended as a camper spencer kennard , 16 , of chatham , mass , landed a job at a home furnishings store owned by the father of his girlfriend mr allen says connections are one of the best ways for teenagers to find jobs web sites like his also have listings , as do many town halls and guidance offices at high schools he said federal and state governments are a great source of jobs so are summer camps summer camp is the best job you can get , he said it s your first time away from home you meet all sorts of people you get to enjoy yourself while you 're working and get paid 800 to 2 , 000 a summer in choosing a job , ms ireland said teenagers should look at their interests , personality traits and favorite subjects at school , for example , and decide how those would come in handy in a job mr allen said teenagers should use their imaginations if you 're really into cars , get a job at a car dealership detailing cars , he said if you love the beach , work at the beach employee perks can also be an attraction when i ask teen girls where they wanted to work , many of them say clothing stores , because they want the discount , ms ireland said before starting work , and depending on the state where they live , teenagers may be required to get employment certificates or to receive age certification , which assures employers that teenagers are the age they say employment certificates are a bit more involved and often require schools , parents and teenagers to sign off on the employment the federal labor department says 42 states require some sort of certification , depending on age requirements differ by state , so it is best to check with the high school or your state s labor department most of this paperwork can be done through the school connecticut , for example , requires an employment certificate for those under 16 and age certification at the ages of 16 and 17 for new jersey and new york , employment certificates are required for anyone under 18 my daughter took her time finding a job , and i nagged her constantly about it i suggested the ice cream parlor , where a friend s son was working i suggested the snack bar at the town beach , where a neighbor s boy had just landed a job \?

morningstar inc , whose ratings of mutual funds have long been potent marketing weapons for funds with good ratings , is changing its system the current system rates funds within four broad areas united states stock funds , international stock funds , taxable bond funds and municipal bond funds the new method , to take effect on june 30 , will measure funds only against those that have similar investment styles this means that some funds with very low returns , or even losses , will receive the coveted fivestar rating if they have performed better than others with similar objectives the immediate effect will be to lower the ratings of some valueoriented funds , because value funds have tended to outperform growthoriented funds over the last two years two years ago , every growth fund looked wonderful , don phillips , the managing director of morningstar , said yesterday after he announced the changes now , none does the new ratings will be based on 48 separate groups of funds , and that number is likely to increase this fall mr phillips said morningstar intended to break up some groups splitting out , for example , funds that short sell shares of stock from general stock funds and separating funds that buy bank loans from shortterm bond funds some of the groups will be very small not considering the different classes of shares issued by some funds , there are just 13 latin america stock funds and 19 japan stock funds but all groups will have funds with ratings across the spectrum , with 10 percent of the funds receiving five stars , and the same percentage receiving the bottom rank of one star twostar and fourstar ratings will go to 225 percent of funds each , and the middle group , three stars , will be given to 35 percent as is now the case , morningstar will assign ratings based on 3year , 5year and 10year performance , with an overall rating based on a combination of the other ratings , to the extent that they are available but under the new system , when a fund changes investment categories for example , when it switches its focus from growth to value the performance data from periods before it changed will be given less weight
atlanta , nov 17 the way the new orleans saints viewed it particularly receiver joe horn the saints and the atlanta falcons do not share a rivalry the saints arrived here with a 72 record they viewed the falcons as pesky wannabes after atlanta smothered new orleans , 2417 , to follow up on a 3735 victory in new orleans on oct 25 , the falcons proved that the saints have reasons for a new , headbanging rivalry atlanta \( 631 \) , which has not lost in six games , has won 13 of the last 16 games against new orleans both teams are in the new national football conference south and figure to tangle with tampa bay \( 82 \) for first place atlanta led by 70 at halftime and by 173 early in the fourth quarter before both teams combined for 21 points in the final 12 minutes the most damaging flurries belonged to atlanta , however , which played a complete game before 70 , 382 merry fans at the georgia dome horn boldly stepped forward afterward and proclaimed it s a rivalry now they whipped us twice they beat us we are 02 against the falcons i'm a man i got pride they whipped us it s robbery now the saints came undone with 2 turnovers and 16 penalties for 133 yards they talked all that trash , atlanta linebacker john thierry said , and did n't even bother to show up the game was scoreless in the first quarter , and then with 9 minutes 3 seconds left before halftime , quarterback michael vick did what he does best make something out of nothing he took a busted play where he was scrambling and waved at receiver trevor gaylor to run a deeper route gaylor was starting for the injured shawn jefferson and made an impression , with 3 catches for 100 yards i saw him wave , gaylor said we 've had a couple of situations this year where mike has scrambled and none of the receivers did enough to get free to help him out he waved i ran i listened and he caught a 74yard touchdown pass that gave atlanta its halftime lead with 6 34 left in the third quarter vick struck again , darting and dashing around right end and shooting himself into the front right corner of the end zone for a 7yard touchdown run that made the score 140 i do n't know if i 've ever seen anyone score on a run like that because there were a lot of missed blocks and he only had a small portion of the end zone to work with , atlanta coach dan reeves said vick , who passed for 160 yards and rushed for 55 , outplayed his cousin aaron brooks , the saints' quarterback brooks was 20 of 31 for 279 yards and 2 touchdowns , with an interception for most of the game , the atlanta linemen and linebackers pursued brooks passionately and always applied more pressure when he attempted to scramble the defense was as tough on running back deuce mcallister he rushed 13 times for only 43 yards after rushing 17 times for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns in the first meeting between the teams mcallister credited the atlanta defense but also said that in the final quarter he was slowed by a right ankle injury the most important thing going in was shutting down mcallister , falcons defensive end patrick kerney said we were able to close up the bubbles where they attacked us with the run the last time we have linebackers who can really run and our linemen can get around pretty good brooks and horn connected on a 57yard scoring pass early in the fourth quarter , but vick answered with a 4yard touchdown pass to tight end alge crumpler with 3 56 remaining a 12yard touchdown pass by brooks to the rookie receiver donte' stallworth ended the scoring with 47 seconds left between the horn and crumpler touchdowns , atlanta cornerback juran bolden intercepted brooks warrick dunn gave atlanta a lift with 26 carries for 90 yards , and the falcons outrushed the saints , 15580 atlanta was penalized 9 times for 70 yards , but that was not nearly as costly as new orleans s penalties after that amazing 3434 tie against pittsburgh last week in which the atlanta defense allowed pittsburgh to come back , today s game was a bright and big moment for the falcons it s exciting for our team to know that we can just make more plays than the other team and that we can just make it happen , vick said we were aggressive reeves added we had to earn the win we needed everything we had i think we earned some respect today we 're growing photo quarterback michael vick passed for two touchdowns and ran for another \( associated press \)
louisville , ky , may 31 like most great horse tales , this one begins in a sales ring , a minor one in ruidoso , nm it turns on a missed opportunity , a lastchance flight to las vegas and involves a craps table , a cowboy hat and a hot tub it might very well end historically on saturday if a colt named war emblem runs off with the belmont stakes to become only the 12th triple crown winner in thoroughbred racing the protagonist is bob baffert , a trainer with snowwhite hair , a penchant for wearing his sunglasses at night and saying whatever comes to mind sometimes what he spouts is funny sometimes it is inappropriate all of it makes him one of the most recognizable and popular figures to casual fans of a majestic sport trying to regain its foothold on a larger audience it also makes those within the horseracing community resentful , suspicious and perhaps a bit conflicted about how they want the mileandahalf belmont to turn out the sport has not had a triple crown winner since affirmed in 1978 and , in war emblem , has a very talented colt with personality to burn and a story made for hollywood but for some , the thought of a colt purchased three weeks before the kentucky derby by a saudi prince and conditioned by a flaky former quarterhorse trainer taking down horse racing s most sacred feat is too much to bear it s almost thought of as blasphemy , explained julian \( buck \) wheat , the longtime director of horseman s relations at churchill downs you 're walking on hallowed grounds and to have some jack leg quarterhorse trainer win the derby and now on the doorstep of history , well , that is n't done in the last six years , baffert , 49 , has won the derby three times , the preakness four times and the belmont once this is his third chance at the triple crown , having come up threequarters of a length short with silver charm in 1997 and a stomachwrenching nostril short with real quiet in 1998 sitting next to his friend wheat in a golf cart parked in the shade on churchill down s backside , baffert acknowledged his precarious place within the industry some setbacks on and off the track in recent years have tempered his combativeness , but he will never understand why the hard boots of kentucky turn up their noses and act as if the jump from quarter horses to thoroughbreds is akin to a doortodoor salesman finding success as a wall street mergersandacquisitions specialist they are intimidated by my success , baffert said i did n't just show up as a walkon back in 1989 i 've done this my whole life , and i 'd tell any young trainer to start in quarter horses because you have to do everything i broke them , rode them , wrapped them and slept with them since i was a boy he may have never shown up at all if it were n't for a quarter horse he let get away for the owner mike pegram at that ruidoso horse sale in the late 1980 s when they underbid on a horse , the two were so disgusted that they wanted to leave town immediately the problem was when they arrived at the el paso airport there was only one flight heading west to las vegas , a city baffert had never been to , and one that pegram , who owns a string of mcdonald s franchises in washington , knew well the pair had a business relationship that got a whole lot closer with a lucrative run at the craps table and a suite with a jacuzzi that baffert enjoyed with a cold beer and his cowboy hat on , as a raucous party whirled around him by then , baffert was becoming bored with the quarter horses , a breed that is more muscular , runs shorter distances usually from 250 to 550 yards and for far less purse money his father , bill , had introduced him to horses growing up on a farm in nogales , nm after graduating from the university of arizona , bob took out a trainer s license and raced his way to the top of the quarterhorse standings baffert told pegram he wanted to make the jump to thoroughbreds as his onetime idol and now rival , d wayne lukas , had , but he needed money and owners pegram was a former college bookie who bought his first mcdonald s in 1975 with 100 percent financing from a banker in his hometown of princeton , ind he understood and gave baffert 300 , 000 and told him to buy some thoroughbreds first of all , i liked the guy , said pegram , who is one of baffert s closest friends second , he had ambition and a tremendous eye for spotting a talented horse no one else needs to like the guy , but you have to respect his horsemanship next to selling hamburgers , giving the money to bob was the smartest investment i ever made when baffert came up with his first good horse , he gave pegram a third of it from his own end thirty slews won the 1 million breeders' cup sprint in 1992 in 1996 , baffert picked out a colt so narrowly built and pitiful looking that pegram asked what s wrong , does he have cancer \? when told he cost just 17 , 000 the colt was real quiet and , after barely losing a triple crown bid , was named 3yearold male champion and earned more than 32 million in purses also for pegram , baffert picked out silverbulletday , the 3yearold filly champion in 1999 , for a bargain 155 , 000 she won 14 of 16 races and more than 28 million in purses the easy part is training a horse the hard part is finding a good one , baffert said i know how to do it there s no maybe in me i either see it or i do n't an eye for style and horses
first the head , now the belly as the recently decapitated ralph cifaretto on the hbo series the sopranos , joe pantoliano , left , was more interested in the shape of the bada bing girls than in his own physique but since he agreed to replace stanley tucci in frankie and johnny in the clair de lune on broadway starting on new year s day , a role that calls for him to spend a considerable amount of time on stage in the altogether , he has become something of a fitness buff i want to look down and see my feet and not my stomach , he said told that one of his castmates on the sopranos , tony sirico , said , i want no part of broadway if i have to see joe nude , mr pantoliano doubled over in laughter but tony was the first in line to go see edie naked , he said , referring to edie falco , who plays the wife of tony soprano , carmela , and is scheduled to be replaced in frankie and johnny by rosie perez he was in the front , with binoculars red sea , meet crimson tide is there an acting role that would intimidate even charlton heston , the man who played moses \? according to tom berenger , and probably a fair share of alabama football fans , playing the coach paul \( bear \) bryant is about as tricky as playing god it s kind of strange , mr berenger said a coach like bryant is godlike , i suppose , he said and it s the old testament god jehovah the walls of jericho , sodom and gomorrah that kind of a god mr berenger , who has played such tough guys as gen james longstreet in gettysburg , teddy roosevelt in rough riders and sergeant barnes in platoon , said none of them were a match for bryant in the junction boys , which is being broadcast all this month on espn , mr berenger portrays the coach as he leads a group of football recruits for texas am , where he coached before moving to alabama , through a brutal training camp in the desolate town of junction , tex , in 1954 more than 100 players started in the camp , roughly 70 quit , and when the season began , bryant was left with only 31 healthy players mr berenger was aware of the risks in accepting the role i was quite aware that people just hated gary busey for doing his movie about the coach , he said of the bear but it was really the audience closest to him that had him the most concerned my wife is from alabama originally , he said she called her mom in alabama and told her , 'tom s playing coach bear bryant' she said , 'oh my god , he s playing the bear ! i 've got to hang up ! i 've got to get on the phone and call everybody' clashing sox and pinstripes in his campaign to become mayor , michael r bloomberg did not shy away from hinting that his baseball heart lay in boston , where he grew up , and not in new york however , george steinbrenner might have found an ally in his effort to persuade the cuban pitcher jos contreras to sign with the yankees instead of the boston red sox i would be happy to help the yankees recruit anybody for new york , the mayor said at a recent party held by espn when asked about his fealty to his old hometown and the belief that he is a red sox fan , mr bloomberg said i never said i was my mother said i was a boston braves fan when i was a kid no one remembers the boston braves , but they were there but i am a new york fan with budget cuts and smoking bans on his plate , the last thing the mayor seems to want to deal with is angry new york baseball fans my costar can whip yours as young boys can attest , there is no end to wondering who would win fake fights staged between fictional characters could the terminator take down rambo \? how would superman fare against the hulk \? when ray liotta was asked who would win in a matchup of his old crew from the movie goodfellas against the new hotshot boys from new jersey on the sopranos , he did n't hesitate i think joe and bob would definitely beat up tony soprano that s for sure he was talking about joe pesci and robert de niro how s that for respect photos
cleveland , feb 7 the other afternoon at st rocco school on this city s gritty west side , the first graders in one classroom were reading aloud from a book about the four food groups while the fifth graders down the hall were rattling off the economic attractions of various american cities that they did so under the portraits of jesus and the virgin mary , on a day in which all of them would be required to pray at mass , was not unusual for a roman catholic school in the united states but what distinguishes st rocco from catholic schools in other parts of the country is that the state of ohio is paying the bulk of the tuition for half of the school s 200 pupils , who are the recipients of vouchers designed to help them and several thousand other children in cleveland flee failing public schools the question of whether such an arrangement amounts to outright government aid to parochial schools and thus violates the constitution s separation of church and state will be taken up by the united states supreme court this month the justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments on feb 20 on the legality of the state s sixyearold tuition voucher program , which is open only to parents in cleveland , where barely a third of public school students graduate from high school a complicating factor that the justices may well consider is this many of the pupils who receive the tuition assistance were already attending parochial or other private schools , raising questions about whether the program is ending up assisting parents who had already found the ways and means to educate their children outside the public schools in the current school year , the state has awarded publicly financed vouchers , worth as much as 2 , 250 , to 4 , 456 students in kindergarten through eighth grade , mostly from families living at or below the poverty low each is permitted to attend 1 of 50 private schools that has agreed to accept them like st rocco , nearly all of those participating schools are affiliated with the catholic church or other religious groups fewer than 1 percent of the pupils in the program are in nonreligious private school in a voucher program in milwaukee , a third of the 10 , 000 participants are enrolled in nonreligious private schools so the cleveland case , by contrast , provides the court with the opportunity to make an unambiguous statement about the constitutionality of a statefinanced program that funnels nearly all of its money , through parents , to religious schools the court will be hearing ohio s appeal of a decision by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit , which found that the program was unconstitutional , ruling that it had the impermissible effect of promoting sectarian schools several years ago , the supreme court declined to hear a challenge to the milwaukee program an endorsement of the ohio program by the supreme court could prompt other states and cities , and perhaps the bush administration , to consider following the lead of cleveland , milwaukee and florida , which has initiated a similar pilot program a negative ruling , if broad enough , could effectively silence the privateschool wing of the socalled school choice movement voucher advocates have had to rely primarily on religious institutions because such schools are usually among the few with tuition low enough to have an incentive to accept the vouchers , which may still be less than what the school normally charges if you look at the voucher conversations that have taken place to date , the constitutional ambiguity has served as a deterrent for states to go the voucher route , said eric hirsch , an education analyst at the national conference of state legislatures , a nonpartisan organization with no position on such programs this case , in clearing up some of these problems , could lead to potential passage of legislation in this area but the cleveland case also gives the court an opportunity to explore whether the ohio voucher program is succeeding in meeting what supporters here and elsewhere cite as its primary mission to provide an escape route for lowincome pupils , especially blacks , mired in an innercity public school system that is among the lowestrated in the nation many of the cleveland families receiving vouchers , which are distributed via lottery , are indeed poor , with a median income of about 20 , 000 annually but an analysis by a private group found that at least 33 percent of the pupils who received the vouchers here in the last school year were already enrolled in parochial or other private schools , and thus had never intended to go to public schools , let alone transfer out of them with the state s help while half of the students who participate in the voucher program are black , the proportion of students in the public school system who are black is closer to three quarters , according to state records , suggesting that blacks may not be applying

low interest rates have been a bonanza for homeowners , but they have hurt investors in real estate investment trusts that own apartment buildings through thursday , shares of apartmentbuilding trusts have fallen 85 percent this year , underperforming the overall market for real estate investment trusts , or reit s , which have risen by 11 percent , according to the national association of real estate investment trusts david m lee , manager of the 114 million t rowe price real estate mutual fund , said he sees the current weakness of apartmentbuilding reit s as a buying opportunity and has been increasing his holdings reit s trade in the same way as stocks they own and operate incomeproducing real estate and are required to pay most of their annual income as dividends for reit s that focus on apartment buildings , low interest rates have been a problem because they have made home ownership more affordable that reduces demand among renters roughly 68 percent of american families own homes , up from 64 percent in 1994 , according to green street advisors , a real estate research firm in newport beach , calif we are at record levels of singlehome ownership and i'm not sure that trend or head wind can get substantially worse , mr lee said vacancies in apartment buildings , meanwhile , have risen to 105 percent this year , from 9 percent at the beginning of 2001 , according to torto wheaton research , based in boston singlefamily housing is eating everybody s lunch , said david shulman , managing director and senior reit analyst at lehman brothers low interest rates have also stimulated construction of apartment buildings , even though demand for apartments has tapered off the demand for apartments in 2001 was negative for the first time ever , said lee schalop , a real estate securities analyst at banc of america securities not only is single family getting all the new households , but it is taking the old ones , too robert w gadsden , manager of alpine realty income and growth , a mutual fund , said apartmentbuilding reit s were not likely to perform well in the short term none of these issues are abating interest rates are low , jobs are being cut , new supply continues we really need to see the economy improve mr lee said he believes that the sector will rebound gradually after the economy improves as of the end of september , his biggest holdings of apartmentbuilding reit s included equity residential , based in chicago , and avalonbay communities , based in alexandria , va timothy j pire , managing director at heitman real estate securities and comanager of the 100 million pbhg reit mutual fund , prefers apartmentbuilding reit s geared to middleincome residents the middle of the market apartments rent more by necessity , and you probably wo n't lose them to the singlefamily homes , mr pire said a favorite is united dominion realty trust , based in richmond , va it holds a national portfolio of middleincome properties , with some exposure to washington , a market that he said had held up better than many regions during the downturn on the other hand , several analysts said they were concerned about reit s with holdings in the southeast , particularly in atlanta mr shulman cited post properties , based in atlanta , and gables residential trust , based in boca raton , fla declining occupancy and rents have depressed post s funds from operations , a commonly used measure of reit financial strength , he said the company said last week that its funds from operations dropped by 275 percent in the third quarter , versus the period last year mr gadsden said post s shares , down 299 percent this year , are trading well below book value , making them attractive last week , gables reported a 10 percent increase in funds from operations for the third quarter , versus the period a year earlier marvin r banks jr , the chief financial officer of gables , said its properties are diversified houston , the site of its largest holdings , has been a strong market this year , he said , with rents up more than 5 percent he added that rentals to corporate customers and revenue from management of apartments not owned by gables have been strong still , mr shulman said that he is concerned that southern markets will not have a speedy recovery and that gables may need to finance its dividends by selling properties mr banks said that even if some shortterm factors were troubling , longterm trends favored the sector through 2020 , census estimates show that the number of new renters will surge as baby boomers' children hit their peak renting years , he said during the last 12 months , we 've been at this low point that has coincided with a recession and low mortgage rates , so if your holding period is three months , reit s are not where you should be , but if it s 12 months or beyond , it s a safe bet , mr banks said

waco , tex , aug 13 president bush said today that he was optimistic about the longterm health of the beleaguered american economy as he heard from a selection of 240 carefully chosen guests who praised his policies at an economic forum created to showcase his concerns i think one of the things you 'll hear is that even though times are kind of tough right now , that we 're america , mr bush said at the threehour forum at baylor university , a short helicopter ride from his ranch , where the president is on what the white house calls a working vacation for most of the month we 've got the hardestworking people in the world we 've got the best tax policy in the world i mean , we got a lot going for us the president offered no new programs or ideas to repair the economy , although he did choose the literal center stage of the forum to announce that he would not release 51 billion in emergency spending requested by congress to fight terrorism , saying he wanted to move toward a balanced budget as soon as possible we 'll spend none of it , mr bush said the money represents a minuscule part of the government s 21 trillion annual budget , and administration officials said the action was a signal that the administration that has plunged back into deficits could crack down on spending even as mr bush expressed confidence in the economy and defended his policies , the federal reserve issued a more pessimistic assessment it said the decline in the stock market s and disclosures of corporate wrongdoing had prolonged a sharp slowdown that might require it to cut interest rates further stock prices fell after the announcement , with the dow jones industrial average dropping 20643 to close at 8 , 48246 page c1 mr bush heard no dissent and no debate at an event where the theme was that the economy was going through difficulty , but that things were headed in the right direction the forum has been heavily criticized by the democrats and a number of republicans as a staged pep rally for the second bush white house , which is ever mindful of the fate of mr bush s father former president bush was enormously popular after the persian gulf war but lost the 1992 election in large part because of voters' perceptions that he no longer had control of the economy most of the eight participants who spoke at a closing session of the forum echoed support for the president s agenda , including tax cuts and the proposed energy bill and , in some cases , reflected his phrasing from recent speeches seven participants three blacks , two hispanic speakers and two white women mirrored the political concerns of the white house in the presidential campaign of 2004 , when mr bush will reach out to minority groups and women in an effort to expand support the thing we all agreed about was that those tax cuts should not be temporary , said phyllis hill slater , owner of an engineering and architectural services company , hill slater inc , in floral park , ny they should be permanent ms slater , who is black , enthusiastically praised mr bush , saying , i'm so glad to see you 're on track karl rove , the president s chief political adviser , said after the forum that he was not aware that the white house had supplied the participants talking points , but that s not to say there were n't any other participants spoke up for favorite republican concerns one said the estate should be permanently repealed another who called for limits on medical malpractice suits , an issue that mr bush campaigned for last week in mississippi some participants , coming from nearly 40 states and including executives , economists , students , union leaders , professors , owners of small businesses and a sprinkling of democrats , did sound concerns to mr bush the bear market that we 're suffering right now is probably one of the worst i have ever gone through , and that s not a comfortable place to be , charles schwab , chairman and cochief executive of the charles schwab corporation , said in a panel on small investors and retirement security mr schwab , whose company manages eight million individual accounts , totaling 800 billion in assets , also told the president that the confidence of american investors was at a very fragile point while mr schwab was at the forum , his company announced that it was eliminating nearly 400 jobs simultaneously , american airlines , the world s biggest airline , said it would lay off 7 , 000 workers democrats immediately attacked the event as a public relations extravaganza put on by a white house seriously worried about how the economy will affect the president s political future representative richard a gephardt , the missouri democrat who is the house minority leader , called it a onesided affirmation of a failed economic policy senator tom daschle , the south dakota democrat who is the senate majority leader , said it was a made for tv forum some republicans criticized it as well william beach , chief economist at the heritage foundation , a conservative research and advocacy group in washington , said the main purpose of the gathering was to shore up shaky public confidence these are frightened people , mr beach said , and i think that is the main reason for having this fairly meaningless conference treasury secretary paul h o'neill , one of seven cabinet members on hand , said the participants had not been told what to say i did n't prompt anything nothing , mr o'neill said when a reporter pointed out that the white house had invited the participants , mr o'neill broke in and said you know , give me a break frank raines was here mr raines , chief executive of fannie mae , was budget director under president bill clinton mr o'neill added that as much as you want to say this was cooked up , this had high energy
a northeaster battered the east coast yesterday with sleet , freezing rain and snow that closed airports and major highways and gave new york city its whitest christmas since 1909 it was not what irving berlin had in mind it was wet , slippery and dangerous whipping winds and icy slime shut down the city s two airports , made traveling by car perilous and kept people who were planning to venture out for a holiday meal holed up at home as of midnight , 5 inches of snow had fallen on central park , the only significant snow on christmas inside the city since 1969 , when 21 inches fell that made it the first official white christmas defined by meteorologists as a dec 25 with one inch on the ground in 33 years the only other new york city white christmas of the 20th century came in 1909 , when seven inches fell , according to todd miner , a meteorologist at pennsylvania state university there have been dustings and traces , to use the technical terms , in the city on several christmases past , and some new yorkers may be positive that they have , in fact , frolicked through many a white christmas in the 1970 s , 1980 s and 1990 s the unusual holiday snowfall came as the storm pounded much of the northeast , turning from icy rain and sleet into snow in the late afternoon , as temperatures fell below freezing by the time the snow started tapering off late last night , records for christmas day had been set in buffalo and other parts of upstate new york that reported more than two feet of snow officials were forced to close a 100mile stretch of the new york state thruway from syracuse to amsterdam , near albany around the city , the snowfall was heaviest in the suburbs , with 92 inches reported in valley stream on long island as of 9 30 pm and similar amounts north of the city today s forecast called for windy and sunny weather , with highs in the mid30 s once the snow began yesterday afternoon , it fell at a furious pace at least two inches an hour and it was met with a mixture of delight and misery for anyone trying to travel or work on the holiday , there was the unpleasantness of having snow spraying into their faces , or their shoes sliding across the sidewalk , their cars trundling slowly across slippery , unplowed roads or their flights delayed or canceled life is very miserable , said mutfar rasman , 54 , a bangladeshi immigrant who was pumping gas at a sunoco station in the van cortlandt section of the bronx late yesterday , as the snow , which had soaked his gloves so much that he finally removed them , began to fall faster and faster it might be good for americans , but for me , it s very difficult there was a clear difference of opinion across the region yesterday as to whether snow on christmas the kind of snow that fell yesterday , anyway was something to cherish or something to curse for juan carlos alvarez , 34 , who moved to manhattan from miami six months ago , the notion of a white christmas made him giddy yeah , snow it s perfect , he shouted into his cellphone yesterday , as he stood in rockefeller center and chatted with a friend in utah while the snow began to fall i could n't have planned it any better this is christmas in new york , right \? that s what it s all about earlier yesterday , the city sanitation department deployed 500 workers and 359 salt spreaders , officials said but they did not start plowing the roads until about 4 pm , after waiting for at least an inch to an inch and a half to accumulate vito turso , a spokesman for the department , said the city reacted right according to plan , with 1 , 000 pieces of equipment out on the streets by about 9 pm , including salt spreaders and dump trucks , and a total of 1 , 600 workers deployed overnight to clear the streets after being closed for about four hours , runways at la guardia airport reopened at 10 pm , and runways at kennedy reopened at 11 30 pmalan hicks , a spokesman for the port authority of new york and new jersey , said that flights were expected to depart through the night , to make up for lost time he said that christmas was not a heavy travel day newark liberty international airport remained open , although flights were delayed for up to two hours many of those who had planned to fly wished they had not at the spirit airlines checkin counter at la guardia yesterday evening , an argument between irate passengers and airline employees , some wearing cheerful red santa caps , became so heated that someone summoned police at the airport one of the angry passengers was chelsea rudder , 19 , a student at pace university who had planned to fly to detroit for a family gathering my christmas is ruined , said ms rudder , dressed in a festive red furtrimmed coat among waiting passengers , a 4yearold girl slept on the floor , using her mother s black coat as a blanket adults slept on rocking chairs set in front of windows , which looked out on snowplows and tractors an information clerk asked earnestly whether information was needed , and a man lugging two duffel bags snapped , i need something , and it ai n't information at kennedy , american airlines flight 2 from los angeles landed safely about 5 30 pm , but the plane was stuck on the runway until about 11 pm , said andrew schneider , 31 , a passenger passengers kept their tempers under control
frankfurt , nov 8 klauspeter m ller has what may be the worst job in german banking commerzbank , where mr m ller has spent most of his career and is now the chairman , has virtually every symptom of the multiple ills that afflict germany s banking system the malaise runs so deep that when an unknown 24yearold credit analyst at merrill lynch mused in a leaked email message that commerzbank faced a cash shortage , it was enough to set off a panic that the bank , germany s fourth largest , might collapse yet mr m ller , a blunt , bantamsize d sseldorfer who spent the formative part of his career in new york , is not moping i'm having fun , i swear to you , he said in an interview in his 48thfloor office at the bank s mistshrouded headquarters here if you ever get on a rocky ship , you should have someone like me on board next week , commerzbank will report thirdquarter results , which most analysts expect will show a loss it is also expected to disclose plans to lay off as many as 1 , 500 employees , including one of every four people in its investment banking division , in an effort to slice 495 million out of its 54 billion in annual costs this is the latest round in a grueling costcutting regime that is transforming a sprawling global institution into a smaller , more domestically focused bank but while mr m ller said the harsh medicine would put commerzbank back in the black , its longterm prospects remain gray germany , the economic sick man of europe , has many more banks and local branches than it needs it has not updated its banking laws since world war ii and its lenders with global ambitions are hemmed in by fierce local competitors as a result , banking here has become a handtomouth business we 're one of the few countries in the world which still has a banking system of this kind , mr m ller said it s outdated , it is oldfashioned and it does not offer a level playing field the biggest trouble is that german retail banking is dominated by savings institutions and cooperatives owned by cities and states , which are run on a less commercial basis than their publicly traded rivals this creates a fragmented industry , in which even the biggest banks are minnows commerzbank , with 750 branches , has barely 2 percent of the total branches in germany together , the five largest banks account for only about 10 percent of germany s 54 , 000 banking establishments opportunities to expand are cramped because so much of the industry is in public hands as a result , commerzbank has not been able to match the growth of european rivals like barclays , which has 12 percent of all branches in britain , or bnp paribas , which has 9 percent of the french market we do not need thousands of coop banks we do not need hundreds of savings banks , mr m ller said what i would like to see is what has happened in every other country a chance to consolidate none of these impediments mattered much when times were flush with a buoyant german economy and frankfurt s designation as the home of the european central bank , the big banks were thinking globally like its crosstown rivals , deutsche bank and dresdner bank , commerzbank expanded aggressively outside its home market , and into activities beyond commercial banking it bought jupiter , a leading british asset management firm , as well as the asset management arm of montgomery securities in san francisco it spent millions to build an investment banking operation from scratch , with highpriced bankers in new york , london , and tokyo commerzbank hired norman foster , the celebrated british architect , to design a dramatic 50story headquarters building in frankfurt it is europe s tallest skyscraper and features garden terraces planted with exotic trees they had a good life for many , many years , said fred b irwin , a vice president at citibank in frankfurt but germany is overbanked , and when revenues dropped , their high cost base was exposed mr m ller , 58 , took control of commerzbank in mid2001 , just as the dimensions of the downturn were becoming clear net profit plunged to 74 million euros \( 747 million \) in the first half of 2002 , from 302 million euros \( 3049 million \) in 2001 the investment banking business dried up , after four years of profits worse , german and foreign companies began to fail , leaving commerzbank with millions in uncollected loans it set aside 200 million in provisions for loans to leo kirch , the fallen munich media tycoon , and more than 100 million for warnaco , the bankrupt american apparel maker once run by linda j wachner all told , commerzbank expects to declare 13 billion euros in loanloss provisions in 2002 a forecast it increased twice mr m ller said his staff deserved credit for avoiding some corporate black holes , like worldcom , to which it had once lent 800 million but no longer has any outstanding loans still , with 42 , 000 corporate insolvencies in germany and bankruptcies still being filed every day the prospects for relief are dim even if you have good risk management , a weak economy does not give you great business opportunities , he said

little did rick rush know when he decided to paint tiger woods for a print called the masters of augusta that he would set into motion a major lawsuit involving the estates of some of the most prominent sports and entertainment figures in american popular culture frank sinatra , elvis presley , jimi hendrix , gene autry and the legendary golfer bobby jones , all weighing in from the great beyond those are a few of the groups lining up to support woods in his opposition to rush in a case that explores the boundary between an artist s right under the first amendment to express himself freely and to sell his works , and a celebrity s right to control his name and his image under rightofpublicity and trademark laws among the organizations supporting rush are time inc the new york times company the newspaper association of america , which represents more than 2 , 000 newspapers in the united states and canada and a group of 73 law professors who spend their lives studying the intersection of first amendment and intellectualproperty issues the case began four years ago , when rush , who has been painting sports figures for the past 25 years , produced a series of numbered prints featuring woods in the foreground and six other golf greats in the background the print , published by jireh publishing , a small company in tuscaloosa , ala , run by rush s brother , was issued in april 1998 in a limited edition of 250 serigraphs at 700 each , followed by 5 , 000 smaller lithographs selling for 15 each while the print , which depicts woods s 1997 masters victory , may not be widely known , the lawsuit that has sprung from its creation has ignited an intense legal battle rightsofpublicity laws typically permit damages if a person s name , photograph or likeness is used for commercial purposes without the person s consent some states , including california , extend these rights to heirs and others woods lost the first round in federal district court in ohio on april 10 , 2000 united states district court judge patrica a gaughan ruled that rush s portrayal was an artistic creation seeking to express a message she added , the fact that it is sold is irrelevant to the determination of whether it receives first amendment protection as for a trademark violation , the judge found none woods s lawyers appealed to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit oral arguments were held in cincinnati last september before a threejudge panel , which has not yet issued a decision the case , etw corporation \( eldrick tiger woods \) , the exclusive licensing agent for woods , against jireh publishing , the exclusive agent for rush , has attracted ardent supporters for each side they have now submitted friendofthecourt briefs in order to inform the court of other interests that may be affected by its decision weighing in for woods , in addition to the heirs and estates of sinatra and presley , are the players associations of the nfl and major league baseball each operates a licensing program for players seeking to make commercial use of their names and likenesses the screen actors guild also supports woods supporting rush are those concerned that rightsofpublicity statutes have become pernicious , growing far beyond their intended purpose in addition to time inc and the times company , they include the reporters committee on freedom of the press , the society of professional journalists , the american society of media photographers and the volunteer lawyers for the arts can you knock off thousands of copies of the image of tiger woods and then hide behind the first amendment and say it is a work of art \?

crowds coiled around department stores , sidewalk santas rang bells , christmas lights glittered on the tree at rockefeller center but behind the holiday cheer yesterday lay the specter of a transit strike , a city without the subways and buses that carry seven million people a day in and out like tides to many new yorkers , like bernice coffie , 28 , a mother of two who rides the subway from the bronx to work in a harlem grocery store , the prospects of a strike were frightening there s no way i can take a cab , she said there s no way i can miss work we have n't talked about it yet , but what would i do \? how would we be able to get food \? how would we be able to support our families \? a transit strike is indeed a vision of human and economic chaos of millions hiking or biking to and from work , of thousands of children missing school , of workplace absenteeism and people dying as emergency vehicles crawl in trafficchoked streets , of theaters and restaurants and retail businesses withering new yorkers old enough to remember transit strikes of the past recall the scenes lilliputian hordes crossing east river bridges like invading armies in the mornings and retreating like refugees in the dusk cars scrimmaging at every intersection hotels jammed with suburbanites instead of tourists commuters riding roller skates subway train yards like branching fish bones , eerily silent it happened twice before in modern times for 12 days in 1966 and for 11 days in 1980 and it could happen again next weekend , with the metropolitan transportation authority and local 100 of the transport workers union , which represents 34 , 000 transit workers , at loggerheads over wages and other issues the union has demanded a 24 percent wage increase over three years the transportation authority , facing a 2 billion deficit and the prospect of 25 or 50cent fare increases , has called for a oneyear wage freeze , with raises in the second and third years only if warranted by productivity increases the transit workers now average 44 , 000 a year the average was 18 , 520 in 1980 , when the fare was 50 cents , and 6 , 250 in 1966 , when a ride cost a quaint 15 cents the two sides were so far apart yesterday that they did not even agree on when the contract expires and a strike might begin the union said the current threeyear agreement would end at 12 01 am next monday a strike then would hit with maximum impact at the start of the workweek , and at the height of the holiday shopping season the authority says the contract ends at 12 01 am sunday a strike then would give commuters and others a day s breather to map strategy there were no negotiations yesterday and none are scheduled until wednesday , although committees might talk today but there was plenty of talk about strike prospects by officials at city hall , and in the streets and subways where ordinary new yorkers began to contemplate life without public wheels officials of the mayor s office of emergency management said that a comprehensive plan to cope with a strike was in preparation , with contributions by the city s police , fire , sanitation and transportation agencies and the port authority of new york and new jersey the deputy commissioner for emergency management , francis e mccarton , would not give details they were still being worked out in preparation for a city hall announcement today by mayor michael r bloomberg and his top commissioners , according to the mayor s spokesman , edward skyler the mayor , who was briefed on the plan last week and requested some changes , met yesterday with michael a cardozo , the city corporation counsel , to discuss legal strategies for heading off a strike and dealing with one if it were not averted , mr skyler said the state s taylor law prohibits strikes by public employees , including the transit workers it calls for imposing fines or imprisonment on union leaders , fines against striking unions , loss of the dues checkoff privileges on which unions rely for collecting money from members , and loss of two days' pay for every day a worker is on strike mr bloomberg , visiting staten island to talk about park improvements , said the taylor law would be fully enforced we will be in court , he said we will exercise every single legal remedy that we have to make sure first to try to prevent a strike if a strike occurs , he said , there will be serious consequences the mayor also reiterated warnings that a strike could cripple the city , severely damaging businesses and the economy , generating layoffs and declines in tax revenues and imposing heavy new burdens on a deficitridden budget to pay for police overtime and extra ferries and buses he also emphasized that a strike could imperil lives no 1 , people will die because of the gridlock that you will invariably have , he said the second thing that will happen is that the economy of this city will be devastated the estimates are a 100 million decline per day in economic activity that is going to translate , if it lasts more than a day or two , into layoffs throughout the city

university who oversees the campus police , said today that there also was a gambling investigation involving florida state students being conducted concurrently with the mcpherson investigation last week a local bartender s home computer and other materials were seized after an arrest warrant was issued earlier this year , mcpherson was investigated by the university s athletic department and the campus police because of rumors involving illegal gambling , and that investigation did not reveal any wrongdoing he was suspended indefinitely from the team last month shortly before his arrest on charges involving a stolen check that was later forged and cashed florida state has made the national collegiate athletic association aware of the current investigations , but the university is not being investigated by the ncaa , a spokesman for the association said in the tallahassee democrat on thursday , chief carey drayton of the campus police was quoted as saying their investigation included mcpherson , other football players and student managers and trainers connected with the university s athletic department later that day in a statement issued by the university , drayton called the story inaccurate and misleading in the way it characterized the nature of the investigation fsu police are investigating rumors and hearsay regarding a single former football player , adrian mcpherson , the university said in a statement the investigation does not currently extend to any other studentathletes at fsu jennie khoen , a spokeswoman for the florida department of law enforcement , said the fdle is part of an investigation that deals with adrian mcpherson it should be mcpherson and other students , not 'other athletes' in a speech to his players on thursday , florida state coach bobby bowden said that none of them were being investigated then he said , 'everybody s got to keep their nose clean , because we still are under investigation , ' pope said bowden left today immediately after the football team practiced the gambling investigations come during florida state s second straight fourloss season a first for bowden in his 27 seasons here and atypically glaring quarterback problems mcpherson , a 19yearold sophomore , replaced the erratic chris rix after seven games mcpherson , who went 31 as a starter , was suspended indefinitely before he was arrested , and rix became the starter again then rix was declared academically ineligible tuesday after he missed two final examinations , one when he said he overslept that leaves an unproven sophomore , fabian walker , as the seminoles' starter in the sugar bowl against georgia mcpherson s lawyer , grady irvin jr , said today from st petersburg , fla , that he planned to send a letter to the ncaa on monday calling for a fullfledged investigation of florida state s entire athletic program in the letter , adrian mcpherson will include any and all knowledge he has regarding the allegations of gambling at florida state , irvin said this is the only way to clear his name i believe fsu has enough information right now that the right thing for them to do would be to withdraw from the sugar bowl irvin said that the university began investigating mcpherson and then found other , more troubling things about other individuals , but has used mcpherson as a scrapegoat i have had a great deal of respect for coach bowden , living in florida as i have , irvin said but what he s done with adrian , allowing fsu to smear his reputation like they have , is just unforgivable florida state s athletics director , dave hart , was unavailable for comment today after drayton s interview with the democrat on wednesday , the university decided not to permit any of its officials to discuss the investigations we need to let the pros do their investigation , carnaghi , the university vice president , said we just need to do this right it s probably best when things are done quietly in five or six weeks we should have the answers we 'll know the good , the bad and the ugly brett williams , a senior offensive tackle , said that he and some of his teammates had heard rumors about gambling but we just kind of look around and say , 'we never heard of any of it' we do n't know what people are talking about but williams acknowledged being aware of how pervasive gambling seems to be at the nation s universities a lot of my friends gamble , he said i stay away from it photo florida state quarterback adrian mcpherson , a 19yearold sophomore , was 31 as a starter this season before he was suspended last month \( associated press \) \( pg d5 \)
following are excerpts from an interview with mayor michael r bloomberg q how did your feelings change after sept 11 , which , of course , was supposed to be the primary \? did any part of you not want to be mayor \? a no , i never had that feeling i think i knew it would be more complex there is a dimension of the job that is just more difficult , in terms of dealing with a budgetary shortfall there was an element to the job that was going to be new that s going to funerals , working on the memorial things that are directly related to 9 11 working on the design for what you build there but you know , the fundamental job is n't that different you always had a lack of housing , you always had transportation problems , you always had people that are desperately in need of social services and the magnitude of new york city is such that 9 11 makes some of those problems worse but i still come back to the basic problems of this city are n't any different , and we owe it to those who died to fix those problems i 've tried to call 400 families of firefighters , police officers and court officers who died , and maybe i have 40 left to go and almost all of the families say , i want a better life for my children q is there anything that is not getting the time and attention it would have received because it has been overshadowed by 9 11 \? a i think you still would have had a problem lower manhattan was losing the financial sector we did n't have enough housing a lot of the problems of this city are caused by the national economic slowdown so 9 11 puts a bump on it , 9 11 moves it to other industries , particularly tourism or any that depend on flying in the end , 9 11 probably economically hurt the poor more than anybody else , because wall street was contracting and laying off anyway but when tourism got hurt tourism is an industry that gives jobs to those at the beginning of the economic ladder , the people that work in the hotels , the people who work in the restaurants , people that drive the buses , those people starting up the economic ladder and they live all throughout the city and the region they were n't living downtown q how does 9 11 characterize your mayoralty \? are you the rebuilding mayor \? a in terms of rebuilding , an awful lot of buildings that we build here wo n't be done in seven years from now just think about the length of time it takes we still have n't really agreed on , conceptually , what should be here that is what i want to focus on over the couple of months i had no objection to the six plans that the lower manhattan development corporation put out , but i thought they were all variations on one conceptual ideal just office space i would consider just residential i 'd consider mixed you have to consider rebuilding the two towers i think that s impractical could not happen you could never finance the thing nobody would move into it but you want to go and say , what are the needs of this city and what are the different ideas \? which of the different ideas fit the needs \? and i think the same mistake is being made with the memorial everybody wants to talk about the size of the memorial and the location of the memorial but i do n't know why we are sure what the memorial will be for example , it could be a park i think that s what most people envision there may be 10 other things that people will come up with as an idea for a memorial , a lot of which i would n't agree with but this is the hard part of getting people to take the time , to sit back and open their minds and list all possibilities and a lot of people do n't ever want to ask questions where the possibility of the answer coming back being something they do n't want to hear exists i think you have to do that i think we owe it to those that we lost to expand our quest at a conceptual level for all different kinds of memorials and then sit back because it may very well be that a year from now people say , oh yes , of course , i would want an x , y , z q who are you referring to when you say people do n't want to sit back and reflect \? a i think there s this pressure we 've got to build right away but if you look at the history of great memorials , all the great ones have taken time the perspective of being away from something lets you look at the forest if you are in the middle of it , you can only see trees that s true in a lot of things we do nobody wants to build faster than i we need the tax revenue i want to be the building mayor , whatever you want to call it but i just think that it s a mistake to rush through it i do n't have any preconceived notion of what the memorial should be i do n't have any preconceived notions about how big it should be i do have a preconceived notion that whatever we do on that site and around that site has to work together , and that this city has to do two things memorialize , but also build for the future i do n't see how you could leave all 16 acres for a memorial it s not fair to those left behind they 're going to need jobs , they 're going to need schools , they 're going to need restaurants and stores q what for you has been the darkest moment since sept 11 \?
santa monica , calif god knows , this is a thin age for storytelling , said the director barry levinson , prompted to this melancholy assessment by a midafternoon screening of elia kazan s on the waterfront watching the film , which he said had a profound effect on him as a boy in baltimore heights , only amplified his sense that something essential had seeped from american movies in the decades since mr kazan and his star , marlon brando , transformed the art of film acting let s hope we 're only into one of these valleys , and not think that this is where we are going to be forever , mr levinson said just look at on the waterfront , mr levinson said you 've got terry malloy , this exfighter who is basically a bum , who works for this crooked union boss malloy s brother , charley , is another crooked big shot in the organization , and they have this very complex relationship then you 've got karl malden as this priest who decides to come down from the pulpit and go out into the streets to help clean things up , and eva marie saint as this girl from the convent who has to deal with her brother s murder by the gangsters look at how many characters there are at work in this story , and they 're all so rich i may be wrong , but i just think this is much , much fuller than the way stories are told today for the most part mr levinson is not the curmudgeon he may seem from these sentiments many veteran directors , including oscarwinners like mr levinson , consider the current sequelpowered , corporatedriven mindset of the hollywood studios to be a weak broth when compared with the richness of american filmmaking in the 1970 s and 80 s , when they came to prominence i think movies in general have gotten more and more simplistic , mr levinson said i do n't know if it s the audience or what s being delivered to them actually , i think this simplification came about because , these days , movies are all about television everything is about selling the movie , and the way movies are sold is in 30second television spots and this is what we end up with when on the waterfront was released in 1954 , it seemed to fit neatly into several filmmaking trends its realistic setting , rippedfromtheheadlines story and workingclass milieu made it part of a continuum in postwar filmmaking that brought movies out of the studio soundstages and onto the bustling city streets it has echoes of italian neorealism , of the social crusading of many late 40 s and early 50 s movies , even of the live television dramas of the period none of this meant anything , of course , to the 12yearold barry levinson who went to the ambassador theater in baltimore with his friends one saturday afternoon nearly five decades ago we just went every saturday afternoon and saw whatever was playing , mr levinson said that was it i had no sense of film history at that point but this was the first movie where i was sitting there and i realized that it was different you know , you see actors in movies when you 're young and it does n't really mean anything but in this movie , the acting of brando it was just something that i had never seen before it was more realistic , yet it had all of these odd moments i was watching it and i thought , you know , i have never seen anything quite like this the young mr levinson was so struck by the experience that he went home and wrote a letter to mr kazan it was the first time i ever paid attention to a director , mr levinson said i had no ambitions to be in this business , but i wrote to him and said , you know , the next time he made a movie i 'd like to come out there and watch him do it i did n't quite understand what it was about it that was so powerful to me the subtext in the actors' performances and the humanism of the storytelling but i knew that i just wanted to be there and see how they did it mr kazan never wrote back , but the impact that the film had on the young man was absolutely central in shaping the screenwriter and director he was to become the political element in the story meant nothing to the 12yearold mr levinson and he said later controversies about mr kazan s direction and budd schulberg s screenplay including claims that the story was at least partly a celebration of those who named names before congress in the hollywood blacklist era have never really colored his appreciation of the film it was simply with this movie that i began to look at movies in a different way , mr levinson said i began to analyze them , to try to figure out how they were done , rather than just going in and spending a couple of hours in the dark with my friends working with the stars mr levinson , 60 , was a comic and television writer winning two emmys for the carol burnett show before he turned to screenwriting in 1976 , for mel brooks , and directing in 1982 with diner since then he has made more than a dozen films , winning an oscar for directing rain man \( 1988 \) he also helped create the popular 1990 s television series homicide life on the streets
tucson , nov 13 barring unexpected developments , the major leagues , after undergoing an unusually high number of managerial changes , will begin next season with the same number of minority managers they had at the start of last season the only difference will be the makeup of the list of the seven managers at the outset of the 2002 season , they were all black next season will feature four black managers and three latino managers felipe alou is the latest latino manager hired in a surprising move today , the san francisco giants hired alou as the replacement for dusty baker baker , who opted not to remain with the giants , is on the verge of being named manager of the chicago cubs his hiring is expected to be announced thursday or friday , as is the naming of seattle s new manager none of the mariners' four candidates is a member of a minority baker would rejoin jerry manuel of the chicago white sox , lloyd mcclendon of pittsburgh and frank robinson of montreal as the majors' black managers robinson said today that he would probably decide by early next week if he would return for a second season with the expos , but a baseball official said there was a very good possibility frank will be back at 67 , alou becomes the oldest active manager , three and a half months older than robinson alou is the third latino manager , joining tony pe a of kansas city and carlos tosca of toronto , both of whom gained their jobs during the season brian sabean , the giants' general manager , hired alou only a week after he announced that the club and baker were ending their 10year association sabean interviewed no other candidates he was brian s first choice based on everything brian had heard about him and observed of him for years in montreal , ned colletti , the giants' assistant general manager , said at the general managers' meetings we had a secondary list in the event this did n't pan out , but brian left sunday night for florida , spent monday and tuesday with him and made the call alou , who was luis pujols s bench coach with the detroit tigers this past season , was long recognized for his handling of young players in his nine and a third seasons as the expos' manager he constantly had young players because the expos could not afford to keep the good players they developed , like larry walker , marquis grissom , john wetteland and moises alou , felipe s son when jeffrey loria , the expos' managing partner , fired alou a third of the way through the 2001 season , some people thought alou had lost his desire and passion for managing jim beattie , who was the expos' general manager , would not comment one way or another when asked about that view , but he provided an explanation i think a new challenge like that will reenergize him , beattie , who works for the expos , said of the giants' job i do n't think anybody can really understand what felipe went through all the years he was in montreal i do n't think any of us can understand how that had an effect on him alou , who made his major league playing debut with the giants on june 8 , 1958 , their first year in san francisco , gains another distinction according to elias sports bureau research , he is the oldest manager named to run a club since casey stengel , at 71 , was hired in october 1961 , to manage the expansion mets
