new orleans this was supposed to be the summer alex hubbard came back home after five years of living with his family in a salvation army shelter , a hotel room , a fema trailer and then a place in mississippi that belongs to his sisterinlaw , he was finally going to move back into his own house in the lower ninth ward then the bp blowout in the gulf of mexico happened and the slowdown of the drilling business offshore and , finally , the sixmonth federal moratorium on exploratory drilling now mr hubbard , an offshore technician , sits on a bucket in his empty house on lizardi street with no work for months , other than a day here or a couple days there , he has no money to buy a refrigerator , a bedroom set or even a few chairs you try to start your life back up and this happens , he said mr hubbard , a man as burly in stature as he is deferential in manner , has been working offshore since 1986 , after he reconsidered a career as a welder there used to be a lot of guys in the neighborhood who worked in the gulf , he said he loves the work , 14 days on , 7 days off , heading out of venice or port fourchon or houma it s like a vacation , he said he was on his sevenday home leave in 2005 when surged in , and the levees failed the next few months he spent in a shelter in laurel , miss , sleeping on a cot and speculating with the other offshore oil workers in the shelter how long it would be before the drilling business fully came back eventually the work picked up , but the old neighborhood did not none of the other offshore workers ever returned , at least none that mr hubbard knows nevertheless , he began showing up by himself on lizardi street a few days each month to rebuild his house , which he described as cracked in half the initial federal rebuilding money he received ran out quickly , and the work flagged but through a combination of grants and donations , and the work of a volunteer group , , his house was put together again the homecoming celebration is scheduled for later this month they are trying to find a time when mr hubbard will be in town rather than waiting around his company s headquarters for some work to turn up so now mr hubbard has a home in new orleans he has two daughters in college , and two other children in their final years of high school and , he said , sitting on his overturned bucket , he does not have much else
mexico city the united states will withhold about 26 million promised for s drug war because of concerns that the country has not done enough to protect its people from  it is the first time that the united states , citing human rights concerns , has held back a portion of the financing for mexico under the , a threeyearold , 14 billion effort to help mexico and central american nations fight drug trafficking organizations under the program , 15 percent of the money for mexico is allotted on the condition that the country improve the accountability of the federal and local police ensure civilian investigations and , if warranted , prosecutions of allegations of abuse by the police and the military and ban testimony obtained through torture or other mistreatment the state department , in a report delivered to congress on friday , said it would release 36 million from earlier budgets but it said it would withhold 15 percent of the 175 million allocated in the most recent budget no society can enjoy domestic peace and security without a functioning justice system supported by appropriately trained and equipped law enforcement and justice personnel who are respectful of human rights and rule of law , said a state department spokesman , harry edwards the state department called on the mexican congress to pass legislation strengthening the authority of the country s national human rights commission and subjecting military service members accused of human rights abuses to civilian prosecution the mexican government , in a statement , called the findings an affront to its sovereignty the merida initiative is based on shared responsibility , mutual trust and respect for each country s jurisdiction , the statement said nik steinberg , mexico researcher for , said , any withholding of funds would be a step in the right direction , but given the total impunity for military abuses and widespread cases of torture , none of the funds tied to human rights should be released

united nations after weeks of receiving threats and demands that it dismiss many female employees and pay a security fee to an islamic extremist group , tuesday that it was suspending food deliveries to one million people in southern indefinitely the cutoff , which includes the withdrawal of more than 40 local staff members , will affect roughly one third of the 28 million people whom the food program had anticipated feeding in somalia in january in the past few weeks there has been a harder line of unacceptable demands and conditions set by armed groups in these areas , said peter smerdon , the spokesman for the program , by telephone from nairobi , kenya we sadly had to make the decision to pull our staff out the demands had been accompanied by a rise in intimidation , threats and harassment , he said various branches of the shabab , the islamist militants who control much of southern somalia , presented local offices of the food program with a list of 11 demands in november they included paying a 20 , 000 fee for security every six months , seeking shabab approval for their projects and replacing all female staff members , except those engaged in health care , with men the militants also demanded that the organization put a more islamic stamp on its activities by not bringing in any alcohol or foreign films , not celebrating holidays like new year s day , not observing the weekend on saturday and sunday and not flying the agency s flag the shabab also pressed a demand that the agency not import food during the harvest season , which just ended , in order to encourage the development of local agriculture several previous shabab statements accused the agency of undermining local agriculture , as well as importing poor quality food in the statement announcing the suspension , the agency noted that even in the best of times , somali farmers supplied only about 40 percent of the , and although last year s harvest was good , in the past five years it had fallen to provide about 30 percent of the country s needs the monthly food distribution included staples like corn and sorghum , as well as vegetable oil , beans or lentils and sometimes salt mr smerdon said the agency had tried to negotiate with the shabab as well as community elders , but ultimately decided the distribution centers at wajid , buale , garbahare , afmadow , jilib and beledweyne would have to be closed and the food supplies removed people will go hungry , he said if it continues for a long time you could see malnutrition rates rising to try to cope with the problem , he said the agency would increase distribution along the border in neighboring kenya , anticipating that some somalis would cross the border in search of food a few other organizations help distribute food in southern somalia , but none on the same scale the unicef program , for example , focuses on feeding about 10 , 000 malnourished children monthly , said patrick mccormick , a spokesman for the group in new york unicef had received scattered demands that echoed those presented to the , but , he said , it had no plans to withdraw the shabab and allied insurgent groups control most of the country , while the weak transitional government holds a small enclave in mogadishu , the capital , under the protection of african union troops branches of the shabab , which have drawn increasingly close to al qaeda , have recently sought new sources of financing to free themselves of dependence on foreign money the world food program had considered stopping work in the area after the unsolved killings of four staff members in attacks roughly a year ago , mr smerdon said , but after talks with the shabab and local tribal leaders , the distribution continued without significant problems the united states , one of the main food donors , had out of concerns that contractors were funneling money to the shabab
a stalled economy , a bitter election year , a shaky music business none of those can thwart the annual cmj music marathon , which starts today and once again , for five days , will fill new york city s clubs with musicians eager to be heard by the right people , whoever they might be the marathon includes places from madison square garden a concert on wednesday by phoenix , dirty projectors and wavves to clubs barely bigger than a studio apartment its epicenters are the lower east side of manhattan and williamsburg , brooklyn , which also happen to supply a good number of the bands some 1 , 200 acts are scheduled to perform at official cmj showcases from noon to 2 am for the next five days , which are accessible \( up to club capacity \) by those who have bought a cmj pass \( 295 to 495 \) or garnered one by , for instance , performing 1 , 200 acts means a lot of musicians checking out one another the badgedeprived can pay admission charges or freeload at many unaffiliated , peripheral or parasitical events like the offline festival , three days of shows at the brooklyn bowl presented by one of cmj s rivals , the online music magazine pitchfork the great majority of cmj performers qualify as indierock , in subgenres as diverse as punk and mathrock , chamberpop and chillwave , electro and singersongwriter there s some collegiateminded hiphop , too blasts from the past , like gary numan and helmet , are among the showcases so are bands from sweden , canada , france and new zealand and with all that music , there are also outliers galore the exhilaration and the slogging have already begun in an attempt to patch a tentative itinerary out of cmj s online listings for anyone serious about cmj among them the music critics from the new york times , who will be blogging and tweeting we ve been clicking through the schedule s links to songs with myspace plays in the low three figures , and seeing how many bands now augment their 30 minutes of cmj recognition with additional gigs at parties , stores and online studios those plans are bound to fracture in the course of cmj as buzz coalesces around certain acts like , perhaps , the noisy spooky salem , or the pristinely strange lia ices , or the elegantly patterned braids , or the samplemanipulating gold panda , or the lowfi and determined cloud nothings , or the quicktongued , rhymechirping teenager dominque young unique , or dozens of other contenders critics and photographers will be updating here and on twitter between \( and sometimes during \) sets , if we can tear ourselves away from the potential of the next band just down the block
as an irishamerican , i don t usually trumpet the work of a nation that kept my ancestors under its boot heel for nearly 300 years but having just finished the memoirs of two great exports of britain , i rise to praise a pair of brits in the season of bookbuying christopher hitchens , the polemical polymath , is to modern american discourse what lenny bruce was to comedy he changed the game , and in so doing forced us to examine our core beliefs his story , hitch22 , was hitting the bestseller lists this year just as he was diagnosed with a killer type of esophageal cancer he has vowed to go to his grave as an intellectually curious atheist the beautiful ruin that is keith richards , guitarist and guiding musical force behind the rolling stones , is best known for being a living cadaver a heroin addict during his most productive years , richards the author is now competing with former president george w bush for bragging rights to the most popular nonfiction book in this country in his story , life , the united states and its black music saved him as a man and an artist the atheist poked the most religious of western democracies , assailing us for flabbiness of spirit and outright ignorance the junkie found the best of chicago blues lost in the back alley of american pop culture , and made those soulstirring chords mainstream forever both men , on paper at least , are hard to love , but impossible to dislike in the united states , they got what so many from other shores have obtained renewal life in britain had seemed like one long antechamber to a room that had too many barriers to entry , hitchens writes of his move across the atlantic in 1981 , becoming a citizen 26 years later a product of oxford , he displays none of the educated english habit of using unnecessary modifiers and disclaimers no bit of cancer or spot of bad luck from him he greeted one reporter in august with , how am i \? i m dying in his words , sarah palin is a disgraceful opportunist and real moral coward the jihadists who attacked the united states represent the mirthless , medieval , deathobsessed barbarism of islamic fundamentalism and recreational drugs keith richards s nutrients are a form of weakminded escapism almost as contemptible as religion of course , he does share his countrymen s taste for the grape and grain , describing his daily intake as at least one bottle of wine and two drinks of mr walker s amber restorative and as with any english bad boy , he fell in with the wrong crowd for a time , finding common cause with president bush in a dishonest war of choice against iraq that was his oneoff , and it was a big one his lasting contribution will be his challenge to religion once , while waiting in line for coffee with hitchens , i asked him why his book god is not great was such a big hit in a nation with so many believers he said it was because many of those believers are actually skeptics and , indeed , after reading his provocative but not entirely convincing tract against faith , i kept hearing the voice of a jesuit teacher from my high school , who urged us to be in constant search of your god and yourself hitchens may not have long to live but he will not go gently a few days ago he debated religion with tony blair , comparing god to a kind of benign north korea by audience consensus , hitchens handily won the match with the former british prime minister richards will be 67 later this month , and long ago fell off the list of rock stars most likely to die soon so what if he once stayed up for nine days in a row , and displayed the junkie s paranoia for sleeping with weapons \? if that was the price for the musical genius of tumbling dice , rip this joint or midnight rambler , so be it his music grew out of devotional listening to howlin wolf , muddy waters , jimmy reed and other american bluesmen chicago blues hit us right between the eyes , richards writes , and as long as we were together , we would pretend to be black men he has never thought otherwise you can come from anywhere and be any color , he writes we found that out later should it surprise us that richards is now a longmarried connecticut gentleman , a fierce reader of history , living out his years with a wellstocked library \? or that he was pardoned for reckless driving by a governor of arkansas , the evangelical mike huckabee \? not really for all of our current miseries , this country nurtures second acts better than any other and produces its share of first acts , as well this oped column appeared in print on december 4 , 2010
this week s question comes from guest blogger david shenk mr shenk is the author of the genius in all of us why everything you ve been told about genetics , talent and iq is wrong in his book which laura miller of saloncom says has quietly blown my mind mr shenk argues that extraordinary talent and high intelligence are not rare , genetic gifts bestowed on the few but , instead , something to which we can all aspire we asked mr shenk to pose questions for teachers and parents about the classroom implications of what he found if it s true that talent and intelligence are highly malleable rather than genetically fixed , how should we respond as educators \? read about mr shenk s findings , then write in , below , to tell us what you think does the gifted label get in the way of developing real potential \? by david shenk how many students in any given classroom have the potential for remarkable future achievement \? the new science of genetics , intelligence , and talent suggests that our abilities are not set in genetic stone , but rather are soft and sculptable people are not doomed to mediocrity , as conventional wisdom suggests no one can really know his or her true limits before applying enormous resources and investing vast amounts of time greatness is something to which any kid of any age can aspire this presents an enormous challenge to teachers if any of your students not just the obviously gifted standouts could become the next bruce springsteen or barack obama , how do you try to inspire ambition and persistence among such a wide range of abilities \? studies of gifted children and adult achievers show conclusively that we can t assume that early promise or a lack thereof is a clear sign of future success even very ordinary brains are capable of extraordinary things when provoked , and early gifted achievers are capable of slipping back into ordinary achievement or worse some assert that an individual s intelligence is a fixed quantity which cannot be increased , french psychologist alfred binet decried in 1909 we must protest and react against this brutal pessimism binet turns out to be correct though a lot of effort has gone into persuading us that each of us inherit a fixed amount of intelligence , the prevailing view now is that intelligence is not an innate thing , but a developed process intelligence , tuft s robert sternberg declared in 2005 after many decades of study , represents a set of competencies in development cornell university s stephen ceci has shown that individual iq scores can change dramatically in individuals , and james flynn has famously documented how our increasingly sophisticated culture has lifted iq scores steadily over the century perhaps most profoundly of all , stanford s carol dweck has demonstrated that students who understand that intelligence is malleable \( rather than fixed \) are much more intellectually ambitious and successful and john mighton s jump program has demonstrated powerfully that , with the right instruction , no one need be left behind in math while all this shows that ordinary students have the potential to bust out , we also know that socalled gifted children aren t automatically assured of great adult success in the early 1920s , psychologist lewis terman began tracking nearly fifteen hundred california schoolkids identified as exceptionally superior in what he called genetic studies of genius alas , as terman s exceptional kids matured , they seemed less and less exceptional they did grow up to be healthier and more successful than the average american , but very few ultimately emerged as geniuses or superachievers none went on to earn the nobel prize as two children rejected from terman s original group did none became worldclass musicians as two other terman rejects , isaac stern and yehudi menuhin , did all in all , terman s epic studies in genius turned out to be studies in disappointment the frustration was especially keen when it came to the very top of terman s group the 5 percent who had scored 180 or better on the iq test there is the disappointing sense that they might have done more with their lives , concluded tufts s david henry feldman in a 1984 retrospective of the long study all of this reinforces the old hope that great schools can lift all but it also presents a curious challenge to teachers how do you maintain the ambition of those showing early promise while simultaneously trying to tap into the hidden potential of everyone else \? teachers and parents what experiences do you have with the socalled gifted \? what effects does this label have on kids and schools \? do you think highability children belong in the same classrooms as lesser achievers \? in general , how do you think teachers can challenge all kids in classrooms where there is a wide variety of ability \? tell us here see previous teacher qs and responses
goodyear , ariz they are not related but shelley and eric duncan have a lot in common besides their last name both were high draft picks by the yankees , shelley in the second round in 2001 , eric in the first round in 2003 both have finally moved on shelley to the cleveland indians , eric to the atlanta braves they talk every night , shelley said on wednesday morning , at the indians training camp shelley has 68 games of major league time and eric has none neither made the kind of impact they had hoped for with the yankees it s a complicated thing to talk about , shelley duncan said i don t like to think about it much you really can t control any of the stuff that happened over there it s like me and eric talk every night we just share thoughts every night about how things are so different it s fun to have someone to talk to who went through that same thing eric duncan , 25 , who is not in major league camp with the braves , spent the last three full seasons at class aaa scranton wilkesbarre in seven seasons as a yankees minor leaguer , the florham park , nj , native hit 242 with a 320 onbase percentage a first and third baseman , he never hit more than 19 homers in a season homers were not shelley duncan s problem he hit 170 over nine seasons in the yankees system , including 30 last season for scranton only one player in class aaa the former yankee mitch jones , in the dodgers organization hit more homers when duncan , 30 , quietly left as a minor league free agent , it ended a long yankees minorleague career and a brief but memorably colorful run as a yankee in the majors i asked how he would remember his yankees experience , and after thinking for a while , he answered i feel really privileged to be in that organization for as long as i was , duncan said it would have been nice , and there would have probably been positives being in other organizations , but i think i learned a lot being in that one you learn to play the game the right way , go about your business the right way they do things right over there from the bottom up i think being there as long as i was has set me up for a lifetime of lessons , or lessons that transcend my playing days what kind of lessons \? like if i go into coaching , i have an aspect of how they went about their ways , duncan said it s a whole different outlook on the game than being somewhere else for the whole time duncan agreed that the prestige of playing for the yankees might lend some credibility in a future job there is always part of him that will wonder how his life and career would have been different if he had been with another team but he usually resists the urge to dwell on it everybody that s been in that organization feels like they ve been stuck before , duncan said we have whatifs but i don t like to live by whatifs duncan is 2 for 7 early in camp for the indians his main competition for a roster spot seems to be austin kearns , 29 , the former cincinnati and washington outfielder who hit 195 for the nationals in 80 games last season duncan played 11 games with the yankees and went 3 for 15
to the public editor re times standards , staffers or not \( jan 3 \) i am struck by the hypocrisy of the times what was not mentioned by mr hoyt is that the times accepts many millions of dollars for advertising then , there is an expectation that objectivity will be maintained when writing articles covering these advertisers if there is an expectation that the times as a whole will be able to maintain objectivity , then it is not unreasonable to think that times freelancers should be able to maintain a similar objectivity individually if the times must be free of even the smallest hint of undue influence , then reject all advertising , just as consumer reports does mountain lakes , nj , jan 3 , 2010  newspapers are sustained by advertising revenue , but there is a big difference between that and a writer s accepting or soliciting free travel the times has many advertisers , none with the economic leverage to affect coverage , and the paper has strong safeguards i 've asked bill keller , the executive editor , to comment on this and the following letter  your column buried the essential point made by the former times columnist virginia postrel she called the paper s rules about the financial involvement that freelance writers can have with other clients borderline unethical because the times wants freelancers to function like staffers without the pay or benefits publishers and other corporate media types want to profit from outsourced production and avoid financial responsibility for the many benefits like health care , vacations and retirement that the corporation s regularly employed workers have won then they react with horror when the freelance \( read underemployed \) worker uses whatever means available to compensate for the economic benefits they 've been denied by that same system of outsourcing that has proved so profitable to corporate america , and so destructive to the american worker , over the past decades that s the real story do n't bury it queens , jan 4 , 2010  the times has established some of the strictest guidelines in the business to protect the independence and integrity of our news report we want readers to know that our journalists are not beholden to , or intimidated by , anyone advertisers , subjects , sources or advocates for causes thus we keep a deliberate distance between the people who make journalism and the people who sell ads we in the newsroom do not tell the advertising department what we are planning to publish they , in turn , make clear to advertisers that their money buys space to sell their products and services , nothing more we do n't hesitate to publish unwelcome news or toughminded analysis about companies or industries that advertise in the times occasionally advertisers have withdrawn their ad dollars in response to something we have published but we accept that as the price of doing honest journalism writers on assignment for the times , whether staffers or freelancers , are bound by the same ethics code it s true that freelance writing is a hard way to make a living , and there s no question we make it harder by imposing these stringent conflictofinterest rules but what are the alternatives \? we ca n't afford to put everyone who writes a book review or a travel article on fulltime staff if we stopped using freelancers to supplement our staff reporting we would deprive our readers of much interesting material \( and deprive freelancers of both income and a prestigious outlet \) and if we let freelancers take freebies from people they write about , we would compromise the integrity that people demand of the times  the honest mistake and the borderline unethical rules mentioned by two former times freelance writers made me nostalgic for the old days , when there was a brighter line between right and wrong my late father , cowl rider , wrote many of the topics of the times for these pages from the 1940s to the early 1960s , one of which mentioned the encyclopaedia britannica the eb offered to send , at no charge , its latest edition , in appreciation for its inclusion in topics i was thrilled at the prospect of getting free stuff by merely putting a company s name in an article \( i came up with a list beginning with lionel train sets of products that could be sent for free to our doorstep \) but my father said it would be wrong to accept anything but the 20 he received per column i ruefully learned the lesson that integrity trumps money and is never an afterthought i agree with the times s policy as applied to these recently removed editorial contributors , but i still wish i had gotten that set of books and that little locomotive that spewed fake steam as it hurried around its oval track grapevine , tex , jan 3 , 2010 re stolen email , stoking the climate debate \( dec 5 \) so , we are told the new york times is just to interview scientists and not actually try to understand the science \? even when there is evidence of deceit , the times does n't pry itself away from its dependence on interviews with scientists \? drastic , mindbogglingly expensive policy changes are proposed based on this science , making this potentially the biggest fraud in history why is n't the times on fire trying to figure everything out and helping us readers see into the controversy \? wichita , kan , dec 6 , 2009 times editor erica goode is quoted as saying that we here at the times are not scientists she goes on to say that the best we can do is to give our readers a sense of what the prevailing scientific view is i would say the times can do better it can present the arguments of those who question the prevailing scientific view as well only in this manner can the public be aware of the nature of scientific inquiry , a giveandtake of opinions with systematically collected data as the ultimate arbiter dobbs ferry , ny , dec 7 , 2009  first , i should point out that we of those who question the prevailing scientific view on climate change when there is a possibility of fraud or deceit , as in the current debate over the email and documents from the british climate research center , we investigate those allegations independently and do not rely on scientists to do it for us in our coverage of climate change and other environmental issues , we are fortunate to have the assistance of many highly experienced science reporters in many cases these reporters have scientific training , and they have mastered the science to the point that they are able to convey complex scientific concepts in easily accessible language and while they do interview scientists , they also have a sophisticated understanding of scientific methodology that allows them to aggressively question scientific conclusions and to evaluate the quality of research or to find appropriate experts who can help evaluate it but they are not arbiters of scientific truth \( something that is , in any case , highly elusive \) rather , they try to accurately reflect the spectrum of scientific opinions , to explain what those opinions are based on , and to give readers a sense of where a majority of qualified scientists stand on a given issue
washington the heard on tuesday about the controversial practice of keeping sex offenders locked up after they have completed their criminal sentences but from an unusual angle the question was not whether the continued civil commitment of prisoners for fear that they remain sexually dangerous violates due process principles it was , rather , whether congress had the constitutional power to authorize the practice at all for federal prisoners state civil confinement laws are not at issue in the case last year , a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond , va , unanimously that none of the powers granted to congress in the constitution empowered it to authorize such civil commitments during tuesday s argument in the case , united states v comstock , no 081224 , solicitor general elena kagan said the practice was needed to run a criminal justice system that does not itself endanger the public but she relied almost solely on a clause of the constitution not ordinarily thought of as a source of freestanding authority , one that gives congress the right to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its other powers only justice antonin scalia consistently disputed ms kagan s invocation of the necessary and proper clause necessary and proper does n't mean it is necessary and proper for the good of society , he said it means it is necessary and proper for the execution of another power that the federal government is given by the constitution but there is no constitutional power on the part of the federal government to protect society from sexual predators , he said , adding that state officials were up to the task ms kagan agreed that the states should take the lead role but she said the federal government is a kind of backstop , so that if the state does not take responsibility and does not take custody , the federal government will ensure that the person will not be released in practice , she conceded , states do not typically volunteer to take custody of federal prisoners completing their sentences who are said to be sexually dangerous others justices were more sympathetic to ms kagan s argument justice samuel a alito jr said states might no longer view prisoners held in federal prisons , often elsewhere in the country , as their responsibility when public safety is at issue , justice ruth bader ginsburg said , the government has some responsibility , does n't it \? the challenge to the civil commitment law was brought by five prisoners the case of graydon comstock was typical in november 2006 , six days before mr comstock was to have completed a 37month sentence for receiving , attorney general alberto r gonzales certified that mr comstock was a sexually dangerous person lower courts ruled that the law under which mr gonzales acted exceeded congress s constitutional authority but those decisions have been stayed , and mr comstock remains confined in a federal prison g alan dubois , a lawyer for the prisoners , disputed ms kagan s characterization of the relationship between the criminal justice system and his clients' cases civil commitment has never been thought to be part of the criminal justice system , he said they are two separate spheres of government control and government authority ms kagan drew an analogy to continuing to quarantine people with communicable diseases after their sentences were complete would anyone say , ms kagan asked , that congress was powerless to effect that kind of public safety measure \? justice anthony m kennedy responded that congressional power over interstate commerce would support that action but ms kagan relied on the constitution s commerce clause only glancingly in her argument in favor of the civil commitment law the rehnquist court struck down federal laws concerning violence against women and the possession of guns near schools on the ground that congress had exceeded its constitutional authority under the commerce clause , but it upheld a federal law regulating the medicinal use of homegrown  justice scalia suggested various approaches the federal government could take to make sure the states confined dangerous people after they had served their sentences , prompting a response from justice john paul stevens i guess we can all think of a lot of different statutes , justice stevens said we have to decide whether this one is constitutional
washington the chances of congress allowing income tax rates to go up only for millionaires slim the chances of democrats using tax cuts for millionaires as a political bludgeon against republican lawmakers game on for several months , democrats have railed against republicans intent on extending all the bushera income tax cuts , accusing them of doling out tax cuts for the rich they said it on the floor of the house and the senate , and they had their people repeat and jam the idea into every news release and twitter message they could but now , faced with the likelihood that their generalized populist argument will not be enough to hold the line , some senate democrats are offering a new approach , and with it a new and more targeted buzz phrase in search of a compromise with republicans , they are offering to extend the tax cuts for income up to 1 million , rather than the 250 , 000 per couple limit originally sought by and to those republicans who are resisting the idea , they are hurling the phrase tax cuts for millionaires for democrats , short on time and political mojo , the hope is that the phrase can define the debate with the same semiotic impact as death tax , the coinage used to considerable effect by conservatives in their drive to slash and eliminate the federal  senator , democrat of new york , began to float the idea of the millionaires' tax cut a few weeks ago he is pressing it on what he sees as the substantive merits , but sees it as well as an example of how the way a policy is framed can determine its political viability just as the death tax sort of put democrats on the defensive on the estate tax , mr schumer said in a telephone interview , the millionaires' tax is putting the republicans on the defensive on tax policy he added , i think it is a potent issue with the public on the floor of the senate on wednesday afternoon , he taunted , cajoled and politely begged his republican colleagues to join him in supporting the new income cutoff , but none took the bait senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the republican leader , took the floor thursday morning to reiterate that his caucus would accept tax increases on no one , and cited democrats who agreed with him but many democrats are adopting mr schumer s language in a news release about the expiration of unemployment benefits this week , senator harry reid of nevada , the majority leader , said , at the same time that they deny assistance for outofwork americans , republicans are pushing for more tax breaks for millionaires republicans have spent much of this week answering the charge they are trying to create class warfare , said senator , republican of south carolina but i do n't care who they take it from it s still money out of the private sector but will the slogan have negative impact \? we 'll see , mr demint said with a smile , before dashing down a hallway democrats are planning to stage votes to force republicans to go on record supporting the highend tax cuts and to use the outcome to cast republicans as putting the interests of millionaires ahead of other priorities , like reducing the deficit and providing additional benefits to the unemployed how it will end is anyone s guess , though it seems increasingly likely that democrats , unable to set an income ceiling that republicans would accept and unwilling to blink and let all tax cuts expire , will agree to a temporary extension of the tax cuts at all income levels in return for concessions on some other issues but using votes cast by republican senators some of them millionaires themselves as a blunt instrument of class rage is something democrats hope will have legs beyond the lameduck session that ends this month the strategy is hardly a slamdunk , largely because it is late republicans have framed any eliminated tax cut as a pro forma increase as such , failing to extend the current rates for millionaires may well be seen as less a cut for rich people than a tax increase on someone the problem with that is that it seems so calculated now , said , a republican pollster who is widely credited for popularizing the term death tax in the 1990s in reference to the estate tax the issue with the death tax is that it tied the tax to the name of the event that caused it to be triggered , mr luntz said , which tax cut for millionaires lacks while nearly all republicans rallied around the death tax slogan to push for elimination of the estate tax an issue that continues to be fought over even today democrats are not quite so united behind the millionaires' tax cut idea some senate democrats support extension of the highend tax cuts on the grounds that it is a bad idea to raise taxes on anyone when the economy remains so fragile many liberals say that the 1 million threshold is too high and that democrats should fight to hold the line at the 250 , 000 level originally set by mr obama mr schumer is still counting on a potential bumper sticker this is not just the issue for the moment , he said , this will be an issue for the next two years
charleston harbor , dec 22 , 1860 for two nights the sentinels had watched the patrol boats as they passed back and forth like prowling sharks the small steamers cruised with their lamps doused , paddlewheels turning slowly , hulls and wheelhouses silhouetted against water lighted by the reflection of the waxing moon across the water loomed a larger shape , high and square to members of the small , beleaguered union garrison at fort moultrie , it represented all that they longed for safety honor perhaps even , in the end , victory with the secession of south carolina two days earlier , the noose around them had tightened the carolinians now officially regarded them as alien interlopers , a foreign force upon the sovereign soil of their state the union commander , maj robert anderson , had done his best to buttress moultrie s inadequate defenses , but this seemed little more than shoring up a sand castle against the rising tide meanwhile , the garrison s officers and men gazed longingly from their low battlements at the other federal citadel fort sumter it sat on its own artificial island a sturdy pedestal of granite boulders , hewn from new england quarries just inside the narrowest part of the harbor s mouth , alongside the main ship channel though the fort was still unfinished after decades of fitful progress , sumter s 360degree view of the surrounding water made it almost impregnable to sneak attack , and its high brick walls were much more formidable than moultrie s designed to protect the port from enemy fleets , its armament included a fearsome array of heavy mortars and columbiads , the bulbous 10ton cannons that could hurl a heavy projectile far enough to hit a warship three miles out to sea or , for that matter , broad street in downtown charleston currently , however , sumter housed just a few union military engineers supervising some civilian workmen the carolinians could seize it with impunity and turn its heavy guns upon moultrie itself and now the secessionist governor had ordered the guard boats to patrol nightly , with orders to stop every vessel passing between the forts and , if union troops from moultrie were found aboard , either to turn it back or sink it though barely a mile distant , sumter now seemed almost as unattainable to major anderson and his men as the moon nor was it only the guard boats that blocked them for weeks , since long before secession , major anderson had been begging his superiors in washington for orders to transfer his little force just five dozen officers and men and a brass band to sumter none arrived terse communiques from the war department forbade him , in general terms , to make any move that might provoke the hotheaded secessionists on dec 19 , after one of the union officers had managed to extract a few dozen old muskets from the federal arsenal in charleston , a telegram arrived almost immediately from john floyd , the secretary of war , forbidding the garrison even this paltry addition to its armament the following evening , the men watched powerlessly as fireworks flashed among the distant rooftops of the city , hailing south carolina s rebirth as an independent nation major anderson s junior officers led by his secondincommand , capt abner doubleday implored him daily to make a dash for sumter better this than sit and wait for the secessionist militiamen to overwhelm them moreover , public feeling in the north might be with them , even if president james buchanan and his administration weren t \( the captain and his formidable wife had tried to stoke this support with strategically leaked letters in the new york papers \) we hoped , almost against hope , captain doubleday later wrote , that , even if the government were base enough to desert us , the loyal spirit of the patriotic north would manifest itself in our favor , inasmuch as our little forces represented the supremacy of the constitution and the laws still major anderson demurred doubleday s doubts about the kentuckian s true loyalties deepened occasionally the captain would relieve his frustration by loading a howitzer with double rounds of canister shot , pointing it out to sea , and blasting a furious volley against the insolent southern waves it was the only thing he could do doubleday and the other junior officers were as yet unaware of anderson s private entreaties to the war department nor did they see the orders from secretary floyd that arrived at moultrie on dec 23 floyd told anderson that of course he should defend the harbor forts to the best of his ability but , he added if they are invested or attacked by a force so superior that resistance would , in your judgment , be a useless waste of life , it will be your duty to yield to necessity , and make the best terms of surrender in your power this will be the conduct of an honorable , brave , and humane officer , and you will be fully justified in such action president buchanan himself was in complete agreement with these instructions , floyd added it did not take much reading between the lines to grasp their purport if the carolinians sent any force against moultrie that was more substantial than five dozen soldiers and a brass band , anderson was to surrender without firing a shot this was a bitter pill for major anderson to swallow , far more than floyd so blithely assumed true , the major sympathized with southern grievances he also dreaded the thought of bloodshed yet he was an american officer , sworn to uphold his nation s honor as he had been ever since that distant day when , at the age of 16 , he first donned the uniform of a west point cadet as he had been when he shed his blood in the war with mexico his father , a revolutionary war soldier , had fought to defend this very spot , fort moultrie , against the british long ago could he now surrender it , without resistance , to a mob of halftrained militiamen \? orders were orders yet as anderson pored obsessively over that infuriating missive from secretary floyd , he found something that just might serve as a loophole it was narrow as narrow , indeed , as a single letter of the alphabet floyd who was not known for weighing his words with great care had referred to anderson s command of charleston harbor s forts , plural therefore , could not the transfer of men to a different fort be seen as merely a slight rearrangement , like shifting a cannon from one side of the battlements to another \? anderson s papers are archived today at the library of congress with characteristic thoroughness , he seems to have saved almost every document he accumulated while stationed at charleston , no matter how routine among these is a letter so ordinary that it appears at first glance to be of little importance an editor at harper s weekly wrote on dec 18 , asking the major for a photograph of himself that could be used to create a portrait in the magazine when i paged through the robert anderson papers recently , i skimmed this letter and moved on quickly to the next one yet as i turned it over , something on the back caught my eye it was a faint pencil sketch , possibly a doodle it looked at first like a crude rendering of a duck \( see above \) then i realized it was a map , hastily sketched , of charleston harbor whoever drew it had marked the locations of the three federal forts moultrie , sumter and castle pinckney it is hard to imagine anyone else in the garrison using the commander s mail , however trivial , as scrap paper could the mapmaker have been anderson , privately pondering an escape route \? in any case , events would soon prove that the major s thoughts were very much upon such matters far more than his junior officers suspected join

the tea party has officially entered the united states congress representative michele bachmann , the outspoken minnesota republican , has won approval from house leaders to form a tea party caucus and on wednesday , the group will hold its first meeting followed by a news conference aides said that already at least a dozen lawmakers had asked to join and that more were expected to sign up at the meeting representative pete sessions of texas , who as chairman of the national republican congressional committee is leading the party s effort to win back the house , said tuesday that he intended to join the tea party caucus , which he said was reflective of america every tea party event that i have been to , people literally have been onethird democrats , onethird republicans , onethird independents , mr sessions said they are 100 percent fired up about trying to save this country from a big government that is taxing , spending and causing deficits in a letter to representative robert a brady , democrat of pennsylvania and chairman of the committee on house administration , requesting to register the new organization , ms bachmann said it would be an informal group , dedicated to promote americans call for fiscal responsibility , adherence to the constitution and limited government she added , presently , i will serve as chair of the house tea party caucus in a followup letter to speaker nancy pelosi , ms bachmann stressed that the group would be policyoriented , not focused on political goals this caucus would do nothing more than promote the timeless principles of our founding , principles that all members of congress have sworn to uphold , she wrote the tea party caucus is strictly issuebased in nature , promoting policies of fiscal responsibility and limited government with a strict adherence to our constitution at the forefront by rejecting such an organization , we would be silencing the voices , values and principles held dear by millions of americans the tea party movement has become synonymous with these principles , and a caucus taking these values to heart would work to advance them she noted that the group would take its place in the pantheon of house affinity and interest groups , including the congressional animal protection caucus , congressional apparel manufacturing and fashion business caucus , the congressional shellfish caucus , and congressional songwriter caucus , among others those others include the congressional task force on bowhunting , the congressional soils caucus , the congressional nanotechnology caucus , the congressional wine caucus , the house commuter caucus and the out of poverty caucus of course , none of these groups have the political voltage of being tied to a national movement that is seeking to harness a wave of antiincumbent sentiment and , potentially , to oust some of the very same lawmakers who would be eligible to join the tea party caucus the move by ms bachmann apparently caught house republican leaders by surprise and creates a potentially awkward situation for some senior members of the party who may want to embrace tea party ideals while not officially joining a movement that both critics and supporters view as insurrectionist the house republican leader , representative john a boehner of ohio , will not join the caucus a spokesman , michael steel , said that mr boehner as a personal policy does not join any groups other than the house republican conference , which he leads house democrats have stayed decidedly mum about the new group , although they do not deny being tickled by any discomfort the new group may be causing within the republican ranks in a statement on her web site , ms bachmann said that she was forming the group in an effort to draw attention to core principles of the nation s founders george washington once said , the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon ms bachmann wrote in her statement sadly , it seems today that the constitution is no longer at the forefront guiding congress if the reckless runaway spending , expansive government overreach , and excessive amounts of debt we have piled on our future generations are any indication i called for a tea party caucus to bring members attention to the cries of everyday americans who are asking for a return to the fundamental principles contained within our nation s greatest document , the constitution she added , americans from all locations and backgrounds have united through tea parties to spread the timeless messages of fiscal responsibility and limited government and i have talked to many people who felt discouraged because no one in washington , dc , seemed willing to listen this caucus will change that sentiment and ensure the voices of the people are carried through the halls of congress an aide to ms bachmann said that while the inaugural meeting would be held in the morning , tea would probably not be served this is not a gimmicky thing , the aide said

grounds out weakly to rodriguez at third yankees win , 65 andrus does bunt nice bunt it rolled up the firstbase line it was in the grass , not the dirt , so it looked like it would stay fair teixeira didn t take the chance and made a nice play , looping a throw over the runner and getting the out one out , man on second michael young \( 2 for 4 , 2 rbi \) batting mariano rivera to work the ninth with a 65 lead greg golson replaces nick swisher in right field the rangers send up mitch moreland to pinchhit for cantu he hits a slow grounder to robinson cano s right it s in a good spot and it gets through for a leadoff single cano was playing moreland toward first to pull elvis andrus batting he bunts foul on a 11 pitch , so now he s swinging swisher is up there bunting he fouled off the first and it looked like he tried to bunt the second , but it s a ball , 11 and swisher pops a bunt up to the catcher molina in foul territory on the firstbase side a wasted chance and atbat for swisher mark teixeira batting with one out on a 32 count , teixeira flies out to cruz in shallow right field the rangers conference on the mound , trying to decide whether to have holland pitch to

no 9 , spot \( cantu \) followed by andrus , young and josh hamilton in the hole the rangers really move players around benji molina is in to catch the ninth for the rangers from left to right , the outfield is now david murhpy , josh hamilton and nelson cruz the yankees have the top of the order , jeter , swisher , teixeira , as they look for an insurance run and jeter doubles over hamilton s head in center field man on second , none out an insurance run would be huge for the yankees so for wood , the walk and pickoff on 32 counts , david murphy fouled off three pitches before grounding out to teixeira at first , and now julio borbon , a singles hitter , is pinchhitting for treanor borbon likes to bunt , but wood has him 02 wood throws a slow curve that almost hits borbon s back knee he doesn t budge on a 12 pitch , borbon strikes out swinging dave robertson also warming up and kinsler was picked off first ! wood picked him off by about three yards he was way off first he must have been going mark teixeira runs him to second , throws to jeter , who tags him as he heads back to first that s a big break for the yankees the rangers lose their leadoff runner and the yankees get an out kerry wood enters the game to pitch the eighth inning boone logan is warming in the bullpen the leadoff hitter , ian kinsler , walks on four pitches this rally all began on brett gardner s hustle play to beat out an infield hit the yankees have put seven straight batters on base the stadium is a bit quieter , and nolan ryan is looking frustrated in the stands on a 32 pitch , posada flies out to deep right field nelson cruz caught it with a little bunny hop and then hit the wall posada just missed one but , robinson cano tagged up and went to third so the yankees have first and third with one out granderson is batting derek holland is pitching , by the way he s a lefthander , too in the excitement , i don t think i mentioned him he came in before thames s single granderson strikes out on a 32 pitch , bringing up gardner , who started the inning two out , first and third gardner grounded out to short to end the inning but what an inning five runs , five hits , one of the biggest innings in yankees playoff baseball so , to reset , the score is tied , 55 , first and third with none out marcus thames at bat the rangers are playing the infield halfway thames lines a single to left field rodriguez scores yankees have scored five runs in the eighth inning to take a 65 lead first and second , still nobody out robinson cano singles to center on the first pitch from clay rapada , who replaced darren o day mark teixeira scored when center fielder josh hamilton couldn t field it cleanly error on hamilton allowed rodriguez to go to third so first and third , none out yankees 5 , rangers 5 darren o day , a righthander , comes in to replace darren oliver , who walked swisher and teixeira on full counts rodriguez rips a single past the third baseman on o day s first pitch two runs score the yankees still have first and second with none out on a 32 count , mark teixeira walks to load the bases with none out alex rodriguez comes to the plate i hate to say this , but i think i hear vuvuzelas oliver walks swisher with swisher on first and jeter on second , teixeira is the tying run none out rangers replace c j wilson with darren oliver , 40 years old with jeter on second , he will face swisher , teixeira and rodriguez pat borzi wrote about oliver in friday s times  wilson starts gardner off with a firstpitch strike , of course gardner grounds to cantu s right at first gardner dives headfirst , beating wilson to the bag derek jeter doubles down the leftfield line and gardner scores all the way from first it took a weird hop off the wall in foul territory down the line , and murphy had to retrieve it rangers 5 , yankees 2 dustin moseley still pitching xander from san francisco tells us texas s win expectancy is now 97 percent for the game what do you think about the win expectancy statistic \? how do you feel about vladimir guerrero this season \? he really couldn t run with the angels last year , but he looked a lot better in the rangers division series with the rays moseley has an easy inning he adds two more strikeouts \( hamilton and cruz \) and now has four in two innings c j wilson is usually tough on lefthanders except tonight he s tough on righthanders he s pounding the strike zone \( thanks , cliff lee \) , often getting firstpitch strikes , often on fastballs cano hit a 11 breaking ball for the home run that was the first home run by a lefty off c j wilson since 2008 in fact , three of the yankees four hits tonight were by lefthanders it s a strange game rangers 5 , yankees 1 robinson cano hits a line drive that curls around the rightfield foul pole , giving the yankees their first run of the game treanor flied out to center against moseley , but the next batter , jorge cantu , hit a hard grounder to third that alex rodriguez booted it was hit to his right , and he got in front of it , but the ball hit off the heel of his glove and kicked into left field elvis andrus struck out , bringing up michael young \( 2 for 3 , 2 rbi \) young struck out too that was a nice inning by moseley three outs around the rodriguez error but if he doesn t come back out for the seventh , we ll know girardi s strategy the rest of the game with his bullpen rangers 5 , yankees 0 the righthander dustin moseley will pitch the bottom of the sixth joba chamberlain looked good in his one inning , and could have stayed in , but it appears yankees manager joe girardi is trying to shake off the rust for some of the players on the roster we may see other relievers c j wilson has another 123 inning swisher , teixeira , rodriguez the yankees nos 1 through 4 hitters are 0for12 with three strikeouts wilson s line is impressive six innings , three hits , two walks , three strikeouts he has thrown 83 pitches dustin moseley warming up for yankees in a game devoid of strategy so far , the rangers pinchhit for the righthanded right fielder jeff francoeur with the lefthanded david murphy in the fifth inning murphy flies out to gardner in left , so joba chamberlain faces four batters in the fifth \( he walked nelson cruz on a full count \) joba chamberlain will pitch the bottom of the fifth talk about rest or rust , chamberlain hasn t pitched since oct 3 in an 84 loss to the red sox what s that \? eleven days rest \? sabathia leaves with four innings pitched , six hits , five runs \( all earned \) , four walks , three strikeouts , a balk , a wild pitch , 93 pitches it would be tough to bring sabathia back in game 4 because then the yankees would also have to pitch hughes and pettitte on short rest , and i don t think they want to do that curtis granderson leads off with a walk on a 32 pitch that s wilson s second walk of the game brett gardner grounds to third michael young tries to go around the horn , but they get only granderson at second for the first out gardner beat out the double play derek jeter coming up the game has slowed down with wilson keeping an eye on gardner at first this time jeter hits a ground ball , to short , and the rangers do turn the double play c c sabathia was still in the dugout that halfinning , so we ll see if the yankees bring in joba chamberlain or not on wild pitch , michael young goes to third i think that s only sabathia s first wild pitch of the game , officially on the other bad pitch , with the bases loaded , the runner trying to score from third was out , so i don t think that counts as a wild pitch josh hamilton strikes out to end the inning so , sabathia has thrown over 90 pitches already his line is four innings , six hits , five runs , four walks , three strikeouts i think you take him out here and bring him back on three days rest , even though the yankees said they would pitch a j burnett in game 4 rangers 5 , yankees 0 michael young delivers a tworun double past nick swisher in right , giving the rangers a 50 lead from the ballpark , ben shpigel points out that the yankees were losing by three runs to the twins in game 1 he can t tell who was sharper through four innings the twins liriano or the rangers wilson alex from brooklyn says he has wilson on his fantasy team and he typically has four or five solid innings before the bottom drops out in the meantime , the rangers have michael young coming up with two on \( singles by matt treanor and elvis andrus \) and two out with cano on second and thames on first , posada lines out to nelson cruz in left field , so the inning is over posada hit it hard , but it wasn t a tough play for cruz , who came in on it c j wilson continues to throw firstpitch strikes to the yankees teixeira pops out to short and alex rodriguez strikes out the rangers fans boo rodriguez and teixeira contrast that with the way yankees fans welcomed johnny damon and hideki matsui at the stadium this year i guess the fans really want this so , robinson cano singles to right field with two out and now only lefties , cano , gardner and granderson , have reached base against the tough lefthander wilson marcus thames hits a soft single to left field near the line first and second , two out , with jorge posada coming up with the infield in , nelson cruz grounds out hard to rodriguez at third arod knocks it down , the runner holds , and arod fires to first kinsler grounds out to short to end the inning still rangers 3 , yankees 0 sabathia is battling as ben shpigel points out from the ballpark , even though the yankees got two on in the top of the third , c j wilson threw only 13 pitches and before his hit , granderson was 0 for 6 with three strikeouts against wilson sabathia walks the leadoff hitter , josh hamilton , and goes to 32 on guerrero , who swings at everything he strikes out swinging , but hamilton was running on the play posada s throw to cano was way off to the shortstop side , and hamilton was safe and now sabathia balks runner to third , one out infield in jorge posada grounds out curtis granderson , who led the yankees in the division series with five hits in 11 atbats , singles off wilson that s his first hit off wilson in his career so his hot bat in the postseason continues , and he also continues his success against lefties and now brett gardner walks so the yankees have first and second with one out and jeter coming up the yankees have speed on the bases and the top of the order coming up but jeter swings at the first pitch and hits a soft fly to center two out nick swisher is up the tying run is at home plate , but at the very least , the yankees would like to chip away at the lead but swisher pops up between third and home , and the rally is over nice hustle by granderson though with two out he was almost on home plate \( from second \) before the ball came down sabathia started off the inning with unfavorable counts , but he came back with some nice breaking balls to strike out michael young to end the inning so that s a 123 inning for the yankees , but sabathia needs to hold the rangers there in the meantime , c j wilson has faced the minimum six batters through two xander from san francisco writes i m looking at the pitchtrax on mlbcom s postseason tv and a lot of the pitches thrown by cc that were called balls early on in the first inning were strikes i think it threw him off has anyone else noticed that \? sabathia threw 35 pitches in the first and without the lucky bounce off the backstop , who knows how many more \? elvis andrus made a nice catch in shallow left field on a pop by robinson cano arod struck out to lead off and marcus thames line out to left the rangers look sharp another 123 inning , the fans are waving white towels it s a party in texas rangers 3 , yankees 0 sabathia did get him on the left arm before cruz s foot hit the plate terrific call at home the yankees got a huge break the rangers could have broken the game open there sabathia throws a wild pitch with the bases loaded , but the ball bounces hard off the back stop and sabathia tags out cruz trying to score oh my i don t know how he got there in time we ll see what the replay will tell us an ugly inning for sabathia a big hit would have killed the yankees but the batter never got a chance rangers 3 , yankees 0 so , the concern entering the game was whether c c sabathia would be sharp after eight days rest and we now have our answer to the rust or rest question when a pitcher feels too strong and andy pettitte has said this happens to him too he feels overpowering and throws the fastball high sabathia s home run pitch to hamilton was above the belt , a lot of his pitches have been up , and a lot have been out of the strike zone this is a nightmarish inning for sabathia he walks ian kinsler on a 32 count , so it s first and second with one out francoeur popped to jeter infield fly rule was called and matt treanor walks that s the third walk of the inning for sabathia bases loaded , two out and now vladimir guerrero takes sabathia deep but curtis granderson corrals it in front of the wall for the first out nelson cruz follows with a single to right field that swisher fields on a hop so , to recap walk , single , home run long out , single a rough first inning for sabathia one out , man on first does c c sabathia have his rhythm \? he walked the leadoff hitter , elvis andrus , and michael young singled into the leftcenter gap two batters , two 31 counts and josh hamilton lines a threerun home run to right field right down the line rangers , 3 , yankees 0 c j wilson gets off to a fast start , sandwiching groundouts to third by derek jeter and mark teixeira around nick swisher s strikeout looking game 1 , yankees at rangers , has begun the yankees will begin the 2010 american league championship series against the texas rangers on friday night at rangers ballpark in arlington visit this blog for updates and ingame analysis c c sabathia , who is 41 over all in two postseasons as a yankee , will face c j wilson , a lefthander who was 158 this season with a 335 earned run average , but 01 with a 565 era in three games against the yankees the rangers ace , cliff lee , won t pitch until game 3 because he pitched the decisive game 5 of texas division series against the tampa bay rays wilson , a reliever last year , allowed nine walks in 141 innings against the yankees and was hurt by high pitch counts he is tough on lefties curtis granderson and brett gardner are a combined 0 for 11 against him , and they will bat eighth and ninth in the lineup wilson has said the addition of the lefthanded ace lee has helped him this season he said lee s influence on him has been great , even joking to reporters that before lee was traded to the rangers this season , i was actually a righthanded second baseman hard to believe but home teams have a 411 record in this postseason the road team won each of the five games in the rangers division series victory over tampa bay , for example according to elias sports bureau , that s the lowest winning percentage for home teams \( 267 \) for home teams during the division series since the inception of the wild card the worst part of the yankees not having any home field advantage throughout the playoffs \( the world series home team was decided by the allstar game , so there was no chance of that \) might be the dates fans have to trek out to the stadium on monday , tuesday and wednesday \( if necessary \) , while texas fans get four weekend dates the yankees fiveday gap between games was one more day than their span between the division series and the championship series last year in 1996 the yankees actually went six days between the alcs and the world series , which they won , beating atlanta in six games c c sabathia is pitching on eight days rest , and it is widely believed that he is sharper with lots of innings and regular rest wilson , 29 , will pitch on seven days rest he won his first career postseason start last thursday in game 2 of the division series , a 60 victory at tampa bay so , on the plus side , the yankees got to align their rotation and rest their veterans the rangers could not , which is the reason cliff lee will not pitch until game 3 but the rangers are fresh off their first postseason series win , and must be invigorated by that here are game 1 s starting lineups
as a followup to last week s posts on the historical trends in priestly sex abuse in the united states , i ve been trying to find similar data on the irish sex abuse scandal as far as i can tell , none of the many reports that have been issued in the last decade \( the ferns report , the murphy report , etc \) contain a chronological accounting comparable to what the john jay report did for the american catholic church \( though if i m missing something , please point it my way \) the closest thing i ve found is the commission to inquire into child abuse s report on ireland s religiousrun reform schools , which solicited claims of abuse from irishborn adults educated in those schools between 1914 and 1999 here s how brendan o neill , the editor of britain s spiked online , summarizes the findings for that 85year period , 253 claims of sexual abuse were made by males and 128 by females the number of sexual abuse claims in these institutions fell for the more recent period for males , there were 88 claims from the pre1960s , 119 from 1960 to 1969 , 37 from 1970 to 1979 , and nine from 1980 to 1989 the alleged sexualabuse incidents ranged in seriousness from boys being questioned and interrogated about their sexual activity to being raped there were 68 claims of anal rape in reform institutions for boys from 1914 to 1999 not all of the sexual abuse was carried out by priests around 65 per cent of the claims pertain to religious workers , and 35 per cent to lay staff , care workers , and fellow pupils this is a different pattern from the john jay data the alleged incidents peak in the 60s , rather than the 70s , and a higher percentage involve maleonfemale sexual assault note , though , that this is data from a distinctive set of religiousrun institutions \( which had no real american equivalent \) , rather than from the irish church as a whole note , too , that unlike the jay data these numbers include allegations of abuse against laypeople as well as priests so i m hesitant to draw any conclusions about what this pattern tells us \( or doesn t \) about similarities and differences between the american and irish experiences spiked s o neill , i should note , has no such hesitation when it comes to speculating about why irish abuse allegations are highest in the 60s a libertarian atheist who s no admirer of catholicism , he s a much fiercer critic of what he sees as the hysteria surrounding the scandal , and the culture of victimhood that it s abetting thus this analysis in ireland the state has explicitly invited its citizens to redefine themselves as victims of authority rather than as active agents capable of moving on and making choices the commission to inquire into child abuse discusses at length the debilitating impact that abuse can have on individuals , to the extent that many of ireland s social problems including unemployment , poverty , drug abuse and heavy drinking are now discussed as the products of ireland s earlier era of abuse rather than as failings of the contemporary social system this , i believe , is why claims of sexual abuse in ireland s religiouseducational institutions were so much higher for the period of 1960 to 1969 \( nearly half of all claims of sexual abuse against boys during the period of 1914 to 1989 were made for that decade \) it is not because priests suddenly became more abusive in the 1960s than they had been in the far harsher ireland of the 1940s and 50s , but because the people who attended the institutions during that period were in many ways the main targets of the commission to inquire into child abuse they would have been in their mid40s to mid50s when the commission began in 1999 and many of them had suffered longterm unemployment , health problems , and other disappointments reporting their misfortunes to the commission offered them the chance , not only of getting financial compensation , but also of validating their difficult life experiences as a consequence of their having been abused in a grotesquely convenient marriage , the state redefined social problems as consequences of catholic abuse and the individual redefined himself as a sufferer from low selfesteem who did not bear full responsibility for the course of his adult life in such a climate , not only are incidents of abuse by priests more likely to surface , but they are also more likely to be heavily politicised , turned from undoubtedly distressing and possibly criminal acts into modernday examples of evil capable of distorting society itself thus did the contemporary cult of victimhood ensure that catholic abuse was blown out of proportion whether you find this persuasive and provocative or offensive and outrageous , you should definitely read the whole piece
indianapolis the probably will not hold up saturday night s game as a monument to avoiding rust during a playoff bye week , considering that ed reed improbably intercepted twice on the same thirdquarter drive but after nearly a month at the center of the debate about whether teams should rest their starters in meaningless games and whether their own history of shaky playoff performances suggested they made the wrong choice the colts provided the answer this time , it worked for them the colts beat the , , in a somnolent american football conference divisional round game , the first time in four tries in the manning era they have won a playoff game after having a firstround bye as the conference s top seed , they will host the winner of the chargersjets game next sunday in the afc championship game for the right to go to the  i thought being healthy was important , manning said , offering the final word on resting the starters there was this myth you ca n't win at home after the bye week if the colts did not produce the pinpoint accuracy that characterized many of their regularseason games , they did not need to because the ravens summoned none of the energy on offense that allowed them to last week instead , the colts followed their preferred script perfectly they jumped to a lead with two manning touchdown passes in the final two minutes of the first half and held on the ravens , after an impressive first drive that included several passes and ended in a field goal to give them an early tie , were startlingly onedimensional for the rest of the game , relying almost exclusively on running back ray rice to rush and catch short passes from joe flacco but the fast colts defense was able to catch rice on the edges and never allowed him to break the big plays that he did to stymie the patriots last week he had just 67 yards rushing and another 60 yards receiving these guys move the entire game , said of the colts' defense we do n't see this on a regular basis everything we see is a 34 front they play a spread offense , and they have a speed defense flacco had been battling a hip injury , and he struggled with his accuracy after those first few passes , completing 20 of 35 for 189 yards on two early drives in the second quarter , the ravens could not get a first down to move them from deep in their own territory they gained just 9 yards on nine plays in the quarter giving the colts the opening for a long , clockchewing drive early in the game , , who seemed to dislike the decision to forgo a try at an undefeated season when he was against the jets , showed no ill effects from the long layoff when the colts were caught in no man s land , facing fourthand4 from the baltimore 35 too long for a field goal , too close for a punt manning hit joseph addai along the sideline for a first down then he launched a perfect 10yard corner fade to the rookie receiver austin collie for a touchdown that drive consumed eight minutes and surely left the ravens' defense exhausted the kind of thing the ravens had hoped to do to the colts , but could not and gave the colts a 103 lead because the ravens cannot score points quickly , they had hoped to keep the colts off the field as much as possible but when the ravens got the ball back after the colts touchdown , they could not get a first down again two incomplete passes by flacco did them in and the colts got the ball with 1 minute 26 seconds remaining that was all manning needed to produce a clinic in the hurryup offense he hit one short pass after another and then the ravens selfdestructed a pass interference call on the ravens' domonique foxworth gave the colts the ball at the ravens' 14yard line an unnecessaryroughness call for a helmettohelmet hit by ray lewis which almost surely prevented a touchdown catch by collie gave the colts the ball at the 7yard line and then , with seven seconds remaining in the half , manning waved off the field goal unit for one more pass to him , the decision was a nobrainer the ravens were dropping eight defenders into coverage , compressing the space manning had to work with he wanted to either throw into the end zone or throw the ball away quickly , so that enough seconds would be left to kick a field goal but when the colts broke the huddle , manning , reggie wayne and dallas clark were still talking about what play might work best what do you think \? ' manning said they were saying to one another it was a little recess playground to me , it was n't even a thought to attempt a field goal , said manning , who completed 30 of 44 passes for 246 yards and 2 touchdowns manning drilled a pass to wayne at the goal line for a 3yard touchdown pass and a lead that , for a ravens offense that will probably spend the offseason trying to find more downfield threats , was insurmountable he s done it enough times , he s been around the block , colts coach jim caldwell said of manning we trust him the ravens , whose defense remains the cornerstone of the team , might have had one last gasp in the thirdquarter drive in which reed had his two interceptions but the first was foiled when reed , who had jumped in front of a pass intended for pierre garcon , was chased down and stripped by garcon the other was undone by a pass interference call on corey ivy the colts survived the onslaught that left the ravens weary from all those wasted return yards then the colts tacked on a final insult a field goal that at that point seemed superfluous , who has been bothered by injuries this season , said after the game that he was considering retirement and put his chances of returning at 5050 the colts had chafed all week at the constant reminders of the and by week s end , caldwell had told his players to stop answering questions about the decision to pull the starters against the jets but the colts had also adjusted their approach they did not rest starters as much as they had in previous years , and they practiced harder than usual during the bye , unspoken affirmation that they knew something was wrong those other years in eight previous playoff appearances this decade , the colts failed to win one game five times the franchise that won more regularseason games than any other team in the decade had nabbed just one lombardi trophy but now , with perfection and the pressure of surviving a firstround bye gone , the colts have done what they always said they wanted to do position themselves for the only goal that matters another super bowl like the topseeded saints , who will host the nfc championship game next sunday , they were rested and now they are ready
adrian , mich the stone family , and the fiercely militant christian group that revolved around them at a ramshackle homestead outside of town here , were best known by their neighbors for their active use of guns and their increasingly heated talk about fighting back violently against the government but their biggest and most surprising adversary was practically next door the local branch of the michigan militia from a distance , the two might seem like peas in a pod both wear fatigues or camouflage , train in the woods with heavy weaponry and believe in threats to liberty from washington but here on the ground the distinctions were crucial the michigan militia , which in past years had links to extremist groups with neonazi flavorings , has moderated over the years , according to members and experts who track the organizations meanwhile , the \( pronounced hutaray \) , as the stone group was called , was going the other direction , with increasing talk of violence the crucial moment of that tension came saturday night when one of the stone family members desperate and on the run from the law called the local militia commander , matt savino , and begged for help in getting guns or shelter mr savino offered neither , not only refusing to help but in fact calling the state police , who passed the call to the this was a new situation for us , and we did what we thought was right , mr savino said led by a former high school marching band member , nine people in the hutaree group have been arrested in raids since saturday , linked to what federal law enforcement officials said was a plot to kill a police officer and then foment violence at the ensuing funeral eight pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in detroit on wednesday the decision to help the police corner the hutaree though mr savino said he was not sure his tip made any difference has drawn flak from some other militia members in michigan and around the country , but mr savino remains comfortable with his call some people have said , those are your brothers , ' stuff like that , said mr savino , 34 , a former assistant manager at a gnc nutrition and health products store , who is currently unemployed the problem is , most of those people are n't here , they do n't know those people , and they do n't know what that group is a spokeswoman for the fbi in detroit , sandra r berchtold , confirmed that agents spoke to mr savino , but she declined to say what sort of information he provided the context of hutaree life in and around adrian , where guns and resentment of federal authority is fairly common , is crucial to understanding the hutaree and the stones , many people in the area say yes , they shot guns , did skirmish exercises on their land and hosted regular monthly meetings of people in militaristic clothing , said one neighbor but they also kept to themselves , and their talk was deemed by many people to be just that we never thought they were dangerous , said jane ream , 68 , who lives just up the road with her husband , dick and lots of people shoot guns that s normal around here so you do n't pay any attention to it several people who have known the stones for years said they were unsure what , if anything , might have transformed angry rhetoric into what the released on monday by the department of justice on monday called an active conspiracy against law enforcement the retired principal at the school that david b stone sr , 45 , the patriarch and leader of the group , attended in of 21 , 000 people about 60 miles southwest of detroit , remembered the young mr stone as a child who stayed in the middle and did n't get noticed , or in trouble either the principal , richard g butler , 79 , who worked his whole career in adrian schools , said mr stone pictured in a yearbook in the early 1980s with short hair and a flamboyant vest loved motorcycle dirt bikes and played in the band all through high school , marching on the field and playing on stage as well squinting at an old yearbook on a recent evening here on his porch overlooking the woods , mr butler could not remember what instrument mr stone played , and the band picture did not help since the young man stood in the back but never , he added , did mr stone seem like a person headed for trouble whatever happened to him happened after high school , mr butler said the michigan militia also changed over the years , mr savino and other militia members said , especially since the early 1990s , when the name became associated with an earlier wave of antigovernment angst after the election of president bill clinton , a democrat , in 1992 some militia groups in michigan then had a strain of vehement antisemitism , in particular , that has mostly faded over the years as more radical members left , said mark potok , who tracks extremist groups at the people like mr savino and his father , jim gulliksen , who is the chief executive officer and like his son , a navy veteran said they have worked since then to distinguish the group from its past estimates of statewide michigan militia membership range from several hundred people to 500 or more my goal is to get the militia name clean , said mr gulliksen , 60 , who works as a manager in the paint and hardware department at the local walmart the strict christian dogma espoused by the hutaree does not fly as well these days either , at least in adrian militia circles mr savino said that he converted to islam in the late 1990s after a soulsearching separation from the lutheran faith he had grown up with , and that he believed that he was the only muslim in the militia but people across the militia world , and people like mr potok who study it , agree that anxiety within that world is rising from economic frustrations growing out of the recession , or fear of the democratic party leadership in washington , or both and that small , outlier groups like the hutaree are probably the ones to keep on eye on one longtime friend of the stones who also got a call for help last weekend from a hutaree leader did say yes the friend , robert c m dudley , 80 , said he met mr stone 10 or 15 years ago at a weekly dinner for people to talk about what s wrong with the country when mr stone s son joshua knocked on mr dudley s door on saturday night , seeking help , mr dudley said he let him and the group of people he was with sleep in their van but he said he thought it wise not to ask too many questions i figured it was none of my business , he said joshua stone was ultimately tracked to the property and arrested on monday

belgrade lakes , me the national bereavement over the death of j d salinger provided a strangely public moment in the career of a writer who 'd become best known , in recent years , for his reclusiveness there are other american writers famous for shunning the public eye thomas pynchon leaps to mind but mr salinger s seclusion was unique by the end of his life , he may have become better known for his solitude than for his imagination in a way , nothing succeeds like invisibility in america , we revere artists who wo n't do the thing they 're famous for we revere glenn gould , who gave up performing greta garbo , who gave up acting and michael jordan , who not only gave up basketball \( at which he was gifted \) , but then , perversely , took up baseball \( at which he was not \) the more steadfastly they refuse us , the more infuriatingly desirable they become , like that boy we just know loves us but who cannot bring himself to call how can the satirist tom lehrer , who long ago gave up performing music for teaching mathematics , not miss writing songs like poisoning pigeons in the park \? \( whenever he s asked when he will return to his musical career , mr lehrer likes to reply , oh , did hell freeze over \? \) there is a marvelous peace in not publishing , mr salinger told the times in 1974 publishing is a terrible invasion of my privacy i love to write but i write just for myself and my own pleasure as a teacher of writing , i frequently hear young authors echo mr salinger s words , that they 're writing primarily to satisfy themselves it s hard to disagree with that on the surface writing can be great fun but to create fiction or nonfiction , for that matter without any thought of a reader seems creepy to me , the ultimate exercise in selfindulgence of course , we all yearn to live in that kind of selfcontained world , now and again there is plenty to envy about an imaginative universe detached from the world of commerce writing just for oneself and one s own pleasure \? nice work if you can get it what i suspect , though , is that fame through invisibility may well belong to a generation that is passing , or passed in contemporary america , a writer s life is more than just the endless , thankless task of writing itself , which e b white is said to have called hard work and bad for the health there is also the humiliating , cringeinducing necessity of becoming a public person , of book tours and radio interviews and , if you 're extremely lucky \( as i was \) , a trip to oprah s couch \( or in my case , four \) there were a lot of things on my mind when i wrote she s not there , my memoir of being transgender , during a particularly cold maine winter , but the green room of the today show was n't one of them yet there i was , a year or two later , with the actress lucy liu looking over at me and saying i have a new movie what are you on for \? sex change , i said , and wondered how it was that i had wound up in this situation was this what it means now , to be a person of letters \? discussing one s genitalia with an actress from charlie s angels \? when j d salinger disappeared , invisibility was still a perfectly viable if enigmatic way to be a successful literary figure in america but now that the desperate economics of publishing more or less demand that public relations become part of a writer s professional toolkit , being a recluse is a harder stunt to pull off in order to sustain their careers , plenty of shy , awkward authors people who chose this profession for the very reason that it s fundamentally a private activity have sacrificed their solitude for web sites , blogs , twitter accounts and videos of themselves on youtube somehow , these items were n't on the syllabus in john barth s class at johns hopkins i 've always thought of encountering readers of having any readers at all as an unbelievable gift giving lectures , signing books , sitting hopefully behind a table at a bookstore in wichita falls these rituals may be humbling , but i 've never forgotten the fact that thousands of unpublished writers in this country would give anything to be humiliated in exactly this way of all the mortifications to be found in an author s life , probably none hurts as much as the kind you get from not being able to share your work with another soul in the catcher in the rye , holden caulfield famously observes , what really knocks me out is a book that , when you 're all done reading it , you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours what was sad and strange about j d salinger is not that he did n't want to be our terrific friend it s that , at the pinnacle of his fame , he yearned for the very thing many writers fear most a world without readers
reluctant to embrace the spotlight , particularly if english is being spoken there , has been well served this week as he has prepared to defend his title although cabrera s story an improbable rise from impoverished caddie to twotime major champion remains a compelling tale , as this tournament begins thursday nothing is as compelling to the golf world and beyond as s return after his free fall from grace even in cabrera s appreciative home country of argentina , he is not the sports topic of the week not in a week when lionel messi , argentina s diminutive soccer savant , scored all four of barcelona s goals in a champion s league mismatch against arsenal on tuesday night it does n't matter to ngel , but there s no doubt that he 'll be more under the radar than your usual defending champion , said charlie epps , cabrera s american swing coach and confidant even when cabrera won at augusta national last year , it seemed to be much more about kenny perry s losing his touch and his twoshot lead down the stretch than about cabrera s keeping his cool but how can it be a coincidence that cabrera a balding , bearish , 40yearold who is much more deft than he appears keeps coming up with the major trophy under crushing pressure \? he acquired his first at the 2007 he then did it again last year at the masters , conjuring a great escape among the trees on the first hole of the suddendeath playoff with perry and chad campbell blocked by a tree trunk after his errant tee shot on 18 , cabrera took a wideeyed whack at his ball and ended up finding refuge in the fairway , eventually salvaging par and then winning the tournament on the next playoff hole returning to augusta this week , he made sure to visit that tree with his son angelito , who will be caddying for him this week honestly , i'm the one who wanted to go see that shot , but he was a perfect excuse , cabrera said of his son he said no you 're crazy there s nothing there to shoot at' it was a rare moment of levity at an otherwise matteroffact news conference , one in which the argentine , speaking in spanish , declined to dip his toe into the tiger trap they can talk about anybody , he said they can talk about tiger , but the masters is the masters , and we have to give that importance to the masters as the masters even , the retired 70yearold golf icon who generally graces every query with a thorough answer , declined repeatedly to address woods s travails well , it s been none of my business , so i 've stayed away from it , frankly , said nicklaus , a sixtime masters champion whose career record of 18 major tournament victories remains catnip to woods , now holding at 14 but even with the emphasis more than ever on woods , the masters a carefully tended symbol of american privilege is an evermore international experience the last two champions have been nonamericans trevor immelman of south africa and cabrera in the 96player field this year , as last year , the international players have the numerical edge , with 51 players to 45 from the united states it should come as no surprise then that the cast in the main interview room on tuesday was resolutely cosmopolitan , with the 10 men who came in for questioning hailing from five continents there were americans like phil mickelson , steve stricker and cink there was the australian geoff ogilvy and south korea s han changwon , an amateur who took advantage of a new route into the masters field by winning the inaugural asian amateur title last year there was also matteo manassero , the reigning and engaging european amateur champion who , at 16 , is the youngest player in masters history and one of a record three italians in the field , with the brothers edoardo and francesco molinari cabrera made some history of his own last year , becoming the first south american to win at augusta he might not have had that honor if his argentine compatriot roberto de vicenzo had not signed an incorrect scorecard at the 1968 masters , costing himself a spot in an 18hole playoff with bob goalby de vicenzo , now 86 and living in buenos aires , said he cried with delight when he watched on television last year as cabrera donned his green jacket , but cabrera and de vicenzo are rarely in contact they are from different generations , economic backgrounds and addresses , with cabrera still living in villa allende , near argentina s second city of cordoba from a poor family , cabrera s parents left him in the care of his grandmother as a child it was another mouth to feed , and in argentina , there s a lot of poverty and so he had to sacrifice his education to put food on the table , epps said at the age of 10 , ngel became a caddie , and he 'd caddie every day , he added , and he said that at the end of the day , they 'll give me a bologna sandwich and send me home , and he 'd get home at night and his grandmother would give him a hard roll and a cup of tea i always like to say that the young kids in the united states , they dream about winning the masters , but when ngel was a young boy , he was dreaming about food cabrera was a caddie at the cordoba golf club , the same place where epps , years before , had played regularly as a teenager when his american father worked in argentina for kaiser motor company in the 1950s as a fluent spanish speaker with strong connections to cordoba and villa allende , epps was a natural mentor for cabrera when they begin working together on his weak point putting in 2007 not long after , cabrera won the united states open he knew where i was coming from , and i think that s what bonded us together , cabrera said cabrera is now a member of the golf club that once would not allow him into the clubhouse he is now the head of his own foundation and a symbol of upward mobility in a country where golf remains largely a sport for the elite for epps , it is cabrera s demanding childhood that molded him into a pressure player , but he still needed to learn the technique and mental tricks that would provide him with a base one thing about caddying is you learn first with your eyes , epps said you 're almost deprived from playing , and you caddie six days a week and then you get a chance to play on monday i always like to tell people that ngel s favorite club in his golf bag is a 7iron , because that s the only thing he had when he was a boy he came out of poverty , he added but it drives certain people ngel learned by watching other people play judging from last year s masters , where he was under par every round , he is a gifted observer
lucio gonzalez , a 33yearold unemployed truck driver from a tough part of fairfield , said he was scared to look out the door at night , but not because of the area s gangs he thinks he will be a casualty of police efforts to control gang activity i feel like the police are going to kick in the door , said mr gonzalez , who has a 2yearold son who is going to watch my kid if they take me away \? i'm paranoid , looking out the window like , are they out there right now \? they take pictures of me , of my cars and my house they constantly pull me over they give me tickets for everything to the fairfield police , mr gonzalez is a known member of the norte os , a violent street gang they have sought to restrict through a courtordered civil gang injunction he s a threat to the community , said sgt matt bloesch of fairfield police department s gang unit he s associating with gang members , and he is an active member of a gang that s involved in drug trafficking , carrying weapons , putting up graffiti and shooting people mr gonzalez said this characterization was false is he or is n't he \? what might have been a question confined to police investigative units is now ricocheting around a far larger arena , as fairfield and dozens of other california cities have become proving grounds for the latest legal assault on gang violence the gang injunction in fairfield , the injunction gives a judicial imprimatur to barring gang members and gang activity from large swaths of the city , the better to ensure that violence between the norte os and their rivals , the sure os , is curbed and the community is safer from the outbreaks of gunfire that have resulted in 10 killings since 1994 it is no accident that the injunctions have flourished in california there are 236 , 200 gang members in the state , almost onethird of the national total , according to a tracking system set up by the california department of justice but what makes someone a gang member \? that is the question being posed by mr gonzalez and mario huezo , 22 legally there is no single definition to be considered a gang member under state law , a law enforcement official trained in gangs must validate membership by determining that a person falls under at least two criteria from a list that includes selfadmission of gang affiliation , frequenting a gang area , gang dress and tattoos , and using hand signs associated with gangs the american civil liberties union , which has intervened in numerous cases of gang injunctions , put mr huezo and mr gonzalez in touch with paul feuerwerker , a lawyer representing them without a fee in a hearing scheduled for july , a judge will decide whether the men are in fact gang members who should be named in the injunction the judge will also decide at that time whether to make the injunction permanent the issues raised by civil libertarians go well beyond the question of accurately identifying gang members lawyers for the aclu have argued that civil gang injunctions violate a host of constitutional rights , including the first amendment right of freedom of association and due process rights guaranteed by the fifth and 14th amendments gang injunctions function like roving warrants , and they can lead to a lot of racial profiling , said jory steele , managing attorney of the northern california chapter of the aclu fairfield s injunction , which a judge preliminarily approved in july , serves as a restraining order within defined geographic boundaries 419 square miles of downtown \) in which gang members have restricted rights , including a mandatory curfew of 10 pm and rules against associating in public before filing the injunction the police department spent years assembling more than 400 pages of evidence chronicling the activities of gang members , recording tattoos , traffic violations , driveby shootings and any misconduct dating back to 1994 , the year of the first norte o gangrelated homicide in this city of 106 , 500 according to law enforcement officials , mr gonzalez , mr huezo and an estimated 250 others in fairfield are members of the norte os gang , which originated in the state prison system in the 1960s in spanish norte os means northerners , a name given to prisoners from the agricultural and often rural northern parts of the state by the mexican mafia , a prison gang largely made up of latino prisoners from los angeles and more urban parts of southern california allies of the mexican mafia are called sure os , or southerners over time , the gangs moved from the prisons into the streets law enforcement officials say the norte os are known for violent crime , the color red and peddling drugs like heroin , methamphetamine and cocaine within the prison system and on the street the sure os are involved in the same activities , but wear the color blue and have different tattoos the norte os are a violent group of individuals that terrorize the city with shootings , stabbings , graffiti , the list goes on and on , and they do these criminal acts as an entity , as a group , said bryan kim , solano county s deputy district attorney this injunction is an effective tool to prevent that violence before it happens there is no fairfield injunction involving the sure os the first civil gang injunction was filed in 1987 by the los angeles city attorney against a gang known as the playboy gangster crips since then , such injunctions have proliferated , covering parts of at least 40 cities , including five injunctions in san francisco and one filed in february by oakland s city attorney in 1997 the california supreme court upheld gang injunctions as a constitutional means to control street gangs that case involved just four square blocks in san jose , within which none of the gang members lived , but increasingly , gang injunction safety zones have incorporated larger swaths of cities and towns just over 11 percent of fairfield is within the safety zone many of the designated gang members in the injunction live within its borders it s basically all of fairfield , mr huezo said the rich neighborhoods around the perimeter of the city are the only place the gang injunction does not apply when a county judge granted the preliminary gang injunction , mr huezo immediately picked up the phone i was bright enough to contact the aclu , he said i'm not a gang member i'm not who they depict me as i'm not on parole or probation if i was who they say i am , i 'd be in prison , on probation or dead for the judge remove mr huezo and mr gonzalez from the injunction , each must prove that he has had no association with suspected gang members for three years the police say both men have been seen in gang locales and in the company of gang members within that time the two men also have another option for getting off the list , using the injunction s builtin optout provision in that case , it is the district attorney who must decide their status mr gonzalez echoed mr huezo on the effect of the injunction i have so much family here , cousins and aunts and uncles , and we all live in the gang zone , he said now i ca n't see my family i ca n't be out with them because if the police see us they 'll try to label them gang members and harass them , too my family is scared to be around me but sergeant bloesch said it was easy for the police to distinguish innocent associations if mr gonzalez is stopped on his way to church and one of his family members who is a known gang member is in the car with him he said , then obviously they are not doing gang stuff if he s rolling in a car at 3 o'clock in the morning , and he s with other members of the gang and some of them are drunk and they 're wearing red , well now there s a problem gang injunctions are likely to get a closer look in the coming year as the obama administration has taken a keen interest in the problem of gang violence during a visit to oakland last week , attorney general eric h holder jr said combating gang violence was a top priority for this administration and announced that next year the president s budget would include 12 million in new spending on gang and youth violence prevention while both mr huezo and mr gonzalez want to get off fairfield s list of gang members , neither claim complete innocence in 1994 , as a teenager , mr gonzalez was involved in a gang shooting in a fairfield park he pleaded guilty , though he was not the one holding the weapon he spent time in a juvenile jail since then , he has had runins with the police for street fights , public drunkenness , yelling gang slogans and verbally threatening police officers while drunk i 've made mistakes in the past , mr gonzalez said , but i 've paid for my mistakes
the magical run by butler university s fifthseeded basketball team this month has amplified talk of expanding the men s basketball tournament to as many as 96 teams , ostensibly so that more colleges can participate ncaa officials are expected to decide whether to take that step in the coming weeks among the many options , the most obvious plan would include eliminating the national invitation tournament which the ncaa also owns and adding its 32 slots to the ncaa tournament then , the logic goes , more universities would have a chance to earn some of the hundreds of millions of dollars that the ncaa doles out to its members each year expanding the tournament , though , raises a host of questions , including whether teams from midmajor conferences will be any better represented on the court and whether they will earn more ncaa money although expansion is being promoted as a way of helping the midmajor conferences , the 11 major conferences that now receive 76 percent of the ncaa s distributions could end up grabbing an even larger share of the pool the ncaa has debated these questions for years but there is more urgency to find answers because the ncaa has until july 31 to decide whether to opt out of the three years left on its 6 billion contract with a contract that provides about 90 percent of the association s revenue by expanding the tournament , the ncaa could negotiate a new and presumably more lucrative deal with cbs or other networks , including , which broadcasts hundreds of college basketball games on its various networks but not the main draw of the ncaa tournament all things being equal , more games are likely to attract more viewers and more advertisers for the winning bidders some basketball purists oppose a larger tournament but many coaches and college administrators favor the idea if a new deal secures more money for their colleges we 're very mindful that a good portion of our membership has come to rely on that financial stability , so understanding how that can best be preserved is important , said greg shaheen , the senior vice president for basketball and business strategies at the ncaa shaheen said it was too early to say how much more money a new rights deal might bring in , or how it would be shared the ncaa , he said , could decide that it could make more money by not exercising its option and waiting until its contract expires in 2013 by then , the television deals for major league baseball and the nfl will also expire , potentially undermining the ncaa s position as a guiding principle , the general goal is not to leave anyone worse off than they were , shaheen said to achieve that goal while expanding the tournament , the ncaa would need a far more lucrative deal from the networks none of us in the industry quite know what the money will be , said jonathan b lecrone , the commissioner of the horizon league it is the 64 , 000 question cbs is reluctant to lose a marquee event like the ncaa tournament but expanding the tournament to 96 teams would not ensure it would make its money back the extra games would need to generate roughly as much money as its regular primetime programming on those nights the network will have to determine whether two less popular teams from smaller conferences facing off in the first round of an expanded tournament would draw as well as lopsided firstround matchups like syracuse and vermont did this year if an expanded tournament remained on cbs , the network would probably have to strike a deal with a cable partner to carry some of the games if cbs decides not to broadcast the early games , the ncaa could turn to espn and its affiliates , or a third or fourth network but unless a second network bids for those games , espn will have the upper hand in the negotiations even if the ncaa obtains a more lucrative television deal , the midmajor conferences will not necessarily be better off , at least based on the way revenue is currently divided it is possible that the largest conferences will continue to receive most of the revenue the ncaa distributes money to the 31 conferences with teams in the tournament in the form of units the units are calculated by taking the total pool in the basketball fund 1671 million this year and dividing by the number of teams in the tournament plus the number of games played \( except for the championship game \) during the past six years this year , there are 752 units worth 222 , 206 each \( the nit units are worth about 14 , 000 \) how much a conference earns yearly is based on how many of its teams qualified for the tournament and how many games they won over a rolling sixyear period this year , units earned in 2004 will be replaced by those from 2010 , determining the distribution in 2011 the horizon league , for example , has one team in the tournament , butler , which had won four games before saturday s semifinal that means it will receive at least five units , which will be added to the 14 units the league earned from 2005 to 2009 the five new units will replace the one unit earned in 2004 , representing a net gain of four units worth 880 , 000 as a result , it will earn 42 million in 2011 , up from 33 million this year the strongest conferences earn the most because their teams generate the most units the big east took home the most this year , 231 million the horizon league and other midmajor conferences may get an additional team or two into the tournament if the field is expanded to 96 , generating more units and potentially more revenue playing on national television also sells tickets to games at home and promotes a college to prospective recruits making the tournament is a great national platform , said thomas e yeager , the commissioner of the colonial athletic association it gives some credibility to the teams and fans but teams from the eight top conferences would have more chances to add teams in an expanded tournament this season , the big east sent eight teams to the ncaa tournament and five to the nit if all of them qualified in a new format , 13 of the conference s 16 teams would earn units athletic directors from midmajor conferences argue that they could use the extra money , too indeed , in an expanded tournament , they stand a better chance of winning more games , especially if the top 32 teams receive a firstround bye , leaving lowerseeded colleges to play one another in the first round even then , the ncaa could reward the top 32 teams with extra units , offsetting the share of the pool that the midmajor conferences may receive the extra money the top conferences may earn could widen the gap between the wealthiest sports programs and everyone else , critics say these universities already pay their coaches multimilliondollar salaries and spend heavily to recruit high school prospects , and the extra money would probably intensify the practices if past is prologue , these new funds will get fed into growing the size of athletic budgets , paying coaches' salaries , and frankly , the rich get richer , said william e kirwan , the chancellor of maryland s university system and a cochairman of the knight commission on intercollegiate athletics , a watchdog group this does n't alleviate the problem , it will exacerbate the problem

elizabeth , nj kevin boyle jr , whose wit is considerably quicker than his crossover , has been heckled on stages as large as madison square garden and in front of national television cameras for suspected nepotism , but that was for basketball boyle , the senior starting point guard for the topranked high school team in the country , st patrick , last spring at night , he told his mother , kelly , that he was working out instead , he sneaked off to manhattan for openmic nights we joked on the train rides in that he 'd be like entourage , ' said dean kowalski , a former teammate and now a freshman at columbia i 'd be like e , the manager north carolina s dexter strickland , then paired in the backcourt with boyle , listened to his teammate s quick quips at mario s pizzeria around the corner from the school , and said , i 'd pay money just to hear you talk the appearances started in april at the stress factory in new brunswick , nj all of 18 , boyle , known for calling one teammate unibrow and giving out the assistant coach ray miller s cellphone number as his own , talked about keeping it real with a girl and getting tipsy at a bar while on a team trip to south carolina i do n't want to sound like a clown , but it does n't take much to make a bunch of drunk rutgers kids laugh , boyle said the next step was caroline s on broadway he had submitted video from a gotham comedy club performance , and made the lineup then , the former cast member darrell hammond walked in and preempted him boyle went on after hammond completed his set hammond complimented me with a bunch of curse words , said boyle , who has done 13 shows , none since basketball season started tom konchalski , the editor and publisher of the high school basketball index , attended two of his shows , and rated him the third best performer of 12 at caroline s the others play someone else , konchalski said kevin was himself , a 17yearold commenting on things he found funny plus , he can shoot better than hammond the written form is boyle s preferred platform he started writing a screenplay last year , first purchasing a howto guide at barnes noble , then developing dialogue he began by writing a scene between two teenage boys , and has modeled his project after his producing idol judd apatow s the 40yearold virgin he 'd bring apatow dvds over his toothbrush on trips , kowalski said in boyle s final season , the dynamic relationship of father and son , coach and player , has served as a central theme for st patrick , which , in the hoophall classic his father is the coach , and has assembled a chessboard with all the pieces necessary to win a national title but his son , at 5 feet 10 inches , ranks no higher than a rook michael gilchrist is the nation s best junior , according to the senior kyrie irving will play at duke next season boyle , who rebelled by leaving basketball to skateboard in the fourth grade , said he would play in college to attend a school with a film program the elder boyle , who has won five tournament of champions titles in 21 years , added , if i'm guarding him , i'm thinking about where gilchrist is for the double team st benedict s prep coach dan hurley can relate to kevin jr s burden he grew up the son of the legendary st anthony high coach bob hurley and the brother of duke guard bobby hurley in jersey city he struggled to live up to both standards i'm envious of kevin jr , said dan hurley , a sarcastic type who has been described as richard lewis with a clipboard i wish i had his guts the recent passing of the boyle family s patriarch , neil , after a battle with leukemia and several strokes has made kevin jr s time with his father more valuable neil boyle , who served as business manager of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local 675 , was wary of his grandson s humor , at first , but watched a youtube clip while sick , and scouted latenight comics thereafter he offered support after a recent practice , kevin jr , sitting on the gym s stage , began to tear up when he spoke about his grandfather as teammates saw him crying , he cracked a quick explanation sorry about that , he said i think a bug flew in my eye his teammates laughed , but the sentiment was not lost a comedian , hurting in his own way , had lightened the mood again
urbana , ill i had been a professor of entomology for 15 years before i saw my first live bedbug it crawled out of a plastic film canister that had been mailed to me by a distraught student in the boston area who had no idea what it was i was so thrilled to see a live bedbug , i showed it off to every graduate student i ran into that day cimex lectularius a small , flat , wingless , brown ectoparasite that hides in cracks and crevices in human dwellings and emerges under cover of darkness to feast on human blood that was in 1995 , and none of my students had laid eyes on cimex lectularius either a century ago , bedbugs were ubiquitous in new york so much so that their presence in an apartment was n't considered sufficient legal cause for withholding rent bedbugs , one judge remarked in an early 20th century lawsuit against a landlord , can be dealt with by the tenant by processes known to all housewives but with the midcentury advent of synthetic organic insecticides , these insects all but vanished from urban landscapes \( and pretty much every other kind of landscape \) in north america my bostonian bug turned out to be one of many on the forefront of an unprecedented resurgence global travelers now bring in a steady supply from around the world , inconspicuously undeclared in checked bags and carryon luggage today , bedbugs have been found in all 50 states , as well as guam , puerto rico and american samoa , and bedbugrelated calls to pest control operators are escalating at a fantastic rate from june 2009 to june 2010 , there were more than 31 , 000 calls in new york city alone now , bedbugrelated lawsuits can lead to thousands of dollars in punitive damages for mental anguish , embarrassment or humiliation everywhere new yorkers go theaters , stores , offices , schools , trains , ships , hospitals bedbugs go , too , hidden in folds of clothing , bags , backpacks and purses getting rid of them has become more than any housewife could ever be expected to handle even professional pest control operators are struggling to keep up , because bedbugs have become , for the most part , resistant to the old pesticides that once were so effective , and relatively few viable chemical alternatives exist we reserve a special kind of enmity for bedbugs because , though humans generally do not like being anywhere other than at the pinnacle of a food chain , there is a particular horror associated with being consumed while relatively helpless , asleep in what should be the security of one s own bed \( or chair or couch \) with bedbugs , it s personal unlike cockroaches , ants , silverfish and other vermin that are attracted to our possessions , bedbugs are after us and they 're remarkably adept at circumventing our defenses they not only attack while we sleep , but they also inject anesthetics , so as not to awaken us , and anticoagulants , so that in every 10minute feeding they can suck in two to three times their weight in clotfree blood bedbugs win neither praise for their sophisticated technique , nor very much respect for the fact that they do n't carry diseases , as most bloodsucking human ectoparasites do although their bites can cause unrelieved itchiness , bedbugs take only blood and leave no pathogens behind in contrast , lice spread typhus mosquitoes carry the viruses that cause yellow fever , dengue , encephalitis and west nile disease ticks transmit the lyme disease bacterium and fleas can bring the bacterium that causes plague but lack of involvement in spreading disease is hardly an endearing attribute in fact , precious few aspects of bedbug biology are endearing they do n't build their own houses or care for their young , and their sexual practices are bizarre even by insect standards because the female bedbug has no genital opening , the male inseminates her by using his hardened , sharpened genitalia to punch a hole through her abdomen with no elaborate courtship ritual , males in a frenzied pursuit of sexual congress often blunder into and puncture the bodies of other males , occasionally inflicting fatal wounds to top it off , almost every aspect of bedbug behavior is mediated by airborne odorants , almost all of which are , when detected , repulsive to humans what , if anything , is there to like about a bedbug \? they certainly like us we probably have no greater admirers in the insect world they like the way we live , unlike most vertebrates , in permanent homes \( bats and birds , which also build homes , are hosts to several of the bedbug s close relatives \) bedbugs do not discriminate among humans on the basis of race , creed or socioeconomic status , and they 're happy with almost any interior decorating style they are as happy in a french provincial nook as they are in a contemporary cranny the bugs' climate preferences are essentially an exact match to our own , and a small wingless creature could n't ask for a better traveling companion airlines have opened a world of possibilities for a species that ca n't get very far on its own six legs perhaps the one good thing about bedbugs is that they provide a rare point of agreement that transcends race , religion , culture , nationality , tax bracket and party it may be one of the few remaining universal truths urban or rural , red state or blue , everyone agrees it would be great if bedbugs would disappear once more
andy pettitte pitched seven strong innings as the yankees beat the minnesota twins , 52 , on thursday night in game 2 of their american league division series designated hitter lance berkman , in his

the wall in left field delmon young made a nice play , leaping at the wall i don t think it would have gone out alex rodriguez flies out to right looking ahead to the bottom of the ninth , mariano rivera will face the meat of the twins order joe mauer , who is 0 for 3 delmon young , who is 2 for 3 and jim thome , who is 1 for 3 on 32 pitch , curtis granderson hits a bloop into leftcenter field , gardner scores , and the yankees have a 52 lead granderson had a tworun triple in game 1 , and is 3 for 4 today the twins bring in their closer , matt capps , for the ninth it s a smart move even though the twins are losing , 42 , he can get his feet wet in this series , and the teams are off on friday also , the twins need to keep the score at 42 brett gardner leads off with a single to right derek jeter up straight steal \? sacrifice \? jeter swings away , and hits a roller to third base valencia gets jeter at first gardner goes to second now comes the straight steal gardner steals third huge play ok , now let s see if the yankees will get the run in from third this time with less than two out the infield is in granderson hitting kerry wood pitching jj hardy strikes out denard span hits it back to wood two out orlando hudson , whose homer in the sixth , tied the score , 22 , comes up hudson strikes out swinging you can t really have a better inning than that has anyone else noticed that tbs hasn t used that pitch graphic since the berkman strikeout in the seventh \( he doubled right after a close ball strike call extended his atbat \) \? yankees go down easily in the top of the eighth kerry wood is in for andy pettitte , who has been brilliant in the postseason his entire career also , greg golson replaced swisher in right fielder what can you say about andy pettitte \? eightyeight pitches after a 123 inning , including a strikeout of danny valencia , looking , to end the seventh inning pettitte was getting congratulated in the yankees dugout after the inning , so it looks like his night is done the twins bring in reliever matt guerrier to work the eighth jon rauch in to face alex rodriguez with the bases loaded and one out rauch is a location pitcher he strikes out rodriguez on a 75milesperhour breaking pitch on an 02 count the pitch went over the plate but bounced in front of the catcher that brings up robinson cano cano pops up near the mound , and the threat is over that s the third time today the yankees had a runner on third base with less than two out and failed to get him in will it come back to haunt them \? jose mijares replaces pavano , who , despite a great start , allowed 4 runs and 10 hits granderson lays down a nice sacrifice , moving the runners up to second and third now the twins will walk mark teixeira intentionally , which loads the bases , and pitch to alex rodriguez how has that worked out in the past \? pretty odd all around , as mijares threw to a batter who everyone knew would sacrifice and then walked teixeira i could have done that after berkman s runscoring double \( posada ! \) , brett gardner bunted berkman to third the rookie danny valencia couldn t pick it up and everyone was safe gardner is given a single , not a sacrifice , and the yankees have first and third with none out and derek jeter up jeter loops a single to right field kubel dived but caught it on a short hop berkman scores to make it , 42 still first and second with none out , and pavano leaves the game the twins manager came out to the mound to calm down pavano , who thought he had berkman struck out but he really came out to give the home plate umpire a piece of his mind he was really hot he is ejected from the game jorge posada leads off the yankees seventh with a walk on a 32 count wow , after pavano thought he struck out lance berkman , and it was a pretty good pitch , berkman doubles over the head of center fielder denard span posada comes all the way around to score yankees 3 , twins 2 posada ! after joe mauer grounded out to second , delmon young tripled to rightcenter field center fielder curtis granderson made a nice attempt in the gap , but it hit off his glove young slid safely into third but delmon young tap back to pettitte to end the inning the twins no 2 hitter , orlando hudson , homers into the leftfield seats , tying the score , 22 pavano was not hit hard that inning he slowed the game down and made some good pitches the yankees have left two runners on third with less than two out , the difference between a 21 lead and a 41 lead pavano has thrown 75 pitches through six innings , allowing seven runs and two runs andy pettitte has retired 11 in a row and faces the top of the order ben shpigel reports from the park all three of the yankees hits in the fourth came within the first three pitches of the atbat , and alex rodriguez s sac fly came on the first curtin granderson leads off the top of the sixth with a single to right granderson is 2 for 3 today , and the yankees confidence in his hitting continues to climb carl pavano has slowed the game way down so much for springsteen , eh \? on a 32 count with granderson running , mark teixeira flies out to center that was not hit very hard on a hitandrun , alex rodriguez grounds through the hole between third and short granderson gets to third , so the yankees have first and third , one out , and robinson cano at bat cano flies out to shallow left , granderson stays at third that s the second time the yankees could not score the runner from third with less than two out the first time was when swisher grounded into a double play in the fourth and here comes swisher swisher breaks his bat , and grounds out to short reader alex from brooklyn says even the foul balls off pavano sound like they re hit hard turn down the sound , alex so the yankees seem to have changed their strategy on pavano they are used to working into deep counts , but now they are hacking away early i don t know what the endgame will be pavano probably won t have to come out because of a pitch count , that s for sure in the meantime , pettitte continues to roll 60 pitches through five innings after a 123 fifth we might even be able to watch that springsteen special on hbo tonight more firstpitching swinging posada hits the ball on the nose , right to the right fielder lance berkman follows with a home run into the leftfield bullpen \( not on the first pitch \) so the second time through , some of the yankees hard hits fell in but the damage could have been a lot worse the twins limited the damage , and i m sure nick swisher would like to have his atbat back before the inning started , ben shpigel wrote from the ballpark pavano has thrown firstpitch strikes to 9 of the first 10 hitters , the only exception being brett gardner , who swung over a wicked slider for the second out of the third he came back with what looked like a splitter clocked at 88 on the radar gun here to strike out jeter to end the inning maybe the yankees picked up on that pavano throws a lot of strikes through four innings , he has thrown 13 balls and 33 strikes meanwhile , andy pettitte has settled into a rhythm , putting down the twins , 123 , in the fourth ok , the meat of the order second time through they have been hitting pavano granderson leads off with a double high off the wall in right field that wall is 23 feet high , and granderson used most of it mark teixeira lines a single to left field again , the ball is hit so hard that granderson has to hold at third alex rodriguez hits a linedrive sacrifice fly to right field , scoring granderson robinson cano singles to right , but then swisher grounds into a double play to the pitcher andy pettitte , facing top of the twins order , has a 123 inning on seven pitches he got some help from nick swisher , who made a nice , sliding catch of orlando hudson s fly near the rightfield line swisher looks really good sometimes in the field , but i can understand why he is replaced for a defensive replacement in the ninth inning sometimes in last year s game 2 , he made a nice relay to jeter at second base to get an unexpected out when a twin had rounded second too far this game is similar to wednesday s so far the difference is that the top of the yankees lineup , at least , has put good swings on carl pavano s pitches but this inning , lance berkman , in his first postseason atbat as a yankee , tapped out , first to the pitcher covering brett gardner stuck out and derek jeter , in his second look at pavano , took a bad hack at a breaking ball in the dirt pavano has allowed one hit and struck out three through three innings delmon young and jim thome single , bringing up michael cuddyer with none out cuddyer hit a short roller to third alex rodriguez made a

single to rightcenter he bounced back to induce a double play grounder from orland hudson , and then struck out joe mauer on a lowandaway cutter , the pitch he worked on last saturday in boston carl

streak to the yankees manager ron gardenhire buried his uniform from game 1 jim thome and nick punto ate brunch at home instead of at a pancake house , and denard span had new york strip steak instead of the usual chicken for his pregame meal that sounds a little drastic the yankees went down , 123 , in the first derek jeter , firstball swinging , grounds out hard to third , and game 2 in under way

will see his first postseason action as a yankee , batting eighth as the designated hitter the twins will go with the same lineup they used in game 1
for a decentralized , essentially leaderless movement \( the best efforts of dick armey and jim demint notwithstanding \) , the tea party has cut its swath through the republican primary season with a great deal of strategic savvy beginning with pat toomey and continuing through marco rubio and rand paul , sharron angle and joe miller , the candidates propelled to victory by tea partier enthusiasm have often given the national republican party heartburn , but none of them have been clearly unelectable and if this fall is as good to the gop as it s shaping up to be right now , most of them will probably end up winning whereas in those races where the rightwardmost candidate \( to borrow william f buckley s phrase \) couldn t possibly win a general election , the tea party hasn t gone all in thus carly fiorina rather than chuck devore is the republican nominee for the california senate , john mccain rather than jd hayworth is the nominee in arizona , mark kirk is the nominee in illinois , etc whether this pattern represented blind luck , grassroots genius or some combination thereof , it was broken last night unless the democratic party somehow goes the way of the whigs between now and november , christine o donnell will not be elected a united states senator from delaware her politics are too conservative for delaware , and her past is far too checkered to overcome that disadvantage everyone who takes politics seriously understands this , which is why not only republican officials but conservative opinionmakers have spent the last two weeks highlighting o donnell s weaknesses , defending castle s moderateconservative bona fides , and otherwise trying to rein in the enthusiasm of delaware primary voters \( apart from demint and sarah palin , o donnell s highestprofile champion on the right was probably the radio talkshow host mark levin , who managed to add a few more rightofcenter journalists to his everexpanding enemies list in the process \) but it was all to no avail the conservative heart wants what it wants , and in delaware yesterday , it wanted to vote for somebody who wasn t mike castle in the short term , then , this was a bad night for the republican party , and an opportunity for liberals to gloat a little bit about chickens coming home to roost in the long run , though , o donnell s victory and the defeat that will almost certainly follow in november might provide a salutary reality check for the party heading into 2012 yes , it s possible that the gop will fall one seat short of retaking the senate because delaware primary voters didn t care about electability \( or experience , or competence , or bizarre lawsuits \) but chances are that the fate of the first state s senate seat over the next six years will prove much , much less important , both for the republican party and for the country as a whole , than the tone and temper of the gop primary season , and the kind of candidate it produces and if o donnell s likely generalelection fate becomes a cautionary tale about the limits of caring only about ideological purism , then the lessons of delaware in 2010 might serve the party in good stead come iowa and new hampshire in 2012 but of course , it s equally possible that o donnell s defeat will be blamed on her abandonment by the party leadership , rather than her own failings as a standardbearer \( i m sure that will be mark levin s line ! \) , in which case rather than taking the edge off the base s antiestablishment mood it could just end up getting spun into an evermorepowerful narrative of populist grievance this is why it seems foolish and selfdefeating for republican elites to make such a show of turning their backs on o donnell immediately after her primary victory yes , the party s dollars can be better spent elsewhere , but the national republican senatorial committee didn t need to say as much while the confetti was still falling in dover it s the business of pundits to point out the hopelessness of her candidacy it should be the business of the party s leaders to figure out how to channel the enthusiasm that propelled her to victory in a more constructive direction , rather than just throwing up their hands and acting horrified in this regard , i think byron york deserves the last word on last night s events in the end , though , focusing only on o donnell s problems , as the washington establishment is doing , misses the spirit that was unmistakable all around delaware on tuesday for a large group of conservatives , watching christine o donnell come out of nowhere actually , lifting her up on their shoulders out of nowhere has been a huge boost after the frustrations of the final years of the bush administration and the first years of the obama administration those conservatives feel enormously empowered by what they have accomplished , and they are important to the republican party s fortunes this november and beyond the lords of the backroom have got to find a better way of dealing with them than simply dumping on their candidate
how do you spell independent in florida \? gov charlie crist hopes it s with a combination of oversized block letters republicans in red , democrats in blue that come together to form americans , the message of his first campaign commercial of the general election both mr crist and his democratic opponent , rep kendrick meek , released their first ads tuesday for the general election , and both tried to carve out their political identity while differentiating themselves from their opponents in a threeway race for senate in florida marco rubio , the republican candidate , released his first generalelection ad in late august in his ad , best of both , mr crist rearranges the words republicans and democrats to spell out americans , while promising that , as an independent , i will take the best ideas of democrats and republicans to get things done there is only one candidate in this race who will go to washington and fight for the people of florida in an independent way , said danny kanner , a spokesman for the crist campaign there are two candidates who will go to washington for the same political parties and special interests that got this country into the mess in the first place mr meek opens his ad by offering to outline the differences between himself and his opponents i m kendrick meek , the democrat for senate , and with three of us running , you should know what makes me different , he begins and then enumerates eight specific areas of policy he believes set him apart in his commercial , only one , mr meek zips from place to place around the state , riding in an airboat through the everglades and on a bus with senior citizens , while highlighting that he is the only one who is against privatizing social security , who is prochoice , who took on president george w bush , and who is against high credit card fees he also says that he is the only one against offshore oil drilling before and after the bp spill , a notsosubtle dig at mr crist , who rethought his support of offshore drilling in april after he took a 90minute plane ride above the gulf of mexico to see the oil slick the us senate race in florida will feature two lifelong conservative republicans and one democrat , and that s what the ad displays , said adam sharon , mr meek s communications director there are clear differences on policy , on positions , between kendrick and our two conservative republican opponents none of the three candidates overtly mention their opponents in their first ads , but the national republican senatorial committee took on mr crist , issuing a statement titled crist s new tv ad spells opportunist , and putting out an elaborate factcheck of the governor s record governor crist comes out with an ad that says we need to take the best of both democrats and republicans because we re all americans and the nrsc s response is to go negative immediately , said josh isay , a media consultant to mr crist s campaign who helped with the ad i think the nrsc response was more proof that we need to change the tenor of washington in retrospect , mr rubio s spot , dream , was bittersweet in it , he talks about his background and upbringing his dad , a bartender , and his mom , a maid , who worked two jobs most of their lives , so their children would know opportunities they never could his father , mario rubio , died saturday night
andy barall , who writes about pro football history for the fifth down , offered a few thoughts on some of the players who made it to the hall of fame on saturday , and some of those who didn t jerry rice , emmitt smith , rickey jackson , russ grimm , john randle and the two senior nominees dick lebeau and floyd little made it rickey jackson jackson was an outstanding allaround linebacker in the saints 34 defense he could play forward , backward and sideways he was a terrific blitzer , was effective in pass coverage , and played it tough on the line of scrimmage he maintained outside leverage and avoided being hooked by the tight end on strong side sweeps and pitchouts he had quick feet , used his hands effectively in shedding blockers , and was an explosive tackler just watching him , you could tell that rickey jackson loved to play football he s most deserving russ grimm \( or joe jacoby \? \) one of the main arguments in support of russ grimm s candidacy is that he was an integral part of an outstanding offensive line that anchored three super bowl winning redskins teams , and that none of those players had yet to be elected still , each of these men should be considered individually , on his own merits after studying grimm recently in a number of games \( against 34 and 43 fronts \) , i was surprised that he wasn t as impressive as i had remembered him he had good feet , good balance , had above average pulling speed , and played well in space \( hitting a moving target \) all good but not great he consistently had trouble moving laterally against quick passrushers if the committee wanted to elect a hog from that era , it should ve considered the man who played on grimm s left , joe jacoby , who wasn t even a finalist this year remember , that line played most of its games against a 34 front with the guards uncovered jacoby had consistently tough matchups in the nfc east harvey martin and jim jeffcoat in dallas , carl hairston and clyde simmons in philadelphia , and the vastly underrated leonard marshall with the giants on passing downs against new york , the skins would slide their line and jacoby would pick up lawrence taylor later in his career , when he moved to right tackle after washington acquired jim lachey , jacoby matched up with reggie white jacoby moved well for such a huge man and was a powerful drive blocker in his prime , he could block out the sun russ grimm was a tough , physical guard i particularly remember the battles he had early in his career against randy white joe jacoby , however , was just a little better john randle onedimensional \? randle entered the nfl undrafted and undersized and yet , he was able to establish a career as one of the league s most recognizable defensive stars randle spent his best years in minnesota as a 3technique tackle he later moved outside to left defensive end in the vikings base defense while still sliding inside to left or right tackle in their nickel and dime fronts he played a little standup defensive end , too randle was a prolific inside passrusher whom the offense had to account for , especially in mustpass situations he frequently drew doubleteams randle was quick off the ball , used his hands well , and had a variety of pass rush moves the swim , the spin and the bullrush he was especially tough at home , where he got an explosive first step on the turf and took advantage of the effect the crowd noise in the metrodome had on the offensive linemen like most pass rushers , he wasn t nearly as effective on a grass field doubledigit sacks for a number of years is great , but it doesn t necessarily make you a hall of famer always look deeper than the numbers in studying randle , it doesn t take long to see that his play against the run was occasionally , shall we say , indifferent once the offensive lineman engaged him , randle was in trouble he got knocked around a lot and didn t shed blocks well he was so eager to get upfield that he was an easy target for draw plays two or three times a game he was very inconsistent in pursuit on running plays away from him sometimes he gave full effort , sometimes he didn t when he played defensive end , i saw him get too easily handled by a downblocking tight end john randle was terrific , like many momentum pass rushers , when the vikings had the lead and forced the opponent to throw however , in a tough scrimmage battle , he had many long stretches where you wouldn t notice him at all dermontii dawson and cortez kennedy both dawson and kennedy made the final group of 10 but , unfortunately , didn t make it again this year dawson is comparable to the two most recent centers inducted into the hall , mike webster of the steelers \( 1997 \) and dwight stephenson of the dolphins \( 1998 \) webster s game was strength and power stephenson was gifted with quick feet and fast and strong hands and forearms many nose tackles , especially on passing downs , will overplay the center s weakside \( the side of his snapping arm \) to gain an immediate advantage on the rush against stephenson , it never worked he was amazingly fast at getting his right forearm into the chest of the defender after snapping the ball dawson was a cross between webster and stephenson after studying him , i must say he was a better player than i had remembered the first thing you see is how well balanced he was he never got knocked around when dawson planted his feet , he was like an oak tree in the wind he was powerful , strong and quick he usually handled the nose tackle himself so pittsburgh s guards were freed up for other assignments he would often pull and lead steelers runners around the corner if he got beat on the pass rush , he recovered quickly enough to drive his man past the quarterback dermontii dawson was the best center of his era he was consistent , reliable and durable by all accounts , he was also an excellent teammate and person in his junior year at the university of miami , you could see just how good cortez kennedy could be if he could get his weight under control when he was fresh , he was tough to block unfortunately , fresh only lasted two or three plays after his junior year , he got in much better shape , had a great senior season and ended up being the third overall pick in the 1990 draft it didn t take long for kennedy to become one of the nfl s best defensive tackles unlike many pass rushers , kennedy was not onedimensional he was a great inside space eater against the run who frequently demanded doubleteams during his prime years , he played almost every defensive play of every game i recall some great matchups he had against oakland s steve wisniewski i suspect that randle made it over kennedy because he had significantly more sacks \( 1375 to 58 \) believe me , if you studied the two on tape , it wouldn t take you long to conclude that kennedy was the better player dick lebeau lebeau s playing career has come under much scrutiny lately , especially from people who never saw him play lebeau was an outstanding allaround cornerback against both run and pass he had a smooth , fast backpedal and very good recovery speed he quickly recognized wide runs to his side , was an excellent force man , and a sure tackler he certainly was not as spectacular as his hall of fame teammates night train lane and lem barney , but he was more consistent than both of them the selection committee members , as i m sure they were well aware , were supposed to be considering lebeau only as a player but under the unofficial madden exception , most were probably rewarding him for his extraordinary 50 year career in pro football and rightly so i m sure the members of the committee take their responsibilities very seriously but , and i m speculating here , they seem to be too influenced by statistics , allpro teams made , pro bowl appearances , championships teams played on , what others tell them , and their memories those factors are interesting and relevant they should be considered , but they re not the best evidence there s an inevitable gap between history and memory these candidates didn t play behind the iron curtain the video record of their careers is not the equivalent of russian samizdat publications furtively passed around from person to person to avoid detection by the authorities i can t help thinking that if they carefully studied the tape their decisions might be a little different what do you think of the class of 2010 \?
washington with a war chest rivaling that of the republican party itself , the has emerged in the last year as perhaps the obama administration s mostwellfinanced rival on signature policy debates like health care and financial regulation critics on the left have long complained about the chamber s outsize influence but now they are taking on the business association directly , charging in a complaint filed friday with the that it violated tax codes by laundering millions of dollars meant for charitable work from a group with ties to the insurance giant aig the complaint was brought by a group called , which was created four months ago with the strong financial backing of labor unions to scrutinize the chamber of commerce s growing influence and provide a counterbalance but chamber officials said they had complied with all tax laws and dismissed the complaint as a political ploy a chamber spokeswoman , tita freeman , said its opponents are desperately looking for opportunities to undermine the chamber s efforts to promote free markets and economic growth the irs refused to comment on the complaint , citing the confidentiality of taxpayer records irs regulators have often been wary of wading into political grievances , particularly after evidence emerged during the watergate scandal that the nixon white house had sought to use the agency for political purposes but in recent years the agency has occasionally gotten involved in politically tinged controversies in one highprofile case in 2004 , republican complaints led it to open an investigation into the naacp s taxexempt status after the group s leader criticized president george w bush in a speech the irs concluded two years later that the remarks did not violate the group s nonprofit restrictions on political activity at issue in the complaint against the chamber of commerce is whether the group mixed funds for charitable and noncharitable political purposes in violation of tax codes the chamber , often using expensive massmarket radio and tv spots , has weighed in on many major public policy debates in recent months , including the obama administration s health care policy , business regulations , campaign finance laws and internet rules , as well as job creation and the threat of tax hikes on many issues , it has pushed for less government regulation in favor of freemarket incentives now the chamber s political arm is turning to the november elections , and it expects to spend 50 million or more to push probusiness candidates , usually republicans as part of a wave of new commercials broadcast this week , the chamber s california affiliate attacked senator barbara boxer a democrat running for reelection against carly fiorina , the former chief executive of hewlettpackard and accused ms boxer of destroying jobs by voting against business cyrus mehri , a washington lawyer who brought the irs complaint on behalf of us chamber watch , said in an interview that the chamber s current political activities were , in effect , being underwritten with money intended for charitable work the complaint focuses on loans and grants totaling about 18 million that were made beginning in 2003 to a nonprofit affiliate , the , by the , a charity started by the founder of aig and now led by maurice r greenberg , the insurer s former chairman lawyers for chamber watch said their research , based largely on public tax filings , found that none of the principal on some 12 million in loans had been paid back and that the money appeared to have been given to the chamber s foundation for unrestricted use the lawyers said that the money , in violation of nonprofit restrictions , was ultimately funneled to the chamber itself and used to finance broader political causes , including support for legal tort reform to shield companies like aig from liability mr greenberg himself had worked to promote restrictions on lawsuits , the complaint notes you have millions of dollars improperly going to the chamber , said mr mehri , who drafted the complaint with gail m harmon , a washington lawyer specializing in tax law this is not a technical violation but stan harrell , chief financial officer for the chamber of commerce , said in an interview friday that the chamber s lawyers and its accountants at ernst young had reviewed the starr foundation funding and found that it complied with all relevant tax law we 've never had an issue , period , mr harrell said he said that chamber watch , which was created by a federation of five unions called , was simply trying to create trouble for the chamber because of its opposing political views that s democracy from time to time , people make allegations , he said if their real interest was proper accounting , they 'd be talking to us this is political mr harrell said that the funding from the starr foundation was listed in tax documents as a loan only in the most technical sense and that it was never intended to be paid back instead , he said , the money was restricted for longterm use on educational and research projects as part of the chamber s capital plan and was invested by the chamber to ensure the starr foundation a set rate of return we wanted to make sure we guaranteed the investment return , he said legally , that has to be represented as a loan this was all done very scrupulously if anything , we overdisclosed the transaction in the group s federal tax returns , he said
to the editor re \( news article , june 26 \) the failure of president obama to use the powers of his office and his personality to make good on his pledge to close guant namo bay is despicable if the detention camp was a moral blight and a foreign policy liability on day 1 of the administration , it certainly remains so today that the administration would claim credit , as a senior official says , for trying to close the prison , while actually failing in its goal , is a level of cynicism that is mindboggling i voted for mr obama on the basis of his promise of real change with respect to guant namo , there has been none for this reason he has lost my vote on some things , like undoing a legacy of extrajudicial detention and torture , there can be no compromise jeremy varon brooklyn , june 26 , 2010
when the justice department declared in a court filing late friday that genes should not be eligible for patents because they are products of nature , harold c wegner , an influential patent lawyer in washington , did not mince words eric holder hijacks the patent system , flunks patents 101 , mr wegner wrote in an email to 1 , 250 people , referring to the attorney general sharp reaction greeted the declaration that human and other genes are not patentable , a reversal of what had been the government s policy for decades one patent lawyer characterized the new position as dumb the biotechnology industry organization warned that such a policy , if carried out , would undermine us global leadership and investment in the life sciences but the new stance cheered those who believe that such patents retard rather than spur medical progress and interfere with people s access to information about themselves if you want to look at your own genome and see if you have a mutation , you should be able to do that without paying a license fee to someone else , said steven salzberg , a professor of computer science and genetics at the university of maryland the government s new policy was outlined in a friend of the court brief in a lawsuit challenging patents held by myriad genetics and the university of utah research foundation on two genes that are linked to breast and ovarian cancer the reversal appears to be a result of discussions among agencies within the obama administration , including the national institutes of health and the patent and trademark office in the short run , however , it appears the new policy will have little practical impact the patent office said in a statement that it would not immediately put the policy into effect and would not start denying patents on genes because of pending litigation the office will maintain the status quo while this matter is pending resolution by the federal circuit court of appeals , a spokesman said , referring to the case on the cancer risk genes a lower court had ruled against myriad , deciding that human genes could not be patented an administration official said it would be too disruptive to change the longstanding patent policy now , since the court might end up ruling the other way on the case involving the cancer risk genes over two decades , the agency has issued thousands of patents on genes the patent office appears to have opposed the position taken in the justice department s brief none of its lawyers were listed as authors mr wegner , who is at the firm foley lardner , said he had talked recently with david j kappos , the director of the patent office he said mr kappos seemed chagrined that the department of justice was taking a viewpoint very different from the patent office the patent office said it had no further comment in the lawsuit at issue , medical societies , researchers and patients have sued myriad and the research foundation , which have patents on the two genes , brca1 and brca2 myriad sells a test for more than 3 , 000 that detects mutations in the genes that confer a very high risk of breast or ovarian cancer in march , judge robert w sweet of the united states district court in manhattan ruled that the patents were invalid now , with the case before the appeals court , the justice department has essentially agreed with him clearly , this is a major development , said chris hansen , a lawyer at the american civil liberties union , which is representing the plaintiffs in effect , the united states government has joined the plaintiffs but myriad pointed out in a statement on monday that the justice department also agreed with the company on other issues gauging the effect of a policy against patenting genes , should it be carried out , is somewhat difficult part of it depends on whether it would apply just to new patents or whether it would be used to revoke existing gene patents james p evans , a professor of genetics and medicine at the university of north carolina who has studied gene patents , said that there were mainly two companies , myriad and athena diagnostics , that based their business on offering expensive genetic tests protected from competition by gene patents diagnostics , he said , was moving toward tests using multiple genes , or even a person s entire genome sequence patents on each individual gene could be a barrier to development of those multigene tests , he said professor salzberg of the university of maryland has developed a computer program that can analyze a person s genome for mutations in the brca1 and brca2 genes we did it to show how it would be easy today for someone to get their genome sequenced and to do their own genetic testing , he said right now , it costs 10 , 000 or more to get a personal genome sequence but in a few years , it is expected to cost only 1 , 000 or so it might then be possible to have one s dna sequenced and analyzed for mutations in hundreds of genes for less than myriad charges for two genes kevin e noonan , a patent lawyer in chicago who represents biotechnology companies , said that many companies no longer tried for patents on dna isolated directly from the genome , the type the justice department brief says should not be patented they obtain patents on manipulated dna , which the justice department said could be patented still , mr noonan , who is an author of patent docs , a blog on biotech patent issues , said the government s stance would endanger innovation because the same philosophy against patenting products isolated from nature might be extended to proteinbased drugs and antibiotics it s dumb , mr noonan said of the government s brief it shows a singular ignorance of the technology and the law at the same time mr wegner , whose firm also represents some biotech companies , said the government s stance could make it harder for washington to get other countries to protect intellectual property we 're telling the rest of the world to have high minimum standards to protect software , pharmaceuticals , he said , and we 're violating minimum standards ourselves in its brief to the appellate court , myriad argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue because myriad was not accusing them of infringement judge sweet in the lower court rejected those arguments but if the appeals court accepted them , it could decide the case without having to weigh the merits of gene patents it is not clear if the policy against gene patents would then be put into effect photo steven

with only a little more than three weeks until the last american combat troops are scheduled to be withdrawn from iraq , the fragile political standoff between the main population groups shiites , sunnis and kurds is set to move into a more stressful phase , one that could strain the fragile peace achieved under american dominion as nothing has since the explosion of sectarian violence in 2006 and who , all of a sudden , has piped up from his baghdad prison cell and urged president obama not to proceed with the withdrawal schedule , which foresees the last of the 50 , 000 troops who will remain on aug 31 being pulled out of iraq by the end of 2011 \? the answer none other than tariq aziz , who was the best known figure from the years of saddam hussein s tyranny , outside iraq , other than mr hussein himself short , bespectacled , owlishlooking and gifted with a flair for injured innocence , mr aziz cut an incongruous figure as the chief apologist for one of modern history s most murderous regimes for more than 20 years , at every new chapter in mr hussein s history of aggression or deceit , there he was , as foreign minister , and later deputy prime minister , acting out his role as iraq s excuserinchief for its war with iran , its invasion of kuwait , its years of blocking and evading united nations weapons inspectors now , mr aziz has executed one more vertiginous backflip in an interview published last week in the guardian newspaper in britain , he offered his standard skein of justifications and rationalizations for mr hussein s blunders \( didn t churchill make mistakes \? \) for his own lack of culpability \( all decisions were taken by president saddam hussein i held a political position i did not participate in any of the crimes that were raised against me personally \) and for iraq s defiance over more than a decade of un security council resolutions requiring it to abandon its banned weapons programs and make them accessible to un inspectors mr aziz said this was not aimed at the west as much as at iran \( partially , it was about iran they had waged war on us for eight years so we iraqis had a right to deter them saddam was a proud man he had to defend the dignity of iraq he had to show that he was not wrong , or weak \) but his pi ce de r sistance came in his remarks about the countdown to the last american troop withdrawals from the kadhimiya prison on the western bank of the tigris river in north baghdad , the site of mr hussein s former military intelligence headquarters and the place where mr hussein himself was hanged , mr aziz damned britain and the united states for the invasion of 2003 and damned the united states , again , for planning to leave now \( the last british troops were withdrawn in the summer of 2009 \) for 30 years saddam built iraq , and now it is destroyed , he said there are more sick than before , more hungry the people don t have services people are being killed every day in the tens , if not hundreds i was encouraged when obama was elected president , because i thought he was going to correct some of the mistakes of bush but obama is a hypocrite he is leaving iraq to the wolves and more in support of continuing the occupation he cannot leave us like this he is leaving iraq to the wolves when you make a mistake , you need to correct a mistake , not leave iraq to its death there was no dearth of fantastical , nightmarish characters in mr hussein s inner circle , slavish to his murderous impulses and orwellian in their resolve to rationalize and exalt every move he made , including the ones that ultimately led to his and their undoing theirs was a story that , as much as any in modern times , demonstrated that truth can be stranger than fiction what they did , in service to mr hussein , ultimately drew america into two wars that have cost the united states the lives of nearly 5 , 000 troops and the best part of a trillion dollars , not to mention the devastating loss of life iraq has experienced five men in that inner circle , including mr hussein himself , went to the gallows in the wake of the american invasion in 2003 , after trials in which they were found guilty of crimes against humanity , including genocide but mr aziz , the diplomatic houdini , has eluded the hangman s noose , and is serving a 15year sentence for his role in the executions of 42 baghdad merchants accused of hoarding scarce food supplies after the first gulf war in 1991 he faces a raft of other charges , and theoretically could yet go to the gallows himself , unless the byzantine turns in iraqi politics lead to some deal for his release between the current caste of powerbrokers in baghdad , the shiites , the sunnis and the kurds who have flirted with a resurgence of civil war by failing to agree on a new government five months after iraqis went to the polls in a general election mr aziz , now 74 , was always one of the more intriguing members of mr hussein s hierarchy , and not alone for his ability , in confident english , to conjure up rationalizations for everything his boss did he was unusual , too , for the fact that he was a chaldean catholic from the northern city of mosul , and thus a member of a persecuted minority who had suffered severely under mr hussein s many pogroms mr aziz s confrontations with the west won mr hussein many influential friends around the world , not least in the vatican , and he liked to decorate his baghdad office with photographs of himself seducing , diplomatically , some of the world s most powerful figures right to the end of the hussein time , he seemed to have convinced himself that he was a man innocent of all reproach , regardless of the evidence that he was the voice to the world of one of its bloodiest regimes in an interview in baghdad only weeks before the american tanks rolled in , mr aziz reacted with astonishment when i told him that the state department had placed him on a tentative list of those in the regime who had committed crimes against humanity who , me \? he said , momentarily stunned why me \? i have done nothing wrong it spoke for that same sense of innocence , in a way , that mr aziz the eight of spades in the american invasion force s pack of cards list of the 55 most wanted members of the hussein government surrendered to iraq s new overseers within three weeks of the overthrow he was confined at camp cropper , a us detention center for high value members within camp victory , the american military headquarters beside baghdad international airport at that point , he faded into the background as mr hussein and his most murderous henchmen marched onward to their death sentences at a series of trials taha yassin ramadan , a former vice president awad hamid albandar , former head of mr hussein s revolutionary court barzan ibrahim altikriti , a former head of intelligence and mr hussein s half brother and , arguably the most lethal of all , ali hassan almajid , aka chemical ali , who was mr hussein s cousin and the man principally responsible after mr hussein for the use of chemical weapons against the kurds in the late 1980s earlier this year , mr aziz was transferred to iraqi custody as part of the american military drawdown , and transferred with other former american detainees to the prison at kadhimiya that appeared to reflect an american judgment that mr aziz was no longer such a highvalue captive , since several other highranking officials from mr hussein s time have remained sequestered with about 200 other detainees in a part of the former camp cropper center that remains under american control as the rest has been taken over by the iraqis another straw in the wind was suggested by the guardian s account of its interview with mr aziz in it the reporter , martin chulov , quoted a message for mr aziz that he said he had been asked to relay by ayad allawi , who served as iraq s first prime minister after the united states returned sovereignty to iraq in june 2004 after several years in the political wilderness , mr allawi s party performed strongly enough in the general election in march that he has continued to maneuver against the current prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , for the right to form a new government tell tariq aziz that he is my friend , and i think of him often , mr allawi said mr allawi , with his own background as an enforcer for mr hussein s baath party , before he joined the opposition in exile in london in the 1980s , is a powerful friend to have , and power is something mr aziz has always understood perhaps sensing that his freedom may not be so far off , he drew on his old diplomatic skills in the guardian interview to praise his current iraqi captors the treatment from these guys has been excellent , and i m not just saying that , he said it is clean , the food is good , and there is a small garden nearby where we can exercise his goodwill extended even to a glancing concession about mr hussein when one of his jailers prompted him to compare his prison conditions with those endured by prisoners under the old regime , he replied , yes , there were some mistakes made
there was one thing wrong with this movie it was fiction , albert maysles said wednesday at the party after the new york premiere of the company men , the unemployment drama written and directed by john wells and starring ben affleck , tommy lee jones , chris cooper and kevin costner mr maysles , the documentarian , thought the film , about the effects of the masculine recession , would ve had more impact if it had been a true story but he praised the cinematography the bagger knows what was wrong with the party none of the stars made it kevin is touring in russia with his band tommy , he s doing men in black out in queens chris cooper is doing the muppet movie , dancing and singing right now maria bello is in shreveport doing an indie and rosemarie dewitt , today is the last day of shooting on united states of tara , mr wells explained at the party , at the gansevoort hotel on park avenue \( mr affleck did make it to the screening , after coming back from paris , where he had just finished shooting the muchanticipated terrence malick movie tree of life update a publicist later wrote in to say that mr jones did , in fact , escape from the alien clutches of queens to make it to the event , albeit late the company men was bought by the weinstein company after the sundance film festival earlier this year , and mr wells reedited it the movie s about 15 minutes shorter , he said and it has a changed order at the ending , a new beginning and a whole bunch of other music whose idea was that \? harvey said he thought i should look at the music , mr wells said , and he gave us some additional money , so we added about 10 additional pieces of music , from indie favorites like the eels and future islands \( harvey weinstein cooler than pitchfork \? no , mr wells worked with a music supervisor \) mr wells , a veteran tv writer and director who has collected statuettes for er and the west wing , brushed off any awards talk for his movie the purpose with this kind of film is , you re hoping that it tells people that they should come see the film , he said of campaigning was there a liberty in telling a story on film that he didn t get in tv \? episodic television , the thing that is the most difficult is actually figuring out how to keep breaking up the emotional message of what you re doing for massengill commercials , mr wells said so that s lovely , not to have to do that

kuwait city it was not like the old days this time , the ships were smaller , the journey was shorter , the work was easier and these young sailors were surely softer but none of that troubled an elderly diver , who watched with approval as a new generation of kuwaiti men embraced the sea , trimming sails and clapping their hands as they sang the old pearl diver s songs for the diver , khalifa alrashid , 74 , the young men represented a hope that in a country transformed by oil into a land of sprawling shopping malls , luxury cars and subsidized lives , where citizenship has long been a ticket to privilege there was still room for something old and difficult mr rashid was one of the guides for an annual pearldiving expedition , a trip the organizers call a simple attempt to connect young kuwaiti men with their largely forgotten past every year since 1986 , in the scorching furnace of the kuwaiti summer , the men , in their teens and 20s , board wooden dhows and sail roughly 60 miles to the oyster beds on a 10day hunt for the pearls that were once a pillar of the region s economy the trips also serve another purpose , some observers say in a nation racked by arguments about who truly belongs , the pearl expeditions celebrate the history of the country s most prominent families , recalling the days when they were merchants who made their livings from the sea but those arguments happen away from the boats on a recent saturday , nearly 200 young men sat on 15 dhows at journey s end , stooped with exhaustion , but relishing their last moments together we slept outside we cooked for ourselves , said aqeel ashkanani , 26 , who sat next to mr rashid on one of the lead boats i did n't think it would be this hard the dhows turned toward the sea sport club , where relatives of the young divers had gathered on the sand to greet them government officials watched from comfortable chairs on an observation deck kuwaiti television broadcast the celebrations live this is our tradition we must save it , mr ashkanani said the event is popular , in part because it tests young men , whom older kuwaitis fear are coddled the discovery of oil has spoiled a whole generation , said saad alajmi , a writer and a former kuwaiti information minister they do n't do minor jobs the pearl diving was a tough and rough and difficult profession this is part of a nostalgia for the good old days , ' instead of today , when kuwaitis are mostly employed by the state ali alqabandi , of the kuwait sea sport club , ticked off the virtues of the summer ritual they learn how to behave themselves , and how to join the group they learn how to respect their elders , and how their grandfather and father lived they learn how to be patient , he said the expedition is also part of a longrunning debate in kuwait about the meaning of citizenship , according to local scholars some segment of society thinks that reliving this event is in a way an answer to who is kuwaiti , said dr abdulhadi alajmi , a kuwaiti historian the event , scholars say , replays the history of kuwaitis seen as part of the country s founding settler class , merchants or ship owners who lived and worked by the sea , controlling pearldiving and other trades while they became kuwait s most prominent families , others , like bedouins , who trace their heritage to the desert , have sometimes struggled to gain equal rights the debates over unequal status have played out in local newspapers and in the country s national assembly , according to prof abdullah alhajeri , who teaches modern history at kuwait university we focus on the history of the settlers , he said half of the history is missing it has been decades since kuwaitis made their living from the sea the trade , practiced throughout the persian gulf , was crippled by , the emergence of cultured pearls from japan and the discovery of oil the divers themselves were probably indentured servants , according to people who have studied the trade , living on money they borrowed from boat captains they dove to pay their debts , and if they died before repaying the loans , those debts were passed on to their sons or brothers many people do n't even know about the economy of kuwait before the oil age , said anh nga longva , a professor at the university of bergen , in norway , who has studied similarities between the economic conditions facing the divers and those facing migrants in kuwait today the divers , she said , were very poor people , and they were in debt all their lives mr rashid learned the trade from his father and started diving when he was 16 years old the boats carried dozens of divers , and could travel as far south as oman on journeys that lasted for about four months the divers wore clips on their noses , beeswax in their ears , leather thimbles on their fingers and baskets to carry the oysters they stayed underwater for more than a minute to harvest pearling beds 60 feet or more below the surface we ate fish , dates and rice , mr rashid said they dove 30 or 40 times a day , a punishing schedule that led to frequent injuries for the divers and sometimes death but even with those hardships , the nostalgia for that era did not strike mr rashid as odd in any way things are easier today , but our culture from that time is gone , he said the dhows used to be built in kuwait but are now imported from other gulf countries today s dives last less than a minute , and the young men search beds 10 to 15 feet deep the work is still hard enough , the men say after the voyage ended yielding some 600 pearls fahad alhamad , 16 , said his life had changed the trip had broken his usual routine of lounging at summer cottages or wasting time at a sheesha cafe there was no airconditioning , and no electricity you have to depend on yourself , he said there are rules in the sea
if you rely on microsoft s internet explorer s privacy settings to control cookies on your computer , you may want to rethink that strategy large numbers of web sites , including giants like facebook , appear to be using a loophole that circumvents ie s ability to block cookies , according to researchers at cylab at the carnegie mellon university school of engineering a technical paper \( note clicking on the link will initiate a download of a pdf \) published by the researchers says that a third of the more than 33 , 000 sites they studied have technical errors that cause ie to allow cookies to install , even if the browser has been set to reject them of the 100 most visited destinations on the internet , 21 sites had the errors , including facebook , several of microsoft s own sites , amazon , imdb , aol , mapquest , godaddy and hulu typos and honest mistakes likely explain many of the errors , says lorrie faith cranor , director of the cylab usable privacy and security laboratory and one of the paper s authors but she estimates that more than half represent deliberate efforts to keep ie from blocking certain types of thirdparty cookies based on privacy policies cookies are used to store information about a user or computer s web use so sites can customize that user s experience , including what ads they see socalled persistent or tracking cookies are data placed not by the site visited , but by other thirdparty web sites that have placed content or advertising on the visited web page these types of cookies can stay on computers for long periods of time and gather data about surfing habits , and have long raised hackles among those concerned about privacy online the loophole resides deep in an exchange of data between browser and site normally , internet explorer checks the privacy policy of a site to see if it complements the browser s own security settings this checking is done through compact policies lines of computer code \( in this case , three or fourletter codes \) that reflect the content of the tomelike privacy policies that sites have written out in english for illustrative purposes , imagine an interaction between browser and site that goes something like this browser i do n't allow cookies that store personally identifiable information that could be used to contact me without permissionsite i do have some cookies to place here , but none do thatbrowser that sounds fine come on in compact policies are voluntary and are part of an internet standard called platform for privacy preferences , or p3p , that was developed in the 1990s dr cranor was on the standards committee that developed p3p the goal of compact policies was to create a way of describing sites' privacy practices when it comes to cookies that computers could read and use microsoft s ie browser is the only major browser to make meaningful use of p3p it uses compact policies to block and control certain cookies by default with its medium privacy setting \( access the settings in ie version 8 by clicking tools , then internet options and then privacy change your setting using the slider \) and it has been the power of ie s market share60 percent , according to netmarketsharethat has led sites that want to install cookies onto pcs to use compact policies , say experts like dr cranor and ari schwartz , vice president at the center for democracy and technology until he joined the obama administration last month browsers like chrome , firefox and safari have simpler security settings instead of checking a site s compact policy , these browsers simply let people choose to block all cookies , block only thirdparty cookies or allow all cookies the loophole sites are using to evade ie s cookie blocker shows up in the process the browser uses to check compact policies ie checks only for codes that indicate a site does n't have the right privacy protections , dr cranor says if it finds a compact policy with bad inputs say , the codes are wrong \( there are certain three and fourletter combinations \) or there are n't enough of the codes to complete a proper policy \( at least five \) it simply lets the cookies install when students at carnegie mellon started investigating these bad codes , they noticed the exact same insufficient threecode combination showing up in more than 2 , 700 web sites curious how everyone could make the same mistake , they searched for the code in google and found , surprisingly , a microsoft support page microsoft says it has now retired the page cited by cylab \( you can see it , cached , here \) , adding that the codes shown there were meant only to be an example , not a recommendation it notes it also provides an article to guide web developers on how to properly configure p3p so it matches their written privacy policy cylab found that some of the internet s largest sites make use of the loophole , and through other means than the inaccurate microsoft codes for instance , facebook last year had a compact policy with the cheeky entry honk , dr cranor says \( honk is not a valid compactpolicy code , nor does it resemble any valid codes , which would explain codes that were mistyped \) facebook now has a policy with two correct codes , which is unusable because there must be at least five codes a facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement we 're committed to providing clear and transparent policies , as well as comprehensive access to those policies we 're looking into the paper s findings to see what , if any , changes we can make ben maurer , a software engineer at facebook , said that the site used only two codes instead of five because current compactpolicy codes do not allow a rich enough description to accurately represent our privacy policy mr maurer said he did not know the history of how honk made it into a compact policy the paper also notes that 134 sites with truste seals , which are meant to reassure consumers that strong privacy measures are in place at a web site , have faulty compact policies only 391 of more than 3 , 000 sites with the seal had compact policies at all truste s president , fran maier , said in a blog post that the group was investigating the matter and contacting customers mentioned in the paper she noted that customers selfattest to the accuracy of their policies , though truste will help them accomplish that she said p3p adoption has been poor across the internet because it was difficult to put into effect and because consumers did n't see value in it dr cranor says she thinks the real trouble is the lack of a regulatory requirement to use p3p , noting that few consumers know what p3p is i'm hoping companies will do the right thing , and it may take pressure form regulators to make that happen , she says beyond companies that are basically trying to look good on privacy , there is no incentive because you do n't have to do it this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
philadelphia among all the negative things that happened to the in the first two weeks of a season that started so poorly , perhaps none was as shocking as what occurred here sunday night in a performance as bewildering as it was poor , the ace johan santana , the man to whom the mets attached their hopes for the season , gave up a careerhigh 10 runs and tied his personal worst by allowing four home runs as a result , the mets lost to the , 115 , and their brief stay atop the national league east ended after a fourday visit there unable to control the location of his fastball , santana lasted three and twothirds innings and gave up eight hits , four of which easily cleared the fences placido polanco and ryan howard homered in the first inning in a disastrous fourth , the phillies scored nine times , eight of them off santana , as shane victorino hit a grand slam and two batters later chase utley hit a tworun homer tonight was different , santana said it was a crazy day santana s performance , the worst of his 11season career , was a complete surprise because , other than one bad inning against the washington nationals on april 11 , he had been dominant coming into the game , he had allowed only one run over all in his three previous starts against the cardinals , the cubs and the dodgers , all mets victories he was 31 with a 208 earned run average coming into the game , but his era more than doubled to 450 the 10 runs allowed were the most he had surrendered since he gave up nine against the yankees on june 14 last year the last time he allowed four home runs in a game was less than a week before that , against the phillies here on june 9 later that season , he had bone chips surgically removed from his elbow and he has reported no problems since santana said he felt good and had no health problems before or during the game i felt pretty good , he said i had a good warmup , and i felt everything was fine it was just one inning when everything went crazy and my fastball just went off and i was n't able to command it that was about it santana was actually close to escaping the fourthinning devastation with the mets leading , 53 utley , who had a double and a home run in the inning , was on second with two outs , and santana got ahead 02 in the count on raul ibanez santana tried to throw a fastball away from ibanez , but it tailed back over the plate and ibanez hit a groundball single to right field that scored utley that was the pitch that changed the whole inning , santana said what followed was far worse with two outs and the bases loaded , santana inexplicably walked pitcher jamie moyer to force in a run , then victorino followed with the second grand slam of his career , a drive into the stands in left field when moyer was at the plate , the fans stood and cheered in eager anticipation obviously out of sync , santana threw two straight balls to moyer , a 47yearold lefthander whose record against the mets improved to 105 in 26 career appearances against them santana had just walked carlos ruiz to get to moyer , and his command was simply not there with each pitch off the plate , fans grew louder and louder santana threw a called strike at 20 , and then another at 31 , but his fullcount offering was high and inside , well above where catcher rod barajas had set up his glove as the fans roared , ibanez trotted home even before santana had given up the grand slam the second he allowed this season his velocity appeared normal , if not a little bit higher than usual but it was clear he was struggling with his command after the grand slam , polanco singled to center and utley ripped a shot about 15 rows into the stands in right field that would be the end for santana , who had to trudge off the field to the hoots and howls of 45 , 439 mostly delirious phillies fans it was the largest crowd of the year at citizens bank park and the park s seventh largest santana was followed by hisanori takahashi while he was warming up , the outfielders jason bay , jeff francoeur and gary matthews jr stood in the outfield and ruminated over the unusual events we were like , wow , did n't see that happening , ' francoeur said but it s one game , one inning i 'll still take santana on the mound any day of the week how many times is that going to happen \? i 've never seen him give up runs like that , so i 'll just write that one off inside pitch jeff francoeur was hit on the left elbow by the softthrowing jamie moyer , but it was very close to where denys baez hit him friday night when francoeur got to first base , he explained to phillies first baseman ryan howard why he did not wear a pad i told howard that with moyer on the mound , i did n't think i 'd need it , francoeur said so i learned my lesson i 'll be wearing a pad tomorrow david wright hit his fifth home run of the season , giving him half as many in 25 games as he had all last season rod barajas homered in the fourth and now has seven homers and 15 runs batted in his last seven games here
in recent years , i have often said to european friends so , you did n't like a world of too much american power \? see how you like a world of too little american power because it is coming to a geopolitical theater near you yes , america has gone from being the supreme victor of world war ii , with guns and butter for all , to one of two superpowers during the cold war , to the indispensable nation after winning the cold war , to the frugal superpower of today get used to it that s our new nickname american pacifists need not worry any more about wars of choice we 're not doing that again we ca n't afford to invade grenada today ever since the onset of the great recession of 2008 , it has been clear that the nature of being a leader political or corporate was changing in america during most of the postworld war ii era , being a leader meant , on balance , giving things away to people today , and for the next decade at least , being a leader in america will mean , on balance , taking things away from people and there is simply no way that america s leaders , as they have to take more things away from their own voters , are not going to look to save money on foreign policy and foreign wars foreign and defense policy is a lagging indicator a lot of other things get cut first but the cuts are coming you can already hear the warnings from secretary of defense robert gates and a frugal american superpower is sure to have ripple effects around the globe the frugal superpower america s global leadership in a cashstrapped era is actually the title of a very timely new book by my tutor and friend michael mandelbaum , the johns hopkins university foreign policy expert in 2008 , mandelbaum notes , all forms of governmentsupplied pensions and health care \( including medicaid \) constituted about 4 percent of total american output at present rates , and with the baby boomers soon starting to draw on social security and medicare , by 2050 they will account for a full 18 percent of everything the united states produces this on top of all the costs of bailing ourselves out of this recession will fundamentally transform the public life of the united states and therefore the country s foreign policy for the past seven decades , in both foreign affairs and domestic policy , our defining watchword was more , argues mandelbaum the defining fact of foreign policy in the second decade of the 21st century and beyond will be less' when the world s only superpower gets weighed down with this much debt to itself and other nations everyone will feel it how \? hard to predict but all i know is that the most unique and important feature of us foreign policy over the last century has been the degree to which america s diplomats and naval , air and ground forces provided global public goods from open seas to open trade and from containment to counterterrorism that benefited many others besides us us power has been the key force maintaining global stability , and providing global governance , for the last 70 years that role will not disappear , but it will almost certainly shrink great powers have retrenched before britain for instance but , as mandelbaum notes , when britain could no longer provide global governance , the united states stepped in to replace it no country now stands ready to replace the united states , so the loss to international peace and prosperity has the potential to be greater as america pulls back than when britain did after all , europe is rich but wimpy china is rich nationally but still dirt poor on a per capita basis and , therefore , will be compelled to remain focused inwardly and regionally russia , drunk on oil , can cause trouble but not project power therefore , the world will be a more disorderly and dangerous place , mandelbaum predicts how to mitigate this trend \? mandelbaum argues for three things first , we need to get ourselves back on a sustainable path to economic growth and reindustrialization , with whatever sacrifices , hard work and political consensus that requires second , we need to set priorities we have enjoyed a century in which we could have , in foreign policy terms , both what is vital and what is desirable for instance , i presume that with infinite men and money we can succeed in afghanistan but is it vital \? i am sure it is desirable , but vital \? finally , we need to shore up our balance sheet and weaken that of our enemies , and the best way to do that in one move is with a much higher gasoline tax america is about to learn a very hard lesson you can borrow your way to prosperity over the short run but not to geopolitical power over the long run that requires a real and growing economic engine and , for us , the short run is now over there was a time when thinking seriously about american foreign policy did not require thinking seriously about economic policy that time is also over an america in hock will have no hawks or at least none that anyone will take seriously
on sunday night i took the no 7 train to willets point and walked through flushing meadowscorona park , past the giant unisphere constructed for the 196465 world s fair , to the queens theater in the park , where the was presenting its fourth show this year the unisphere is a queens landmark i'm embarrassed to admit that this was my first view of it this was also my first time experiencing the latino cultural festival , which is intended \( according to the publicity material \) to reflect the extraordinary demographic shift that in recent years has made queens the most diverse of the five boroughs of new york city and the nation the festival presents a different program each night sunday s was tango y vida \( tango and life \) , which swept its audience into the pulse , the melodies and the history of the argentine tango the program , despite its chaotic and amateurish sides , was diverse , sensuous and mainly serious it also made fascinating connections between the history of the tango and , among other places , new york and it was dominated by the excellence of its music making it s not unusual to see tango displays to taped music but the tango is at least as much sound as it is movement who created and directed tango y vida and has been a leader in propagating latin music in the united states for 40 years , arranged and directed all the music he also played piano he and his musicians wore uniforms of black shirts , black trousers and white ties the bandone n player , also wore whiterimmed glasses the best feature was the three violinists \( eddie venegas , al bello , iwaki kichiro \) and one violist \( luis casal \) , playing with tremendous verve mr valiente s view of the tango is sometimes allembracing he gives his audience music by the argentine masters and and other argentine numbers but he also included a gershwin medley that converted and other hits into tango tempo , and later did the same to this ought to offend any purist s ear actually , the valiente arrangements made them all delectable and the mozart item toward the evening s close became an irresistible milonga that incorporated all the performers who had appeared during the evening , especially the dance couples \( los pampas \) , and mariana parma and angel garciaclemente but though mr valiente s view of the tango was musically diverse , it was also historically well informed brief fragments of narration provided glimpses of the contributions to argentine tango by the american musician harold phillips and of the time spent in new york by the tango s most famous composers , gardel and piazzolla and none of mr valiente s dancers distorted the tango with high lifts or acrobatic extremes one couple the excellent ms parma and mr garcia first appeared in a waltz \( corazon de oro \) , but with such strong tango inflections that it was some time before i spotted its nontango meter later the pair performed the evening s biggest hit , a tango that was already potent as they approached each other slowly from opposite sides of the stage this abounded in marvelous giveandtake details , little flourishes of footwork that came from her , then him , then her again , and sudden skips from either partner while locked in each other s arms when she raised a leg \( not particularly high \) , the excitement came from the way she then snapped it back in and down , like a pocket knife in one phrase she leaned her weight onto him , stretched one leg low past one of his , and then a peculiarly striking effect took time to flex her foot and then point it none of these dancers are in the first flush of youth , and that was part of their appeal each time they returned to the stage , they showed a different aspect of the tango usually while wearing new attire and shoes the more i saw of the escuderos , the more i loved their cool wit even in their first number , they were like conspirators , and when she moved away from him in a few turns across the stage , she closed the phrase with a little beat of one foot against the other like the snap of a fan the whole program needed more rehearsal , and some of its opening passages were terrible an actor \( gabriel araucabarca \) orated melodramatically in spanish and flourished an unconvincing mockdagger toward his heart and there were strained attempts at comedy , with one singer and one violinist arriving onstage from the auditorium , as if by mistake but the program s heart , and mine , was in the music \( though the bandone n player stretched out two of his slow solos beyond endurance \) mariel sol and daniel holodek each sang several tango classics admirably , he with greater vocal caress , but she with crystalline diction and wonderful gradations between loud and soft the first violinist , was a tower of strength throughout he played a piazzolla solo in which you just felt hints of tango threading through the rhapsody descending pizzicati were contrasted with marvelously mellow tone in legato , and the pauses between phrases were exquisite you could see how often he coordinated the ensemble , what a good time he had with the second violinist , mr bello , and how much he made the event feel like a party it seemed no surprise that in the mozart he suddenly swapped his violin for a trombone he played that instrument with the same gusto in the finale the performers invited audience members onto the stage mr venegas and his trombone were at the center of this dance party as the curtains closed
los angeles for years cbs has lagged behind other television networks in its inclusion of gay , lesbian and transgender characters in the season that starts in september , however , a gay character will join the good wife , a lesbian character will join rules of engagement and a gay character will appear in the new sitcom ! my dad says speaking last week to television reporters , nina tassler , cbs entertainment president , said the network was adding the characters to its primetime programs because we 're very disappointed in our track record so far that record has been scrutinized by glaad , the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation for four years , the group s network responsibility index has assessed the quantity and quality of gay and lesbian representation on tv , and it has not been positive for cbs for the first two years , cbs was labeled adequate for last year and the current one it was labeled failing in its most recent study , released in july , glaad said that 7 percent of cbs s primetime hours included content that was lgbtinclusive , for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender , far fewer hours than the cw \( 35 percent \) , fox \( 30 percent \) , abc \( 26 percent \) or nbc \( 13 percent \) networks for several years , glaad said in the study , ms tassler has publicly promised greater lgbtinclusion in scripted programming and has consistently failed to deliver this year , though , ms tassler announced the addition of the three characters , saying that when it became clear that none of cbs s new shows included gay or lesbian characters , the network looked for other opportunities to improve the numbers we have represented in the casts she added so we 're going to do that , and then we 'll continue to focus on it as we go into the development season we 're not happy with ourselves rashad robinson , senior director of media programs for glaad , said there had been no change in tactics that may have prompted ms tassler s announcement , and no protest in the works i think this was part of the ongoing pressure that we 've kept on cbs , he said this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo nina tassler , president of cbs entertainment , unveiled three characters for the fall \( photograph by jeffrey staab cbs \)

arlington , tex in the household of darren and melissa oliver , it s never too early to teach your children the savvy skills of survival so when oliver pitched for the mets , in 2006 , he made sure that his two sons , brock and maxwell , learned something vital for navigating new york city how to hail a taxicab the boys were 5 and 3 and no , they were not taught the shrill , twopinky whistle said he simply demonstrated how to confidently step out into the street not too far , of course and emphatically raise a hand it s easy , because they saw us do it , oliver said everywhere we went , we took them with us we let them experience new york new york also is where the lefthanded oliver made the transition from fading starter to effective reliever , prolonging his career to the point where , at 40 , he is filling a key setup role against the in the american league championship series oliver s first chance in the series , in game 1 friday night , was a disaster oliver relieved starter c j wilson in the eighth with a threerun lead he fueled the yankees' fiverun rally by walking the only two batters he faced , nick swisher and mark teixeira , to load the bases with nobody out the yankees went on to bat around and take a 65 victory the yankees remain a sore subject for oliver fourteen years ago , in a 1996 al division series , oliver was a promising young texas starter who came within three outs of a seminal victory over the yankees a game that , had it worked out differently , might have altered the ' futile postseason history the texas franchise , founded as the expansion washington senators in 1961 , qualified for the playoffs for the first time in 1996 texas won the first game in the bronx , then blew a 41 lead in the second game and lost , 54 in 12 innings oliver started and pitched brilliantly , taking a 21 lead to the ninth inning but after and opened with singles , texas manager johnny oates brought in closer mike henneman the rangers' bullpen had been shaky all season , and henneman combusted both runners scored , the second on a mariano duncan single john wetteland closed out a 32 victory by striking out darryl hamilton with the tying run at third the yankees won the series in four games and went on to their first world series title under manager  all these years later , the loss still nags at oliver on thursday , before a workout at rangers ballpark , oliver insisted texas should have won game 2 as well as game 3 instead , the games became the first two losses in a ninegame postseason losing streak , which the rangers finally broke in this year s division series against tampa bay it was probably one of the maddest i 've been after a baseball game , that day , oliver said of game 3 we were so close to winning if it would have been a game like that nowadays , i probably would n't have been out there for the ninth they put so much emphasis on the closer and the bullpen for some yankees who were there , memory of the game has faded jeter recalled none of it , even after hearing some of the details you lost me as soon as you said '96 , he said andy pettitte said , i ca n't remember any of those games , exactly oliver s 146 record that season proved to be his career best this is his third stint with the rangers texas traded him to st louis during the 1998 season , resigned him in 2000 , then dealt him to boston for carl everett in december 2001 he spent time with the rockies , the marlins and the astros before landing with the mets in 2006 in 2006 , his first season exclusively in relief since 1994 , oliver went 41 with a 344 earned run average and pitched six scoreless innings in game 3 of the national league championship series against the cardinals oliver credited manager willie randolph with helping him make the transition to the bullpen he always gave me a little bit extra time to get ready , oliver said a lot of people probably did n't know that once i got used to it , it got a little bit easier that led to three successful seasons with the angels returning this year to texas , oliver held lefthanded batters to a 200 average while going 12 with a careerlow 248 era but his age makes him an easy target for his fellow relievers i think i was learning my state capitals when he broke into the big leagues , said darren o 'day , 27 , the rangers' righthanded relief specialist we talk about it all the time old darren , young darren homely darren , goodlooking darren we have a lot of fun with him he s done a great job of fostering a good environment down there he keeps us loose if anybody gets out of line , he s quick to grab them you ca n't say enough about what he s done oliver , however , wishes he had done more 14 years ago rangers fans , he said , still remind him of that 1996 team that was a good team , he said that was a team that probably could have went all the way if we had won that game and went on , i think we probably could have done some big things
the islamic republic of iran is not about to implode nevertheless , the misguided idea that it may do so is becoming enshrined as conventional wisdom in washington for president obama , this misconception provides a bit of cover it helps obscure his failure to follow up on his campaign promises about engaging iran with any serious , strategically grounded proposals meanwhile , those who have never supported diplomatic engagement with iran are now pushing the idea that the tehran government might collapse to support their arguments for military strikes against iranian nuclear targets and adopting regime change as the ultimate goal of america s iran policy let s start with the most recent events on dec 27 , large crowds poured into the streets of cities across iran to commemorate the shiite holy day of ashura this coincided with mourning observances for a revered cleric , grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , who had died a week earlier protesters used the occasion to gather in tehran and elsewhere , setting off clashes with security forces important events , no doubt but assertions that the islamic republic is now imploding in the fashion of the shah s regime in 1979 do not hold up to even the most minimal scrutiny antigovernment iranian web sites claim there were tens of thousands of ashura protesters others in iran say there were 2 , 000 to 4 , 000 whichever estimate is more accurate , one thing we do know is that much of iranian society was upset by the protesters using a sacred day to make a political statement vastly more iranians took to the streets on dec 30 , in demonstrations organized by the government to show support for the islamic republic \( one web site that opposed president mahmoud ahmadinejad s reelection in june estimated the crowds at one million people \) photographs and video clips lend considerable plausibility to this estimate meaning this was possibly the largest crowd in the streets of tehran since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini s funeral in 1989 in its wake , even president ahmadinejad s principal challenger in last june s presidential election , mir hossein mousavi , felt compelled to acknowledge the unacceptable radicalism of some ashura protesters the focus in the west on the antigovernment demonstrations has blinded many to an inconvenient but inescapable truth the iranians who used ashura to make a political protest do not represent anything close to a majority those who talk so confidently about an opposition in iran as the vanguard for a new revolution should be made to answer three tough questions first , what does this opposition want \? second , who leads it \? third , through what process will this opposition displace the government in tehran \? in the case of the 1979 revolutionaries , the answers to these questions were clear they wanted to oust the americanbacked regime of shah mohammed reza pahlavi and to replace it with an islamic republic everyone knew who led the revolution ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , who despite living in exile in paris could mobilize huge crowds in iran simply by sending cassette tapes into the country while supporters disagreed about the revolution s longterm agenda , khomeini s ideas were well known from his writings and public statements after the shah s departure , khomeini returned to iran with a draft constitution for the new political order in hand as a result , the basic structure of the islamic republic was set up remarkably quickly beyond expressing inchoate discontent , what does the current opposition want \? it is no longer championing mr mousavi s presidential candidacy mr mousavi himself has now redefined his agenda as national reconciliation some protesters seem to want expanded personal freedoms and interaction with the rest of the world , but have no comprehensive agenda others who have received considerable western press coverage have taken to calling for the islamic republic s replacement with an \( ostensibly secular \) iranian republic but university of maryland polling after the election and popular reaction to the ashura protests suggest that most iranians are unmoved , if not repelled , by calls for the islamic republic s abolition with mr mousavi increasingly marginalized , who else might lead this supposed revolution \? surely not ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , the former president who became a leading figure in the protests after last summer s election yes , he is an accomplished political actor , is considered a founding father of the state and heads the assembly of experts , a body that can replace the islamic republic s supreme leader but mr rafsanjani lost his 2005 bid to regain the presidency in a landslide to mr ahmadinejad , and has shown no inclination to spur the masses to bring down the system he helped create nor will mohammad khatami , the reformist elected president in 1997 , lead the charge in 1999 , at the height of his popularity , he publicly disowned widespread student demonstrations protesting the closing of a newspaper that had supported his administration many of the westerners who see the opposition displacing the islamic republic emphasize the potential for unrest during shiite mourning rituals , which take place at three , seven and 40day intervals after a person s death during the final months of the shah s rule , his opponents used mourning rituals held for demonstrators killed by security forces to catalyze further protests but does this mean that a steady stream of mourning rituals for fallen protesters today will set off a similarly escalating spiral of protests , eventually sweeping away iran s political order \? that is highly unlikely first , ayatollah montazeri had unique standing in the islamic republic s history it is not surprising that the coincidence of his sevenday observance with the ashura observation would have drawn crowds his 40day observance which will fall on jan 29 and the early february commemoration of the 1979 revolution might also encourage public activism but there is nothing in the islamic republic s history to support projections that future mourning rituals for those killed in the ashura protests will elicit similar attention for example , in late 1998 four prominent intellectuals were assassinated , allegedly by state intelligence officers , prompting considerable public outrage yet the mourning rituals for the victims did not prompt largescale protests in 1999 , nationwide student protests were violently suppressed , with at least five people killed and 1 , 200 detained once again , though , the mourning dates for those who died did not generate significant new demonstrations likewise , after the presidential election in june , none of the deaths associated with security force action even that of neda aghasoltan , the young woman whose murder became a cause c l bre of the youtube age resulted in further unrest in keeping with this pattern , the sevenday mourning observances for those killed in the ashura protests generated no significant demonstrations in iran clearly , comparisons of the ashura protests to the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , projecting a cascade of monumental consequences to follow , are fanciful the islamic republic will continue to be iran s government and , even if there were changes in some top leadership positions such as the replacement of mr ahmadinejad as president by ali larijani , the speaker of the parliament , as some westerners speculate this would not fundamentally change iran s approach on regional politics , its nuclear program and other matters of concern the obama administration s halfhearted efforts at diplomacy with tehran have given engagement a bad name as a result , support for more coercive options is building across the american political spectrum the president will do a real disservice to american interests if he waits in vain for iranian political dynamics to solve the problems with his iran policy as a model , the president would do well to look to china since president richard nixon s opening there \( which took place amid the cultural revolution \) , successive american administrations have been wise enough not to let political conflict whether among the ruling elite or between the state and the public , as in the tiananmen square protests and ethnic separatism in xinjiang divert washington from sustained , strategic engagement with beijing president obama needs to begin displaying similar statesmanship in his approach to iran
back in the early '80s , when the zagat survey was still just a single sheet of legalsize paper that nina and tim zagat gave to friends and colleagues , they learned that their list of the best restaurants in new york had been reproduced en masse inside citibank i had a friend there who called me and said he 'd just gotten one of these things on his desk , mr zagat recalls printed across the top , it said , 'to all officers of the bank' and when i asked how many officers there were , he told me there were 3 , 000 for the zagats , this was one of the first signs that their hobby of tabulating restaurant ratings might have wide appeal in fairly short order , the new york survey , and the narrow maroon books for other major cities that the couple assembled in its wake , became indispensable for gourmands on the go in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s and up until a few years ago , the release of the coming year s zagat \( pronounced zuhgat \) ratings was a hotly anticipated event among the status conscious and the merely hungry with results that would often go viral when a humble brooklyn establishment called the grocery scored an almost perfect zagat score of 28 on a zeroto30 scale for its food in 2003 , for example , it made the front page of this newspaper today , however , viral is hardly the first word that pops off of people s tongues when you ask about zagat survey , the company s official name they talk about the power of the zagat brand that maroon color is now trademarked , for instance and they give the zagats credit for having invented , or at least popularized , usergenerated content but in the next breath , most of them wonder why zagat has n't won on the web the review site yelp , for example , which made its debut in 2004 , draws much more traffic in early 2008 , at a time of high valuations for many emerging web companies , the zagats tried and failed to sell their company , to the disappointment of some of the venture capitalists who had invested in zagat in 2000 we 've now been at it for 10 years , so of course we 'd like to have an exit , says bill ford , the ceo of the venture capital firm general atlantic , which has invested in zagat it s my belief that the brand has not been fully leveraged mr ford , who was once a zagat board member , is quick to note that the things that attracted general atlantic to zagat in 2000 are still there today they had outstanding and differentiated content , and the opportunity to migrate it from offline to online , both on the web and on mobile , he says yet that migration has been neither as dexterous nor as profitable as zagat backers had hoped perhaps the biggest reason is that the zagats have kept their ratings and their reviews behind a pay wall on their web site the cost was high in terms of lost traffic , for just as the zagats were digging in their heels , google was rapidly gaining market share among web users google penalizes sites that keep content behind a pay wall as a result , zagat listings usually did n't appear on the first page of a google search result for specific restaurants because of that , fewer people came to zagatcom , which meant that it did n't have the opportunity to convert them to paid subscribers while online traffic comparisons are never exact , zagatcom had 570 , 000 unique domestic web visitors in september , according to the nielsen company , versus 94 million for yelp the zagats say they actually have more than 12 million unique users worldwide none of this means zagat is in any immediate financial danger while the zagats refused to provide much specific financial information for this article , they did say their company is still profitable they are also quick to point out that it s not at all clear that yelp s strategy of having dozens of salespeople selling local ads is superior to their approach of asking web and mobile users to pay for listings zagat , meanwhile , still sells its paper books and operates what the couple describe as an extremely profitable unit that creates custom guides for corporate clients the digital wheel has also turned in a new direction , with more consumers using smartphones and other mobile devices to find content and services through apps while zagatcom has met resistance from desktop computer users when it comes time to whip out their credit cards , mobile customers have shown more willingness to pay for apps so now zagat is racing to prove that it s worth paying 999 a year for its smartphone app and that it can persuade enough customers to fund its existence for another three decades even while yelp and other competitors are offering their apps free even after the failed sale in 2008 , the zagats profess no regrets about their web strategy in fact , they think the world is finally catching up to them when i think back on the business model , with our books designed to fit in a pocketbook , there we were at the beginning with all three things that we 're all talking about today , ms zagat says mobile , social and local that is in the dna of zagat tim zagat and nina safronoff got to know one another in 1963 , in a study group they joined as firstyear students at yale law school i liked her for plenty of reasons , in part because she took such great notes but also because she knew how to cook , mr zagat says they bonded over homecooked meals , both good and bad
washington weeks into the largest in american history , government officials met in washington to discuss ways to compel , which leased the drilling rig , to move faster in stopping the spill one proposal called for suspending the company from getting government work under a federal law aimed at protecting taxpayers against unscrupulous contractors but there was a snag bp , the regulators knew from experience , might be too big to ban they recalled that last year , before the spill in the gulf of mexico , officials at the environmental protection agency wanted to stop bp from getting government contracts until it addressed various environmental and safety violations then , according to a lawyer involved in the debarment process at the agency , the pentagon objected bp was its biggest supplier of fuel as the case of bp illustrates , the largest companies often escape the stiffest penalties because government agencies are too dependent on them and even when there are suspensions or debarments they usually affect individuals or a business unit within the company , not the whole company the top 100 government contractors have paid more than 19 billion in cases of fraud , bribery , falsifying records and other violations over the past 15 years , but only four of them have been suspended from government contracting , and none have been debarred , according to a database from the , a group based in washington the database is based on the contractor rankings for the 2009 fiscal year the issue of how to deal with these big companies has gained currency in recent months because of the bp case and allegations that iraqi officials were bribed by blackwater worldwide , now called xe services , in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act in the case of blackwater , state department officials pledged to pull its contracts , only to find that no other security companies were big enough to do the work while small companies are often debarred , the biggest ones , like bp , have become the equivalent of too big to fail , senator russ feingold , democrat of wisconsin , said at a congressional hearing this year we need to hold government contractors to a high standard , mr feingold said , and i do not think that large corporations should be given a free pass for behavior that would typically result in the debarment of a smaller corporation some government officials concede there are problems during a recent conference , inspectors general from the departments of transportation and homeland security and the general services administration said the system was plagued by inconsistent standards , a reluctance to act in many cases , and other issues numerous audits by the and federal agencies have pointed to shortcomings one last year by the inspector general of the agency for international development found that the agency has not used contractor suspension and debarment to adequately protect the public interest only three agencies in the federal government have fulltime debarment officials , the epa , the air force and the navy the rest have parttime officials who are typically part of the procurement office , creating a potential conflict because these officials are also trying to arrange contracts for their agencies representative luis v gutierrez , democrat of illinois , has pushed through an amendment to the military authorization bill requiring the secretary of defense to review whether bp is a responsible contractor , with a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics if not , the legislation would require defense secretary robert m gates to bar the oil giant from military contracts , said mr gutierrez s spokesman , douglas rivlin last month , the house of representatives passed a debarment bill , introduced by peter welch , democrat of vermont , that would ban contractors guilty of violating the foreign corrupt practices act from government contracts it was aimed at xe services , which has not been charged with or convicted of a crime , but it would also affect large government contractors like bae systems , daimler ag , and innospec inc , which all pleaded guilty this year to making illegal payments to foreign officials both measures passed with bipartisan support alan chvotkin , executive vice president and counsel of the professional services council , a washington trade group that represents large contractors , said he thought the current system worked well large corporations , mr chvotkin said , are often better able to identify and correct misconduct , and that may account for the low rate of suspensions and debarments for the largest contractors at small companies , mr chvotkin said , the person responsible for the misconduct might be the company leader who is also critical to making or providing what the government needs if you remove or isolate him , you isolate the expertise , and the company ca n't really provide a service to the government , he said he added that since there are more small companies with government contracts than larger ones , it makes sense that they would be represented more in the database government debarment officials say they aggressively pursue companies regardless of size , citing the suspension of international business machines in 2008 after an epa employee provided proprietary information to ibm employees that was used to try to win a government contract , boeing in 2004 for illegally obtaining proprietary information from a competitor , and more recently l3 communications after it admitted to monitoring emails of its workers , workers for other contractors and united states government employees two units of bp have also been banned from government contracts because of environmental and safety violations that resulted in the death of several workers more recently , the government suspended gtsi , a big contractor , but reinstated it after the chief executive and the general counsel resigned it recently won a share of a 30 billion contract from the fbi i have always been empowered to do the right thing , regardless of the impact that a debarment would have on the ability to obtain specific goods or services , said steven shaw , a debarment official with the air force , who was responsible for l3 s suspension debarment officials say agencies can be tough in ways other than suspension and debarment , including agreements in which companies agree to corrective measures with oversight by the agencies the government has suspended some big companies , but critics note that these cases usually involve individual units and not the entire company , unlike cases involving smaller businesses in the case of the boeing suspension six years ago , they point out that it applied to two business units and that the government granted them a waiver and gave them contracts worth more than 50 million because of compelling needs in the national interest , according to the air force scott amey , general counsel of the project on government oversight , said that although the justice department had gone after contractors for fraud and other crimes , its efforts had not been enough of a deterrent he noted that in may , the chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform , representative edolphus towns of new york , wrote to attorney general eric h holder jr expressing concerns that criminal and civil settlements between the justice department and federal contractors were preventing federal agencies from suspending or debarring poorly performing contractors in certain instances , mr amey noted , contractors subject to civil and criminal settlements with the department continue to rack up violations mr amey rejected the notion that the inclusion of so many small companies on the government s list of banned companies was simply a matter of numbers when you look at the fact that the bulk of federal dollars going to contractors are going to large companies , that argument does n't hold up , he said
san diego minutes after cemented the most surprising upset of this nfl season , before travel plans for the american football conference championship had been booked , linebacker bart scott stood defiant at his locker , mouth running , faster than ever scott loudly listed the slights , the dozens of socalled experts who picked against the jets , who said they backed into these playoffs , even the , who scott said spent the first half reminding the jets they did not belong on the jets' joy ride to the game before the , their loquacious linebacker and the rest of his teammates have clung to their underdog status even after they in front of the 69 , 498 they silenced at qualcomm stadium , the jets sounded the same theme everybody can say we do n't deserve to be here , scott said that we snuck in that we 're a fluke then scott added , we have n't even cracked the seal on how good we can be already the jets were looking toward next sunday , to their rematch against indianapolis , the same team that jumpstarted their run by pulling their starters in the third quarter of the secondtolast game this season the jets won that game and the three that followed they have won two games in the same postseason for the first time since 1982 they advanced to the afc title game for the first time since the 1998 season when it ended , the jets gathered in the most jubilant of locker rooms they talked about training camp , back in cortland , ny , how everything started there they stole glances at the super bowl rings worn by offensive linemen damien woody and alan faneca , a reminder of the work and the possibility that lie ahead linebacker calvin pace said he had never heard the lord s prayer sung at such volume i do n't think you could write the script any better , pace said pace then hit the season highlights , as if writing this crazy script himself the 30 start , the six losses in seven games , the lastsecond failing against atlanta after which coach declared the season dead the death of casey johnson , the daughter of the team owner woody johnson , before last week s playoff game at cincinnati even saturday night , at the team hotel , pace said seeds were being sown there was ryan , the master of motivation , showing his team a montage of the boxer mike tyson , dozens of body blows followed by a series of knockout punches the game , pace said , unfolded along those lines on a playoff weekend when every top seed advanced in the three games before this one including brett favre , the quarterback the jets rented last season , and minnesota the jets pulled the only upset , one sure to place the spotlight on norv turner , the chargers coach with the underwhelming playoff record the game turned near the end of the third quarter jets safety jim leonhard intercepted a forced pass from quarterback philip rivers , chargers linebacker shaun phillips was assessed a personal foul for a head butt , and the jets started the fourth quarter 7 yards from taking their first lead three plays later , made the defining play of this season that it came from a rookie quarterback did not surprise his teammates they watched sanchez s growth over the past month , the way he turned the ball over only once , an interception here , in the past four games they saw him roll right on thirdandgoal , buying time , waiting , searching , then throwing to the smallest window , to tight end dustin keller for a 2yard touchdown and a 107 lead forget the 20 interceptions sanchez threw this season with that play , he validated the jets' decision to trade up for him last april , to award him the richest contract in team history , to gamble that he could take a veteran team deep into the playoffs he s just grown up , the backup quarterback kellen clemens said in the last month , he s made huge , huge strides there s been a ton of growth he s a huge factor on our hot streak so has another rookie the jets traded up to select last april his name is shonn greene , and he broke through the chargers' defense , ran over a linebacker and went 53 yards into the end zone for the longest run in franchise postseason history that play gave the jets a 177 lead , a cushion large enough to withstand a late score from the chargers again , the jets' youth movement contributed to the victory cornerback darrelle revis \( interception \) , sanchez \( 100 passing yards , touchdown pass \) , keller \( touchdown catch \) and greene \( 128 rushing yards \) all have three years of experience or fewer none are familiar with the franchise s history of disappointment , only this season , this team , this run that 17 points could vanquish a prolific chargers offense that had scored at least 20 in every game this season spoke volumes about the jets' defensive effort the jets grabbed two interceptions and broke up six passes they sacked rivers twice and hit him on another five occasions the jets' run game took care of the rest with the clock winding down on the chargers' season , the jets faced a fourthand1 at the chargers' 29yard line rather than try for the field goal , the jets ran thomas jones up the middle everyone knew what was coming , but jones gained 2 yards and the jets advanced it s amazing how 1 yard can feel that good , he said now , the jets set their sights on a return to indianapolis , on another round of doubts fullback tony richardson said the jets welcome facing the colts' full complement of stars for an entire game , which will strike some as be careful what you wish for offensive tackle d'brickashaw ferguson said this run felt like divine intervention , as if fate was smiling on the jets after 40 years of breaks that went the other way the jets , underdogs for certain , are not content with just making the afc championship game

kigali , rwanda s president , , who has been in control of this country since 1994 and helped resurrect it from into one of the most orderly nations in africa , appeared to have been reelected on monday by an overwhelming margin , according to incomplete election results released early tuesday many rwandans said they had voted for mr kagame for delivering very tangible benefits to their lives , like more schools , more roads , decent internet service and a sense of peace and security however , some rwandans complained about being forced to vote for him , and in the months leading up to the election , several opposition leaders and journalists were jailed or killed kagame , kagame , kagame ! shouted ignace ntezimana , a college student who said he had cast his vote for the president he rattled off a list of reasons why security education infrastructure but the most important reason , he said , was this kagame is our leader we have to follow him voters lined up in neat , quiet lines before dawn in some precincts , every voter on the registry had cast a ballot in the first hour , according to state media the president s team was so confident that they began inviting people to the victory bash before the polls had closed but then none of his three challengers , all former allies , was considered a genuine alternative the leading opposition politicians who have spoken out against mr kagame were barred from competing \( the government cited technical reasons \) one , with his head nearly chopped off some ballot boxes were swathed in shiny pink fabric and festooned with bows , ribbons and balloons the elaborate decorations , along with the reports of 100 percent turnout in some places , seemed to reinforce what western human rights groups and critics inside the country have been saying about rwanda s democracy , that it is essentially a dressedup dictatorship increasing political repression and a crackdown on free speech was several rwandans said in recent interviews that local officials and police officers had made them contribute to the kagame campaign and vote for him voters here do not punch out a chad or scratch an x to cast their vote , but leave a carefully pressed thumb print next to their choice this system seemed to feed into some voters' suspicions that there was no such thing as a secret ballot here , and that if the government wanted to , it could determine who voted against the president they are watching us , said one man , gaetan , who feared giving out his full name yet many people seemed quite excited about another seven years of mr kagame as president and that may be the complicated reality in rwanda that at the same time to many people in a poor corner of the poorest continent , mr kagame has delivered what they need these are kagame schools , said theophile hakizimana , a teacher , tapping the bricks of a rural school built a few years ago he said he had just voted for mr kagame i think just about everyone here did , he said mr hakizimana was 10 during rwanda s genocide in 1994 , when hutu death squads massacred 800 , 000 tutsis and moderate hutus many countries said it would be impossible for us to rebuild , he said look at us now rwanda is considered one of africa s safest and least corrupt nations , and it has made enormous strides in expanding its economy and fighting poverty mr kagame , 52 , is a former rebel fighter who grew up as a refugee in uganda analysts say he embodies a mix of progressive values and dictatorial tendencies while he has abolished the death penalty , promoted women and embraced new technologies , he also seems allergic to dissent and has enforced hardline policies he has justified his actions by saying that peace in rwanda is still very fragile and that free expression could lead to another ethnic war he and other government officials have denied any role in the recent attacks on opposition politicians and journalists
los angeles as the wilted this summer as matt kemp continued to make mental mistakes , as andre ethier could not shake out of his funk , as manny ramirez was not going to ride to the rescue called more meetings than at any time in his long career as a manager when none of the calming and cajoling helped , torre came to a conclusion i felt this ball club needed a different voice , a younger voice , torre said and so , after nearly three seasons of managing the dodgers , torre decided , at age 70 , that this would be his last with the team he will be replaced by , who has been the dodgers' batting coach since midway through the 2008 season and coached at torre s side with the yankees for four seasons but has never managed dodgers general manager ned colletti acknowledged for the first time friday that the club had added a clause to mattingly s contract last march that guaranteed him the opportunity to succeed torre we wanted continuity , somebody who understood our players , understood our situation and not have to adapt , said colletti , who said the decision to hire mattingly without interviewing any minority candidates was approved by major league baseball giving the inexperienced mattingly a multiyear contract that colletti said had two guaranteed years was not exactly a hit with fans a los angeles times poll asking readers who should be the next manager favored the former dodger tim wallach , currently the class aaa manager , with 63 percent mattingly , who committed some embarrassing mistakes while standing in for torre this year , received 165 percent , while someone else had nearly 21 percent torre , whose threeyear , 13 million contract expires after this season , had been deliberating about whether to return after a disappointing season on the field and a distracting one off it , with the bitter divorce case between the dodgers owner frank mccourt and his wife , jamie , as a backdrop in the spring , torre expressed interest in a new contract , but he tabled discussions abruptly , saying he did not want them to become a distraction torre walked into a packed dodger stadium club two hours before the dodgers' game against the colorado rockies on friday seated in the front row were his wife , ali , and his teenage daughter , andrea the scene was much more upbeat than three years ago , when he held a news conference in a hotel ballroom in westchester county after deciding to leave the yankees , who had offered him an incentiveladen contract he considered an insult i was questioning whether i was too old for this job because it was n't any fun anymore , torre said of his departure from new york it is a whole different circumstance and personality today than it was a few years ago i'm still excited about the game i'm not washed out of it torre , with a record of 2 , 3181 , 990 as a manager ranking fifth in career wins did not close the door on managing again , though he did not know if there would be an opportunity for him he planned to speak with colletti next month about serving as an adviser , and planned to be in baseball somewhere he spent from 1985 to 1990 as the color commentator for the angels it s not easy to say you do n't want to do something anymore , said torre , who informed colletti of his decision earlier this week when the dodgers were in san francisco baseball s been my life and hopefully will continue to be my life in some capacity am i going to miss it \? of course , i'm going to miss it torre s name has come up in connection with two teams the chicago cubs , who have an opening after lou piniella stepped down last month and the mets , who are expected to fire jerry manuel at the end of the season asked if he would have any interest in highprofile managing jobs , torre said recently , everybody whose contracts are up are candidates everywhere when torre left the yankees after 12 years , during which he won four world series titles but fell short of the series in his final four seasons , he came quickly to los angeles the dodgers , after running through three general managers and two managers in the first four years of mccourt s ownership , were seeking stability and credibility at that stage , there s no question , colletti said of the importance of those two qualities he brought a great stability and calmness , like an old soul he was someone who people knew before they knew him torre largely delivered , as the dodgers were transformed from youthful underachievers to a team that won consecutive division titles and lost to the phillies in the national league championship series the last two years but this year the dodgers took a step back they were undone by injuries to four starters shortstop rafael furcal , outfielders ethier and ramirez , and catcher russell martin and some of their promising players , center fielder kemp , first baseman james loney , closer jonathan broxton and martin , did not progress as hoped when ramirez was placed on waivers at the end of august , it was viewed as the dodgers sending up a white flag they sat at 7275 , 11 games out of first place in the nl west , entering friday night mattingly served one season as torre s bench coach in new york and has otherwise been the batting coach he joined torre in los angeles when he was passed over for the yankees job , which went to joe girardi the dodgers announced earlier this season that mattingly would manage this fall in the arizona fall league i have a confidence in myself , said mattingly , 49 i feel ready it s baseball i 've been around the game a long time , not necessarily in the manager s seat , but i 've seen how the game is played when you win , and how it s played when lose there s a feeling inside me that says i'm ready in his stints filling in for torre , mattingly has done little to inspire confidence in spring training , while torre was in taiwan , the dodgers were penalized for handing a lineup card to umpires that did not match the one in their clubhouse in a july game , after torre had been ejected , mattingly went to the mound to talk to broxton with one out , the bases loaded and the dodgers clinging to a 54 lead in the ninth inning as he turned to leave , loney called out to mattingly , who headed back to the mound that constituted a second visit , and broxton had to be replaced george sherrill , the subsequent reliever , gave up the winning hit as batting coach , mattingly has presided over a group that is 12th in the nl in hits after leading the league last season
london the most intriguing move so far in this summer s soccer transfer period has not been any of the household names stockpiled by manchester city , chelsea , barcelona or real madrid rather , it is the gamble that has made in who has not yet played a game in portugal s top league the firstdivision club vit ria guimar es had signed tiago manuel dias correia for nothing five weeks earlier but manchester united paid the buyout clause in his contract last week when it became known that other big clubs , real madrid among them , were sniffing around the striker known simply as b b the nickname has stuck since childhood , when an older brother called him baby born to immigrants from , picked up off the streets where they lived a rough life , they were taken as youngsters into a charitable institution , a refuge and orphanage in loures , north of lisbon by then , the streetwise skills , the improvisation that was so scarce at the world cup this summer , were bred into b b he s raw material , but we can work with that , manchester united manager alex ferguson said it s a fairy tale when you read about his background when we identify someone with potential , we normally assess that over a period of time but we have a good scout in portugal , and he s very bright he s got a tremendous instinct about the boy and other clubs were starting to hover on the boy , so we made a quick decision sometimes you have to work on an impulse , and we 're good at developing young players , ferguson said b b is not so young he turned 20 last month , and it was his agent , jorge mendes , who guided cristiano ronaldo from manchester united to real madrid mendes also represents jos mourinho , who became real madrid s coach this summer it would have been mendes who inserted the buyout clause in b b s contract when he stepped up to guimar es this summer among those whom ferguson quizzed about b b s potential was carlos queiroz , portugal s national team coach and a former assistant to ferguson at manchester united when ferguson talks of impulse or instinct , he is hoodwinking his audience before he signs any player , from a schoolboy to a worldrenowned star , he badgers people about the lifestyle , the family , the roots of that individual and no deal is completed until manchester united s doctors have run a battery of tests on the player ferguson flew to lisbon the day before he authorized the signing of b b he was there to provide a character reference for queiroz , who was accused of having intimidated and insulted doping officials who arrived unannounced in may at portugal s training camp before the world cup he s a fantastic coach and teacher , ferguson told the tribunal his main purpose in life is to develop young people , to inspire them and to make sure they turn out good human beings he s one of the good guys and a good source of players ferguson signed ronaldo as a teenager from sporting lisbon , as well as anderson and nani , who are current firstteam players at manchester united but when ferguson says his club is good at developing young players , the greatest testimony to that came again at old trafford on monday night manchester united overwhelmed newcastle , 30 , in its first match of the season paul scholes , now 35 , was the complete playmaker , a man developed from a boy born at the nearby hope hospital , now embarking on his 16th season with the club when scholes made his final pass , and ryan giggs volleyed the third goal , it was a glorious example of working with raw material giggs is 37 , starting his 21st season he has scored in every one of them some legacy , then , for b b to live up to it is still some journey for a young man who two years ago was hoping to play in the that tournament is for enthusiastic amateurs the next edition will feature 30 , 000 players from 64 nations on copacabana beach in rio de janeiro from sept 1926 i had the dream of playing one day for a major club , b b said last week football can change lives , very much he might have spoken , in that simple sentence , for millions around the world who are being drawn into projects that use soccer to give street youths hope the mathare youth sports association in kenya has been running since 1987 as a way of diverting youngsters away from hopelessness , drugs , violence and aids by the sound of it , b b could have lost his way but for his talent he s a player who is the fruit of street football , jorge paix o said on radio antena 1 last week paix o coached b b in his one season at estrela da amadora in portugal s third division before guimar es signed him as a free agent nowadays , paix o added , players are schooled in the clubs he has none of this he s old school he learned to play in the street and has that natural creativity he improvises because he has quality and a set of characteristics that are difficult to find in a single player he is tall , good in the air , technically gifted , fast and strong b b , who is 6 feet 2 inches , can play wing or striker time will tell whether he adapts to manchester s team play he must learn his first words of english he must adapt to climate , training and expectations paix o , his former coach , has identified the prime asset improvisation i remember sandor barcs , the president of hungary s soccer federation during the era of the 1950s , explaining decades later why hungary lost that magic listen , barcs said in a budapest street what do you hear \? there was nothing but the sound of traffic what we had back then was boom , boom , boom everywhere , you would see kids kicking the ball , or an improvised ball , against the walls or railings when you lose that , you lose the level of play
arlington , tex the margin of error is slim when the play at ballpark , where all four games this season have been decided by one run the yankees have lost three of them , with perhaps none as excruciating or deflating as the 76 decision to texas on saturday night sunday morning , actually that sliced their lead over tampa bay in the american league east to a halfgame after alex rodriguez s basesclearing double gave the yankees a 65 lead in the eighth , faced six batters in the bottom of the ninth and retired only one of them the inning began with rivera walking the leadoff hitter and ended , improbably , with his drilling jeff francoeur with the bases loaded at 12 22 am local time it was the yankees' first loss in 77 games this season in which they led after eight innings it s one of those games that bothers you if it does n't go the way you want to , rivera said to avoid a threegame sweep , the yankees on sunday afternoon will turn to dustin moseley and an undermanned bullpen manager joe girardi refrains from pitching relievers on three straight days , which eliminates rivera , kerry wood , dave robertson , boone logan and chad gaudin the yankees have lost two straight games here on the final pitch , with nelson cruz scoring the winning run each time , after a combined 9 hours 28 minutes in those losses , they have stranded 32 runners , and on saturday failed to produce in three straight opportunities with the bases loaded in their fourth try , rodriguez s double turned a 53 deficit in the eighth inning into a 65 advantage wood stranded a runner on third to end the eighth , and rivera came in to pitch the ninth after working two innings the night before he only threw 23 pitches it was n't like he threw 35 , 40 pitches , girardi said if he had thrown that many , there s no way i would have used him tonight usually , rivera is automatic he has blown only three saves this season , and he had not lost since aug 10 when the rangers vanquished him in the 10th inning from the first batter , rivera felt his command was lacking vladimir guerrero walked on five pitches and then was replaced by a pinchrunner , esteban german wary of german stealing , rivera used a slidestep toward the plate he did the same thing friday night but cruz was not fooled he lined a single to rightcenter , putting runners on the corners for ian kinsler , who sneaked a double inside the thirdbase bag that scored german with the tying run chris davis was walked intentionally to set up a potential force at home , which never happened after andres blanco popped out , rivera plunked francoeur on the left shoulder , and the rangers mobbed cruz at the plate for the second straight night you ca n't go out there and walk the leadoff guy , rivera said that s what bothers me the most the sheer length of friday s game 13 innings , 5 hours 12 minutes forced the teams to exhaust their bullpens on saturday , a 59minute rain delay , which occurred with no outs in the bottom of the fifth , knocked out starters a j burnett and tommy hunter and turned the game into a bullpen battle the rangers fired the first salvo off robertson , the yankees' third reliever of the sixth , who allowed two inherited runners to score , and then one all by himself in the seventh , when mitch moreland lined a twoout single to push texas ahead , 53 pedro strop , who finished the seventh by getting jorge posada to ground into an inningending double play with the bases full , was pulled in the eighth with a runner on first and one out in came the lefthander matt harrison , who allowed a single to nick swisher who left the bases loaded in the second and the sixth and a walk to mark teixeira for all of the pitching changes that texas manager ron washington had made he used 10 relievers friday night and three before harrison he did not , for whatever reason , have a righthander ready to come in and face rodriguez as a team , the yankees entered saturday hitting 390 with the bases loaded , with 10 grand slams , including three by rodriguez on the second pitch from harrison , rodriguez ripped a grounder just inside the thirdbase bag , and it took a nifty slide by teixeira to score the goahead run seemed really big at the time , girardi said of rodriguez s double the yankees had faced hunter once before , in 2008 , in his second career start , and blitzed him for eight hits and five runs he has matured into the linchpin of the rangers' rotation , adding stability as scott feldman and rich harden have struggled , but he is hardly guaranteed a playoff start the rangers , should they match up with the yankees , love the idea of throwing lefthanded pitchers like cliff lee , c j wilson and derek holland at them , and the righthander colby lewis may also have an edge hunter is not known as a strikeout pitcher , but he had a careerhigh eight through four innings , including two each of rodriguez and swisher the bottom of the yankees' order compensated , cramming most of the team s offense off hunter into the second inning , when lance berkman and francisco cervelli delivered runscoring singles that put the yankees up 21 perhaps nothing irks burnett more than allowing runs immediately after the yankees score he shut down the rangers in the bottom of the second , but another of his pet peeves and his manager s helped texas tie the score in the third a twoout walk to david murphy preceded a double into the leftcenter field gap by guerrero , who had driven in the rangers' first run with a firstinning single burnett issued another twoout walk in the fourth , but struck out elvis andrus to strand runners on second and third i told skip today , i'm close , i feel it , burnett said just bear down a little bit more with two outs the stuff s there , the confidence is there , and every time out i'm feeling better and better inside pitch a recurrence of soreness in his right wrist forced brett gardner to leave the game after five innings the wrist has bothered gardner from time to time since he was hit by a clayton kershaw pitch on june 27 in los angeles , and he said he expects to have a magnetic resonance imaging exam on mondayandy pettitte joined the yankees , but his mind was somewhere else the eastern league playoffs in a precursor to his start next sunday in baltimore against the orioles , pettitte will have a final tuneup tuesday for class aa trenton , which was awaiting its opponent in the finals before altoona defeated harrisburg to advance , pettitte was rooting for harrisburg , which is closer to new york i was looking at maps , pettitte saidwith class aaa scranton wilkesbarre s season ending saturday in the international league semifinals , the utility player kevin russo and the first baseman juan miranda were recalled to join the yankees on sunday
in nine seasons as manager of the , ron gardenhire has helped lead minnesota back into relevance , but he has also had to bear witness to each of the franchise s playoff failures from the top step of a dugout there was an overwhelming sense of familiarity saturday night when gardenhire plopped down on the podium after the he wore his typical stoic expression , and he was addressing the same topic after the swept the twins from the american league division series yet again gardenhire provided a portrait of the befuddlement , frustration and irritation associated with becoming new york s first stop en route to the grander stages of the playoffs we know we 're a good baseball team , gardenhire said you just have to put it together at the right time and we just have n't done it the twins have won six american league central titles under gardenhire but advanced to the championship series only once , in 2002 , when they lost to the angels they have had even more difficulty against the yankees , losing 12 of 14 games to them in the postseason , including each of the last nine games since gardenhire took over , the yankees have ushered the twins toward four divisionseries exits , none of them any easier than the one that preceded it in 2003 , the smallball twins were stifled by the yankees' pitching after winning game 1 at yankee stadium the twins nearly forced a fifth game a year later , but the resilient yankees , who had set a record for comeback victories , put them away with a 65 victory in 11 innings then there were the sweeps by the yankees each of the past two seasons hopefully next year will be better , the twins' jason kubel said we just run into the yankees every year gardenhire is normally mildmannered , but he became irritated by the constant prodding about his team s seeming mental block , bristling at a question last thursday about whether his team still believed it could beat the yankees he said saturday that the twins were close , just not close enough on the recordwise , yes , they 've won nine in a row , gardenhire said that s not dominating us , other than wins and losses the games are really close and could go either way we come up with a big hit or big pitch they can turn the other way we just have n't been able to do that the yankees used a fourrun rally in the sixth inning of game 1 to pull away from the twins but the twins did not show much fight after that , especially on saturday the yankees built a 50 lead by the fourth inning that felt too large to overcome there were few spots of trouble after that , and the twins seemed destined for another early postseason exit long before mariano rivera made it official , retiring each of the three batters he faced in the ninth inning although the twins have done more with less than perhaps any major league franchise , they might be lacking in certain areas where the yankees are typically strong , including in their pitching staff that showed at points in this series gardenhire credited yankees manager joe girardi for preparing his team , but he also acknowledged the gap in talent they do a very good job of getting those guys ready over there , gardenhire said you 're also talking about some of the best players in the game the twins have also on their bench since in the playoffs , the twins received lackluster performances from joe mauer and jim thome , powerful hitters in the middle of their order it was not enough against the yankees we had a good year , thome said we 'll be back , and we 'll get them next year but the twins have said that before
on monday night in ohio , a 62foottall statue of jesus got hit by lightning and burned to the ground \( the adult bookstore across the street was unscathed \) less than 12 hours later , gen david petraeus who is not god , although certain members of congress have been known to worship at his altar semifainted at a senate armed services committee hearing then bravo announced that the white house gatecrashers were getting a tv show al and tipper remained in splitsville and the oil kept on spilling so you sort of knew from the portents that president obama s big oval office speech was not going to be a terrific gamechanger the way things had been going , the president was lucky that a maneating pterodactyl did n't come crashing through the window during his opening remarks still , it was a disappointment i was hoping for a call to arms , a national mission as great as the environmental disaster that inspired it after the terrorist attack , george w bush could have called the country to a grand , important new undertaking in which everyone sacrificed personal or regional advantage for the common good the fact that he only told us to go shopping was the one unforgivable sin of his administration ok , also attacking the wrong country and creating the deficit but i digress all we got from president obama was a vague call for some sort of new energy policy plus a gulf coast restoration plan , an oil spill study commission , a reminder that the secretary of energy won a nobel prize in physics and 17 references to god , prayer , blessings or faith we wanted him to declare war on the oil companies ! every day it becomes clearer that these guys are even more feckless than we imagined at the ritual congressional lashing of ceo s this week , we learned that none of the major oil companies have any idea how to control a spill like this , and that their faux plans for handling one in the gulf were made up of boilerplate so undigested that several had sections on protecting walruses mammals that have not been seen in the area since the ice age it s unfortunate that walruses were included , admitted exxon mobil s chief the way things have been going , you ca n't be too careful if the portents keep piling up , it s easy to envision a headline like lone tourist in pensacola eaten by visiting walrus herd obama held back on tuesday then , on wednesday , he and the bp chairman announced that the company which is , in theory , only liable for 75 million in economic damage payments was forgoing its dividend and setting up a 20 billion fund to compensate the workers and businesses who have been harmed by the spill in the negotiations , obama said , he had stressed that for many of the small business owners , families and fishing crews this is not a matter of dollars and cents , that a lot of these folks do n't have a cushion his brief remarks were more effective than his 18minute effort the night before , particularly when coupled with all that cash he is frustrated because he cares about the small people , said the chairman of bp , who is swedish the word choice made the president sound as if he was working on an environmental disaster in munchkinland we are frustrated , too , and it s possible that obama may never be able to give the speech that will make us feel better he may never really lace into the oil companies or issue the kind of call to arms on energy that the environmentalists are yearning for that s because it wo n't get him anywhere unlike bush , he has no national consensus to build upon he 'd barely finished his muted remarks on tuesday before the house minority leader , john boehner , accused him of exploiting the crisis to impose a jobkilling national energy tax on struggling families and small business michael steele , the republican party chairman , claimed that the president was manipulating this tragic national crisis for selfish political gain and the everpopular representative michele bachmann denounced the bp restitution fund as redistribution of wealth and one more gateway for government control as a political leader , barack obama seems to know what he s doing his unsatisfying call for a new energy policy sounded very much like the rhetoric on health care reform that used to drive democrats nuts open to all ideas , ca n't afford inaction , if we can put a man on the moon but at the end of that health care slog , he wound up with the groundbreaking law that had eluded his predecessors for decades the process of wringing it out of congress was so slow and oblique that even when it was over it was hard to appreciate what he 'd won but win he did ironic the man we elected because we hoped his feelgood campaign speeches might translate into achievement is actually a guy who is going to achieve , even if his presidential speeches leave us feeling blah

berlin it usually takes an author decades to win fawning reviews , march up the bestseller list and become a finalist for a major book prize helene hegemann , just 17 , did it with her first book , all in the space of a few weeks , and despite a savaging from critics over plagiarism the publication last month of her novel about a 16yearold exploring berlin s drug and club scene after the death of her mother , called axolotl roadkill , was heralded far and wide in german newspapers and magazines as a tremendous debut , particularly for such a young author the book shot to no 5 this week on the magazine spiegel s hardcover bestseller list for the obviously gifted ms hegemann , who already had a play \( written and staged \) and a movie \( written , directed and released in theaters \) to her credit , it was an early ascension to the ranks of artistic stardom that is , until a blogger last week uncovered material in the novel taken from the lesswellknown novel strobo , by an author writing under the nom de plume airen in one case , an entire page was lifted with few changes as other unattributed sources came to light , outsize praise quickly turned to a torrent of outrage , reminiscent of the uproar in 2006 over a harvard sophomore , kaavya viswanathan , who was caught plagiarizing numerous passages in her much praised debut novel but ms hegemann s story took a very different turn on thursday , ms hegemann s book was announced as one of the finalists for the 20 , 000 of the in the fiction category and a member of the jury said thursday that the panel had been aware of the plagiarism charges before they made their final selection ms hegemann finds herself in the middle of a collision if not road kill exactly between the staid , literary establishment in a country that venerates writers from goethe to mann to grass , and the berlin youth culture of dj s and artists that sample freely and thereby breathe creativity into old forms or as one character , edmond , puts it in the book , berlin is here to mix everything with everything a powerful statement , but the line originally was , on his blog the plot thickens , however , and shows that perhaps more than simple cribbing is at work when another character asks edmond if he came up with that line himself , he replies , i help myself everywhere i find inspiration obviously , it is n't completely clean but , for me , it does n't change my appraisal of the text , said volker weidermann , the jury member and a book critic for the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine , a strong supporter i believe it s part of the concept of the book although ms hegemann has for not being more open about her sources , she has also as the representative of a different generation , one that freely mixes and matches from the whirring flood of information across new and old media , to create something new there s no such thing as originality anyway , just authenticity , said ms hegemann in a statement released by her publisher after the scandal broke in the beginning , her agent , petra eggers , said that the critics could not distinguish between the novel s 16yearold protagonist and the author it s the other way around now , there s nothing left , ms eggers said they say that none of these are her own words even , the blogger who discovered the passages taken from strobo , said that he could understand a few words or phrases seeping into the work through inspiration , but that he quickly noticed that there were too many for it to be a coincidence to take an entire page from an author , as helene hegemann admitted to doing , with only slight changes and without asking the author , i consider that illegitimate , mr pirmasens said the controversy did not appear to be hurting book sales on thursday afternoon axolotl roadkill was ninth over all among books on the german amazon site , albeit with many nasty postings about the plagiarism controversy it s a reissue of the emperor s new clothes , ' wrote one commenter , who gave the book one star under the heading customers who bought this item also bought was strobo by airen

like the abstract painter who created it , the judith rothschild foundation has never had a very high profile in the art world ms rothschild , who died in 1993 , established the foundation in her will and assigned a friend the mission , as trustee , of using her collection of artworks by masters like matisse and mondrian to promote underappreciated artists a category in which she included herself that friend , harvey s shipley miller , has since donated or sold many of these artworks and used the proceeds to benefit cultural institutions across the country another major beneficiary of the foundation s efforts over the years , though , has been mr miller himself a harvardtrained lawyer and art aficionado , he set a salary for himself of more than 200 , 000 in some years for his service as the foundation s sole trustee and , for years after ms rothschild s death , had the use of her park avenue town house and her upstate country home over several years he directed more than 130 , 000 in foundation money to the law school at the university of california , los angeles , where some was used to create a fellowship named after him , not ms rothschild and as the foundation s trustee , and the gatekeeper of its treasures , he was given coveted seats on important boards and committees at institutions like the whitney museum of american art , the metropolitan museum of art and the museum of modern art , where he has served alongside the likes of ronald s lauder and david rockefeller jr in a city where money alone is no guarantee of social standing , mr miller provides a striking example of how control over important works of art can be a ticket to the upper tier of the philanthropic world , with all its attendant prestige and social cachet to be sure , foundation trustees often enjoy wide latitude on how they operate , and ms rothschild s will gave mr miller broad authority to interpret the foundation s mission and to donate to a range of charitable and educational causes no one has alleged financial misconduct by mr miller , whose civicmindedness has impressed many , and who says he has labored faithfully to serve ms rothschild s interests i loved judith , said mr miller , who declined to take questions this was a labor of love the foundation , however , failed to make promised grant payments to arts groups last year and now the new york state attorney general s office is undertaking a broader review of the foundation and mr miller s stewardship even though the grants have since been paid some artworld experts say mr miller has used ms rothschild s assets in ways that honor his friend , whose death he used to acknowledge every year with small notices in the new york times my impression was , he s done an extremely good job of enhancing and sustaining rothschild s position , said karen wilkin , the curator of an exhibition of ms rothschild s paintings that traveled to russia in 2002 mr miller is smart , articulate and very charming , said gail harrity , president and chief operating officer of the philadelphia museum of art , where mr miller has been a board member since 1985 without question , that appointment , eight years before ms rothschild s death , was buoyed by mr miller s own social contacts , passion for the arts and refined curatorial eye but his stature in new york has been boosted by his control over ms rothschild s assets and her art collection , which was valued at 34 million when she died for example , mr miller was appointed to the board of the museum of modern art in 2003 , the same year he embarked with the museum s guidance on a plan to put together a collection of 2 , 600 drawings , subsequently valued at 60 million the collection , named after ms rothschild and underwritten by her assets , was presented to the museum in 2005 but when the modern created a curator s position tied to the collection , it was named , like the ucla fellowship , after mr miller , though the museum said that it too was endowed by ms rothschild s assets it seems as if harvey may have advanced his own agenda rather than fulfilling judith s , said caroline mortimer , a longtime friend of ms rothschild s many artists create foundations to shepherd their legacies , but most foundations do not give control to a single trustee because they seek additional oversight this kind of governance fails to protect against possible conflicts of interest , said nancy e kelly , an accountant at metis group who serves on the advisory panel of charity navigator , a watchdog agency over charities before becoming a fulltime trustee for the foundation , mr miller , now 62 , had worked as a lawyer , a business executive and a curator as part of running the foundation , he determines its travel budget , which has been about 100 , 000 in recent years , though one year the foundation spent 300 , 000 until ms rothschild s park avenue town house was sold by the foundation in 2007 , for 15 million , the foundation s tax returns typically said mr miller was required as a condition of his employment to live in the building , which was its headquarters there is no reference to who set the condition it is not mentioned in ms rothschild s will the returns do say that , without mr miller s tenancy , the foundation would have had to employ a security firm to guard its valuable artwork the returns said he was similarly required to stay periodically on weekends at the country home in kinderhook , ny , which sold for 41 million in 2008 several years before the sale mr miller used foundation funds to expand the property by several hundred acres in a brief interview several weeks ago mr miller defended his oversight , noting that the grant checks were delayed because he had broken his neck in an accident at this point , he said , he is the foundation s only employee and , he noted , he has never had a secretary one year he did not even take a salary , he said do you know , he said , the whole time i collected drawings i was offered things for free , or offered things at low cost \? it never dawned on me to enrich myself ms rothschild s wealth primarily stemmed from artworks collected over the years by her family , successful furniture merchants in her will she directed that her foundation s assets be disbursed by 2018 , and she appointed mr miller , her friend of about 20 years , to use the money to rescue other talents of her generation from obscurity the trust purposes and the encouragement of art are not served , the will states , by helping museums acquire more work by artists already well known mr miller s history as a supporter of the arts is lengthy and includes his work to help the philadelphia museum of art celebrate its 125th anniversary in 2001 as the chairman of its collection committee collecting , colleagues say , has long been in his blood he assembled a print collection beginning when he was just 11 years old , gary garrels , a curator , wrote in the catalog for the rothschild drawing collection at the modern , which he helped mr miller shape for ms rothschild s foundation , mr miller , described by many as tireless , has helped arrange shows of her collection , safeguarded the artwork and reviewed grant applications , among other things in 1998 he helped coordinate a retrospective of ms rothschild s works at the metropolitan , a rare honor for a lesserknown artist critics at the time suggested it was an act of courtship by an institution with its hand out for works from her collection ms rothschild s art holdings \( she owned 10 mondrians and brancusi s muse \) would have made any trustee popular in the museum world , and mr miller built on that popularity with a taste for the grand gesture seven years ago , for example , when he decided to donate a drawing collection , the foundation s generosity would have been evident in a gift of dozens , even hundreds , of works but mr miller donated thousands to the modern after a twoyear , international buying spree that led to his being named to art review magazine s power 100 in 2004 and 2005 critics gave mixed reviews to the collection , which the museum described in 2005 as the largest gift ever to its drawing department a party to celebrate was held in italy at the hotel cipriani during the  many of the 650 artists represented in the rothschild gift were not particularly well known half had never been in the modern s collection and thus resembled the sort of overlooked talents that ms rothschild had hoped to promote but many of them were well established , like robert rauschenberg and jasper johns ms rothschild s will directed that her foundation primarily promote contemporary american artists who had recently died , and it specified her objection to conceptual art but many of the works mr miller bought were conceptual in nature , by artists like lawrence weiner and robert barry other artists were based in europe most were alive on its 2005 tax return the foundation reported paying 18 million for the drawings between 2003 and that year but it reported that the fair market value of the works had been calculated at 60 million , more than triple the price paid mr miller has said that many of the purchases were discounted the increased value does not appear to have created any tax advantage the foundation was already taxexempt but several appraisers said it struck them as odd certainly from 2003 to 2005 we saw a climb in the marketplace , said jane c h jacob , the president of jacob fine art in chicago and an appraiser but that s an exponential climb the tax return does not list who made the appraisal for the foundation a lawyer who has represented the foundation since its inception , erik j stapper , declined comment on several questions and said he was no longer representing the foundation a collection of this size , which had been assembled so quickly , was not the type of gift the modern typically received mr miller said the speed of the acquisitions was overstated , partly because many works had already been identified as worthy by the modern s curator , mr garrels mr garrels , who is now a senior curator at the san francisco museum of modern art , has acknowledged that the museum s drawings committee debated whether to accept a gift of such size , partly because of the traditional view of as a repository of only singular masterpieces but he said everyone came to see the gift s importance after reviewing a sample of the works at a queens art warehouse everybody will look back on this historically and say , this was one of the best purchases of the time , ' mr garrels said it is transformative to the museum of modern art none of the 2 , 600 drawings were by ms rothschild it would not have been appropriate , mr garrels said , to have acquired her works using her foundation s funds

if the world was not confusing enough , the nba is striving to make it worse because you could have flipped on your television this weekend and asked , is this the first round of the playoffs , or the second \? and the answer would have been yes indeed , the league whose playoffs last longer than your average ice age feels the need to vault the lakers and the jazz into their secondround series before the first round ended , with now this is perhaps because the nba forgot atlanta and milwaukee were actually playing \( really , we have teams there \? who knew \? \) or because they have extended the lakersjazz series to a bestof11 to get kobe bryant more television dates than american idol finalists the lakers are certainly doing their part to drum up drama they beat the jazz , and bryant that everyone has come to expect but they made the victory more adventurous than it should have been , and bryant used to remind the team s bench to show up for the next game some ominous signs for opponents in all of this , but everyone else is just trying to figure out what round they 're in the nba has also apparently created a bestof11game series for lebron james and cleveland and that team they 're playing in the second round already it s boston , which hardly looks capable of hanging around very long , even if james s teammates had to talk him out of fixating on his injured elbow , , which he did not injure while lifting his  the nhl , not usually known for organizational successes , did actually finish one round of the playoffs before starting the next , although apparently no one notified the chicago blackhawks , who wandered into a game 1 against vancouver the red wings , in contrast , were participating in their series against san jose , but while the sharks are exorcising all kinds of demons and even getting their best players to score , , detroit is getting the short end of the officiating , others suspect this series is just  the series between pittsburgh and montreal , with the canadiens trying to send the penguins to the same padded room the capitals ended up bouncing around in montreal won despite taking only six shots in the final two periods while goalie jaroslav halak continued channeling patrick roy it has not helped that the penguins star evgeni malkin s mojo has been missing ,  perhaps he could borrow some from jockey calvin borel , who may be the coolest star going these days , his ride on super saver made all the difference , meanwhile , golf was undergoing , with 20yearold rory mcilroy firing a stunning 62 to win at quail hollow , just the jolt the sport needed , then news traveled from the japan tour that ryo ishikawa had outdone mcilroy in not only youth \( he s 18 \) but also score \( he shot a 58 \) to in a major tour event the rest of the weekend s news was not so uplifting , unless you 're a floyd mayweather fan and are , , rooting for a bout against manny pacquiao in the nfl , a prescription drug misuse lawsuit could become trouble for the new orleans saints , then there was the headscratcher from dallas about the draftee dez bryant s being lectured on for the cowboys by none other than michael irvin in baseball , there was the of the mets stalwart johan santana and boston s entering full chicken little mode after being swept by dreadful baltimore ,  college sports offered the thoroughly modern tale of a at virginia and the news that kentucky s basketball team has taken  perhaps one of its classes was figuring out the nba playoff schedule we 'd all fail that
washington over the last two weeks , has taken questions from unemployed workers in ohio , students in florida and a cancer survivor in new hampshire he took questions from youtube users , senate democrats and even house republicans almost everyone , it seems , but the white house press corps after a year in office , mr obama has managed to do what every modern president may have wanted to do but never did effectively shut out the reporters who work just a few feet from the oval office he has not had a fullscale white house news conference in seven months , the longest such stretch by any president in a decade and he has made a practice of not taking reporters' questions at daytoday events , as other presidents did none of that means that mr obama has shielded himself from public scrutiny but he has fundamentally altered the way a president deals with the news media instead of openended sessions with multiple reporters , he prefers oneonone interviews , particularly with television anchors he gives far more interviews than his two most recent predecessors did , reflecting the conclusion that the format is a more effective means for getting his message through he s getting plenty of tough questions , said joe lockhart , a press secretary for president bill clinton i just think they want to put him in environments where he can demonstrate both his mastery of the subject and make a compelling case for his agenda a white house press conference is n't at the top of that list that s just the reality the president s strategy reflects the changing nature of the media as much as political calculation by the white house whereas the wire services , major newspapers and broadcast networks once dominated the white house briefing room , today they are hardly the only filter for news mr obama has made a concerted effort to tap into alternative avenues , including blogs , internet videos , facebook , twitter , spanishlanguage television and magazines oriented to africanamericans he eats lunch with columnists and talks with espn and people he was the first president to appear on the jay leno and david letterman shows the power and influence among the press used to be concentrated in a small handful of people who sit in the first two rows of the white house briefing room , said dan pfeiffer , the white house communications director and that s no longer the case on any given day , mr pfeiffer added , an item on huffington post or the drudge report can be as influential as something in the new york times or washington post indeed , the white house press corps itself is evolving the press pool that takes turns covering the president up close now includes webonly publications like talking points memo , the huffington post and the daily caller and given the widespread disdain for the mainstream media , there seems to be no price to be paid for bypassing beat reporters , who risk looking like whiners if they complain i would never have been bold enough to say totally ignore the mainstream media when it comes to pool sprays , said ari fleischer , a white house press secretary for president george w bush and what s even more breathtaking is , he s been able to carve out the mainstream media and he s getting away with it pool spray is the term for an event where a representative pool of journalists is brought in to record the president meeting with a foreign leader or discussing a policy initiative past presidents have typically taken two or three questions at such moments mr obama typically does not during his first year in office , mr obama took questions at pool sprays 46 times , compared with the 147 times mr bush did and 252 times mr clinton did in the comparable periods , according to statistics compiled by martha joynt kumar , a professor of political science at towson university and while mr obama had five fullscale white house news conferences early in his tenure , he has not had any since july , when he declared that the police had acted stupidly in arresting a black harvard professor , touching off a racial furor that distracted from his health care message for days mr pfeiffer said the episode had nothing to do with the lack of white house news conferences since then , and mr obama has held limited sessions with reporters on the road or jointly with foreign leaders still , the seven months without a formal white house news conference is longer than jimmy carter or either george bush went without one mr clinton and ronald reagan , on the other hand , each went long stretches without one , most notably during the monica lewinsky and irancontra scandals mr obama has been much more expansive with interviews than either of them in his first year , he gave 161 interviews , compared with 50 by mr bush and 53 by mr clinton in their first year in office in an interview , you talk about what you want to talk about , ms kumar said in a press conference , you talk about what the reporters want to talk about that s the difference and why you want to do one and not the other mr pfeiffer said the white house media strategy was based on discipline we have done press conferences and we will do them again , he said but , he added , you want to do these things when you have something to communicate , something to say , not just be a pi ata for the press corps
given their many question marks these days , the might wish that could suit up again in orange and blue alas , hernandez now spends his days in the television booth , writing books and shuttling between his homes in florida and sag harbor , ny but that does not mean his 11 gold glove awards are going to waste this week , he began tutoring daniel murphy , the team s presumptive starting first basemen this season murphy took over at first base last year after carlos delgado had seasonending hip surgery murphy was a work in progress in 2009 , unafraid to field his position , but overly aggressive at times in a conference call with reporters tuesday , hernandez said he had been teaching murphy how to use his feet better around the bag , how to pivot more effectively and when to reach for ground balls in the hole the bag becomes a part of you , it s like an appendage , you move , it s there , said hernandez , who tutored john olerud and todd zeile in years past you get into a comfort zone hernandez said he had the luxury of playing first base as a youngster , while murphy had to learn on the job at the major league level despite that , he said he liked that murphy was unafraid to charge for ground balls and try to throw out lead runners i thought he did remarkably well last year , hernandez said of murphy i would rather he made the mistakes aggressively still , no matter how much time murphy spends with hernandez , looming in the minor leagues is ike davis , perhaps the mets' best position prospect davis has more power than murphy and fields lefthanded , often an asset at first base he hit 309 for class aa binghamton last season , did well in arizona last fall and will probably start the season at class aaa buffalo that means that davis could challenge murphy at first base before the 2010 season is over and hernandez might have a new pupil next winter the mets have seemingly made more changes to citi field this offseason than to their roster all were cosmetic think more blue and orange in and around the ballpark but none were about to affect the course of a game at least until tuesday , when it was revealed that the mets will chop in half the 16foot wall that shields a sliver of straightaway center field otherwise known as the area that houses the home run apple when the mets begin the 2010 season april 5 against florida , that fence , 408 feet from home plate , will stand 8 feet high the modification was first reported by the daily news none of the dimensions will change , and , just as significant , neither will the heights of any other outfield wall it s still 15 feet 8 inches in left field , 186 below the rightfield overhang and 11 feet on either side of this new notch so , why did the mets decide to change such a modest section \? according to a club spokesman , it had nothing to do with promoting a more homerunfriendly environment or increasing the visibility of the apple not that it popped up much last season , anyway the mets , rather , wanted to make the heights more uniform by reducing the obtrusiveness of that 16foot rise even though some metrics , like park factor index , show that citi field actually favors home runs , it has developed a reputation around baseball as a pretty stingy place fueling that perception is its combination of high walls and cavernous dimensions , especially in the gaps , which sapped more than a few potential homers in 2009 from david wright among the 16 national league ballparks , citi field ranked 11th in home runs yielded per game , 160 the mets , destroyed by injuries and flummoxed by a bewildering power outage from wright , hit 95 home runs last season 49 at citi field that was the fewest in baseball any uptick in home runs for 2010 was going to come from a consistently healthy lineup \( already , carlos beltran is facing an uncertain return \) or an improved offense aside from jason bay , whose 30to35homer potential should translate well to citi field , the mets will enter this season with familiar faces and not ones known for power at first base , second base and catcher , all positions that could have been improved over the offseason those moves would have been more than cosmetic outfielder willy taveras has been released by the oakland athletics , eight days after he was acquired from the cincinnati reds with infielder adam rosales for infielder aaron miles and a player to be named taveras was designated for assignment immediately after the feb 1 trade the athletics owe his 4 million salary , but that would be reduced by the 400 , 000 minimum if another team signs him taveras hit 240 with a home run and 15 runs batted in with 25 stolen bases for cincinnati last season the lefthander mark hendrickson agreed to a oneyear contract with the orioles that guarantees him 14 million after pitching well out of baltimore s bullpen last season hendrickson , 35 , went 65 with a 437 earned run average in 53 games last year he was most effective in relief , going 40 with a 344 era catcher yorvit torrealba and the san diego padres completed a oneyear contract that guarantees him 125 million torrealba , 31 , figures to share playing time with nick hundley , who started 71 games last year and hit 238 with 8 home runs and 30 rbi torrealba spent the last four seasons with the colorado rockies and batted 291 with 2 homers and 31 rbi last year
a friend recently mentioned to me that he was considering using mintcom but was worried whether he should trust the site with his bank account information to take advantage of mintcom s money tracking services , you need to enter your bank account user names and passwords so mintcom can keep track of how much you 're spending and saving this raises the question of how safe sharing that data is and how easy it may be for someone to get that information from mintcom and then use it to log into your accounts and swipe out your money there s also the question of what would happen to that data if the site were ever to close , which is the fate of at least one rival site a mintcom competitor , wesabe , announced late last week that it was shutting down its similar budget tracking service as of july 31 we were able to keep the business going for seven months after exhausting our venture backing , but did not get to profitability and made the decision to stop pursuing the business , marc hedlund , wesabe chief executive officer , wrote to bucks in an email message mintcom has recognized that not all consumers are comfortable entering all of their bank information into its site in fact , partly in an effort to gain more users , mintcom recently introduced a service aimed at helping consumers reach their longterm goals that does n't require the entering of any financial account information so should you trust mintcom \? for answers , we turned to mintcom s founder , consulted with identity theft and data privacy experts and found out what is going to happen to the sensitive financial data that customers have given wesabe aaron patzer , from mintcom , said the site protects user names and passwords with the same level of security as a financial institution specifically , none of that information is accessible on the site and no personal identifying information other than your email is linked to your account , meaning someone who had your mintcom login could n't access your bank account information instead , the account information is encrypted and stored on mintcom s own servers , which are located in an unmarked building to get into the building , mr patzer said , one needs to scan his or her hand , pass by a guard and then go through a long hallway where you 'll be trapped if there are suspicions about you inside , the servers are locked in a cage separated from other systems and constantly monitored the only way to decrypt the user names and passwords from those servers , and to change the way the data is encrypted , is to use an encryption key that is broken up on five different smart cards carried by senior mintcom executives , mr patzer said on a quarterly basis , mintcom also hires white knights , ie good hackers , to try and break into the system and so far , according to mr patzer , no one has been able to break into the core of our system where any sensitive financial information would be stored how does that system stack up \? jay foley , cofounder of the identity theft resource center , said he would trust the site their security level is pretty decent , all things considered , he said , noting it was in line with the standard at financial institutions but the information could still be encrypted at a higher level on par with that of the military above all , however , he said what makes him trust the site is that it is owned by intuit and has intuit s reputation behind it for them to make a booboo would be a serious , serious bad thing , mr foley said people would come at them he said he would n't necessarily trust another money tracking site that did n't have a big player like intuit behind it the bigger risk than someone breaking into mintcom s servers and getting your information , he said , is someone at your bank leaving the information around in an easily obtainable area or someone breaking into your own computer and catching your bank user name and password as you enter into it into mintcom mr foley said to avoid such a situation , make sure the security software on your computer is up to date , do n't use the same passwords for everything and do n't have your computer remember your financial institution passwords the bigger threat would be the security that you have on your personal home computer , he said still , not all experts feel the same way there is no doubt that it probably is very secure but anytime that you provide your information to an additional entity , you are really compounding the opportunities for your personal information to be breached , said paul stephens , director of policy and advocacy at the privacy rights clearinghouse since no site is ever 100 percent secure , mr stephens said deciding whether to give out your information was really personal , related to how comfortable you would feel doing that he personally does n't share his bank and brokerage account information with anyone but the institutions it s an individual choice that you need to make he said , adding that there is a trade off between the benefits you get with aggregating your data and creating the additional opportunity for your data to be breached
washington as adds economic pressure and military containment to force s leadership to negotiate on its nuclear program , he is taking three big bets on his ability to defuse an increasingly tense confrontation each will be a test of phase two of his engagement effort after a year in which little in his dealings with iran has gone the way that the white house expected mr obama s first bet is that he can accomplish what president george w bush tried , and failed , to do to win global agreement on a set of sanctions that are strong enough to convince iran s divided leadership that its nuclear ambitions are not worth the price but for mr obama , that effort is complicated by the fear that sanctions could crush a resilient antigovernment movement that appears on the verge of taking to the streets again his second gamble is that he can win over the reluctant chinese , by convincing them that sanctions are a better alternative than the instability and oil cutoffs that would very likely arise if attacked iran s nuclear facilities mr obama s own aides concede that they have diminishing hopes of winning that argument with  and finally , mr obama is relying on his ability to dissuade israel from carrying out an attack , as it did in 2007 when it destroyed a nuclear reactor under construction in syria for now , the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu , while worried that mr obama may go soft on iran , seems to believe that the iranian government is so fragile that truly harsh sanctions might crack it but iran s announcement in recent days that it was raising its enrichment of uranium to a level much closer to weaponsgrade may well change that calculation the next step is sanctions , mr obama said bluntly during a brief news conference at the white house on tuesday , just before the treasury department named several companies belonging to the corps , the protector of the government and overseer of part of the nuclear effort they have made their choice so far , although the door is still open domestic politics , as well as global strategy , lie behind mr obama s new stress on the dualtrack approach backing up a year of futile diplomatic outreach with the threat of yet another round of sanctions other elements of the strategy that the white house does not discuss publicly are the placement of antimissile defenses in four countries around the persian gulf , and steppedup covert action against the country s nuclear program but his aides are still countering arguments , dating from the 2008 campaign , that his determination to engage iran was na ve from the start instead , they argued that it would be impossible to exert real pressure on iran now unless mr obama made a bona fide effort to conduct a sustained dialogue with a country that washington has only talked to in fits and starts over the past 31 years he had to build up political capital , said r nicholas burns , who was the state department s lead iran negotiator during mr bush s second term , and who argued unsuccessfully for a strategy similar to the one mr obama has pursued the reality is that iran is more isolated today because of this strategy , and because of their own behavior , than they were a year ago but isolating a country diplomatically does not necessarily translate into changing its behavior north korea , cuba and myanmar have been economically isolated for decades , with little effect the history of sanctions suggests it is nearly impossible to craft them to compel a government to change on an issue it sees as vital to national security , said richard n haass , the president of the council on foreign relations they can affect a government s calculations , but it s no solution that was certainly the bush administration s experience starting in 2006 , the united states led the drive at the united nations security council to pass ever escalating economic sanctions the list of sanctions is now six pages long but none have accomplished the central goal forcing compliance with the security council s demand that iran halt uranium enrichment mr obama s team acknowledges the potential political liability of passing a fourth round that proves equally ineffective some are scaling back expectations for what they once called crippling sanctions this is about driving them back to negotiations , said one senior official , because the real goal here is to avoid war still , mr obama is moving with characteristic caution during the campaign he raised the specter of cutting off refined petroleum supplies to iran , which cannot refine enough oil to keep cars rolling and factories running but mr obama has backed away from that step , at least for now , for fear of the popular backlash it could set off what you 've been hearing on the streets is death to the dictator , ' not death to america , ' one of mr obama s top strategists said in an interview in december we 'd be foolish to do anything to change that mr obama s second challenge is to get the chinese to agree to any real sanctions at all to overcome china s traditional allergy to sanctions , mr obama has sent aides to beijing to convince chinese officials that there is something worse than sanctioning iran letting war break out between israel and iran they have described the prospect of oil cutoffs in the persian gulf , and instability that would threaten china s daily shipments if israel believed iran was nearing capability and attacked they have tried to convince the chinese that their business links to saudi arabia which is deeply worried about iran s rising military power are more valuable than links to tehran but so far the chinese are unmoved given the tensions between beijing and washington on other issues currency rates , cyberattacks , arms sales to taiwan , a forthcoming meeting between mr obama and the dalai lama of tibet beijing appears in no mood to cooperate top officials from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , adm mike mullen , to the national security adviser , gen james l jones have visited israel to argue that they should give sanctions time the israelis , officials report , now seemed convinced that the iranian government is fragile , and that the sanctions might work they have indicated , with no promises , that they will back off for a while mr haass , who has called in recent weeks for more active american support of the protesters in iran , returned from israel in recent days convinced that mr obama had some time i think we can get through 2010 without a military strike , he said but 2011 could be more dicey
they belong to worlds that , in the normal course of events , would never intersect but shakespeare , as the creator of their universe , saw fit to let their paths cross just once and when portia finally meets shylock , in daniel sullivan s absolutely splendid production of the merchant of venice at the broadhurst theater , the collision lights up the sky giving what promise to be the performances of this season , lily rabe , as portia the heiress , and al pacino , as shylock the usurer , invest the muchparsed trial scene of this fascinating , irksome work with a passion and an anger that purge it of preconceptions you may find yourself trembling , as one often does when something scary and baffling starts to make sense at the same time you 're likely to have trouble figuring out exactly where your sympathies lie for at this moment everybody hurts in traditional presentations of act iv , scene 1 of merchant portia , disguised as a male lawyer to rescue a man under threat of death , emerges as an avenging angel shylock , viciously poised to kill an enemy in an act of legal redress , is usually the vanquished villain or , in more fashionable contemporary readings , the jewish victim of a christian social order reasserting itself but what you read in ms rabe s delicately expressive features is hardly a look of triumph her face is that of someone registering a precious and irrevocable loss in an odd way the fatalistic , shrunken sorrow of mr pacino s crouched shylock , who has not only been thwarted of his revenge but also stripped of his identity , seems to mirror portia s own state of mind the throbbing ambivalence at the heart of mr sullivan s spirited merchant was evident when it was first staged in central park last summer but this revelatory public theater production , which opened on broadway on saturday night , has been refined to an even higher level of clarity and subtlety , virtues that do not always walk hand in hand there have been a few cast changes since the summer most for the better and none for the worse what particularly astonishes is how completely the entire cast seems to inhale the same air shakespeare in new york is often a patchwork affair , stitchedtogether showcases for stars grinding their classical chops and directors with radically hip high concepts but mr sullivan , his cast and his design team have collectively shaped a merchant that feels utterly fluid and original this production gives the lie to theater snobs who insist that only the british can do shakespeare properly \( you need only compare mr sullivan s merchant with last season s rudderless imported london production of hamlet starring jude law \) using scenic simplicity to complex effect , this merchant exudes elegance , but always in the service of a vision of a society that is , at its core , most inelegant as designed by mark wendland \( sets \) , jess goldstein \( costumes \) and kenneth posner \( lighting \) , venice has the look of an edwardian london held captive by its love of lucre a tickertape machine looms center stage , set off by cagelike , circular walls that separate , define and confine the inhabitants of a rigidly stratified city before a word is spoken we 're aware of how physically divided the insiders \( the prosperous investors of the city \) are from the outsiders \( the jewish moneylenders , who come to do business \) at the same time , as with the great novels of charles dickens , we feel the pervasive fog of unease that connects and taints everyone , even portia , who lives like a princess in a tower on her late father s estate brooding music , composed by dan moses schreier , wraps this world in a restless melancholy the anxiety expressed in the opening scene by antonio \( a quietly masochistic byron jennings \) the play s title character , whose fortunes are all at sea , in mercantile ships infuses even the jolliest , funniest moments of this merchant the production insists , subliminally but undeniably , that a happiness based on money borrowed , lent and spent is destined to be provisional \( not that contemporary americans would know anything about that \) more than in any merchant i have seen , we are kept conscious of how money defines and pollutes every relationship that includes the friendship between the handsome young bassanio \( david harbour \) and his doting mentor antonio , whose pledge to back up a loan to his friend by shylock \( who demands his fabled a pound of flesh should the debt not be honored \) is what pushes the play toward tragedy the ostensibly sunnier romances in the play are similarly cast in shadow when portia thinks she has found the love she has longed for in bassanio the one suitor who passes the test dictated by her father s will her happiness is edged in apprehension and we see different mirrors of love in perilous balance in the courtships of nerissa \( marsha stephanie blake \) , portia s lady in waiting , by bassanio s best friend , gratiano \( jesse l martin \) , and , more pointedly , of jessica \( heather lind \) , shylock s daughter , by the dandyish lorenzo \( seth numrich \)
there are only two dancers in balanchine s duo concertant , and each has some time to think onstage while listening to the pianist and violinist play the opening of its stravinsky score what a torrent must have flooded yvonne borree s mind on sunday afternoon at the david h koch theater surely it included her 1992 performance of the duet , when she was cast alongside mikhail baryshnikov \( who appeared as a guest artist \) that was her first time dancing the role and sunday was the last , as ms borree , a principal dancer , retired after 22 years with city ballet , the same company her mother , susan borree , danced in before her yvonne borree s duo concertant debut , which came while she was still in the corps , helped start her career she danced it well then writing in the new york times , anna kisselgoff deemed her a confident young ballerina and praised her swanlike beauty on sunday ms borree radiated a tremulous joy and a welcome incisiveness , her now seasoned confidence aided by jared angle , her sure and elegant partner their warm , shared glances were a pleasure to see so were the deft , rhythmic exchanges of their steps , as they played off each other and the music \( sunday s violinist was kurt nikkanen , the pianist cameron grant \) ms borree was forever flitting out of reach , as if to say not quite yet , i'm not ready to stop , only to let herself be caught and then to sink down luxuriously over mr angle s arm duo concertant , from 1972 , is a quiet ballet , a fitting finale for a performer who has had a quiet career it can seem a slight , fussy conceit of a work , built as it is around the two onstage musicians but here ms borree gave such care to each gesture , her varied \( surely conflicting \) moods shading each moment in the end , as the role dictates , she stood alone , perhaps a muse , perhaps a wraith , a small spotlight slowly tightening to enclose her outstretched hand in darkness this melancholy solitude did n't last long , as ms borree , taking her bows , soon became a onewoman receiving line for city ballet principals past and present one after another they came , flowers and confetti raining down damian woetzel drew an affectionate laugh from the crowd upon presenting her with a big red heart , and the most poignant moments came when albert evans and darci kistler wrapped ms borree in bear hugs their final bows will follow soon enough , as city ballet sees five retirements this spring \( philip neal and the conductor maurice kaplow are also leaving \) these exits are the countermotif to a city ballet season that is all about the new , with seven premieres one of those new dances , christopher wheeldon s estancia , was also performed on sunday retirements can make us take stock of who remains in the company , so it was good to see such a young and vibrant cast leading estancia , including tyler angle and andrew veyette , but especially the marvelous tiler peck , the ballet s fierce , earthy heroine all three dancers paid their respects to ms borree , who will be missed by many , as evidenced by the prolonged standing ovation she basked in , her eyes often bright with tears but ms borree has not left an indelible mark on the company , and in her other performance of the afternoon , the third andante section of balanchine s brahmsschoenberg quartet \( 1966 \) , she reminded you of why partnered by a gallantly attentive benjamin millepied , ms borree was pleasant and pretty , moving carefully through her steps as if hesitant to stir up trouble she skated lightly through her point work , the lush karinska tutu rising and settling about her like gossamer as she delicately unfurled her limbs moment by moment she acquitted herself with perfect competence but never offered anything more there was none of the abandon jenifer ringer brought to the intermezzo section , or the wit maria kowroski doled out in the rondo alla zingarese there was nothing here to hint at the singular powers of a ballerina it was lovely to see the unbridled smile ms borree shared with mr millepied , but difficult , as it often has been for this viewer , to connect with this fragile , dolllike dancer how strange , upon seeing her perform for perhaps the final time , to feel as if you 'd hardly yet seen her at all

zurich switzerland stunned many europeans , including not a few swiss , when near the end of last year the country , by referendum , banned the building of minarets much predictable tuttutting ensued about swiss xenophobia , even though surveys showed similar plebiscites would get pretty much the same results elsewhere a poster was widely cited as having galvanized votes for the swiss measure but was also blamed for exacerbating hostility toward immigrants and instigating a media and legal circus we make posters , the other side goes to the judge , is how alexander segert put it when we met here the other day i love it when they do that he designed the poster in question as manager of goal , the public relations firm for the swiss people s party , mr segert has overseen various campaign posters this one , for the referendum , used minarets rising from the swiss flag like missiles \( mushrooms , mr segert demurred , implausibly \) beside the missiles a woman glowers from inside a stop is written below in big , black letters the obvious message minarets lead to never mind that there are only four minarets in switzerland to begin with , and that muslims , some 340 , 000 of them , or 4 percent of the population , mostly from the balkans and turkey , have never been notably zealous in this heavily immigrant country the ultranationalist swiss people s party is now the leading political party , aided at the polls by incidents like the new year s day attack by a somali muslim immigrant in denmark on kurt westergaard , the artist whose caricature of the prophet mohammad with a bomb in his turban was among the cartoons published in 2005 in a danish newspaper that provoked violent protests around the world all across europe populist parties are growing , capitalizing , to an extent unknown across the atlantic , on a very oldfashioned brand of propaganda art the dominance in america today of the 24hour cable news networks and the internet , the sheer size of the country , the basic conventions of public discourse , not to mention that the only two major parties have , or at least feign having , a desire to court the political center , all tend to mitigate against the sort of propaganda that one can now find in europe it manages , if often just barely , to skirt racism laws in italy , where attacks on immigrant workers in the calabrian town of rosarno this month incited the country s worst riots in years , the lega nord , part of prime minister silvio berlusconi s ruling coalition , has circulated various antiimmigrant posters one , mimicked by s farright national front party in france , showed an american indian to make the point that immigrants will soon turn europeans into embattled minorities stuck on reservations the national front also distributed a poster of charles de gaulle alongside a remark he once made \( in the context of the algerian occupation \) to suggest that true gaullists today would vote for le pen it is good that there are yellow frenchmen and black frenchmen and brown frenchmen , de gaulle is quoted as saying they prove that france is open to all races , adding , on the condition that they remain a small minority otherwise , france will no longer be france in austria the farright freedom party has come up with a poster bearing the slangy slogan daham statt islam , wir f r euch \( roughly , home instead of islam , or islam go home , we are for you \) and britain s neonazi national party , which , to the great embarrassment of the country s political leaders , lately won two seats on the european parliament , swiped the minaret poster by switching the swiss flag for a union jack mr segert and the swiss people s party were n't too pleased , populists being one thing , neonazis , another it may be hard for americans to grasp the role these images can play here in subways and on the streets in america , posters and billboards are eyecatching if sexy or stylish , like calvin klein s advertisements , or if modish and outrageous , like benetton s , but they 're basically background noise by contrast , they 're treated more seriously here , as news , at least when they 're political molotov cocktails cheap to produce compared with television commercials and easy to spread in small countries like switzerland , where referendums are catnip to populists , they have the capacity to rise above the general noise mr segert is the de facto reigning minister of such propaganda he has used red rats to caricature swiss leftists he came up with an image of black and brown hands riffling through a stack of swiss passports and \( until the minaret poster , this one caused the biggest kerfuffle \) he cooked up the idea of three fluffy white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag for more security was the accompanying slogan cries of racism , occasional legal proceedings none of which ended up in fines against him , mr segert hastens to point out and even bans on their display in leftleaning cities like basel and geneva , have only increased the reproduction of the images all of which , as mr segert said , suits him and his bosses just fine if what we do stirs up controversy , then we 've already won the election , he told me , a thought echoed when i met with marc b hlmann , a political scientist here all these rightwing populist parties have learned to get tv and newspapers to show these posters over and over with the excuse of asking , should we allow such images \? ' mr b hlmann said the aim in making the posters is to be as racist as possible , so then when critics complain , the populists can say elites do n't want ordinary people to know the truth and the media fall for it every time mr segert would n't disagree crude , cleverly exploiting the ancient power of a still picture over moving ones to fix an image in a viewer s mind , the posters share a calculated homeliness and violence that is in its own way artful i showed a variety of them to jacques s gu la , chief creative officer for france s secondlargest advertising agency , who ran fran ois mitterrand s presidential campaign fifty percent stalin , 50 percent norman rockwell , was his assessment the images are aggressive , not funny , without charm , straight to the point , clear and he was speaking aesthetically here in no way radical they 're the opposite of most advertising today they aim just at their target audience and that s all they need to do marcus stricker , creative director of netprinz , which handles advertising for switzerland s free democratic party , a competitor of mr segert s , credits the minaret poster with employing a bygone graphic style that conjures up good old switzerland , when everything was safe , clean and growing like mr b hlmann he blames the news media for providing , as he put it , effectively millions of dollars in free advertising it went without saying that my own interest in the poster brouhaha multiplied the problem he was nevertheless reluctant to give mr segert too much credit for swinging the vote local issues did more to sway public opinion , he said we met in a crowded bar above the zurich train station , and before parting he unfurled a poster by a human rights organization called the society for swiss minorities , distributed by the swiss council of religions , showing a mosque , a synagogue , two churches and a buddhist temple beneath a broad , pale blue sky , with the slogan der himmel ber der schweiz ist gross genug \( the sky over switzerland is big enough \) in discreet lettering across the top it was made to compete with mr segert s work two can play that game , mr stricker wanted me to know except that the image , tasteful and vague , stressing elegance over incitement , actually suggested the opposite mr segert knows why a 46yearold german \( yes , an immigrant himself in switzerland \) , he is the father of two adopted children from north africa , although he declined to talk about his personal life he was happy , on the other hand , to discuss work , which he volunteered he would gladly do for the green party or social democrats , if they hired him for me it s an intellectual exercise , he said , as if cynicism were a point of professional pride in the next room young , cleancut associates brooded over drawing boards and computer screens clients must do their homework , mr segert said , by way of explaining how a design evolves it sounds easy , but most political parties do n't know their own message that s the problem for centrist and many leftleaning parties by contrast , everyone knows what the swiss people s party stands for , he said it s against the european union , for neutrality , lower taxes , no illegal aliens you can hate it or love it , but the message is clear that message must then be refined maybe 80 to 90 percent of people are not interested in elections so our job is to tell them be interested in what does n't interest you , make a decision about something you do n't care about , then act on it , vote that s a lot for a poster to accomplish we 're successful because we know how to reduce information to the lowest level , so people respond without thinking this was essential , he stressed the message must go straight to the stomach , not to the brain , and connect with specific emotions involving fear , health , money , safety we can focus just on our target audience so we can speak in a special language and speak to a feeling these people already have we ca n't move anyone who does n't already have this feeling in our case the target audience is low income , with little schooling they have the same right to vote as people who support the green party and read 3 newspapers and 10 magazines i asked whether special language applied to red rats , which can conjure up nazi propaganda mr segert brushed off the comparison as a publicrelations man he has no taboos , he said we do n't begin by thinking what we ca n't do when i chose to show rats , i did n't ask whether it s politically correct i could n't do my job if i did that i only wanted to know whether it serves our purpose , and if we have a problem with the law my party already deals with taboos like islam and immigration , so our job is just to think about how to make the strongest image , then let the lawyers tell us whether it s racist he recounted the making of the minarets design there were some early alltext trials , he recalled , which looked too wordy one version showed missiles without the woman , another , the woman in a burqa , without eyes that was too impersonal , mr segert said he and his colleagues , adding eyes , then debated what should be behind them should they look sexy , not sexy \? he said to me the look we decided on is less aggressive than helpless it can also be read the other way around mr segert added that , instead of the swiss flag , the matterhorn was tried , but the mix of minarets with the woman in a niqab and the mountain created confusion without the mountain , he said , the image , could have been istanbul or dubai there was nothing wrong , he continued , nothing to disturb the view but a flag solved that minarets and the swiss flag sent the message we wanted because they do n't fit together a person looks and thinks , this must be changed' a certain person , anyway the final poster , though heavyhanded , performs a complex task the image of minarets beside the woman in the niqab stirs up a negative feeling among target voters no , i do n't want minarets because i will find myself living under sharia law , the viewer decides but the referendum to ban minarets required a yes vote it s always easier to do a campaign for a no vote , mr segert noted , because people instinctively want to maintain the status quo it s what they already know with a yes vote you need some positive symbol but we had only this negative one , of minarets and sharia so we needed some bridge , some transition from no to yes the designers experimented with the word verbieten , meaning to forbid , but this turned out to look too complicated the obvious solution , arrived at after a few false starts , was simply , stop the word performs a double role , emphasizing the initial message \( stop minarets \) then causing a viewer , when arriving at the word , mentally to stop , be free to switch gears and register yes , written just below stop that is , vote yes so there are three steps to the image , mr segert concluded minarets lead to sharia no to minarets yes to the referendum it looks simple , he said , staring at the finished image but that s the art of it he smiled
philadelphia just because the took three times more shots in the first period than the did not mean montreal had a better chance to win tuesday michael leighton was in goal for the flyers , and he calmly withstood barrage after barrage aided by a defensive corps that helped prevent second chances , leighton stopped all 16 shots in the first period and 30 over all to boost the flyers to a and a twogamestonone lead in the eastern conference finals tonight , they were on us right off the bat , leighton said but i felt good the flyers received goals from danny briere , simon gagne and ville leino to win their sixth straight game leighton stretched his scoreless streak to 165 minutes 50 seconds , including the 60 shutout of montreal in game 1 on sunday and part of game 7 against boston in the conference semifinals leighton became the first flyers goaltender to post backtoback playoff shutouts in 30 years bernie parent , honored at wachovia center with an orange banner with his retired no 1 jersey , shut out toronto in consecutive starts in 1975 the year the flyers last won the cup leighton , out eight weeks with an ankle injury , took over as the starter on may 10 after brian boucher sustained a knee injury in game 5 against the bruins but leighton , a journeyman who turns 29 on wednesday , was unbeatable once again to me , tonight , he looked as good as i 've seen him , philadelphia coach peter laviolette said leighton said he would have been just as happy if the flyers had won , 31 , but he did not play that way late in the game , he landed on the seat of his pants , legs spread , to make a glove save on a sizzling shot from the point by montreal s p k subban briere and gagne scored powerplay goals , but philadelphia s ability to kill penalties was just as important montreal was 0 for 4 on the power play for the second straight game the canadiens were 0 for 3 in the first period , which ended with only five flyers shots i think we need to find a way to get a better net presence , montreal coach jacques martin said the canadiens went on the power play 2 02 into the game because defenseman lukas krajicek received a slashing penalty but the power play ended after 53 seconds when montreal s scott gomez was called for a hooking penalty the flyers needed 14 seconds of the ensuing power play to score a goal on a pictureperfect rush claude giroux chugged deep into the canadiens' zone before slipping a crossice pass to briere , who only had defenseman hal gill in front of him briere moved to the outside as he faked a shot , using the 6foot7 gill as a screen then briere fired a rising shot that sailed over montreal goaltender jaroslav halak s glove and into the goal at 4 16 it was briere s ninth playoff goal , and his fifth in his last six games the puck is just finding us right now , giroux said of the team s powerplay success as they had in the first period of game 1 , the flyers withstood a ferocious montreal attack as they protected a onegoal lead midway through the first period , the canadiens had a 133 edge in shots on goal the flyers killed a holding penalty on leino and another for having too many men on the ice during the penalty on leino , montreal took six shots on goal and had the flyers frenetically scrambling to swipe the puck from the area around the goal leighton held on sometimes , you need your goalie to steal one for you , briere said the flyers stretched their lead to 20 with a powerplay goal at 15 49 of the period montreal forward brian gionta was called for holding as the flyers controlled the puck in the canadiens' zone kimmo timonen , the philadelphia defenseman , then missed a close shot but the flyers were persistent gagne won a battle for the puck behind the goal , nudging the puck to mike richards , the philadelphia captain , to his right richards slipped the puck to leino in front , and he and gagne whacked at it until it went in we 're at our best when we 're at our simplest , philadelphia defenseman chris pronger said dustin byfuglien and jonathan toews scored on deflections 90 seconds apart in the second period and the chicago blackhawks rolled to their recordtying seventh straight road win in the playoffs , 42 over the san jose sharks in game 2 of the western conference finals andrew ladd and troy brouwer also scored , and antti niemi made 25 saves for the blackhawks , who have a 20 series lead this is the closest chicago has been to making the stanley cup finals since getting there in 1992 the series moves to chicago for game 3 on friday night and game 4 on sunday that may not be the best thing for the blackhawks , who are only 33 at home this postseason chicago has had its most success on the road , clinching the first two series in nashville and vancouver before taking the first two against the topseeded sharks in a heavyweight conference finals
puerto serrano , spain during spain s construction boom , antonio rivera romero happily traded long hours and backbreaking labor in the fields for the betterregulated building trades , earning four times as much as a bricklayer he took out a mortgage and enlarged his house on a quiet side street in this small city in southern spain now , with the construction jobs gone , mr rivera is behind on his bank payments and eager to return to the farmwork he left behind but spaniards have been largely shut out of those jobs those bent over rows of strawberries under plastic greenhouse sheeting or climbing ladders in the midday sun are now almost all foreigners romanians , poles , moroccans , many of them in spain legally the farmers here do n't want us , mr rivera said with a defeated shrug local officials and union leaders say mr rivera has it right farmers have been reluctant to take spanish workers back unsure whether they will work as hard as the foreigners who have been picking their crops , sometimes for a decade now so far , only 5 percent of the pickers this year are spaniards , said diego ca amero , the head of one of spain s largest labor organizations , the field workers union , or soc he said the union was working to keep tempers from flaring and to persuade farmers to employ local people again , but with little success there is a sense of bewilderment among the spanish workers , he said they say why do they let people come 5 , 000 miles , when we need the jobs \? the is now 27 percent , the highest in spain except for the canary islands spaniards have always been resilient , helping out one another in hard economic times but these days entire families like that of mr rivera and his wife , who have five workingage children most at home are jobless unemployment benefits go only so far , and for those who have house or car payments , not nearly far enough mr rivera , 50 , gets 420 euros a month , about 530 his mortgage takes up half of that , he said his wife , encarnaci n rom n casillas , 49 , started going to the local soup kitchen at first , i could not do it , she said my sisterinlaw went for me but then we went together , and now i do what i have to do in addition to two hot meals , she is given a loaf of bread , a liter of milk and four containers of yogurt soon , the riveras will borrow a car from a relative and go to france , where they expect to camp while picking beets , asparagus and artichokes , then grapes in the fall they got work there last year , though the cost of the campsite ate up half their wages this time , a french farmer has agreed to let them stay on his property mr rivera s predicament is hardly unique mayors across andalusia say local residents come to their offices all the time looking for work some do not want farmwork , saying it is too hard but many , says emilio vergara , mayor of paterna del campo , a small farming village outside huelva , would gladly take it together with three other nearby mayors , mr vergara began an effort to persuade farmers to hire local people but , he says , of the 450 people who signed up from his village , none have been offered a job i am concerned about a potential outburst of xenophobia , and hope that it can be avoided at all costs , because spain is traditionally a hospitable country , mr vergara said experts say some farmers do hire immigrants to take advantage of them mr ca amero , the union leader , says 15 to 20 cases of serious abuse are reported each year , in which workers have not been paid or do not have enough food or water but in most cases , mr ca amero says , that is not why farmers turn to foreigners he said hiring was governed by a web of prejudices about who are the best workers for the very hot work in the summer , farmers prefer to hire africans for strawberry picking , they prefer women it is not written anywhere , he said that would be terrible discrimination but that is how it works wages vary as well the africans tend to be paid 30 euros a day , about 38 other pickers can earn as much as 40 euros many farmers argue that they have found a reliable work force and that they cannot afford to jeopardize it diego luis camacho rodr guez , who owns a small strawberry farm outside huelva , has hired some local people but the bulk of his workers are foreigners , like the polish woman and her daughter who were delicately placing ripe fruit on plastic trays on a may afternoon once you start working with people and they know your operation , he said , you want to keep working with them still , he hired francesco gil barrera , 29 , this year , when the young man lost his construction job he also gave elena rosado p rez , 28 , a job she had been working as a waitress , but the restaurant was doing so poorly that its owners decided to close except for weekends manuel recio , the regional minister for employment and , said the government lowered the number of contracts available to foreign workers this year but he said he doubted that spaniards were really interested in the farm jobs and he was quick to point out that many of those in the fields were citizens of european union countries , and that they were as entitled to the jobs as spaniards even more than the spaniards , illegal immigrants , who had flocked to spain in recent years looking for work of any kind , are suffering hundreds of them are living in encampments in the woods recently , even immigrants with working papers have arrived at the camps abdoulaye diallo , who came from senegal in 2002 and worked steadily until 2008 , lives in one of the camps , on a dirt road that divides two farms outside huelva like hundreds of others living under a patch of trees , he has fashioned a shelter from plastic sheeting most of the men have not worked in 18 months they survive on handouts from the red cross not so long ago , they were sending money home to wives and children we live like animals , mr diallo said i keep looking for work but there is nothing
boston if you read the coverage of the from the national association of realtors , you may well have come to the conclusion that the american dream is dead it is indeed worrisome that sales in july were down 25 percent from a year ago but a little perspective is in order first , the bad news what has happened in the housing markets since 2005 is a catastrophe that may take years for our economy to recover from anyone who believed that home prices never fall has learned a tough lesson suggest that since their national peak in 2006 , home prices have fallen by 29 percent some areas of course look better than others las vegas is down 57 percent from its peak and phoenix is down 51 percent on the other hand , boston is down just 135 percent and dallas only 42 percent the effect on household wealth has been huge data maintained by the federal reserve show that the value of residential real estate directly held by households fell to 165 trillion in the first quarter of 2010 , down from 229 trillion in 2006 it has yet to be determined who will end up bearing those losses the decline in wealth has substantially reduced consumption , stifling the economy depressing , yes but the end of a dream \? not exactly i have never quite understood what the american dream really means when it comes to housing for some people , it means having a solid and fairly safe longterm investment that is coupled with the satisfaction of owning the house they live in that dream is still alive others , however , think the american dream is owning property that appreciates by 30 percent a year , making a house into a vehicle for paying bills but those kinds of dreams have become nightmares for the millions of foreclosed property owners who have found themselves sliding toward bankruptcy but for people with a more realistic version of the american dream , buying a house now can make a lot of sense think of it as an investment the return or yield on that investment comes in two forms first , it provides what is called net imputed rent from owneroccupied housing you live in the house and so it provides you with a real flow of valuable services this part of the yield is counted as part of national income by the commerce department it is the equivalent of about a 6 percent return on your investment after maintenance and repair , and it is constant over time in real terms consider it this way when enron went belly up , shareholders ended up with nothing , but when the housing market drops , homeowners still have a house and this benefit is taxfree the second part of the yield on investment in a house is the capital gain you receive if it appreciates and you sell the house gains are excluded from taxation if the property is a primary residence and the gain is less than 250 , 000 for a single filer or 500 , 000 for a married couple filing jointly consider a few other bonuses of buying a home today you can deduct the interest you pay on the mortgage interest rates are about as low as they can get and , do n't forget , home prices are down by 30 percent on average from the peak the mortgageinterest deduction and the taxfree income from housing cost the government at least 200 billion a year during this recession the government has been doing even more on behalf of the american dream it offered a tax credit of 8 , 000 to firsttime buyers , and eventually 6 , 500 to other qualified buyers not only did the federal reserve continue to keep the shortterm interest rates it sets at essentially zero , it purchased 14 trillion in mortgagebacked securities so that lenders could keep mortgage rates low do the math four years ago , the monthly payment on a 300 , 000 house with 20 percent down and a mortgage rate of about 66 percent was 1 , 533 today that 300 , 000 house would sell for 213 , 000 and a 30year fixedrate mortgage with 20 percent down would carry a rate of about 42 percent and a monthly payment of 833 in addition , the down payment would be 42 , 600 instead of 60 , 000 in fact , until about two months ago , it looked as if potential buyers were beginning to understand all these advantages and that the market was turning around by may 2009 , housing prices had stopped falling in a majority of the metropolitan areas surveyed in the caseshiller index sales were also up in 2008 , 49 million existing homes were sold in 2009 , the figure rose to 52 million last november , sales hit an annual rate of 65 million \( a boomtime number \) even new construction showed a pulse so , what happened to kill the momentum \? for one thing , the firsttime buyer credit expired at the end of april and some longerterm demographic changes may also be affecting the housing market in the next several years , the census bureau and other demographers project that the number of american households will increase by 1 to 15 million each year with new construction sagging , we should be experiencing a tightening market with low vacancy , as has occurred in every housing cycle since world war ii but instead of falling , vacancy rates remain at nearrecord levels my guess is that the number of households has not been growing as much as projected and may even be falling we wo n't know for certain until the 2010 census is complete this figure depends on many factors immigration , emigration , the age distribution of the population and the number of young adults staying at home or doubling up unemployment is high , and we know that without jobs people tend to move in with mom and dad and we do n't make immigration easy , even for those with advanced degrees who would be most likely to enter the housing market none of this bodes well for a quick recovery while demographic trends are uncertain , one important reason for the recent downturn is clear the steady drip of bad news about the economy has sapped the confidence of buyers , sellers and lenders and there is no understating the importance of expectations and confidence in this industry real estate sales are unlike other financial transactions you can place a rough inherent value on a stock or bond by looking at fundamentals a company s profits , pricetoearnings ratios , quality of its products and management , and so forth but a house is worth what someone is willing to pay for it that s a very personal , emotional decision and emotions can change on a dime to try to track moods and expectations as part of our caseshiller data , the economist robert shiller and i send out 2 , 000 questionnaires each year to recent homebuyers in san francisco , los angeles , milwaukee and boston , asking them what they think is likely to happen to the value of their houses over the next year in 2005 , respondents felt on average that prices would rise 96 percent in 2008 , they anticipated a small drop in 2009 , the figure turned positive again in all four cities , with an average anticipated gain of 22 percent we have just tabulated this spring s survey , which found that homebuyers anticipate a gain of 52 percent in the next year in a given year , the number of completed sales is about 4 percent to 5 percent of the housing stock thus it does n't take a change in mood of a large number of buyers to change the overall direction of the market this financial crisis has made us all too aware that we live in a catch22 world the performance of the housing market drives the economy , and the performance of the economy drives the housing market but housing has perhaps never been a better bargain , and sooner or later buyers will regain faith , inventories will shrink to reasonable levels , prices will rise and we 'll even start building again the american dream is not dead it s just taking a welldeserved rest
president obama s handling of the gulf oil spill has been disappointing i say that not because i endorse the dishonest conservative critique that the gulf oil spill is somehow obama s katrina and that he is displaying the same kind of incompetence that george w bush did after that hurricane to the contrary , obama s team has done a good job coordinating the cleanup so far the president has been on top of it from the start no , the gulf oil spill is not obama s katrina it s his 9 11 and it is disappointing to see him making the same mistake george w bush made with his 9 11 sept 11 , 2001 , was one of those rare seismic events that create the possibility to energize the country to do something really important and lasting that is too hard to do in normal times president bush s greatest failure was not iraq , afghanistan or katrina it was his failure of imagination after 9 11 to mobilize the country to get behind a really big initiative for nationbuilding in america i suggested a 1agallon patriot tax on gasoline that could have simultaneously reduced our deficit , funded basic science research , diminished our dependence on oil imported from the very countries whose citizens carried out 9 11 , strengthened the dollar , stimulated energy efficiency and renewable power and slowed climate change it was the texas oilman s nixontochina moment and bush blew it had we done that on the morning of 9 12 when gasoline averaged 166 a gallon the majority of americans would have signed on they wanted to do something to strengthen the country they love instead , bush told a few of us to go to war and the rest of us to go shopping so today , gasoline costs twice as much at the pump , with most of that increase going to countries hostile to our values , while china is rapidly becoming the world s leader in wind , solar , electric cars and highspeed rail heck of a job sadly , president obama seems intent on squandering his environmental 9 11 with a bushlevel failure of imagination so far , the obama policy is think small and carry a big stick he is rightly hammering the oil company executives but he is offering no big strategy to end our oil addiction senators john kerry and joe lieberman have unveiled their new energy bill , which the president has endorsed but only in a very tepid way why tepid \? because kerrylieberman embraces vitally important fees on carbon emissions that the white house is afraid will be exploited by republicans in the midterm elections the gop , they fear , will scream carbon tax at every democrat who would support this bill , and obama , having already asked democrats to make a hard vote on health care , feels he ca n't ask them for another i do n't buy it in the wake of this historic oil spill , the right policy a bill to help end our addiction to oil is also the right politics the people are ahead of their politicians so is the us military there are many conservatives who would embrace a carbon tax or gasoline tax if it was offset by a cut in payroll taxes or corporate taxes , so we could foster new jobs and clean air at the same time if republicans label democrats gas taxers then democrats should label them conservatives for opec or friends of bp shill , baby , shill why is obama playing defense \? just how much oil has to spill into the gulf , how much wildlife has to die , how many radical mosques need to be built with our gasoline purchases to produce more times square bombers , before it becomes politically safe for the president to say he is going to end our oil addiction \? indeed , where is the obama end to oil addiction act \? why does everything have to emerge from the house and senate \? what does want \? what is vision \? what are redlines \? i do n't know but i do know that without a fixed , longterm price on carbon , none of the president s important investments in clean power research and development will ever scale obama has assembled a great team that could help him make his case john holdren , science adviser carol browner , energy adviser energy secretary steven chu , a nobel prize winner and lisa jackson , chief of the environmental protection agency but they have been badly underutilized by the white house i know endangered species that are seen by the public more often than them obama is not just our superdisastercoordinator he is our leader , noted tim shriver , the chairman of special olympics and being a leader means telling the rest of us what s , what do need to do to make this a transformative moment please do n't tell us that our role is just to hate bp or shop in mississippi or wait for a commission to investigate we know the problem , and americans are ready to be enlisted for a solution of course we ca n't eliminate oil exploration or dependence overnight , but can we finally start \? mr president , your advisers are wrong americans are craving your leadership on this issue are you going to channel their good will into something that strengthens our country the obama end to oil addiction act or are you going squander your 9 11 , too \?
from 2006 to 2009 , ryan howard had 198 homers and 572 runs batted in for the both figures were the best in baseball over that period and rank among the best in history for a fouryear stretch only five players have hit more home runs over four consecutive seasons , and only seven have driven in more runners last week , the phillies agreed to pay howard like one of the game s greats , signing him to a fiveyear , 125 million contract extension the deal gives him the secondhighest annual salary in baseball , trailing only the contract of the yankees' alex rodriguez philadelphia fans erupted in joy that their beloved gentle giant would almost surely retire in a phillies uniform what they probably are not expecting , however , is that that retirement may come before the club is finished signing howard s paychecks despite those statistics , howard is not part of the game s elite although there is no doubting his power , his home run output is helped by his stadium according to , 16 percent more home runs were hit in games played at philadelphia s citizens bank park than in the phillies' road games from 2006 to 2009 similarly , howard s mammoth rbi totals stem from the onbase skills of the batters preceding him over the last four years , 1 , 993 men have been on base for him , the highest figure in baseball during that time , the kansas city royals' david dejesus has driven in a similar percentage of runners , with 183 percent to howard s 188 percent but because dejesus hits leadoff for the lowly royals , and howard hits cleanup for the mighty phillies , dejesus s rbi totals pale in comparison does no such favors for the players hitting behind him during his first two full seasons , he was usually followed in the phillies' lineup by the punchless aaron rowand , leading to a large number of intentional walks but once the team began putting sluggers in the fifth slot pat burrell in 2008 , and a mix of jayson werth and raul ibanez in 2009 howard s free passes plummeted , taking his onbase percentage with them over the last two years , howard s onbase percentage , 349 , barely exceeds the 343 mark that a leagueaverage hitter would have posted in philadelphia these caveats might not remove howard from the discussion of baseball s finest if , like his fellow first basemen mark teixeira and albert pujols , he made additional contributions in the field or on the basepaths but his fielding is merely average , and calling him a runner would be generous according to baseball prospectus , he has cost the phillies 15 runs on the bases over the last four years , the ninthworst total in the game because of these liabilities , howard resides in the majors' second tier a star , but not a superstar , the phillies have won 192 more games with howard since 2006 than they would have with a minimumsalary journeyman at his position that makes him the 17thmostvaluable nonpitcher during that stretch , just below his positional peers miguel cabrera , lance berkman and teixeira , and just above his teammate jimmy rollins the site s calculations show that a typical free agent expected to match howard s historical production would be paid 216 million a year that suggests the phillies are paying only a modest premium of 34 million annually to retain their hometown favorite howard s new deal , however , does not begin this year , or even next year it starts in 2012 and runs through 2016 , when he will be 36 that is why most quantitatively minded writers have panned it as , to borrow a phrase from internet discussion boards , an albatrocity howard s game personifies what bill james , the father of modern statistical analysis in baseball , once called , namely patience and power by contrast , young players tend to excel in speed , fielding and making contact neither set of abilities is more valuable than the other but they bode very differently for the futures of the players who possess them natural athletes like carl crawford or hanley ramirez can compensate for the inevitable loss of durability and bat and foot speed that comes with aging by improving their pitch recognition or bulking up in the weight room but massive mashers like howard or prince fielder cannot transform themselves into lithe leadoff men as the years go on and the strikeouts pile up as a result , their stars tend to burn brightly but briefly howard s on includes a number of cautionary tales , including mo vaughn , travis hafner , david ortiz , richie sexson , cecil fielder and john jaha of recent vintage , as well as throwbacks like jim gentile and dick stuart none of them had a valuable season after age 33 , and most flamed out well before that it is no wonder that dan szymborski , a writer for espncom who has developed a playerprojection system called zips , posting a 325 onbase percentage and 469 slugging percentage in the last year of his deal that is not much better than what one would expect from mike jacobs , whom the mets cut two weeks ago shortly after the deal was announced , philadelphia s general manager , ruben amaro jr , said howard kind of set the market for himself when a general manager admits he has let players set their own market , it may be time to get into the market for a new general manager
lake placid , ny the olympic pilot john napier did not take any practice runs thursday in advance of this weekend s world cup races here early that morning , he sent a text message to his united states team coach , saying he should probably stay off the track he had n't slept much , he wrote nightmares had kept him awake napier , a sergeant in the vermont army national guard , returned to competition this month , just 16 days after coming home from a sixmonth tour in afghanistan sometimes i dream that i'm back in afghanistan going on missions , said napier , 24 , who served with the 86th infantry brigade combat team but it s completely normal to have those sleep problems after what i 've been through , so i'm ok with that i know those dreams will fade with time bobsled keeps my mind busy , and that s a good thing his unit was based in the turbulent southeast , near the pakistan border yet it was by choice not by obligation that napier ended up there through the 2010 vancouver olympics , he was in the army s , which gives olympians and elite olympic hopefuls full army salaries and benefits as they train in turn , those athletes promote a positive image of the military , helping with recruiting but for napier , being an army promoter simply was not enough in a move army officials say is rare , he asked to be released from the world class athlete program for the opportunity to join his national guard unit in afghanistan in vancouver , he finished 10th as the driver for the usa2 twoman bobsled , but his sled crashed during the fourman event , and he did not finish even during the olympics , he dreamed of becoming a real soldier , he said , to repay the army napier said he could not forget how capt brian freeman , an american former bobsled athlete , was killed in iraq after being taken hostage in 2007 freeman s death , napier said , was additional motivation for him to serve i just kept asking to go because i could n't get away from the guilt of being here while other guys were over there fighting , napier said first sgt christopher button , who helps run the world class athlete program , said he was impressed with napier s enthusiasm but warned him to be careful of what he asked for i do n't have people knocking down my door to go , button said , adding that one of napier s olympic teammates , first lt chris fogt , was serving in iraq now napier s life had been built around the closeknit community of bobsledding , with the war a world away he grew up with the sport his father , bill , who died of cancer in 2005 , was a bobsled driver from the 1960s to the '80s and later became president of , the sports' national governing body john s mother , betsy , also drove bobsleds in her day she is volunteering at this weekend s world cup event , where she is the unofficial den mother for the competitors the napiers called schenectady home but spent many weekends at their lake placid cabin on bobsled run lane , the street that leads to the track here by the time john was 8 , bill napier was teaching him how to drive a bobsled , propping him atop a telephone book so he could see napier later become one of the best drivers in the country in a sport in which the sleds often scream down the track at 85 to 90 miles an hour my dad was a former marine , a tough sonofagun , so that was a lot to live up to , said napier , now 6 feet 3 inches and 205 pounds john napier joined the national guard in 2006 for the money his father had just died and the family was in debt from financing john s bobsled career napier was accepted into the world class athlete program two years later , and a huge financial burden was lifted when napier left in june for two weeks of preparation in mississippi before deploying , his national team coach , brian shimer , told him do n't worry about any training , i just want you to keep your head down i let him know , man , you 're nuts , but for a bobsledder that s almost a compliment to do this sport , you already have to have a few nuts and bolts loose because you go to such extremes at first , napier held a desk job on a big base in , working as an engineer but he considered that boring so he asked to work with an infantry unit , joining a platoon that had been in afghanistan since march first lt dan silver , the platoon leader , said he wondered what kind of arrogant soldier would volunteer for the miserable assignment the first thing i found out was that the colonel gave his blessing to be with us , silver said thursday in a telephone interview from his home in barrington , nh the second thing was that napier was an olympian and was pretty mature for his age so i said i have an olympian \? he s a machine by god , i'm going to use him' napier , who was used to the powerful sprinting needed for bobsled , not the enduranceheavy patrols of the army , adapted with ease but lost 34 pounds along the way he was assigned to be a gunner , carrying a 16pound m249 machine gun , twice the weight of his fellow soldiers' typical weapons in all , he lugged about 80 to 100 pounds of equipment , sometimes on foot patrols that lasted more than eight hours his radio call sign was not much of a stretch bobsled i never heard him complain , never once saw him not upbeat , silver said he turned out to be one of the best soldiers i 've ever had napier earned his combat badge on his first day , when the unit came under fire attacks were common , with mortar rounds landing inside their outpost or roadside bombs hitting their patrols in early october , taliban fighters had trapped napier s unit in an open field , attacking from three sides after everyone survived , silver said , napier led his platoon in a prayer often , napier called home on a satellite phone betsy napier said she worked at keeping the conversation light i 'd say you 're getting bombed \? you do know how to duck , right \? i 've seen you duck pretty fast under a bobsled cowling , so you 'll be ok' i 'd cry only after we 'd hang up three soldiers from the vermont national guard were killed , but none in napier s platoon yet at times he was sure he would not make it home now he thinks that experience could give him an advantage in bobsledding napier had always felt queasy when he stood at the top of a bobsled run , with about a mile of treacherous , twisting track below him but no more i'm calm because what s the worst thing that can happen to me \? he said am i going to be shot \? am i going to get blown up by a mortar \? no well , i guess i could still die , but i look at things differently now his platoon will be at this weekend s races , where he will compete in the twoman event on saturday and in the fourman on sunday he has planned a pig roast to celebrate we do n't care if he wins because to us , he s already won , silver said he s back in a bobsled , alive with all of his limbs , in the greatest country in the world , doing what he does best really , what more could he ask for \?

new orleans this was supposed to be the summer alex hubbard came back home after five years of living with his family in a salvation army shelter , a hotel room , a fema trailer and then a place in mississippi that belongs to his sisterinlaw , he was finally going to move back into his own house in the lower ninth ward then the bp blowout in the gulf of mexico happened and the slowdown of the drilling business offshore and , finally , the sixmonth federal moratorium on exploratory drilling now mr hubbard , an offshore technician , sits on a bucket in his empty house on lizardi street with no work for months , other than a day here or a couple days there , he has no money to buy a refrigerator , a bedroom set or even a few chairs you try to start your life back up and this happens , he said mr hubbard , a man as burly in stature as he is deferential in manner , has been working offshore since 1986 , after he reconsidered a career as a welder there used to be a lot of guys in the neighborhood who worked in the gulf , he said he loves the work , 14 days on , 7 days off , heading out of venice or port fourchon or houma it s like a vacation , he said he was on his sevenday home leave in 2005 when surged in , and the levees failed the next few months he spent in a shelter in laurel , miss , sleeping on a cot and speculating with the other offshore oil workers in the shelter how long it would be before the drilling business fully came back eventually the work picked up , but the old neighborhood did not none of the other offshore workers ever returned , at least none that mr hubbard knows nevertheless , he began showing up by himself on lizardi street a few days each month to rebuild his house , which he described as cracked in half the initial federal rebuilding money he received ran out quickly , and the work flagged but through a combination of grants and donations , and the work of a volunteer group , , his house was put together again the homecoming celebration is scheduled for later this month they are trying to find a time when mr hubbard will be in town rather than waiting around his company s headquarters for some work to turn up so now mr hubbard has a home in new orleans he has two daughters in college , and two other children in their final years of high school and , he said , sitting on his overturned bucket , he does not have much else
in a hearing this morning , the senate energy and natural resources committee is set to examine various issues related to offshore oil and gas exploration and to grill executives from bp , halliburton and transocean about the fatal and environmentally calamitous destruction of the deepwater horizon drilling rig  in the meantime , president obama is dispatching a government science and technology team led by his cabinet s nobelist , steven chu , to houston for an extensive dialogue with bp officials to continue to aggressively pursue potential solutions  since i began exploring responses to the unchecked seafloor gusher on may 1 , hundreds of readers have weighed in with questions for both company and government officials if you were on the senate panel , or heading with the energy secretary to houston , what questions would be on your mind \? here s a notable list from hj boitel of new york  1 does bp have a conflict of interest with regard to plugging this well \? from the outset of the blowout , did they permit the risk to increase because they were simultaneously attempting to protect their investment in this well \? 2 does this incident demonstrate negligence or lack of expertise or simply that the odds are that in every so many wells there will be a tragedy such as this because there are factors that cannot be controlled \? 3 what is the worstcase scenario here with regard to impact upon the environment , business and cost \? 4 if we treat this as an event in line with the odds , what does that tell us as to the number of other blowouts that we can expect \? 5 are bp and its insurers capable of paying for the likely and worst case damages resulting from this blowout \? 6 what can be done to expedite compensation to those who have been damaged by the blowout \? 7 it still appears to be unknown why this blowout happened nonetheless , it is likely possible to reduce the risk of this in other and future drillings for example , i speculate that limiting depth or pipe diameter or some other factor may be a way to keep us further from the danger zone , even if we do not yet know the specific reason for the blowout are there limitations that can be imposed now to limit the likelihood of future blowouts \? 8 did government regulation fail , in some way , here \? for example , was this kind of risk a known possibility , and did government impose adequate regulation to minimize that possibility \? 9 under the worst case scenario , as to this blowout , is there a risk that certain coastal areas will become uninhabitable or that certain aspects of the food and wildlife chains will be seriously impaired or pose a danger to the human population \? 10 shouldn t risky drilling , such as this , bear a fee or tax that will fund a substantial investment into alternative energy research and development \?

portauprince , haiti private medical evacuations of critically injured haitian children to the united states for treatment have largely stopped because aid workers , doctors and government officials are worried about being accused of kidnapping if they transport the children without first getting paperwork that is slow to arrive or is unavailable before 10 americans were trying to take children out of late last month , the largest pediatric field hospital in haiti was airlifting 15 injured children aboard private flights to the united states each day but since the arrests , it has been able to evacuate only three children on private flights to american hospitals , according to elizabeth greig , the field hospital s chief administrative officer , who has been in charge of trying to get the necessary haitian and american approval at least 10 other children have died or become worse while waiting to be airlifted out of the country , she said dozens of children are in critical need of care , and there has been no shortage of american hospitals or pilots willing to take them but before being permitted to evacuate the children , some doctors said they were now being asked by american and haitian officials for documents proving that the children were orphans or that the adult traveling with them was a parent a challenging task considering that many residents' birth certificates and other records remained buried under the rubble they 're all at risk of dying , and none of these children should still be here in haiti , said dr shayan vyas , an american pediatrician changing an iv at the pediatric field hospital , which is based here at the portauprince airport and handles most of the private pediatric airlifts out of haiti the hospital is run by , a miamibased charity , and a coalition of hospitals tied to the university of miami other clinics here in haiti have also conducted private evacuations , but they , too , are wrestling with the burden of proving that they are not illegally transporting children , according to those involved in the relief effort whatever the 10 jailed americans had when they tried to whisk the children across the border without government approval , many haitians and aid workers say the case has become a dangerous distraction for a country still in the throes of a huge humanitarian crisis last week , haiti s prime minister , jeanmax bellerive , observed that reporters were talking more now about 10 people than they are about one million people suffering in the streets dr lee sanders , an american pediatrician at the airport field hospital , took the point a step further for these kids the kidnapping case is n't just a distraction , he said , as he changed a dressing on a girl s infected leg it has become the difference between life and death previously , doctors , pilots and aid workers airlifted children with lifethreatening conditions out of the country immediately after triage , and then completed the paperwork after the children were stabilized no longer everything has slowed down , and most pilots are backing out of these medical missions with kids , said scott dorfman , a pilot from atlanta who has flown 50 flights since the earthquake , moving supplies , doctors and patients he said he planned on flying a critically ill haitian baby to an american hospital this week even though he was nervous about it no matter what , i'm not taking off until i know we have those papers in hand , he said if it means the patient does n't go , that s what it means adding to the list of problems , ms greig argued , the american customs officials who issue the socalled medical parole forms allowing children to be evacuated have sometimes failed to coordinate with the pilots who need completed forms in hand before they can take off american officials in haiti declined to comment on the problems with getting clearance to evacuate the children , but the kidnapping concerns are not the first problem for doctors trying to evacuate critically injured patients medical airlifts being flown by the american military were suddenly on jan 27 because hospitals and state officials were short on space and worried about shouldering the cost of receiving more children , according to military officials since the military flights on feb 1 , dustin doyle , a spokesman for the air force , said that on average they had been flying eight patients a day to the united states but doctors said that only a handful of children in need of care had been able to take advantage of those military flights because getting approval was slow and only patients at risk of dying in 24 to 48 hours had been permitted in fact , most of the patients airlifted to the united states since the earthquake struck have flown on smaller private flights arranged by a diversity of nongovernmental organizations and private citizens , according to doctors at the airport field hospital the paperwork for these private flights has been a challenge from the beginning after the earthquake struck , pilots and doctors were getting in shouting matches daily on the runway , with pilots saying they feared losing their licenses and being fined 400 , 000 if they did not have the medical parole forms from customs the impact of the evacuation delays could not be more evident leaning over a premature baby girl at the field hospital here , doctors took turns squeezing an air bag to keep her lungs functioning and used heating packets from readytoeat meals to raise her body temperature because they lacked an incubator across the sweltering room , a 5yearold boy lay moaning on a stretcher , his back broken by a wall that collapsed on him during the earthquake behind him , a 15yearold girl stared at the infection running down her leg toward what is left of her amputated foot florida hospitals had already volunteered to take them pilots were waiting with planes ready to fly them there all three had at least one person claiming to be a parent with them , but none had documents to prove it the baby has since been flown to another hospital in haiti , but is still struggling to survive the other two are still in the field hospital awaiting clearance to leave some doctors at the city s general hospital and at the airport clinic said they had consulted lawyers to see if they could be liable for arranging and often paying for private planes to take haitian children without having first ensured there were proper papers the doctors said they had since tried instead to get the children onto the comfort , a military hospital ship docked in the port , but had failed because space there was limited this is not how medicine is supposed to work , dr vyas said
those of us left off the guest list could only fantasize about now cruising into marriage no 4 an impressive total for a guy not quite 60 rush staged a lavish luau at the breakers in palm beach the revelers included what some might regard as the rat pack from hell the scriptural readings remain a mystery but we did learn the identity of the pop deity anointed as the wedding singer that would be elton john , whose last , with david furnish in 2005 why would america s rightwing radio king hire an openly gay entertainer to star at his wedding \? and why would sing can you feel the love tonight for a gaybaiting provocateur who and that samesex marriage could lead people to marry dogs \? sir elton s fee was reported to be a cool 1 million which goes to show that pop music and cash have the power to make even stranger bedfellows than politics june is america s month for weddings , and were we so inclined , we could bemoan limbaugh , an idol to the familyvalues crowd , for marrying a woman barely half his age alternatively , we could lament , which has produced so many cries of shock you 'd think they were the toy bride and groom atop a wedding cake rather than actual fleshandblood people capable of free will but let s refrain from such moralistic handwringing the old truth remains we never know what goes on in anyone else s marriage , and it s none of our business here s a toast to happiness for the gores and limbaughs alike , wherever life takes them but there is a shadow over marriage in america just the same the gores and limbaughs are free to marry , for better or for worse , and free to enjoy all the rights \( and make all the mistakes \) that marriage entails gay and lesbian couples are still fighting for those rights that s why the most significant marital event of june 2010 is , when a federal district court judge is scheduled to hear the closing arguments in perry v schwarzenegger , the landmark case challenging proposition 8 , california s samesex marriage ban a verdict will soon follow , setting off an appeals process that is likely to land in the supreme court , possibly by the 201112 term when the former bush v gore legal adversaries , ted olson and david boies , teamed up to mount the assault on prop 8 , but you may not know much about the trial that followed unless you made a point of finding out as it unfolded in january their efforts in this case , unlike the 2000 election battle , were denied the essential publicity oxygen of television the judge had planned to post video of the proceedings daily on youtube , but the prop 8 forces to keep cameras out their stated reason for opposing a television record was fear that their witnesses might be harassed but in the end the prop 8 defenders mustered only two witnesses , just one of them a controversial culture warrior was david blankenhorn , president of the socalled institute for american values blankenhorn holds no degree in such seemingly relevant fields as psychology , psychiatry or sociology but his pretrial research by george rekers , the antigay evangelist for his recent 10day european trip with a young male companion procured from and blankenhorn s testimony relies on the same sweeping generalization as rekers that children raised by two biological parents are so advantaged that all alternatives should be shunned what was the unqualified blankenhorn doing at the prop 8 trial \? like rekers , who had a lucrative history of testifying for pay in legal cases attacking gay civil rights , he also profits from his propaganda public documents , , reveal that blankenhorn s institute , , paid him 247 , 500 in base salary in 2008 , the most recent year for which data is available , and another 70 , 000 to his wife not a bad payday for a selfprofessed arbiter of american marital values who under oath described his sole peerreviewed academic paper \( from the university of warwick \) as a study of two cabinetmakers' unions in 19thcentury britain that the prop 8 proponents employed him as their star witness suggests that no actual experts could be found \( or rented \) to match his disparagement of gay parents you ca n't blame the prop 8 advocates for wanting to keep blankenhorn off camera boies demolished him during crossexamination \( \) another likely motive for opposing cameras at the trial was to shield viewers from the sympathetic gay plaintiffs ordinary taxpaying americans whose families , including four children , were often in the courtroom gays are far from the only americans still facing discrimination , but as boies said when i interviewed him about the prop 8 case last week , the ban on samesex marriage is the last area in which the state is taking an active role in enforcing discrimination and though some , of all people have claimed that civil unions are tantamount to marriage and remedy marital inequality , that is a canard domestic partnerships and equal economic benefits are n't antidotes , boies explains , because as long as gay americans are denied the same right to marry as everyone else , they are branded as subcitizens , less equal and less deserving than everyone else that governmentsanctioned stigma inevitably leaves them vulnerable to other slights and discrimination , both subtle and explicit the damage is particularly acute for children , who must not only wonder why their parents are regarded as defective by the law but must also bear this scarlet letter of inferiority when among their peers boies does n't dispute the consensus that the endgame in this case will , the supreme court s reigning swing justice kennedy in lawrence v texas , the ruling that finally ended the criminalization of gay sex in 2003 but where he may come down in perry v schwarzenegger is anybody s guess what fuels boies s hope for a just resolution is his faith in america itself this country is a culture of equality , he says we 've got that baked into our collective american soul he observes that attitudes continue to change fast on gay rights and that the approval rate for legalizing samesex marriage in a washington post poll in february is far higher than the approval was for interracial marriage \( \) even a year after the supreme court ruled it legal in 1967 it s not news that samesex marriage is a settled issue for most young people but the growing adult acceptance of unconventional family models can be found in the phenomenon of glee , the primetime hit on rupert murdoch s fox , no less , that unexpectedly became this year s on television for the 18to49 demographic glee recounts the lives of students in a hypercompetitive show choir at an ohio high school , and it s addictive for many reasons that have nothing to do with sexual politics but what s exceptional is the way it mashes up different kinds of american families from week to week much as it mashes up musical genres ranging from vintage rock to hiphop to lady gaga to show tunes in its performance sequences the leading teenage characters in glee have single parents \( both widowed \) , absentee parents and , in one case , two gay dads the teenagers suffer , struggle and occasionally triumph like any others , but along the way we see how families reconfigured by death , divorce and sexual orientation can be as loving , nurturing and , yes , as dysfunctional as any other the landscape is recognizable as the country we actually live in even if familyvalues zealots do retain the ability to prevent america from watching the prop 8 trial , we 're lucky that the era when they could banish a show like glee from network television seems to have passed dramatically enough , glee generated an unexpected reallife story last weekend to match its fictional plots the times s sunday wedding pages , the actress who steals the show as sue sylvester , the cheerleading coach who is the students' comic nemesis it s a sunny article until you read that lynch s spouse , a clinical psychologist named lara embry , had to fight a legal battle to gain visitation rights with her 10yearold adoptive daughter from a previous relationship that battle , , was required by florida s draconian laws against gay adoption laws that were and more recently , for an expert witness fee of 120 , 000 , by the rev rekers of rentboycom renown we 've come a long way in a short time , but as

havana \( ap \) when armando rivero took the mound for industriales with the score tied in the top of the 10th , he was already in a deep hole villa clara had runners on first and second with no outs all before the first pitch of the inning opening day in cuba offered a new rule that tries to prevent extrainning games from going on forever but the olympicstyle format has irked many purists on this baseballcrazy island who say it cheapens the sport under the rule , teams begin the 10th and any subsequent innings with two men on base managers get a onetime restart , meaning any hitter can lead off after that , the lineup stays in place think soccer penalty kicks , nhl shootouts or perhaps the closest analogy overtime in college football , in which teams start in fieldgoal range at the 25 and trade possessions the object in the top cuban league this season is to make it easier to score , thereby shortening games that often top four hours i do n't like it , said 66yearold sixto ramirez , wearing a blue industriales cap as he watched a recent game from fieldlevel seats behind third base after six decades of coming to havana s el latino stadium , the tie breaker strikes him as cold and clinical we are committed to a traditional game , ramirez said when there s a tie in the ninth , it should keep going there s nothing wrong with 15 innings many share that view in cuba , where baseball is as much the national pastime as it is in the united states the sport is wildly popular among everyone from workingclass fans who pay 1 peso about 4 cents to dance , drum and blow trumpets in industriales' raucous bleachers , to the country s no 1 fan fidel castro , who as a youth dreamed of playing in the majors and still occasionally comments on b isbol in columns written from semiretirement the tiebreaker debate is playing out in the stands , on street corners and even in cuba s statecontrolled news media , where sports is fair game for columnists who otherwise toe the official line on all things , well , official the first experience of the rule was not the happiest , wrote miguel ernesto g mez on the governmentrun news web site how are we supposed to understand that a reliever begins an inning with two runners on base \? that completely changes the way the game is conceived g mez pondered what might have been if the tie breaker had been in place during last season s tight championship series , also between industriales and villa clara , which was decided in a seventh game when industriales won 75 in extra innings it remains to be seen how much will be lost and how much gained in this spectacle , he wrote it is difficult to convince a knowledgeable crowd that the man who made the last out in one inning can comfortably begin the next on second base that confusion does n't show up in the box score but a columnist for the staterun newspaper juventud rebelde said something had to be done to speed up games in cuba , where batters are notorious for stepping out of the box for no apparent reason and pitchers tend to dawdle on the mound come on , it s not the end of the world , lu s l pez viera said , chiding the purists this is the first major professional league to try the tie breaker , which was adopted by the international baseball federation before the 2008 beijing games in response to olympic officials' requests to have a winner more quickly masaru yokoo , a federation marketing official , said that the idea of the new rule was to make the game more television friendly it did not work the olympics dropped baseball , anyway , earning the ire of both the united states and cuba , one of the few times in the past 51 years that the cold war adversaries have agreed on anything an adfriendly television package is a nonissue in communistrun cuba between innings , broadcasts air analysis , interviews , highlights and long shots of fielders waiting for play to resume but officials apparently see other benefits , like avoiding heat exhaustion by the 10th inning , players are running on inertia , industriales manager germ n mesa said they 're tired they 're desperate to finish moreover , it helps save on stadium lighting during tough economic times nearly all games in cuba s 16team top league have been ordered to start at 1 pm to take advantage of daylight , and the tie breaker all but ensures an end before sundown that is particularly important for industriales , whose field has been without working lights since last season cuban officials have warned that money is tight in baseball , as in everything on the island and there is no word on when the lights will be fixed there is also the tie breaker s official stated purpose to bring cuban baseball in line with international play supporters , including many players , managers and former players , say it heightens the excitement it s more intense , said rivero , who on nov 28 became the first pitcher to face the tie breaker in league play amid the debate , one thing is certain the tie breaker seems to work in the first week of the season , three games went into extra innings , and none lasted beyond the 11th luis zayas , 73 , a cuban who played in the cincinnati reds' and los angeles dodgers' minor league systems in the 1950s , said it was time for the sport to evolve the only thing that has to be preserved is baseball itself three strikes , four balls , he said , champing on a cigar in the stands at el latino soccer is the most popular sport in the world and it has penalty kicks to decide games , he said why not baseball \?
washington president obama promised thursday to spend 80 billion over 10 years to maintain and modernize the nation s nuclear arsenal , a commitment that could help win republican support for his  the plan expands a previous proposal by mr obama to upgrade nuclear infrastructure and was sent to the senate along with the treaty and accompanying protocol and annexes mr obama called president dmitri a medvedev of as he kicked off his campaign to win senate consent for the treaty the senate foreign relations committee will begin hearings next week , starting tuesday with secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , defense secretary robert m gates and adm mike mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the white house wants the treaty approved by summer , but it remains uncertain whether ratification could happen that soon i 'd like to see it happen before the election , mr obama told russian state television last week our hope is that they will be able to review it quickly and recognize that this is an important step in the efforts of both the united states and russia to meet our obligations under the nonproliferation treaty to lower our stockpiles in a recent interview , senator john kerry , a massachusetts democrat who is the committee chairman , expressed optimism that he could win the twothirds vote needed i want to do it as rapidly as we can , he said mr obama had proposed 7 billion for next year to upgrade the nuclear arsenal and comparable sums for several more years the plan sent on thursday extends the financing to 10 years , a more sustained commitment aimed at assuaging republicans like senator jon kyl of arizona , who have made the issue a priority and linked it to the treaty the treaty requires each side to deploy no more than 1 , 550 strategic warheads and 700 bombers , missiles and submarine launchers , and it establishes a new verification system to replace the one that expired along with the original strategic arms reduction treaty in december documents sent to the senate detailed how the cuts would be made at least 30 missile silos , 34 bombers and 56 submarine launch tubes would be taken out of service but the united states could remove missiles from their silos without actually destroying them most of the bombers will be converted to conventional use none of the 14 strategic nuclear submarines will be retired instead , each will have 4 of its 24 launchers removed
one of the pleasures of being a dedicated mad men fan and what are you doing here if you aren t \? is connecting with other viewers whose knowledge of the show is as encyclopedic and as obsessive as your own and no one fills that role better than matthew weiner , who created the show , oversees its production and would probably cater it if he had the time , and who is kind of like a walking wikipedia of mad men \( with a much higher rate of accuracy \) on a visit to new york to cheer on jon hamm in thursday s live episode of 30 rock , mr weiner welcomed artsbeat to his hotel room to talk about the mad men season though he was tightlipped about sunday s finale even on the friday evening before it was broadcast mr weiner spoke at length about the ideas that were in play during season 4 , his vision for the show s characters and what the future might hold for the series a version of this interview appears in monday s print edition of the new york times these are extended excerpts from that conversation is it fair to say that one of the themes of this season was about major new undertakings , whether it s sterling cooper draper pryce or betty s marriage to henry francis , coming perilously close to failure \? there s definitely some of that i always talk about how the show is about consequences , but also how the drama is derived from following things to the next step their marriage failed , and we did something people don t usually do on tv shows we actually ended the marriage we actually changed the business i wanted to show that don had lost his coordinates , was not married anymore , is getting older and is not good on his own who is \? these big events sleeping with that secretary and realizing that was a mistake drinking until he blacked out , losing the only person in the world who could call him dick , and you would see a different person there , that s gone are these low moments meant to remind us that for all of his charm , he s a guy we shouldn t be seduced by \? is that the tony soprano in him \? i don t think he s a bad guy i don t want you to ever think that i don t feel like it is tony soprano this is not a story about , crime doesn t pay this is a story about how hard it is for him he has a lot of admirable qualities and is basically a moral person , and he makes mistakes his morality is conflicting it s situational , which is the disease of the 20th century i want you to put yourself in his shoes i started off the season with those three holidays thanksgiving , christmas , new year s to show , this is what it is to be divorced him coming back from california after finding out anna was sick and corrupting lane , that s don saying , i can t fix that , but i can fix this i can make lane feel better what the audience is not used to , i think , is seeing him being rejected or make mistakes i know people identify with this slick , superconfident , whatever it is ok , we have a feeling he s an alcoholic , and if push comes to shove , he could become a problem drinker that was not a surprise , people weren t happy about it we know he s going to get older people don t want to think about that the work part of it was where people got nervous , and i saw them projecting onto the story that his work was not going well i think his work s been going great he s been trying to do it on his own terms as of last week , though , it certainly seemed like the agency had hit rock bottom i think the company was at rock bottom the week before , and there were consequences to the move he made but in terms of what i m trying to say and i don t own it , once it s out there i thought that that letter was a tremendous success it s the ultimate pr move to me that episode was all about people doing the right thing for the wrong reasons don s making an announcement against tobacco but all he s trying to do is get back at that company american tobacco and change the brand of his company midge wants him to buy a painting , but she doesn t betty finally decides to move that s the right thing why does she do it \? because she s jealous of her daughter that s what s in there was don s newspaper advertisement a deliberate nod to \? there s a bunch of people who did this move i didn t want anyone to think that i thought i d invented this on the other hand , when we talked to certain people in advertising about it , they were like , why would you do that \? everything that pete says in that scene , and lane , that s what they said you re committing suicide you re euthanizing the company you can t do that , it s tobacco jay chiat , actually , published a letter similar to this it s not an unusual move for the audience out there , there was some question about whether or not don could get an ad in the night before laughs i don t know why people thought it was unbelievable there might have been some question as to whether he could afford to buy the ad and also pay for pete campbell s stake to keep the company afloat he made half a million dollars selling that company he s been making between 40 , 60 , maybe 100 , 000 a year then he has a lot of money it s part of the story an ad back then , it was probably 3 , 500 it costs the same as a car , like it does now was it by design that the home life of betty francis and , in effect , the domestic lives of nearly all the characters played less of a role in this season \? no it was about was a guy who has no family , so he s at work all the time i hear people weigh in on this one year there s too much betty , this year there s not enough betty i always feel like , whose story do i want to tell \? what s the most interesting way to say it \? betty s story , the homelife story , has as much screen time probably , and weight , as joan s story had last year that s a lot i think people get concerned because , in the past , you ve shown no hesitation about dispensing with characters when it would be most dramatic to do so it s a totally organic experience all the actors want to work , and they want to work every week everyone s always worried they re not going to be in it enough , and jon hamm s always worried he s going to be in it too much the idea that people thought betty wouldn t be in the show was amusing to me when we did see betty this season , it was often in connection to sally , and sally seemed more like the adult in that relationship she s childish , but i think there was also a twist that henry has been good for her when she tells henry that she s talked to the fbi , she doesn t want to have secrets with him there s an attempt to have an intimacy she s had a hard time , betty i don t hate her i know it s hard for people i think they see a lot of themselves in her , and it s very hard for them to look at it they love the pleasure of thinking , i would never be like that hopefully they won t i ve got to tell you , just as a parent , and imagining being divorced , if your exhusband takes your daughter for the week and she comes back having cut her own hair , there s going to be a lot of anger you got some amazing performances this season from , who plays sally could you have known when you first hired her that she would blossom like this \? you don t but i can tell you she s always been more than a cute kid in addition to her talents , she has a mom , erin , who is not a stage mom her parents are very supportive of her desire to do this and what that means is we can be more and more adventurous in the stories we tell i ll bring erin shipka in at the beginning of the season and tell her what s going to go on it started off with , she s going to be making drinks and doing ballet , and she s going to smoke a cigarette and she s going to get her hair pulled , and then she s going to drive a car her grandpa s going to die and she s going to get slapped in the face she s going to cut her hair and then she s going to get caught masturbating it just got more and more and more , and they ve never said anything other than , this is a real person kiernan can do it , kiernan wants to do it , and we will shield her as much as possible but have her be an actor back at the office , we got to see peggy olson spend a memorable night with don at gunpoint don didn t want to be alone , and wouldn t admit it but we see the closeness between them and it s very satisfying she s probably become much more of don s disciple than she would want to admit to herself that s probably true i think she loves don and he s an important part of her life , and yeah , she wants to spend time alone with him but she turns on you sometimes , because she s so selfrighteous and full of herself , and it embarrasses us i look at the episode where pete found out trudy was pregnant to me , that story was basically , pete is getting older and peggy s getting younger she s going to go out with the kids in the village and kiss that guy in the closet and pete is having a child and going to lunch with the men look at the scene between the two of them , when she does the right thing and congratulates him on this pregnancy he s in denial about it and so is she i look at that and think , here s peggy making the decision to move on with her life i don t suppose you ll want to answer this , but there s been a lot of speculation about whether joan harris , christina hendricks s character , actually went through with the abortion you have to watch the show i ll have this conversation with you again in a week , but you have to watch the show christina s a great actress , that s all i can say whether you read that she did do it or didn t do it , you feel the strength of someone who s made a decision whether it was the hotel nude scene with peggy and stan rizzo , or or even the way the death of miss blankenship was handled , this felt like a more comedic season , with the humor coming from more unusual or dangerous situations i ve heard that i have to say , i think we always do it i was a professional comedy writer for a very long time , so i m not insecure about that but there are so many things i laugh at that maybe other people don t think are funny when roger has just lost lucky strike , they come in and he says , david montgomery died \? there s your silver lining or what i think is the funniest line in that episode , when megan says to don , how was the funeral \? and he says , we ll see there s not one person on the show who is not a really sharp , gifted comedian every time trudy and pete are in a scene , it s immediately funny , no matter what else is going on the scene when she was first shown fully pregnant was hilarious i put in the script trudy is eight months pregnant but still in a shorty nightgown and janie bryant goes to town when there s something that specific i saw that thing and i was like , what is that , a wedding cake she s wearing \? even though alison brie is already playing a comic character on community , you ve been able to get a performance out of her that is very funny in a very different way she s supergifted there is a very deft controlled , complete character , and she brought that with her there is this parenthetical above her lines that s like , well , of course ! pete says , i m already drunk , and she s like , good for you and they have the strongest marriage in the show she has a certain lady macbethlike power over him i think that they re a team , and she gives him good advice when he was passed over last season , she asked him the questions that only a very sophisticated businessperson would ask they ve both grown up , honestly , and that season where they were trying to have their baby and he threw the chicken out the window i ve heard from other people , not just my own experience that is a lot of people s first year of marriage , especially if they haven t lived together we even got to see more of this season what does it say that you cast your son marten as this creepy , offkilter character \? i know people use the word creepy , i don t understand it i don t find him to be offkilter i m very proud of their conversations , because anyone who has seriously eavesdropped on children , that is the way they talk to each other glen s always going to be defined by the fact that he asked betty for a lock of hair and he walked in on her in the bathroom , and i know that but we have a delusion , i will say , in this country , that children are not people people forget the thoughts they had when they were 6 and 7 years old , and how much of them was in there already as a dad , the anxiety i have is that he s going to get some public retribution for being a peculiar person , and he s not like that at all he s got very big eyes and very thick black hair and that may be part of why people think he s so intense but he s a doll and he loves doing it my worst fear is that he ll read some of the things that people write about him on the internet , which he never will that s all i care about we re now well into 1965 on the show , and there are no major black characters , no characters who are any kind of racial minority do jews count as racial minorities \? because there have been a lot of jews on the show i don t think so but is that its own commentary on the reality of the world these characters occupy \? that is the world they move in it s like saying , well , you re telling a story about baseball , where s jackie robinson \? i m like , jackie robinson is jackie robinson because he was one person , and this story is not taking place in that other universe i ve tried to show , obviously , as time goes on , this is going to change by the way , it changes socially it does not change in advertising it still has not changed and i will go to the mat on this thing i defy any of these companies outside of their corporate retreat photos to show me people of color in positions of power and those people who are out there , who have positions of power , who are of color , i have been in contact with and none of them think there should be more black faces in that office i don t mean it in an accusatory way i don t mean it defensively to me , i m telling a story about segregation and assimilation , and who s coming along at what time i hope people can tell faye miller is jewish i hope people know at some level that jane siegel , roger s wife , is jewish they are assimilated not everyone can be an heiress like rachel menken , who feels absolutely bulletproof bobbie barrett and jimmy barrett certainly were transparently jewish i gathered as much well , she said his name was brownstein grin and brownstein would be the name of the show if it wasn t for me i m not doing a whit stillman movie , and by the way those are contemporary , right \? so that has not gone away there was an interesting debate about the social network , which for having so few female characters who are anything other than sex objects , and was that that depiction was true to the world of those characters that was a fascinating thing to me , a sense that the world of the women in that movie and this is not a criticism felt very similar to entourage it was really about a frathouse perspective whenever people are like , we ve come so far , thank god we re not like that any more , you re like , really \? one of the stories we did on the show this year , i got from a creative director here in new york a few years ago i think she started here in the mid80s , and told me the story about the lipstick on her teeth she had an allmale staff , and she gave her presentation with lipstick all over her teeth , and no one said a word that s where i got that from at what point do you start thinking about season 5 for mad men \? it s not really scheduled at this point there are so many business things that have to go on , that are operating at a level far beyond me we have not officially been renewed , i m assuming we will be for me , these weeks afterward , i have to reacclimatize myself to my life , because i work long hours i have to try and force myself back into the hole that i ve left in my life , which sometimes closes up a little bit my family , my kids i start thinking about it as soon as i have a signed contract and i know what it is other than that , i put everything i have into every season and when it s over , it s over and i want the audience to feel that way too i want them to feel like , it s gone and hopefully they ll be so excited when it comes do amc and lionsgate seem to understand that the best way to end the series would be on your terms and not somebody else s \? i think everyone has suggested that that s the way it would be and i also feel like there s a way to end the show , to leave the taste in people s mouths that artistic decision , to complete it , is very strong for me we have a gigantic audience a gigantic audience , no matter what is said about it it has a tremendous life on the internet , and dvd and all these other things , and it s been so good for both of these companies , as good as it s been for me so i assume that everything will work out are you able to enjoy the culture of 2010 , or are you always on the lookout for stories for your show \? no , no , no first of all , half the stuff i tell you comes from right now and one of the great things about the show is that people share their stories with me , and i just say , that s mine laughs my job as an artist is to channel the feelings i have about society right now , these are the things i m feeling about our isolation , about our ambiguous relationship with materialism , about failure , about our declining selfesteem about our attitude towards change and technology these are things i m feeling every day , that i put into the show the other aspects of things that are going on in entertainment right now are frustrating to me i ve been very disappointed with whatever has happened to the business model that has made the movies so incredibly unattractive to me i m so starved for things , for any kind of entertainment the oscar things are coming out right now maybe they saved everything good for right then and there but it s been a bummer it s a bummer to see movie after movie where so many talented people get together and so much money is spent , and they re just bland , lifeless , familiar , fake i m not a superhero , it s not one of my interests it s ok for it to be a fraction of the entertainment that s out there , but it can t be everything and i have four little boys so i m seeing everything and they re tired of going to the movies that s a sad commentary it s a bummer but we have things we watch together we still watch the simpsons we watch 30 rock we love that cartoon avatar the last airbender we watch symbionic titan and we watch a lot of old movies i probably sound like an old person but it s not a great moment for someone who just got out of working 24 hours a day and wants to be entertained and i don t blame the artistic community i really don t something happened that nobody can make a movie between 500 , 000 and 80 million that can t be possible
twentyone college football players have collapsed and died as a result of training over the past decade at least eight were carriers of the sicklecell trait , a genetic disorder that can unpredictably turn deadly during rigorous exercise a blood test to screen for the trait costs about 5 , and many university team doctors and athletic trainers support compulsory testing , arguing that it could save lives yet a proposal to make such testing mandatory for all division i athletes is not a sure bet to pass when it comes up for a vote by member conferences as early as monday in indianapolis the measure is questioned by the , which argues that athletes should know their own status but raises concerns that those with the trait could be denied the chance to compete leading sicklecell researchers have also resisted calls for mandatory testing , saying that changing training practices for everyone would minimize the risks to athletes with the trait there s not any data that shows that screening can save lives , said dr william roberts , who coedited a set of recommendations by six medical organizations on preseason physicals a lot of the kids who have died , they 've known they have sicklecell trait and they still run them to death it should just be a change in the training program to protect everyone and not just the kids with sickle a vote on the issue in january failed to gain a necessary twothirds majority , with some of the most influential football conferences including the pacific10 and the big east opposing it concerns include the cost of testing athletes less likely to carry the trait and those competing in lowerintensity sports , as well as whether the test would lead the ncaa to require other , morecostly tests for other characteristics would allow athletes to opt out of testing , an idea that some opponents said they supported people with sicklecell trait have one abnormal hemoglobin gene and typically lead normal lives many do not even know they are carriers the trait is found in about 8 percent of africanamericans , but in less than 1 percent of white americans those with two mutated genes are said to have , which can cause a lifetime of health problems like severe pain , anemia , stroke and damage to tissue and organs during extreme exercise , some blood cells in an athlete with sicklecell trait elongate into sickle shapes that can disrupt blood flow to parts of the body , potentially causing damage heat , altitude and dehydration increase the risk of sickling , according to the national athletic trainers' association , which recommends easing athletes into workouts , giving them regular breaks and modifying intense conditioning tests the risk of death among college football players with sicklecell trait was first documented in 1974 , when polie poitier , a sophomore defensive back at colorado , collapsed during a workout after his death , the ncaa described the risk of sicklecell trait in its medical handbook , and for a time , the guidelines recommended that all africanamerican athletes be offered testing for sicklecell trait screening policy has since been left up to individual universities in 2008 , the ncaa took its strongest stance and formally recommended testing a result of a legal settlement with the family of dale lloyd ii , a rice football player whose death in 2006 was linked to the trait the proposal before division i members was initiated by rice as part of its settlement with the lloyd family we were just hoping and praying that we could make a difference , said bridgette lloyd , dale s mother someone had to say , enough is enough in 2006 , in the top tier of college football found that 21 percent of the 92 respondents screened all athletes for the sicklecell gene , with 64 percent having some policy in place as awareness has grown , several programs have begun testing , said scott anderson , the head athletic trainer at the university of oklahoma oklahoma began testing all athletes in the late 1990s so far , 20 football players have tested positive , including six on the current roster anderson said only 2 of the 20 had known they carried the trait , although all 50 states now test infants at birth really , a basic tenet of sports medicine is to know your athlete , anderson said last week in his office you do n't want to be surprised at the sooners' training center , some players who tested positive for the trait said the news came as a shock i'm not going to lie , it terrified me , said , a senior who was oklahoma s starting left guard last season my first year here , it just had me thinking about things a little bit more than it should it is unclear whether screening all athletes would prevent deaths of the eight football deaths linked to sicklecell trait in the past decade , four occurred after a university knew that the player had the disorder , said anderson , who keeps the statistics dr m a bender , the director of the odessa brown comprehensive sickle cell clinic in seattle , said scant research had been done on the connection between exercise and the sicklecell trait there is n't the data in terms of how often it occurs , what the real risk is , and what underlying factors may be involved , he said one of the few military recruits from 1977 to 1981 it concluded that those with the trait were 40 times more likely to die during basic training than those without it the national institutes of health is hosting a meeting in june to plan further research anderson said medical examiners often missed the trait as the cause or a contributing factor to death because it was easily confused with heat exhaustion or heart ailments others say the trait can be overreported because all blood cells tend to take on the telltale sickle shape when they are removed from the body and deprived of oxygen some worry that coaches and the nfl will discriminate against athletes who are singled out as carriers in the 1970s , the air force academy barred people with sicklecell trait , and some airlines refused to hire them as pilots and flight attendants does it now slide from protection of the athlete who has sct by sitting them out , to maybe losing a scholarship , to maybe not being recruited at all \? asked dr lanetta jordan , the chief medical officer for the sickle cell disease association of america many researchers say the best solution is to use training practices that protect everyone from the risks associated with overexertion one model is the army , which no longer screens for the trait but takes acrosstheboard precautions since the change in practices , studies have shown , soldiers with the trait have no higher risk of dying in basic training than those without it may not be necessary to select a subset of athletes for special treatment , said dr susan shurin , the acting director of the national heart , lung and blood institute at the national institutes of health the most serious complications of sicklecell trait can probably be prevented if they just drink water whenever they need to , and you avoid really extreme exertion but anderson said what worked for soldiers might not work for studentathletes the military has a commandandcontrol structure that college athletics does not , he said at oklahoma , trainers keep a close eye on athletes with the trait and modify grueling workouts like wind sprints or conditioning tests anderson acknowledged that this singled out players with the trait three oklahoma football players who have the trait said they had endured some goodnatured ribbing , a defensive end , said his roommates called him sickle but none said they felt discriminated against , and they pointed to former oklahoma players with the trait , including atlanta falcons linebacker curtis lofton , who were drafted by the nfl the league requires all participants in its scouting combine to be screened for the trait , but whether other players are tested is left up to each team one study found that the incidence of the trait in the nfl was consistent with that of the general population after a 2007 game in denver , pittsburgh steelers safety ryan clark s spleen and gallbladder were removed as a result of complications from sicklecell trait caused by the altitude clark said that he supported the ncaa legislation but that the trait was an issue during his free agency this offseason some teams were concerned about his ability to play at altitude anything that can negatively impact , of course they 'll bring those things up because they 're trying to get players as cheap as possible , he said it s business anderson said it was time for the ncaa to act we 're 35 years down the road , at least , he said athletes who have sicklecell trait have already been discriminated against by not being protected they have not only lost opportunity to participate in sport , but they have lost their life and that is what we seek to change
a bit more on how government spending has not , contrary to what you hear everywhere , surged under obama let me offer a calculation that will , i hope , make things a bit clearer \( cue the usual suspects shouting that i m lying \) so , what would we have expected total government spending federal , state , and local to do over the past three years if there had not been a crisis and a change in government control \? a first approximation would have been spending growing along with the trend growth in the economy that is , real gdp growing with the economy s potential , and government spending growing at real gdp plus inflation now , over the period 20002007 from business cycle peak to business cycle peak real gdp grew 24 percent a year so a reasonable estimate for trend growth is 24 percent , or 73 percent since 2007 we can use actual inflation the gdp deflator rose 41 percent from 2007ii to 2010ii put these together , and normal growth in government spending would have been 117 percent over the past three years actual growth has been higher 195 percent so government spending is about 7 percent , or about 350 billion , higher than a simple trend projection would have suggested what accounts for the higher spending \? well , none of it is government consumption it s all in transfer payments bea data aren t quite as helpful here as i d like , but it s clear that a large chunk , roughly 100 billion , is unemployment benefits , which have surged along with unemployment , and another large chunk is medicaid spending , which has surged because the slump has impoverished more people some more for other safety net programs , like food stamps also , social security and medicare outlays have gone up about 85 billion more than my 117 percent norm medical cost growth , aging baby boomers , and maybe some people taking early retirement because they can t find jobs and with that , you ve basically explained the growth in government spending no giant expansion of the welfare state just business as usual in the face of a horrific slump

as his name , don draper so you do n't really expect her to break the ice by talking about bad news the world is so dark right now , she says one of the boys killed in mississippi , andrew goodman he s from here a girlfriend of mine knew him from summer camp her date is too busy studying her d colletage , so she fills in the dead air is that what it takes to change things \? she asks he ventures no answer this is just one arresting moment no others will be mentioned here in the first episode of like much in this landmark television series , the scene haunts you in part because of what people do n't say and ca n't say mad men is about placid postwar america before it went smash we know from the young woman s reference to goodman one of the three civil rights activists that the crackup is on its way but the characters ca n't imagine the full brunt of what s to come , and so a viewer in 2010 is left to contemplate how none of us , then or now , can see around the corner and know what history will bring this country was rightly elated when it elected its first africanamerican president more than 20 months ago that high was destined to abate , but we reached a new low last week what does it say about america now , and where it is heading , that a racial provocateur , wielding a deceptively edited video , could not only smear an innocent woman but make every national institution that touched the story look bad \? the white house , the naacp and the news media were all soiled by this episode meanwhile , the majority of americans , who believe in fundamental fairness for all , grapple with the poisonous residue left behind by the many powerful people of all stripes who served as accessories to a hightech lynching even though the from shirley sherrod s 43minute speech came from andrew breitbart , the dirty trickster on fox news , few questioned its validity that the speech had been given at an naacp event , with naacp officials as witnesses , did not prevent for shameful actions as the world knows now , her talk \( \) was an uplifting parable about how she had risen above her own trials in the jim crow south to aid poor people of every race during her long career in rural development the smear might well have stuck if the white octogenarian farmer saved by sherrod 24 years ago was no longer alive and if he did n't look like a norman rockwell archetype only his and his wife s could halt the lynching party tom vilsack , the secretary of agriculture without questioning the video s patently spurious provenance , was far slower to reverse himself than the naacp good for him that he seemed but an executive so easily bullied by fox news has no more business running a government department than ken salazar , the secretary of interior who let oil companies run wild on deepwater drilling until disaster struck that the white house sat back while vilsack capitulated to a mob is a disgraceful commentary on both its guts and competence this was n't a failure of due diligence there was diligence even now , i wonder if many of those who have since backtracked from the sherrod smear including some in the news business who reported on the video without vetting it have what s important is not the exculpatory evidence that clears her of a trumpedup crime what matters is  she was making the speech in georgia , her home state , on march 27 , the 45th anniversary of her father s funeral he had been murdered when she was 17 , leaving behind five children and a wife who was pregnant with a sixth sherrod had grown up in baker county , a jurisdiction ruled by a notorious racist sheriff , black men were routinely murdered there but the guilty were never brought to justice as sherrod recounted , not even three witnesses to her father s murder could persuade the grand jury to indict the white suspect sherrod had long thought she 'd flee the south , but had an epiphany on the night of her father s death i could n't just let his death go without doing something in answer to what happened , she said so she made the commitment to stay and devote her life to working for change she later married charles sherrod , a minister and cofounder of the student nonviolent coordinating committee , whose heroic efforts to advance desegregation , including his imprisonment , in any standard history of the civil rights movement none of this legacy , much of it accessible to anyone who wanted to look \( or ask \) , prevented the tarring of shirley sherrod last week and it all unfolded while the country was ostentatiously marking the 50th anniversary of to kill a mockingbird if we are to learn anything from this travesty , it might help to retrace the racial soap opera that immediately preceded and provoked it that story began on july 13 , when calling on the tea party to expel racist elements in its ranks no sooner had tea party adherents and defenders angrily denied that such elements amounted to anything more than a few fringe nuts than mark williams , the spokesman and past chairman of the tea party express , he slapped a parody on the web a letter from colored people to abraham lincoln berating him as the greatest racist ever and complaining about that whole emancipation thing because freedom means having to work for real williams had , but now that the naacp had cast a spotlight on the tea party s racist elements , he was belatedly excommunicated by the leader of another tea party organization in truth , it s not clear that any group in this scattered movement has authority over any other but one thing was certain the naacp was wrong to demand that the tea party disown its racist fringe it should have made that demand of the gop instead the tea party express fronted by williams is it was created by prominent gop political consultants in california and , including sharron angle , harry reid s senate opponent in nevada but republican leaders , presiding over a congressional delegation with no blacks and a party that nearly mirrors it , remain in hiding whenever racial controversies break out under their tent i am not interested in getting into that debate ,  once williams was disowned by other tea partiers , the bogus sherrod video as revenge under the headline video proof the naacp awards racism to portray whites as the victims of racist blacks has been a weapon of the right from the moment desegregation started to empower previously subjugated minorities in the 1960s but its deployment has accelerated with the ascent of a black president the pace is set by rightwing stars like glenn beck , who on fox barack obama a racist with a deepseated hatred for white people , and the everopportunistic newt gingrich , who sonia sotomayor as a latina woman racist even the civil rights hero john lewis has been slimed by these vigilantes lewis was by state troopers bearing nightsticks and whips in selma , ala , just three weeks before sherrod s father was murdered 200 miles away in 1965 this year , as a member of congress , he was while walking past protesters on the capitol grounds during the final weekend of the health care debate breitbart charged lewis with lying never mind that the melee had hundreds of eyewitnesses and so manifestly bogus that even fox did n't push it but he was n't deterred then , and he and others like him wo n't be deterred by the sherrod saga s happy ending as long as the mcconnells of the conservative establishment look the other way and fox pumps racial rage into the media bloodstream 24 7 you think we have come a long way in terms of race relations in this country , but we keep going backwards , she speaks with hardwon authority while america s progress on race has been epic since the days when sherrod s father could be murdered with impunity , we have been going backward since election day 2008 we do n't know what history will bring next but we might at least address the chilling question prompted in mad men by the horrific events of 46 summers ago is that what it takes to change things \? before our own summer comes to a boil again

francis lawrence , mr huguely s lawyer , said ms love s death was not intentional until more information becomes available , it is our hope that no conclusions will be drawn or judgments made about george or his case , mr lawrence said , adding that his client was withdrawing from the university we are confident that ms love s death was not intended , but an accident with a tragic outcome the shock of ms love s death was fresh on the virginia campus tuesday , the final day of classes finals begin thursday some of ms love s teammates walked to classes in tears some of her sorority sisters at kappa alpha theta wept while sitting on porch swings at the sorority s house i'm sorry , but it s just too soon , one of the sorority members said outside of the house we all promised not to talk about it until more time has passed but the lacrosse teams , both awaiting seeding on sunday for the ncaa tournament , will play on craig littlepage , the director of athletics , announced tuesday that both teams the men are ranked no 1 nationally , the women no 5 will continue their seasons to honor yeardley a spokesman for the university said littlepage had communicated with the love family a

assists ms love started 3 of 18 games but did not score a point details surrounding the death of ms love , a 22yearold senior from cockeysville , md , began to surface tuesday an affidavit said that one of ms love s roommates and a man on virginia s tennis team found ms love in bed on monday morning she was face down , with her head on a pillow , unresponsive police found a pool of blood on her

help build the case against mr huguely , the police recovered ms love s computer after mr huguely admitted he had taken it from her apartment chief longo would neither confirm nor deny if the computer contained death threats and would not specify what evidence led to the firstdegreemurder charge we 're looking into what , if any , threats were made , he said we 've heard exactly what the entire community here has been hearing the difference is that we have to prove it there is no record of any previous violence against ms love by mr huguely , chief longo said but mr huguely has had runins with the law in november 2008 , he was arrested near a fraternity house not far from the campus of washington lee university in lexington , va , for public swearing , intoxication and resisting arrest

of their parents were at police headquarters on tuesday , just as mr huguely was on a video conference next door in general district court none of the players commented mr huguely s bond hearing

several weeks he also said he met with mr huguely several times monday , and that mr huguely appeared emotional he was upset by the circumstances that he found himself in , chief longo said i would n't say he was distraught about 120 miles away in alexandria , va , on a high school lacrosse field , there were other emotions ms love s alma mater , notre dame preparatory , played a lacrosse game at st stephen s and st agnes school to pay tribute to ms love , the players wore orange bows in their hair they put black pieces of tape on their sticks and wrote no 1 , ms love s number , on their

this past summer , i sat in norman mailer s living room in provincetown , mass , as the sun beat on the windows looking out to the bay , listening to mailer s literary executor and longtime friend , j michael lennon , tell stories about norm , his wives and his writing habits i was there as a writing fellow at the norman mailer center , which is what the brick house on commercial street has become , and our group , lennon told us , was going to have a special opportunity to tour the house , including mailer s attic study , which has been preserved in amber mailer was in the middle of writing a book when he died , and after his death nothing was touched the plan is to have the room stay that way forever , lennon said having toured dozens of dead writers' houses over the years , i was familiar with the genre of the mailer tour the bedrooms , the bookshelves , the dining room table scratched up by the author i could also anticipate the quiet awe of my fellow tourgoers once we reached the mecca , the thirdfloor study my reaction \? geez , it s hot up here , and musty , and i hope no one saw me yawn but i did marvel at one thing the universal gym , in mint condition , installed in the middle of the room i wonder how that will play to the provincetown pilgrims 50 years from now \? by my count , there are 73 writers' houses open to the public in the united states not all provoke the awestruck response of the selfselected group at the mailer house according to curator and tourguide estimates , only about half of the 2 , 000 people who visit the walt whitman house in camden , nj , each year come because they are interested in whitman \( as opposed to a nice historical stopover after touring the battleship down the road \) just 10 percent of the 9 , 000 annual visitors to the thomas wolfe memorial in asheville , nc , come specifically for the author most people who visit the mount , edith wharton s lavish estate in touristfriendly lenox , mass , are killing time before a concert at tanglewood \( and tend not to continue to arrowhead , herman melville s modest homestead in the nearby depressed industrial city of pittsfield \) half of the 182 , 000 annual visitors to hemingway s house in key west say they come for the cats it s tempting to write off the interest in writers' real estate to american materialism , but literary pilgrimages and resistance to them have a long history petrarch s birthplace in arezzo was preserved in the 14th century , while he was still alive , though the poet found the idea preposterous , as he had never lived there and considered florence his home the casa di dante , near the piazza della signoria in florence , is utterly ersatz the guidebook on sale at the ticket counter says of the bedroom , this was certainly not dante s bedroom in england , writers began visiting shakespeare s birthplace in stratforduponavon \( which may or may not have been the house where shakespeare was born \) in the 18th century , followed in the 19th by the tourist hordes more keep opening up you can now tour and sleep in agatha christie s house in devon , where several of her books were set american writers' houses can be spotty in their chronology , as well as their historical accuracy new york may be the nation s literary capital , but there is only one writer s house museum in the five boroughs edgar allan poe s cottage in the bronx , where he spent the last few years of his life the contents of marianne moore s greenwich village living room were preserved , but moved to philadelphia the whitman house displays oldtimey paper the curator bought across the river at the ben franklin print shop in philadelphia , even though franklin predates whitman by a century hannibal , mo , has plaques announcing where events from mark twain s books tom painting the fence , huck fishing took place , though of course none of these things really happened the poe house in baltimore one of several dwellings \( including a dorm room at the university of virginia \) preserved in honor of the peripatetic writer shows a video in which school kids tell us poe is important because he helped spawn the tv series moonlighting \( does anyone remember moonlighting \? \) these small museums do tell fascinating stories , though not always the ones they intend in cleveland , where i live , a community development group bought a house langston hughes lived in during his high school years for 100 at a sheriff s sale in november 2009 the city has condemned the structure , so people are debating whether to raise the 100 , 000 it would cost to save it from demolition the questions under discussion will a hughes museum attract tourists to a dicey part of town \? did hughes live in the house long enough for it to be significant \? reflect the confusions at the heart of the idea of preserving writer s houses i 'd argue we 'd be better off using the money to help buy every school kid a book of hughes s poetry then again , 100 , 000 is chump change next to the costs associated with mailer s bayfront pile in provincetown , or the old hemingway place amid the multimilliondollar retreats of ketchum , idaho , where the neighbors blocked efforts to turn the property into a public museum \( at present , it s mainly visited by potential donors to the nature conservancy , which owns the property , the largest undeveloped site in ketchum \) sitting at mailer s bar overlooking the water , i find it hard not to price the place and wonder how long they will be able to afford to offer writing fellowships literary capital can fluctuate as much as hard currency or real estate instead of buying houses , investors in literary futures might consider setting up tours of college campuses , where so many of today s esteemed writers do much of their work anyway one imagines a tour of toni morrison s hard drive in her princeton office , marilynne robinson s archived inbox in iowa city and the yellowed note card i'm imagining here tobias wolff tacked to his stanford office door , announcing fall 2010 office hours and then there s the risk that a writer s reputation will be foreclosed on while the house still stands consider the hamlin garland homestead in west salem , wis , and the thomas bailey aldrich house in portsmouth , nh , which honor writers whom most of us have forgotten it may be morbid to imagine the deaths of our greatest writers , but that they will someday die is one thing of which we can be assured , unlike property values or literary reputations jack london serves as a cautionary tale in sonoma county , he built a dream house on top of earthquakeresistant concrete slabs large enough to reinforce a 40story building , intended to last 1 , 000 years three days before it was to be completed , it burned down but that has n't stopped visitors from coming to tour the ruins photo the mailer house in provincetown is now the home of the norman mailer center and writers colony top , the mount , edith wharton s estate in the berkshires \( photographs by top , george ruhe for the new york times bottom , copyright norman mailer center , 2007 \)

the mets have made a number of changes to citi field this winter a new team hall of fame , more images of their stars , and even planters with orange and blue flowers the credit rating agencies are doing their part , too on tuesday , standard poor s lowered the ratings on the 695 million in bonds issued to pay for the stadium to below investment grade , or junk ambac assurance corp was chosen to guarantee the bulk of the bonds , which were issued in 2006 , in the event the mets missed a debt payment the company has run into financial difficulties , which theoretically makes it less able to meet its obligations as a result , the bonds themselves were downgraded to bb , from bbb before the bonds issued in 2006 do not have a reserve fund with adequate liquidity to support any disruption in project cash flow , sp said in a statement in other words , the rainyday fund is drier than thought sp , however , said the outlook for the bonds was stable , not negative , which means another downgrade is not imminent moody s investor services lowered its ratings on the bonds to junk status last week the bonds were issued by the new york city industrial development agency , but covered by the mets with revenue generated from a portion of the premium seat sales and other sources including concessions and parking by having the agency issue the bonds on behalf of the queens ballpark company , the mets were able to reduce their interest payments on the bonds , which mature in 2046 none of this may mean much to the mets payroll , already one of the largest in the majors if the mets were to issue new bonds , they may have to pay a higher interest rate they may also have to contribute more to the reserve fund for their current bonds in a statement , the team said , this is related specifically to ambac , which insures the 2006 bonds , and is not based on our operations or the strength of the underlying credit
i suppose you could call an interdisciplinary artist but somehow the term seems flat and cumbersome in describing his output , which at this point feels more like a continuing set of questions and proposals than a series of distinct pieces he is building a body of work in the truest sense , reaching for a poetics at once complex and simple and constructing a container to receive , if only for scattered moments , things that ca n't be kept for those familiar with his performances and visual art , the new york premiere of how can you stay in the house all day and not go anywhere \?

st petersburg , fla the traded for cliff lee in july for games in october and on wednesday , lee delivered the type of performance that he displayed a year ago in leading the phillies to the world series , in game 1 of the american league division series , thanks largely to lee s customary mix of 90mileperhour fastballs and pinpoint accuracy he allowed one run and five hits in seven innings he struck out 10 and walked none he s a special man , catcher bengie molina said lee , a 32yearold with steely pale eyes and the whiskers of a man who has not shaved since last week , looked ready to carry another team deep into the postseason the rangers would take any success he can bring they have never won a playoff series and had lost nine playoff games in a row , dating to 1996 but they have , the al east winners with the  i like pitching on a big stage , lee said just pitching in the big leagues alone is an honor , but when you get an opportunity to make it to the postseason , that s what it s all about lee won the 2008 cy young award with cleveland , then was dealt to philadelphia midway through 2009 in last year s playoffs , he was 40 with a 156 earned run average he began this season in seattle , then was dealt to texas , which was looking for a repeat performance from their new ace come fall the anticipated matchup at tropicana field between lee and s david price , a pair of lefthanders considered among the best in the league , never fully developed the rangers picked at price early and often , scoring one or two runs in every inning from the second through the fifth price , a 25yearold who was 196 with a 272 earned run average and the starter in the allstar game in july , allowed more than three earned runs for the first time at home this season damage came from unexpected places , including molina at the bottom of the order he went 3 for 4 , singling home a run and hitting a home run he had five home runs in the regular season i just got lucky today , molina said molina arrived in july in a trade with the giants outfielder jeff francoeur came from the mets on aug 31 combined with lee , they provided everything the rangers needed in game 1 francoeur followed ian kinsler s secondinning single with a runscoring double off the centerfield wall an out later , molina singled to score francoeur nelson cruz hit a home run in the third inning , and molina hit his in the fourth vladimir guerrero , added to the team last offseason , hit a runscoring double in the fifth we were able to hit four or five fastballs for extrabase hits , which turned out to be huge , francoeur said price lasted six and twothirds innings , allowing five runs and nine hits he struck out eight the rays squandered their best scoring opportunities early in the first inning , lee surrendered three consecutive oneout singles before striking out carlos pena and rocco baldelli pena s strikeout followed a controversial call a lee pitch came inside and hit something both molina and lee said they heard it pena did not rush off to first , though , and the homeplate umpire tim welke ruled that the ball hit pena s bat , not his hand the difference between the two was a strike instead of a run , and rays manager joe maddon hurried onto the field to argue it definitely hit something , lee said i could hear it from the mound when he did not start jumping around and did n't want to go to first base , i had a pretty good feeling it hit the bat ben zobrist doubled to lead off the second , but never advanced as lee sandwiched strikeouts around a linedrive out after the game , maddon struck an optimist s tone , saying he was encouraged by his hitters , perhaps because he knows they will not see lee again until at least game 4 , if the rays can stretch the series that far we had bad baseball luck , maddon said we kept hitting the ball at them thursday afternoon s game 2 will pit tampa bay pitcher james shields \( 1315 , 518 earned run average \) against texas' c j wilson \( 158 , 335 \) , making his postseason debut but game 1 was proof that the regular season has little to do with the postseason lee arrived with an 03 record and a 456 era in three starts this year against the rays one of the losses came aug 16 , against price it has zero bearing on the game tomorrow , lee said on tuesday and , on wednesday , he was right the game did not feel at all like august it felt more like october last october
, the former giants and jets coach who has rebuilt five franchises as a coach or a general manager , will no longer run the  on tuesday , that parcells , who in one season turned a onewin dolphins team into the afc east champion , would remain with the club as a consultant but that jeff ireland , his prot g , would assume control over all aspects and decisions relating to the team and its support staff the statement said this was the intent of the structure put in place a while ago , but this is clearly parcells s first step toward eventually leaving the dolphins as the dolphins were collapsing to 115 parcells was hired by the dolphins' former owner h wayne huizenga to essentially rebuild the football side of the franchise he hired ireland as the general manager and tony sparano as the coach , although parcells was particularly involved in personnel while sparano became the public face of the franchise , in large part because parcells rarely spoke to reporters after the team released its statement , there were no further comments , and none are expected there was also no indication why the decision was made now , five days before the regularseason opener , when it would seem likely to cause a distraction for players and coaches last year , stephen ross , a new york real estate developer , took control of the franchise and took steps to glamorize the team , attracting celebrities like serena williams and marc anthony as minority owners and creating an orange carpet to welcome vips to games there were those in the organization who quietly worried that the glamour and the way it might infringe on the team sideline access was assured for a membersonly gameday club might alienate the more oldschool parcells , who protected the sanctity of his team now , the question is whether ireland is a strongenough figure to exercise the same sort of control parcells did quarterback donovan mcnabb said that his sprained ankle was not 100 percent , but it will not keep him from starting washington s opener sunday night against dallas yes , i will be starting this weekend , mcnabb said and i look forward to it mcnabb sprained his left ankle two and a half weeks ago in a preseason game against baltimore mcnabb said the injury was not classified as a high ankle sprain but he said it was very close to it he said he was receiving multiple treatments each day is it 100 percent \? he said no but it s getting better
kerry wood can tell us better than anyone how home field and the hottest pitchers do not necessarily make for the most secure safety net he can tell us about the cubs and the marlins , himself and mark prior , steve bartman and the trapdoor a team can fall through just when it seems ready to take off for the stars i thought about that last night , how i was on a team that was up , 31 , going home with our best pitchers , and we did n't make it happen , wood said wednesday night in the ' clubhouse , speaking of the chicago nightmare known as the 2003 national league championship series we all thought it was going to happen , but that s why you go out to play the game as it was with the marlins , the first move for the yankees had to be a step forward wednesday , in the name of survival and in the direction of the airport it would be a stretch to say that carried them there when it was more a case of a scuffling sabathia picked by wood , mariano rivera and an awakened yankees offense even during a 72 game 5 triumph that started out 50 for the home team , we were reminded of what a load this alcs has been for the yankees now the boulderpushing only gets heavier than a dozen sabathias on their shoulders but if you are the yankees , heading to the heart of texas for what most people believe will be a hoedown of pennantclinching proportions , there is a counter thought to the widespread belief that no matter what they do in game 6 , cliff lee is guaranteed to turn them into a bunch of pinstriped bobblehead dolls in game 7 first , the yankees have to win friday at ballpark , where they again are scheduled to trot out against the immortal colby lewis far from a sure thing , given the outcome of game 2 , but not exactly the scaling of everest , either and if they can win game 6 , then the grand finale becomes something quite different than what had been advertised this week as the rangers bullied the yankees to the brink of extinction game 7 becomes as much about lee s head as his splendid left arm and zenlike control it becomes about his ability to carry a team that had never won a playoff series before this month across the threshold to the world series it becomes about him winning the game most people have decided he ca n't lose  good as lee has been , futile as the yankees were against him monday night , game 7 at home would not be an assignment you necessarily want to handicap with past performance emotions would be high the pressure at home would be enormous and most of it would fall on lee because the yankees were all but toetagged after losing on tuesday night we know that lee has never lost a postseason game in seven decisions we know that when you combine his numbers against the yankees with the phillies in the world series last year and with the rangers in this series , what you get is 30 , 24 innings , 15 hits and 5 earned runs allowed you get people saying why even bother , though none of them with the name of ron washington comfort \? he said after the rangers sprayed 13 hits around yankee stadium in game 5 , just never the big one you 're never comfortable because you never know what s going to happen from day to day a clich born of a million examples , and in this case heightened by the fact that the yankees are still the yankees , defending champions , and their only effective starter in this series would be lee s opponent yes , mark teixeira is gone but , who followed nick swisher s leadoff homer off c j wilson in the third inning with his fourth home run of the series , deserved to be hitting ahead of the slumping teixeira anyway the reservoir of talent that keeps expanding , like the universe , brought lance berkman s valuable bat and wood , who threw two scoreless innings wednesday and then passed on guessing how lee would feel if he had to pitch game 7 with all those expectations the way wood had to for the cubs in 2003 who do we get next , lewis \? yeah , lewis , he was told then we got lewis on friday , he said another clich , one game at a time , but he had already acknowledged that momentum can shift in a playoff series like the weather in fact , who is the upstart now as this one returns to texas the team with the 206 million payroll or the one that was in bankruptcy as recently as august \? lee , of course , has already pitched the rangers past the rays after the rangers had blown a 20 series lead but the rays are n't quite the yankees and the division series is n't the last texas twostep from the world series for a franchise that has never been there before we 've got to keep grinding , win the next one wood said the reward for winning game 6 would be a compelling psychodrama the next night , possibly a cliffhanger for the ages

paris prime minister of announced a few symbolic measures on monday to provide concrete results from france s bitterly contentious debate over national identity in a special cabinet meeting , mr fillon also threw the discussion , , to an experts committee of politicians and historians , bringing the debate to an end in its current public form mr fillon disclosed a set of new requirements that the french news media mocked as small measures designed to extract him from a discussion that appeared to lead nowhere except toward france s regional elections in march , in which the governing conservative party hopes to pull votes away from the far right mr fillon said that french schools will now be ordered to fly the french flag and to have a copy of the in every classroom there will be a form of young citizens' manual for students , and new citizens will have to speak better french , know more about the values of the republic and take part in a more solemn but undefined ceremony but the details were vague the emphasis will be put on the respect for the values of the republic , mr fillon said , notably the principle of equality between men and women , language aimed at the perception that muslim immigrants are suppressing women by forcing them to wear head scarves or veils the debate on national identity , fiercely defended by mr sarkozy , has been attacked by the opposition socialist party as aimed at immigrants , much like , which has produced much heat but few results so far there has been little discussion of expanding the idea of french identity to include the values and contributions of immigrants , but much oratory about the need to enforce existing norms and principles the minister of and national identity , eric besson , a former socialist , has led the debate , and it is viewed as having damaged his political prospects but the government said that more than 58 , 000 people have participated in the debate on an internet site mr fillon said that the debate would continue in various forms through the government s term and that mr sarkozy would make another speech on the subject in april nothing is worse and damaging than things unspoken and stigmas that we know have always played into the hands of extremists , mr fillon said , arguing that the debate over identity could not be left in the hands of the farright national front olivier le cour grandmaison , a historian , dismissed the initiatives as insignificant the mountain has given birth to a mouse , and none of these measures will change anything , quoted him as saying the crisis of national identity has been created by the government all this agitation is only an electioneering business the former socialist leader fran ois hollande said ironically on his blog that the whole debate has given birth to a commission , a device that he said clemenceau used , under the third republic , to mock governments that no longer knew what to do with their bad projects
ax 3 domaines , france with 568 punishing miles left in the , some riders finally accepted their fate sunday they would not win this race or even come in 2nd , 3rd or 10th some , possibly , may not even finish i just feel consistently mediocre , said the british rider bradley wiggins , the multiple olympic medal winner who finished fourth at last year s tour but he lost nearly four more minutes to the race leader , andy schleck , when the race ended sunday on a lush pyrenean mountaintop i have n't lived up to my expectations , but it s not a shock , said wiggins , who rides for team sky i just have n't got it the breaking point , both physically and psychologically , came for some riders , like wiggins , just as the race hit its hardest point after 15 days of racing at the tour , there are six days to go , including three stages in the pyrenees looming are two ascents up the daunting , where even the best riders have been known to crack yet the race s top riders , schleck and alberto contador , do not appear to be worried they rode to the finish line together , chatting as if on a casual weekend ride , without a victory in the world s most prestigious cycling race at stake twice on that final climb , contador had tried to attack schleck , to no avail at day s end , schleck remained in the yellow jersey , 31 seconds ahead of contador , the twotime tour champion samuel s nchez of spain is third , 2 31 back i feel really good , said schleck , who then referred to contador when he said , if he wants to get me tomorrow , he has to be really good while those riders were gearing up for the next few days , when the tour will probably be won or lost , christophe riblon of france took the chance to grab the spotlight sunday riblon , of the ag2r la mondiale team , was in a breakaway that formed about 19 miles into the 1146mile stage then one by one the other riders could not handle the pain and dropped back in the final miles of the stage , riblon looked around no other riders were there he was alone to enjoy the moment the fans , many waving spanish flags because of the finish line s proximity to spain , cheered him on i do n't know what to say i'm just too emotional , riblon said as he held back tears he is in 27th place over all , 23 29 behind schleck but nearly 20 minutes ahead of the most famous rider at the tour lance armstrong armstrong , the seventime tour winner , finished 70th in the stage , more than 15 minutes behind riblon in earlier stages , he crashed several times and lost his chances at an eighth tour victory now , each day he drops even more in the standings armstrong is now 38th , nearly 40 minutes behind schleck one of the riders he had shared the podium with last year \( schleck was second armstrong third \) on sunday , for yet another day , armstrong did not appear to be trying very hard as other riders zoomed past him he said he was conserving his energy to try to win a stage in what he says will be his final tour when the time comes for him to try to win a stage , armstrong said he would earn it i 've got 25 of 'em , armstrong said of his stage victories at the tour i do n't need somebody handing me one just 'cause they feel sorry for me wiggins , who started as one of the favorites , does not want pity , either he had no explanation for why he is faring much worse at this tour than he did last year , when he rode for the team that is now garmintransitions he left that squad to join the newly formed british team sky , as that team s and his country s best hope to win the tour last year was a fluke , wiggins said it was a fluke in that it was n't planned last season , he became garmin s team leader only after christian vande velde injured himself in a crash at the giro d'italia throughout the tour , wiggins a track cycling specialist just kept getting better and better for years , he had been known as being good at going fast on a track but , in what seemed like an instant , he finally figured out how to be a road racer he dropped so much weight that he looked like a stick figure , but it was worth it it became easier for him to motor up the climbs i fell into super form and was riding on a cloud the whole time , he said this year , though , wiggins had none of that magic in him on sunday , he realized that as the top riders accelerated up the mountain , he could not keep up looking tortured , he winced and gritted his teeth but he just could not pedal faster wiggins finished 36th , 4 59 behind the winner , and fell to 18th from 16th in the standings he is now 11 30 back from the lead , too far back to dream of matching last year s performance

augusta , ga the tough old golf course behind the gates at the augusta national golf club awoke in a bad mood friday the gloves came off , the scores went up and things got serious at the  the top of the leader board was ceded by the 50yearold and the 60yearold tom watson , who yielded to the years and a couple of tough britons ian poulter and lee westwood have been pounding on the major championship door for the last few years , and on friday they each stuck a foot inside poulter shot his second straight 68 westwood added a 69 to his opening 67 , and they are tied at eightunderpar 136 leads a group of five players that includes phil mickelson tied for third place , two strokes behind the leaders woods , who shot 70 , is casting a longer shadow than the tallest pine in amen corner in 10 of his 13 previous appearances as a professional in the masters , woods has bettered his 36hole result over the final two rounds , which ought to give poulter and westwood a little something to think about not that either of them are likely to be cowed by the prospect three years ago , poulter told the magazine golf world uk that when he finally reached his potential , it would be just him and tiger dominating the landscape after winning the wgcaccenture match play championship in tucson earlier this year , his first win in the united states , he has reached his potential , and if he were to win the masters , he would be right behind youknowwho sure , if i win this week , i 'll probably go no 2 , which would be lovely , poulter said with a smile so i guess it s a work in progress i'm working towards that so , we 'll see westwood , who finished a stroke behind at the at torrey pines in 2008 and a stroke out of the playoff at the 2009 british open at turnberry , now has the confident mien of a player who realizes just how good he is i know my game s up to the level it has to be , said the 36yearold westwood my long game s always been up to it and now i feel my short game is , as well , not that i had to use it too much today it is not bragging when you can do it , and had westwood not made one of his few bad swings of the day on the tee at the 14th setting up a doublebogey six he would have had the lead alone there is still a long way to go , and some noise could certainly be made from anyone in that group of five mickelson \( 71 \) , anthony kim \( 70 \) , k j choi \( 71 \) and ricky barnes \( 70 \) are all capable of going low if the conditions are right on friday , the conditions were not conducive to low scoring only 17 rounds were completed under par , 14 fewer than thursday none among the top 11 players improved on their firstround score couples shot 75 , owing in equal parts to a balky back and an uncooperative putter after that bogeyless 67 on thursday , watson shot 74 on friday all the warm and fuzzy stories about elderly players having their way with the place had to be tossed aside , along with the other two players in their 50s the 52yearold sandy lyle , who added an 86 to his opening 69 , and bernhard langer , also 52 , who shot 78 after a 71 both missed the cut youth , however , was served the italian amateur matteo manassero , 16 , became the youngest player in the history of the tournament to make the cut demonstrating his mettle , manassero made a 4foot downhill slider at the 18th hole to close out his 76 i'm very proud of this , manassero said , because i 've always been a player that played very straight and regular and miss some important putts for his part , woods chuckled ominously when he was asked if he likes his position after two rounds yeah , i do , he said yes mickelson said he felt the same way he said he thought the course was made more difficult by some of the nasty hole positions that greeted the players , along with a cool breeze out of the northeast and a high , bright sky i thought the pin placements were as lot more difficult and i knew it was going to be a lot harder to shoot in the 60s because it was going to be tough to get to them , mickelson said , adding that he like most strong players likes the conditions hard and fast i'm two back and feel i'm right on the cusp of having a good round , mickelson said i really feel like i'm putting the ball the way i want to as soon as some of those 1215 footers start dropping , i feel like i can have a round in the mid60s westwood and poulter are not likely to back down , so it might take something low to either shake them up or catch them saturday is normally moving day in professional golf , but the likelihood is that survival in this tournament will depend on some very selective aggression combined with some very good course management poulter said he believed he was ready to make this the kind of weekend he had been dreaming about since he made his remark two years ago about dominating the tour with woods many players and fans chuckled at his audacity then , but now poulter gets a chance to live his dream i mean , yeah ,

philadelphia a 49yearold stanley cup drought ended in a flood of anxiety patrick kane , the 21yearold winger , scored 4 minutes 6 seconds into overtime wednesday , lifting the over the , 43 , and giving chicago its first cup since 1961 the blackhawks had come up empty in five finals since their last cup victory until kane scored his third goal of the series it came suddenly on a shot from the bottom of the right circle that whizzed under the stick and pads of flyers goalie michael leighton many in the crowd at the wachovia center did not know that a goal had been scored until they saw kane and his teammates throw their sticks in the air in celebration no red light went on , and both teams had to wait several moments until the officials confirmed the goal after reviewing the replay and searching for the puck in the padding at the back of the net but kane did not need a review i shot , i saw it go right through the legs , sticking right under the pad in the net , he said i do n't think anyone saw it in the net i booked it to the other end i knew it was in i tried to sell the celebration a bit he added i think some guys were still kind of a little iffy to see if the puck was in the net i saw the coaches there pointing at the puck and jumping around it s pretty surreal right now for sure chicago coach joel quenneville described the view on the bench when it went in , i do n't think too many people knew it , he said but it made a funny strange sound like the back of the leather and the back of the net and i asked kaner where did it go in \? he said it went in long pad , five hole , in that area , he continued when they lifted up the net , when they went searching for the puck , it was underneath in there deep they lifted it up , it fell through we knew that was the winner the last time the blackhawks were champions , bobby hull and stan mikita were young chicago stars playing with curved sticks , glenn hall stood barefaced in the goal , and john f kennedy was president jonathan toews , the chicago captain , was named the winner of the conn smythe trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs he finished second in overall playoff scoring , but had played unevenly in the finals , with three assists and a minus5 mark nevertheless , he was a force on faceoffs throughout the series , winning 97 and losing only 52 , and for his preternatural leadership abilities this is the best feeling you can ever get playing hockey , and i just ca n't believe it s happening , toews said he and his teammates duncan keith and brent seabrook , both defensemen , won the stanley cup and olympic gold medals with team canada in february the trio joined ken morrow \( team usa and the islanders in 1980 \) , steve yzerman and brendan shanahan \( both canada and the red wings in 2002 \) in this exclusive club the cup drought was the second longest in league history , after the rangers' 54year sojourn in the wilderness , which ended in 1994 the blackhawks seemed to be hanging on for a narrow victory in the third period against a furious flyers attack , but they did not hold on in regulation philadelphia s scott hartnell scored with 3 59 left for his second goal of the night , sending the game to overtime but kane s goal , which came after the flyers had at least four clear chances at the chicago net in the extra session , made the road team winners for the first time in the series it was a victory typical of this series not well played , but exciting and unpredictable like the olympic gold medal game at vancouver in february , it ended memorably , in overtime john madden threw his gloves into a corner after kane scored , picked them up after he thought the goal might not count , then threw them again it was like we won two cups tonight , said madden , a former devils wing it was pretty weird flyers fans stood and saluted their resilient team , then booed loudly as the blackhawks paraded the cup around the ice the flyers had earned a berth in the playoffs on the last day of the regular season by winning a shootout against the rangers and were seemingly eliminated in the eastern conference semifinals , trailing the boston bruins by three games to none , and by 30 in game 7 in boston but the flyers rallied to become the third nhl team to win a bestofsevengame series after trailing by 03 the blackhawks , with a 177 shooting advantage , were the better team in the opening period , but the score was tied at the first intermission after dustin byfuglien and hartnell traded powerplay goals the blackhawks held the edge in play in the second period as well , outshooting the flyers by 106 but they fell behind when danny briere , the leading scorer of the finals , beat chicago goalie antti niemi on a play that started when keith tripped over hartnell s skate patrick sharp tied the score by finishing a fine passing play with a shot from 21 feet that beat leighton to the short side at 9 58 a soft goal , but not quite as soft as kane s overtime winner andrew ladd tipped in niklas hjalmarsson s shot at 17 43 , and the blackhawks were ahead by 32 entering the third period niemi , who had a shaky series , stopped 21 of 24 flyers shots and ended with an 882 series save percentage he became the first finnish goalie to backstop his team to a stanley cup leighton ended with 37 saves on 41 shots his save percentage in the series was 876 the flyers' line of hartnell , danny briere and ville leino was by far the best for either team in the series briere led the series in scoring with 3 goals and 10 assists for 13 points leino a rookie even though he is 26 and who had already been named the most valuable player in the finnish smliiga , europe s secondbest professional league had 7 goals and 14 assists for 21 points in the playoffs that tied him for the postseason rookie scoring record , set by dino ciccarelli of the minnesota north stars in 1981 it was the sixth straight final series that the flyers have lost that ties them with the maple leafs of 193340 and the red wings of 195695 for most consecutive finals lost at one point they ranked 29th in the 30team league , but peter laviolette , who won the stanley cup in 2006 with a lightly regarded carolina team , took over as coach in december it hurts a lot , said the flyers captain mike richards , who had a quiet finals at the end , they got the last bounce chicago s stan bowman , 36 , became the youngest general manager to win the cup the son of the legendary coach and manager scotty bowman , stan bowman was in his first year at the helm of the blackhawks it was also the first stanley cup for blackhawks coach joel quenneville , one of only three men to participate in at least 800 nhl games as both a player and a head coach his name is already engraved on the cup , from when he was an assistant with colorado in 1996 now it will be etched onto the silverware with the 2010 blackhawks the same is true of marian hossa , the first player to reach the stanley cup finals in three straight years with three different teams after losing with the penguins and the red wings the last two years , he finally won wednesday hossa was the first person toews passed the cup to what a relief , hossa said i'm so happy to finally do this on the ice after the game , the blackhawks and their family , friends and fans celebrated as 2010 was added to the club s previous cup victories , in 1961 , '38 and '34 kane , whose summer was marked by controversy when he and a cousin pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after they got into a latenight dispute over a fare with a buffalo cab driver , ended the season in glory , with the 16th overtime goal to win the stanley cup on the ice he was being horsecollared by his jubilant friends and showed the television audience his famous cousin got to shout out to my people back in buffalo , my hometown , kane said i have four buddies who drove all the way to come out here my five family members three sisters , three beautiful sisters my mom and dad what a feeling , i ca n't believe it we just won the stanley cup
ah , democracy by the bay mayor gavin newsom s office said it was peppered by 60 or so calls earlier this week , largely from entertainment industry workers , clubgoers and sundry creative types from the south of market district , complaining that heavyhanded police officers have been stifling their neighborhood s right to party dozens of people dialed in from a phone booth in front of city hall the wooden structure with tinted panes , magenta cushions and a laptop with voiceoverip phone service was put up several days earlier , by ani niow and mat heitel , two soma residents officials under the dome shook their heads in disbelief just three days earlier , a shooting outside a north beach nightclub prompted a san francisco chronicle columnist to argue for a course what some supervisors and the mayor say they are already considering giving police more power to crack down on rowdy entertainment the mayor has always supported a vibrant night life scene in san francisco , said tony winnicker , mr newsom s spokesman but after a violent club shooting that left one person dead , it hardly seems the right time to focus on relaxing club restrictions and who s the most fun the organized dialaprotest , in so many ways , offered an immediate nibble of topsyturvy , san francisco civic theater but it also was part of a larger political script , with subplots that could play out throughout this election year the complaints on tuesday were centered on a particular police officer , larry bertrand , who has been accused of unfairly confiscating computers and sound systems from disc jockeys at underground warehouse parties both alternative weeklies in the city have been covering the story extensively it is all part of a larger campaign to rein in the police department at the curbside level , the police and state regulators have clamped down more firmly both on legal venues and on illegal parties , while the entertainment industry and its followers seemed to be enjoying a political renaissance  their organizers have also formed a statewide coalition , the california music and culture association , to put pressure on the state s alcoholic beverage control agency and they have apparently anointed debra walker , a longtime resident and artist who has been making the rounds at community gatherings in recent weeks , as their champion it was ms walker who proposed the shockandawe assault on the mayor s telephone lines deb walker has already shown her allegiance to help us and make sure the creative culture in san francisco is represented , said skot kuiper , the organizer of a coalition of illegal warehouse dwellers in soma who hope to gain some political muscle but coming out as someone who supports entertainment , you leave yourself vulnerable to attack not that ms walker is particularly vulnerable she is a leading contender in the heated race for the district 6 supervisor seat , which should require just 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 votes to secure , political observers say chris daly , the incumbent , is termlimited and must relinquish the seat this year for a candidate seeking to represent a constituency that loves to strike a pose of edgy independence , ms walker is firmly rooted in the political establishment a painter who has worked out of soma for 25 years , ms walker has advanced herself in the san francisco democratic party , most recently serving as treasurer on the central committee she is also vice chair of the state party s women s caucus in a brief interview , she said she has the support of aaron peskin , the former supervisor and influential chairman of the central committee she sounded sanguine about her attempts to win over john l burton , the chairman of the statewide democrats i m trying to get the support of everybody , ms walker said you have to know how things work , who the players are , how to get support , how to get initiatives started a cursory look at campaign finance records also suggests that ms walker is leading in fundraising she said she has raised more than 50 , 000 in her two campaigns this year for reelection to the central committee and the supervisor race she named two other women , theresa sparks , the former police commission president and jane kim , the vice president of the board of education , as her main challengers so when ms walker , a few weeks ago , sat in on the meeting of soma residents seething about the police department and then pitched the idea of calling the mayor , she happened upon an ardent grassroots network that was already in place and presented a cause over the next few weeks , more than 1 , 300 people received a facebook invitation to the call the mayor day event \( subtitled gavin newsom , we have your number \) as advertised , the invite provided phone , fax and email contact information for mr newsom ms walker s name was prominently included in the invitation as the originator of the idea aides in city hall said none of the calls reached the mayor , but staff took down the complaints and redirected further issues to the office of neighborhood services mostly , they shrugged quizzically it was a good chance to raise her profile , joe arellano , a deputy spokesman for the mayor , said of ms walker

laredo , tex the other children in his middleclass suburb teased him by calling him barbie because of his looks , which reminded them of a ken doll the name stuck , and three decades later it would become associated with sadistic gangland slayings few people who knew edgar valdez villarreal back when he was a squarejawed football star at united high school here would have pegged him as likely to become one of s most feared and savage drug leaders none of the clich d roots of crime could be seen is his youth no broken home , no abusive father , no poverty instead , his father was a shop owner in downtown laredo who emphasized church , hard work and the value of a college education he grew up in a wellappointed brick home with a wooden swing set in the backyard most of his siblings went to college and started businesses , becoming the sort of lawabiding people who are the mortar of society , neighbors and relatives said he chose that road , said his older brother , abel valdez jr we are a good family the authorities in the united states and mexico say mr valdez , who is 37 , moved to mexico after being indicted in the 1990s on charges of dealing , and rose quickly to become a violent leader in the beltr nleyva gang , at the helm of a corps of gunmen engaged in almost constant warfare with other cartels he is the only american citizen known to have moved so high in the command structure of the mexican cartels five years ago , mr valdez played a key role in the battle between the sinaloa cartel and the gulf cartel for control over the lucrative i35 smuggling route into the united states , the drug enforcement administration says he is also believed to be the person most responsible for pushing that conflict into central and southern mexico , taking over the city of acapulco last week , mr valdez was captured by dozens of federal police officers after a firefight at a rustic house in the mountains northwest of mexico city he had eluded the authorities for years despite having multimilliondollar bounties on his head , and his capture was considered a major blow to the remnants of the beltr nleyva organized crime group , law enforcement officials said for months , mr valdez had been fighting for control of the gang since its leader and his mentor , arturo beltr n leyva , was killed in a gun battle with the mexican marines last december in cuernavaca , just south of the capital the internecine struggle had pitted mr valdez against mr beltr n leyva s brother , hector more than 150 people have died in the struggle , many of them mutilated or beheaded and left with grisly messages for the other side in videotaped statements to the mexican police , mr valdez said that he managed a smuggling route from panama to mexico and that he transported cash in tractortrailers back from the united states he also admitted that he had ties to many of mexico s most wanted drug lords , including joaqu n guzm n , who has emerged from the last three years of gangland warfare as the most powerful cartel leader in mexico mr valdez faces three indictments in the united states in atlanta , where the most recent charges were filed , he stands accused of smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine from 2004 to 2006 , shipping it through laredo in tractortrailers and then sending the millions in cash back the same way kent a schaffer , a houston lawyer representing mr valdez , said his client denied all the charges against him mr schaffer also said mr valdez was probably coerced into making the videotaped statements mr valdez got his start in crime as a petty marijuana dealer in laredo in the early 1990s , but he was never arrested on drug charges , according to the webb county sheriff s office and the laredo police department there were signs , however , that the affable linebacker on the united high school football team had a wild side arrests for drunken driving and public drunkenness in 1992 , near the end of his senior year , he was arrested on a charge of criminally negligent homicide after he drove his pickup down the wrong side of a road and collided headon with a middle school guidance counselor , killing him the charge was later dropped after graduation , mr valdez turned down an offer from his father to attend college , saying he wanted to make money , his brother said according to a federal indictment in laredo , the next year he joined a group of smugglers who were moving hundreds of pounds of mexican marijuana through laredo to cities in massachusetts and missouri his brother said mr valdez fled across the river into nuevo laredo in 1998 to avoid arrest , opened a small shop and never lived in the united states again detectives in laredo say he quickly became affiliated with a local gang known as los chachos , one of four groups that controlled the city s drug trade in those days over the next years , the gulf cartel and its commandos , the zetas , moved into nuevo laredo and started taking over the drug and extortion rackets from local gangs mr valdez was sucked up into the conflict abel valdez said his brother deeply resented the zeta s tactic of killing family members of their enemies and extorting enormous amounts from local businesses mr valdez joined in the fight against them partly in selfdefense , and he has been battling them ever since , his brother said i'm not saying he s an angel , abel valdez said he s done things that are not legally right , but he has principles los chachos eventually lost control of the border town to the zetas , who still control it , and mr valdez threw his lot in with arturo beltr n leyva , one of four major leaders in the sinaloa cartel , law enforcement officials said mr valdez told the mexican police this week that he first met mr beltr n leyva when he sought help in arranging a meeting with the head of the gulf cartel , osiel cardenas mr valdez wanted to plead with mr cardenas to instruct the zetas not to kill him by 2003 , mr valdez had been placed in charge of mr beltr n leyva s squads of hitmen , known as los negros , law enforcement officials say and a year later , he took over the gang s operations in acapulco , eventually pushing the zetas of the gulf cartel out of the city with a bloody campaign that included beheadings and grenade attacks on police stations , mexican officials said his rise was spectacularly rapid , and owed not only to his contacts in the united states , but to his brutality taking a page from middle eastern terrorists , he was willing to use beheadings , videos of killings and corpses to send messages he seems to be a pretty bright kid and very brutal and ruthless , said scott stewart , an analyst with the stratfor security consulting firm in austin , tex , who tracks mexican drug violence in a period of cartel warfare , the enforcers will tend to rise in the organization
one of the few positives for the this season has been the surprising performance of hisanori takahashi , the japanese lefthander who signed a minor league contract in february and developed into one of the team s most versatile players though he is technically a rookie , the 35yearold is one of the only mets who can become a free agent on oct 31 , and there is a distinct chance he may end up elsewhere in 2011 has enjoyed his time with the mets , but probably sees himself as a starting pitcher and may opt to sign with a club that can assure him he would have that role like any player , he would also prefer the longest deal possible he has obviously established himself in the major leagues , said peter greenberg , takahashi s agent he liked it in new york and would love the chance to take the next step here but we 'll have to wait until the season ends to sit down with him to see what he s thinking for next year as far as if he has a preference to any particular role , greenberg said of takahashi , who has been a starter , setup reliever and closer for the mets no negotiations have taken place between takahashi and the mets and none are expected until after the season meanwhile , the mets know there is a risk they may lose him we 've been very happy with him , general manager omar minaya said he s done everything we 've asked of him , and he s shown the ability to pitch in new york i'm sure we 'll sit down after the season and , hopefully , we can work something out takahashi earned 1 million this year plus performance bonuses when he was negotiating with teams last winter he was not able to get a guaranteed contract so he signed with the mets , but insisted on an escape clause at the end of one season , confident that he would prove his value the contract has a provision that says he can become a free agent either 10 days after the mets' last game , or on oct 31 , whichever comes later since the second date is far more likely , there could be a fourweek window in which the mets will have exclusive negotiating rights takahashi has an 86 record with a 395 earned run average and is 2 for 2 in save opportunities as a starter he is 44 with a 501 era , including two excellent games against the yankees and a couple of stinkers as a reliever , he is 42 with a 234 era

during the season cbs took over complete ownership in january 1973 , a syndicate headed by steinbrenner bought the team under cbs , houk had a free hand on the field while lee macphail handled the frontoffice duties but steinbrenner let houk know how he felt things should be done and was overheard making derogatory comments about some of the players houk quit on the final day of the 1973 season

was in command as kubek put it in sixtyone , a remembrance of the 1961 season , written with terry pluto none of us questioned ralph he was the major
after opening in november to some of the best reviews of the theater season , the off broadway production of the orphans' home cycle seemed on a fast track for broadway three of new york s most prominent play producers began trying to raise 25 million to move the show , even though its length \( nine hours , broken into three parts \) and lack of star performers made it an iffy investment for commercial broadway but the producers thought the show , the final opus of the acclaimed writer horton foote , had a good shot at tony awards which go only to broadway productions and they believed that a wide audience would want to see the work , given the huge demand for tickets at its 160seat off broadway house yet orphans did not go to broadway this winter the obstacle ended up not being money , the show s running time or its cast of nonames we could n't get the right theater , one of its producers , daryl roth , said in january when the decision was made \( her team is now aiming for the fall \) real estate is really difficult to come by on broadway these days and it s too bad , because some great shows are n't being seen broadway has 40 theaters , and hunting for an available one has become an increasingly competitive sport for starters , 15 or so are routinely locked up with longrunning shows like the phantom of the opera , which has kept the majestic theater off the market for 22 years for the remaining theaters the edge goes to shows that have the makings of a smash hit because of their pedigree , their stars or their originality , like billy elliot the musical and a steady rain , which starred hugh jackman and daniel craig those productions were both hotly pursued by philip j smith , chairman of the shubert organization , broadway s biggest theater owner , who said in a recent interview that he shuffled around other shows to secure prime theaters for billy and steady rain because he sensed they would be huge moneymakers as proved true in a twist , some theaters have to go vacant for long stretches while they wait for these presumed blockbusters to come in the hilton theater has been empty since january 2009 waiting for spiderman turn off the dark , the muchdelayed musical that is now expected late this year the neil simon theater has been dark since this past january , when ragtime closed earlier than hoped due to poor ticket sales that theater is now waiting for love never dies , the sequel to phantom that has been delayed until the spring of 2011 a result , according to theater producers as well as owners , is an uphill climb for plays like orphans and some musicals seeking an open broadway stage which , in turn , determines the shows and actors that audiences have a chance to see i 've never seen it more competitive , or the supplyanddemand imbalance more stark , said mr smith , whose shubert group owns 17 theaters for the next broadway season , which begins after labor day 2010 , we do n't have a single theater available not one everything is committed , and several theaters already have one or two backup shows if a commitment falls through tom hulce , a lead producer of the new musical american idiot , echoed mr smith as he described the waiting process to see if the st james theater his first choice would be available this spring the revival of the musical finian s rainbow opened there in october to strong reviews but struggled to sell tickets and ended up closing in midjanuary none of us wanted 'finian s' to fail , but we were also really hoping for the st james , mr hulce said american idiot opened at the st james two weeks ago whether you can get your first , second , thirdchoice theater or any theater has just become totally unpredictable among the factors on the supply side is the lack of new space thirtyone broadway theaters were built between 1910 and 1930 , but only five theaters opened between 1930 and 1990 and five were either built or reopened since two decades ago plenty of theaters went dark for long stretches , while others started to host blockbuster musicals cats , les mis \? bles and phantom in the 1980s miss saigon , beauty and the beast , chicago and the lion king in the '90s and mamma mia ! , wicked and jersey boys in the last decade on the demand side there is greater investor interest in broadway , where box office revenues topped 1 billion for the first time last year , and has been remarkably resilient even during the great recession this season celebrities like elton john \( next fall \) , will smith \( fela ! \) and candy spelling \( promises , promises \) are producing on broadway far more people with lower profiles are looking to produce or be handsoff major investors as well the high costs of producing off broadway and at regional theaters have only reduced outoftown tryouts for shows ultimately it s broadway where art , critical adulation , awards and profits mix to maximum effect
los angeles when anze kopitar arrived in edmonton for a game this season , he was leading the nhl in scoring so after the doors to the visiting locker room swung open , he got the royal treatment , a center for the , quickly found himself at the center of about 25 cameramen and reporters for a morning skate when kopitar returns home , to the united states' secondlargest media market , he can count on a more intimate audience it often consists of a single newspaper reporter , a handful of bloggers and , once in a great while , a television crew for a game we 're a little under the radar here , dustin brown , the kings' captain , said as he recounted the scene in edmonton the nhl season has moved beyond the midpoint , and kopitar and the kings are writing one of its more interesting stories having last reached the playoffs in 2002 , the kings with budding young stars like kopitar , defenseman drew doughty and goaltender jonathan quick are in the thick of the western conference playoff chase they entered thursday night s game against detroit with a , and their 53 points placed them tied for sixth in the tightly bunched conference any questions about their staying power were seemingly answered in the last week with impressive wins against the division leaders washington and san jose their monday at san jose gave the kings a 301 record against a team that carried an eightgame winning streak and the best record in the nhl into the game the question surrounding the kings is whether anyone cares years of losing and mismanagement and the lockout of 20045 have dented the fan base , but there are others who have lost interest , too the los angeles times , until recently , rarely traveled with the team , a circumstance that prompted the kings to hire a to cover the team for its web site when the kings left last month for a threegame trip to canada , they were in first place in the conference in december for the first time since 1991 but none of the games were televised back home and when the kings have been on television , their audience is shrinking ratings are down 21 percent from a year ago at the same time , to 17 , 000 households per game on fox sports net affiliates if sports talk radio is a barometer of buzz , the kings cannot get a word in edgewise at least not with the uncertain state of pau gasol s hamstring or news that matt kemp is rihanna it s not a hockey market , for sure , said ryan smyth , the veteran left wing who spent most of his in edmonton the rugged , hardworking , goodintheroom smyth was the marquee offseason acquisition for the kings , and the antithesis of the type of big move the kings have made in their 41year history mostly , the motivation has been q ratings the acquisition of wayne gretzky worked out famously , as did that of marcel dionne but picking up pasttheirprime players like jeremy roenick and ron duguay was more the norm the kings , who did not hold onto a firstround draft pick until their 10th season , now have a team built through the draft general manager dean lombardi , in his fourth season , has astutely assembled his team from within defenseman jack johnson , acquired as a minor leaguer , and kopitar are 22 , doughty is 20 , quick is 23 , and brown is 25 the promising forward wayne simmonds , who has 10 goals , is 21 johnson , quick and brown will play for the united states in the olympics , and doughty was chosen for the canadian team coach terry murray , who last year replaced the fiery marc crawford , has brought a backtobasics approach and a professorial bent to the bench he is more likely to use chalk to diagram a play than to throw it across the room the kings tightened up their defense considerably last season if that meant struggling to score goals , that was ok because they went from 28th in the league in shots allowed to fourth now they are second the kings' emergence mirrors that of , who was expected to be a placeholder until jonathan bernier , the kings' no 1 pick in 2006 , was ready quick has ensured that there is no hurry in 86 career games , he has a 255 goals against average already making him their best goalie since felix potvin left in 2003 for a long time , it s been , do they have that goaltender \? said mark hardy , a former kings defenseman and longtime assistant coach when your goalie is at the top of his game , it has a very calming effect on your team it s very hard to go out there and play the game when you 're always worried about making a mistake taking all this in is luc robitaille , the who is now the kings' president for business operations he , like hardy , is one of the few people in the organization who date to the kings' period of relevance during the gretzky years when the kings made their run to the stanley cup finals in 1993 , it was a time when the lakers were between reigns , the dodgers and the university of southern california football were intermittent contenders , and the rams and the raiders were preparing to skip town tom hanks , sylvester stallone , goldie hawn and kevin costner were regulars at kings games even ronald reagan showed up on occasion that s always in the back of my head , robitaille said people say it s a basketball town , but if it was , more people would go see the clippers it s about winning robitaille said there were subtle signs that the kings were catching on their was 19th in the 30team league , but was up slightly from last season the team is distributing 35 percent fewer free tickets than it did a year ago , and has sold 1 , 000 more season tickets than a year ago , he said a sellout is expected thursday night when the kings open an eightgame homestand against detroit how many more follow may be up to the kings themselves i think the fans are anxious to get on board , but they 're still leery , said sean o 'donnell , the 38yearold defenseman who started his career with the kings in the gretzky era and returned last season they do n't want to totally push all their chips in yet the fans want to come to playoff games , they want to see us moving in the right direction , but it s been awhile they 're a little gunshy yet
john quiggin , who has a book in progress on zombie economics ideas that should be dead , but aren t worries about the extent to which , with undeniable green shoots now appearing , the zombie ideas i ve written about are clawing their way through the softening soil and walking among us again i have the same impression now that we seem to have avoided a full replay of the great depression , a large part both of the economics profession and of the political establishment seems ready to pretend that none of it happened
\( and check out the version by cowriter , carole king \) in the final moments of versus postgame show wednesday night , former defenseman and stanley cup champion brian engblom spoke the words that are the most fitting epitaph for the 200910 washington capitals when he said , a long time ago i learned you have to be able to play more than one way someone s always got the antidote and in the final moments of a segment of the nhl network s on the fly program , host dan pollard asked rhetorically , does anyone have rj umberger s phone number \? it was columbus forward umberger who ignited a small controversy in march by saying the washington capitals play the wrong way and would be eliminated by a defensiveoriented team all that came to pass wednesday night in 21 game 7 upset victory by the eighth seededcanadiens over the president s trophy winning capitals \( dave caldwell s times story here \) the caps only knew one way to win , through their great individual talents , and the canadiens had the antidote it started with better goaltending , of course , and jaro halak s play in games 5 , 6 and 7 deserves a place in stanley cup lore he stopped 131 of 134 shots taken by the best offensive team in the world it continued with better defense , and jacques martin adroitly deployed hal gill and josh gorges especially to shut down the caps big guns , even splitting them up on the road so that he could always get one on the ice when bruce boudreau put out alexander ovechkin and nicklas backstrom in contrast , mike green , the caps high scoring norris trophy candidate , struggled all series to score and took a silly game 7 penalty that resulted in montreal s first goal canadiens superiority on special teams also neutralized washington the habs penalty kill worked 32 of 33 times , their power play scored 6 goals in 30 chances gill was exceptional on the penalty kill as a shot blocker as were all the canadiens and boudreau could n't figure out that ovechkin needed to be stationed on the other side of the ice on the power play , away from gill , so the large , fearless canadiens defenseman would n't be in ovie s path to the net boudreau s onedimensional approach to the series also cost him when he stayed far too long with an ineffective alexander semin the coach could have demoted the semin off the top two lines , or even sit him in the press box in favor of the less skillful , but gritty scott walker , the only guy on his roster with a cup ring and a healthy scratch until game 7 so the caps did n't make adjustments , nor could they elevate their game , which the playoffs require especially when faced with adversity boudreau was unhappy , for example , that ovechkin s third period goal was waved off on a goalie interference call against mike knuble knuble did make contact with halak in the crease and this close call could have gone either way but boudreau is also right when he admitted , it feels like you 're whining to question the call every team is victimized by a close call , even a bad call , on occasion it s how teams respond to it that matters most the caps did n't really respond the bigger issue is that this was supposedly the best team in hockey if they were , why were they even in a game 7 losing by a goal to a team that finished 33 points behind them \? the caps had other chances to tie the game , none better than backstrom s with two minutes remaining , only to be foiled by gorges diving deflection \( video \) , a play symbolic of the extra gear the canadiens found that the caps never did sean gordon in the globe and mail summarized this exemplary team effort , writing , they dove in front of pucks , they jumped up to swarm rushes , they stepped in to close off passing lanes , and where they failed , their magnificent netminder bailed them out it s funny how teams so often manage to live up to their identities the canadiens are perceived as hockey s royal franchise and seem to regularly find new glorious chapters to write in their unmatched history in reality , this version of the habs bears little resemblance to the legendary teams of earlier eras although , to be fair , this version has n't finished writing its latest chapter and the capitals at the outset an nhls laughing stock , then intermittently a contender in the days of rod langway and mike gartner , and later during the peter bondraollie kolzig period before the illfated jaromir jagr experiment are considered perennial failures , never able to fulfill whatever dreams they have or their fans have for them it does n't matter who they have on their team when it really , really counts , they just do n't get it done caps fan rob darnell told zach berman of the washington post after game 7 we always felt like there was some kind of curse about the team the caps always got beat by pittsburgh then , they got jagr , and they could n't make the playoffs so , they have a knack for being the best team or whatever , making the playoffs going to the end , and just never get it done
those who have followed the debate over the risks of sports concussions nodded knowingly monday when its most significant legal action to date was brought by a woman eleanor perfetto s worker s compensation claim on behalf of her husband , , asserted that his earlyonset dementia was an occupational hazard of his seven seasons as a lineman in the having heard league officials say for years that high rates of dementia in former players either did not exist or could not be ascribed to football , perfetto , who has a phd in public health , said she wanted to end all doubt in the courts perfetto , who declared herself one very pushy broad while last october , is one of six women from diverse backgrounds who have redirected the discussion of brain trauma they range from players' family members to a former team president , from a congresswoman to a leading neuropathologist there is a sense of what is she doing here \? she does n't belong , ' said representative , democrat of california , whose blunt criticism of the nfl s concussion policies during last fall s congressional hearing in league protocol people underestimate you , and it makes you very powerful that s something that s afoot here with these women the nfl is so male and macho and testosteronedominated , i do n't think they figured that women were going to be a force to be reckoned with in this thing , and they 're finding out the hard way dr ann mckee , a at boston university school of medicine , has been the primary doctor to identify traumainduced damage in the brains of former players , and to dispassionately connect that damage to football gay culverhouse , the former president of the tampa bay buccaneers , not only blistered the league s playing down those findings before congress , but also began a foundation to assist players in need the eloquent personal appeals of sylvia mackey , the wife of the former nfl tight end who was almost bankrupted by his earlyonset dementia , persuaded the league and the union to start an assistance plan for families like theirs and much of the recent reform to concussion management which extends to state legislatures covering high school sports might never have been made without the efforts of kwana pittman , a niece of andre waters , the former nfl safety who killed himself in 2006 reluctant relatives to allow an analysis of waters s brain tissue , and the finding of rampant damage made football s concussion problem national news in recent interviews about their roles in the evolving discussion of football brain trauma , none of the six women condemned the sport , and most called themselves fans just with a dash of compassion and clarity as culverhouse put it men look at the violence and they say , oh , yeah ! ' when someone gets hurt , women say , oh , no ! ' women have long shuddered at football s inherent brutality in november 1909 , a new jersey football game between montclair military academy and montclair high school was canceled just before kickoff the new york times later wrote , the mother of nearly every one of the high school s team had visited principal h w dutsch and informed him that if he permitted the game to be played and their sons were injured , they should hold him personally responsible responsibility is what pittman also sought after her uncle s suicide she had watched waters , her mother s brother , transform from upbeat and playful to profoundly depressed in only a few years before he shot himself in the head in november 2006 grieving , she received a startling call a few weeks later from chris nowinski , a former harvard football player and professional wrestler looking into the effects of concussions nowinski asked her if researchers could examine pieces of waters s brain i took some biology courses and i was interested in anatomy , so that helped , i think , said pittman , a middle school teacher in west palm beach , fla my family and i , we could n't understand why uncle andre did this we wanted some answers , and chris promised that it would help people i wanted to keep this from happening to other families nowinski said she could have hung up the phone she could have not followed through by convincing her family to sign off on it but kwana really came through , and it changed everything waters was the third former nfl player to have his brain identified with chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a degenerative disease whose only known cause is repetitive trauma but it was his death , and the subsequent finding of trauma , that produced headlines and catalyzed debate mckee was not involved in the waters case but was immediately drawn to the study of football brain trauma she grew up a rabid green bay packers fan in appleton , wis , idolizing the star safety willie wood , who now has dementia with two older brothers who were star football players , she recalled i used to play football in the summers i used to run the tires with the guys during practice i remember being told i should have been a boy now one of the nation s leading neuropathologists , mckee was approached by nowinski s group to examine football players' brains one pleasure of the otherwise ghoulish process , she said , was speaking to the players' widows and helping them understand better what had happened to their husbands the tissue teaches us , mckee said the men are not alive , but there s a sense of existence i do feel like john mchale , john grimsley , wally hilgenberg , these men are still speaking to us i help them explain things to their wives culverhouse is speaking to her father , in a way , by criticizing how the nfl has handled the concussion debate she described her father , hugh , as the typical nfl owner of his era in football for glory and money and male fraternity , she said , with no regard for the players' health culverhouse said she saw players shot with cortisone on the sideline and routinely sent back on the field after serious concussions i think my father made some very poor choices i'm embarrassed for the choices he made , culverhouse said asked if she felt guilty , she said none of us knew what was going on , really now i 'll stand in front of a truck to make things right her foundation , the , has identified two dozen former players whom she is helping to fill out disability paperwork one of those players , the former tight end , said with a laugh , her daddy would slap her while culverhouse and perfetto have been vocal from the outside , has taken a more conciliatory tone from inside the nfl s innermost circles partly because john mackey was a union leader , she has always known management well today she considers herself friends with commissioner roger goodell and his wife , jane she sat with them and gen david h petraeus at the in 2009 the 88 plan , the nfl s dementia assistance program begun in february 2007 and named after john mackey s uniform number , derived from sylvia mackey s letter to the former commissioner paul tagliabue in which she pleaded for help with her husband s slow , deteriorating , ugly , caregiverkilling , degenerative , braindestroying tragic horror in dozens of interviews , she has always expressed gratitude for the plan without criticizing the nfl , complementing perfetto s more pointed activism i love eleanor it fits her personality , not mine , said mackey , who considered filing a worker s compensation claim for her husband a few years ago she said the papers remained in a desk drawer , blank when you 're fighting a fight , or you 're trying to win fair benefits and recognition , you need different types of people on different roads going for the same thing , mackey said i feel i get more with sugar than with vinegar but we need her personality on our side perfetto s personality is summed up in i do n't care if the commissioner of the nfl is mad at me she has watched men defer to the nfl s power structure from their own playing days and dreams but the wives of players with dementia regard their relationship with football as personal after husbands live the dreams , the wives live the nightmares but what if men were to find that a woman s product cosmetics , for example were dangerous \? would the husbands fight for change as passionately \? i do n't think so , said perfetto , a senior policy director at pfizer i think it s the way women handle health issues if it were all women who were sick , it would probably be a lot of women taking care of them that s kind of how health issues are handled in our society in a congressional hearing regarding football head injuries last october , mckee , culverhouse and perfetto provided some of the most compelling testimony , and sanchez made many of the most damning remarks toward the nfl meanwhile , representative lamar s smith , republican of texas , played down the scientific findings that led to the hearing representative ted poe , another texas republican , rued the end of football as we know it sitting in her congressional office months later , after the nfl and many state legislatures had adopted rules to make football safer , sanchez smiled in some instances , you have to be the outsider to be the

as hall of famers , jerry rice and emmitt smith represent a rebuke to the stopwatches and tape measures that are wielded every year at the combine and predraft pro days their induction saturday was a victory for those who evaluate players by watching games or by watching tapes of those games smith and rice fell out of the top 15 in their drafts primarily because of concerns about their speed \( also in smith s case , his size \) smith went 17th and rice 16th , and it was a testament to the smarts of the men running the drafts of the cowboys \( jimmy johnson \) and the 49ers \( bill walsh \) that the teams traded up to get each player charean williams , the startelegram emmitt smith became a dallas cowboy for a simple reason he couldn t run he was too small , measuring 5foot8 and weighing 190 pounds he was too slow , having run 40 yards in 455 seconds during his pro day at florida smith and rice weren t the fastest guys for their positions , but they were the most driven , the most ambitious , the most competitive how do you measure that \? if you could , you d have something \( the wonderlic measures learning and problemsolving , not will \) at a young age , smith wrote out preposterous goals  rick gosselin of the dallas morning news but smith has a bust on display in the hall of fame today because of what you couldn t see he possessed an intangible gift an indomitable will to succeed smith aspired to become the nfl s alltime leading rusher at an early age and drove himself to that height rice was never relaxed , never satisfied the transcript of rice s induction speech is worth examining here are a few excerpts i m here to tell you that the fear of failure is the engine that has driven me throughout my entire life it flies in the faces of all these sports psychologists who say you have to let go of your fears to be successful and that negative thoughts will diminish performance but not wanting to disappoint my parents , and later my coaches , teammates and fans , is what pushed me to be successful i wasn t the most physical or the fastest receiver in the nfl , but they never clocked me on the way to the end zone the reason nobody caught me from behind is because i ran scared that old fear of failure again but if i have a single regret about my career standing here today , it s that i never took the time to enjoy it i swear to god , this is true because i was always working right after the season , whether we won the super bowl or not , i would take two weeks off and go right back to training the doubts , the struggles is who i am , and i wonder if i would have been as successful without them extra point in a previous thread , several readers mentioned that smith was not in barry sanders s class as a running back gosselin of the dallas morning news polled a list of experts , none of whom had smith listed among the top five backs but doesn t that still make smith s achievements remarkable \? yes , he had better blocking and a better team but he didn t have nearly the socalled measurables , and he got more out of his ability than sanders
st louis tony la russa had just landed here wednesday night after a dreary road trip that pushed his eight games behind the cincinnati reds in the standings it was a bitter disappointment for la russa , who had every reason to retreat until the next game on friday but la russa responded to a reporter s message because he wanted to talk about the man who runs the team he is chasing in the national league central such is his admiration for walt jocketty , the former general manager of the cardinals who has shaped the in 15 years you would have to look long and hard to find someone that does n't like and respect walt and there s a difference , la russa said people like him because he s a good man , but they respect him because he s honest the reason he makes deals is he is n't hiding information he gives value and he receives value , so both sides prosper and want to make another deal well , sometimes kevin towers , the former san diego general manager , laughs when he talks about jocketty , whose cardinals beat his padres three times in the playoffs some of the worst trades i 've ever made were with walt , towers said he s the one guy , every time we made a trade i 'd end up saying you know what \? this is not going to be good' i always tell him , the only one i ever won on you was for , and the only reason i won that deal was because jackson retired and fernando did n't' at 59 , jocketty has been around long enough to have traded icons of the 1980s like valenzuela he is upbeat by nature , and players call him approachable and calm but only one general manager is older jack zduriencik of the seattle mariners , by a month and jocketty came to baseball through some of the game s most colorful characters as a boy in minnesota , jocketty created teams by playing the dice game he pitched in high school and junior college but entered the pros as an eager jobseeker at the 1974 winter meetings in new orleans jocketty worked for the chicago white sox' class aaa affiliate in des moines , where he first met la russa and spoke a few times with the pioneering owner bill veeck then he worked for the oakland athletics and the maverick  the man from those years with the most lasting influence on jocketty , the one who encouraged his defining character trait , was , of all people , billy martin jocketty was 29 in 1980 when finley hired him to direct the oakland farm system martin , the tactical wizard and tortured soul who managed the a s , took a liking to him by then , finley was long past his days of mechanical rabbits and designated runners and his eponymous mule mascot he was rarely around he had hired jocketty by phone and sold the team in 1981 martin persuaded the new owners to keep jocketty , reinforcing the importance of loyalty within an organization jocketty s farm system produced three rookies of the year that decade , helping oakland win three pennants and the 1989 championship la russa managed those teams , and in 1996 jocketty hired him in st louis , winning another title 10 years later la russa said jocketty created an environment where a manager works with the boss , not for him jocketty inherited dusty baker as the ' manager , but baker said they had a similar relationship he does n't usually rush into decisions , baker said his favorite saying when he s thinking about something he 'll just comment , that s interesting' i'm like , to myself , was it really , or are you just stalling \? ' but we run things by each other the coaches , too we do n't always agree , but i like to have people around me who do n't always agree jocketty is working on the same timetable in cincinnati that he had in st louis the cardinals hired him in late 1994 , and in his second full season they made the playoffs this is his second full season with the reds the reds' owner , bob castellini , was a cardinals investor while jocketty was there he bought the reds in 2006 and hired jocketty in an advisory role two years later , after the cardinals promoted a younger executive , john mozeliak , to replace him in april 2008 , jocketty was named general manager of a team with fading fan support and no winning seasons since going 8577 in 2000 we needed to change the culture , jocketty said there was a culture here , i believe , that they never really thought about winning they were never really serious about it they talked about winning , but i do n't think there was really that fight or drive to be competitive and win la russa , whose teams had competed most seriously with the chicago cubs and the houston astros , figured the reds would be relevant again with jocketty in charge but he did not know how soon it would happen walt s going to take his qualities wherever he goes , but if an organization does n't have any players , it s going to take longer to make an impact , la russa said i knew walt would make an impact sooner or later , but none of us knew the core they had of real nice young players and pitchers to be fair , jocketty said , he did not think the reds could turn around so quickly but with a solid foundation of hitters \( joey votto , brandon phillips , jay bruce \) and pitchers \( bronson arroyo , johnny cueto , francisco cordero \) , jocketty aggressively sought highend amateur pitchers like mike leake and aroldis chapman he also added veterans with winning pedigrees , like shortstop orlando cabrera and the former cardinals scott rolen , miguel cairo and jim edmonds the result is a team that has the best record in the league , 7855 fan support is still tepid the reds averaged fewer than 17 , 000 fans in their most recent home series , and they rank 12th of 16 nl teams in attendance per game the hope is that the reds' performance will increase the seasonticket base and help add to a payroll that ranked 19th in the majors on opening day if that happens , and the wealth of young pitching continues to thrive , jocketty could build in cincinnati what he built in st louis a sustained contender in a midsize market rich in tradition this is the oldest franchise in baseball , jocketty said there is a history of winning here people still remember the big red machine , and that s huge but other than 1990 , there has n't been a whole lot in between it s now important to get people believing that this can be similar to that era , and that it s going to be a lot of fun to be a reds fan reminders of the big red machine are all over the ballpark , from the doggy s dogs grill \( named for tony perez \) to a pete rose appearance next weekend to the hiring of joe morgan as an adviser those reds teams won two titles , against the boston red sox in 1975 and martin s yankees the next season martin died in 1989 , when his pickup truck crashed in upstate new york after a day of drinking with a friend jocketty was still with the a s then , his success as the architect of the cardinals and the reds still years away he has collected many friends in baseball but still misses one of his first , a mentor he knows would be proud billy was a very interesting man , jocketty said i wish that he had been around long enough to see how far i 've gone in the game
charlottesville , va in early fall , a few weeks after the start of school , cold viruses wing their way from one young nose to another and thence to families and the workplace , infecting people at three to four times the rate at other times of year and so the cold season begins and , with it , the relentless sneezing , coughing and sniffling that continue well into winter most of us come down with at least a couple of colds a year children get up to a dozen but we all know people who seem never to catch one what s their secret \? do they have extraordinarily robust immune systems , and the rest of us , pathetically weak ones \? you might think this was key , given the number of nutritional supplements , cold remedies and fortified cereals on the market that purport to augment the immune system often with the help of vitamins , zinc or ginseng and by so doing stave off colds but science and experience do n't back this up on the contrary , if you 're keen on tamping down your own cold , boosting your immunity may be the last thing you want to do to understand why this is so requires a bit of knowledge about how colds work there are more than 200 cold viruses , the most common of which are rhinoviruses \( from the greek rin , for nose \) when you encounter a particular strain , your body eventually produces antibodies to it , which remain on hand to quash that virus the next time you 're exposed but with so many flavors of cold virus circulating , there s always a new one to catch from the look of it , these ubiquitous cold bugs are mischiefmakers in our bodies for decades , people thought this was the case that the runny nose , sore throat and sneezing we experience with colds resulted from the destructive effects of the virus itself on the innocent cells of our noses and throats after all , flu viruses work this way they destroy the cells of our respiratory tract , wreaking havoc in our airways but , as medical science has realized over the past few decades , the most prevalent cold viruses in fact do little direct harm to our cells researchers at the university of copenhagen performed biopsies on nasal tissue taken from people suffering severe colds , then did the same after the subjects had recovered to the scientists' surprise , none of the samples showed any sign of damage to the nasal tissue further vindicating the viruses themselves was another study around the same time showing that rhinoviruses infect only a small number of cells lining the nasal passages here was a new insight in cold science the symptoms are caused not by the virus but by its host by the body s inflammatory response chemical agents manufactured by our immune system inflame our cells and tissues , causing our nose to run and our throat to swell the enemy is us indeed , it s possible to create the full storm of cold symptoms with no cold virus at all , but only a potent cocktail of the socalled inflammatory mediators that the body makes itself among them , cytokines , kinins , prostaglandins and interleukins , powerful little chemical messengers that cause the blood vessels in the nose to dilate and leak , stimulate the secretion of mucus , activate sneeze and cough reflexes and set off pain in our nerve fibers so susceptibility to cold symptoms is not a sign of a weakened immune system , but quite the opposite and if you 're looking to quell those symptoms , strengthening your immune system may be counterproductive it could aggravate the symptoms by amplifying the very inflammatory agents that cause them in any case , the supplements , remedies and cereals that claim to strengthen immunity \( and thereby protect you from colds \) do no such thing it would be one thing if by some magic they made your body produce antibodies to any particular virus but they do n't and though some of these products contain ingredients that have been shown in studies to affect elements of the immune system , there s scant evidence that they bolster protection against infection by cold viruses no one knows which immune agents other than antibodies accomplish that there s another intriguing paradox here studies suggest that about one in four people who get infected with a cold virus do n't get sick the virus gets into their bodies , and eventually they produce antibodies to it , but they do n't experience symptoms it may be that people like this are not making the normal amounts of inflammatory agents it seems counterintuitive , but there it is people with more active immune systems may be especially prone to cold symptoms so getting a cold may be a positive sign that your biochemical defenses are working normally a glasshalffull view of getting the sniffles
as if republicans did not have enough cause for optimism this year , the pollster neil newhouse offers this lesson from history since john f kennedy occupied the white house , presidents with approval ratings below 50 percent have seen their parties lose an average of 41 house seats in midterm elections this year , a gain that large would return the house to republican control president obama s most recent gallup poll rating 45 percent there s more of mr obama s last nine elected predecessors , none saw his approval ratings rise between january and october of his first midterm election year that points to a republican breakthrough that would snatch the speaker s gavel away from representative nancy pelosi if 2010 follows historical patterns but american voters have smashed plenty of precedents lately , most spectacularly by electing an africanamerican as president in 2008 as soon as a political scientist comes up with a sweeping generality about american politics , said alan abramowitz , a political scientist at emory university , it will immediately be falsified end of deadball era two decades ago , democratic strategists bemoaned the republican lock on electoral votes for president in california , the most populous state , the party of reagan won 9 of 10 elections from 1952 to 1988 but in 1992 , bill clinton picked the lock and no republican has carried california since two years later , the democrats lost their own redoubt led by newt gingrich , republicans won control of the house of representatives for the first time in 40 years for 15 straight midterm elections , from 1938 through 1994 , the party holding the white house lost house seats then mr clinton s democrats gained seats in 1998 despite the monica lewinsky scandal republicans did it again under president george w bush in 2002 as mr clinton , mr gingrich and mr bush started their careers in the 1970s , an increase in splitticket voting appeared to signal the decline of partisanship and the rise of the political independents in reality , that phase marked the realignment of partisanship , especially in the south not its demise by 2004 , mr bush ran a successful reelection campaign on the theory that truly independent swing voters had all but vanished for a time , partisan polarization tempered shifts in the makeup of congress neither republicans nor democrats gained as many as 10 seats in the five house elections between 1996 and 2004 with the nation evenly divided and gerrymandered districts narrowing the political playing field , james e campbell of the state university at buffalo dubbed it the deadball era of congressional competition then republicans lost more than 50 seats in 2006 and 2008 within a fearful democratic party , no strategist doubts that the ball remains very much alive this year unusual elements this midterm campaign involves several historically unusual elements in addition to mr obama , those include passage of comprehensive health care reform after 70 years of failure and the aftermath of a deep recession with a taxpayer bailout of wall street with the health care bill signed into law , the president hopes to convince americans of its virtues while making clear that he has not stopped working on economic recovery but one new lesson for the age of 24 7 multiplatform news coverage may be the diminished power of the presidential megaphone yeah , he s got the bully pulpit , but so do 5 , 000 other people , said daron shaw , a university of texas political scientist who advised both presidential campaigns of mr bush he predicted that mr obama s approval rating , now that voters have taken his measure , would hardly budge this year though the unemployment rate remains stuck around 10 percent , the economy in march enjoyed its strongest job growth in three years the stock market has been booming democratic candidates hope that continued good news between now and november will begin alleviating the sour mood of voters some models of political behavior suggest that there is little time for that attitudes toward the economy tend to harden in springtime , mr campbell said , since the second quarter is the last one people have an opportunity to process before election day ray c fair , an economist at yale and a student of the relationship between economic conditions and political outcomes , argued that history shows voters take account of thirdquarter performance , too his model of 2010 economic performance projects that democrats will draw 5163 percent of the twoparty vote for the house that translates to roughly 224 seats enough for democrats to retain control of the house could 21stcentury shifts in the political and media culture be scrambling such calculations \? give me another 20 elections , mr fair responded , then we can test that
atlanta in their almost 50 years of existence , the have had more knuckleheads than knuckleballers , but the gap will be closed slightly wednesday when r a dickey throws his version of the pitch for the mets against the  he will supply the unpredictable pitch and the glove that will catch it virtually every knuckleball pitcher is expected to supply the oversize glove that catchers usually use to receive the pitch , and dickey , who is starting in place of oliver perez , is no exception he has the glove , said catcher henry blanco , who has the unenviable assignment of trying to contain the pitch that can start almost anywhere and often ends up at the backstop so i'm sure i will use that one it should be interesting blanco said he had never caught a knuckleballer in the major leagues , but he did catch dickey twice in spring training that gives him the nod over rod barajas , who was not necessarily going to complain about getting that particular day off catching a knuckleballer can be a humbling experience , even for veteran catchers the former los angeles dodgers manager tommy lasorda recalled the plight of his minor league catchers in spokane , wash , scrambling to track down charlie hough s wild pitches they were like labrador retrievers , lasorda said although the mets have had only a sampling of mostly unknown knuckleball pitchers , they did have a wellknown pitching coach who threw one hough himself coached for the mets from 2001 to 2002 , and also worked with dickey when he was first developing the pitch when he played for texas in 2005 in that way , dickey s knuckleball lineage goes back to the hall of famer hoyt wilhelm , a legend among knuckleballers wilhelm was a teammate of hough s with the dodgers , and hough passed on the knowledge in texas when dickey decided to commit himself to the quirky pitch he was just getting started , hough said we worked on some of the basics , like the grip and the arm angle but he definitely had his own style plus , he had better stuff than i had i mean , he could really pitch a typical knuckleball is gripped with the fingernails and is released without spin to allow atmospheric elements to influence the trajectory of the ball , making it move unpredictably the 35yearold dickey throws his harder than most , and lately it has been very effective he has a 42 record and 223 earned run average for class aaa buffalo on april 30 , he set down 27 consecutive batters , which would have been a perfect game if the first batter he faced had not hit a single that s the way knuckleballers do it , hough said it s always a little backward hough in the major leagues , and lasorda was the driving force behind his adoption of the pitch in the first place when lasorda was managing hough at class aaa spokane in 1970 , the dodgers wanted to release him lasorda loved hough and claimed to have saved him from baseball oblivion five times but then he finally called hough into his office i told him , i do n't know how long i can keep this up , ' lasorda said you 're going to have to come up with another pitch' he said , how about a knuckleball \? ' and i said , let s go' it is often on such whims that knuckleballers are created dickey threw a semiforkball version of the pitch until 2005 , when he decided the knuckleball was the only way to survive in the major leagues that was when he and hough began working together dennis springer was a knuckleballer who pitched two games for the mets in 2000 according to , the only other knuckleballers for the mets were bob moorhead in 1962 and 1965 , tom sturdivant in 1964 and rich sauveur , who pitched in six games for the mets in 1991 none of them fared well now it is dickey s turn to take his place among the small and farfromselect group of mets knuckleballers when he does , he will become the first knuckleballer to pitch for manager jerry manuel , who admitted he would have little advice to give i 've got no idea when he s got it and when he does n't , manuel said i have no idea that is how a knuckleballer likes it
no one knows how long it will take to seal off the well that is still gushing oil into the gulf of mexico , or how much longterm damage will be done to the gulf s fishery but the spill has thrown thousands of people out of work and threatened the viability of communities that were already reeling from one of the worst hurricane decades on record congress needs to act quickly to keep businesses and individuals afloat until they can secure compensation from bp , which is responsible for cleanup costs and has agreed to pay legitimate damage claims that means passing the aid package that the white house submitted to congress last week it also means pushing out federal disaster relief loans as quickly as possible and providing debt forgiveness to people who are already struggling to pay off federal loans in connection with the four hurricanes that ravaged the region in 2005 and 2008 federal officials must closely monitor the conduct of bp , which says that it has received nearly 7 , 000 claims so far , primarily from people who have lost earnings , and has issued initial payments on about 1 , 000 of those under the law , bp is responsible for the total cost of the cleanup and only 75 million in economic damage , but the company has said it would be willing to pay more the coast guard disaster office that oversees the cleanup says that bp has complied with federal laws that require it to notify people about how to make claims the company has also updated the office on the processing of claims bp said on friday that it had no estimate of the average payments it had made some officials in louisiana worry they are too small to help fishing boat owners and other businesses that have been sidelined by fishery closures or the falloff in tourism bp should make sure that none of these businesses go under while awaiting compensation the white house aid package provides for unemployment compensation for people affected by the spill and provides money for onestop assistance centers where people can go for job placement or to file complaints or unemployment claims the final bill should include a debt relief amendment by senator mary landrieu , democrat of louisiana , aimed at businesses in the gulf coast states that will need to take out new loans even as they are already struggling to pay back loans they took after the hurricanes by authorizing the small business administration to waive up to 15 , 000 in interest , the landrieu plan would lower loan payments for many businesses and give them at least a little breathing room
san francisco the lobby of the war memorial opera house is already intensely theatrical in nutcracker season , with a perfect tree not only beautifully decorated but also spotlighted in the afterglow that follows the matinee , children and their parents linger a long time , and many photographs are taken this , with houston , is one of the two bestdressed nutcracker audiences of my travels and , if the attire is less spectacular than houston , it s more elegant it s in this opera house that america s first complete nutcracker had its premiere , in 1944 the same version , choreographed by willam christensen , that i saw danced by ballet west two weeks ago one look at the dancers and i m reminded that san francisco ballet is among the best companies in the world finesse , elegance , polish , line , technique , ease one look at the cast list and i m aware that this is an exceptional matinee , with sarah van patten and tiit helimets as the queen and king of the snow , vanessa zahorian and taras domitro as the sugar plum fairy and her consort , and elana altman , ricardo bustamante , val caniparoli , frances chung and pascal molat in supporting roles unfortunately , travel delays meant my flight to san francisco was three hours late , and so i arrived in time for only the last few dances of act 2 i regret this not just as a dancegoer but as a tourist helgi tomasson s production is set in the 1915 san francisco world fair there is plenty to say even about the little i see martin west does some of the best conducting i have heard from him , and the company s orchestra is a match for its dancers this is neither the first nor second production in my recent experience to feature a dancing bear , but i hope it is the only one where the bear emerges from the skirts of mother ginger \( here called madame du cirque \) ms zahorian and mr domitro are outstanding in the grand pas de deux , which features some prominent references to both the 1892 ivanov and 1954 balanchine versions but there and in the waltz of the flowers , mr tomasson lets appealing dance ideas flounder blandly without building them into an architectural and musical array that would make them poetic or memorable it s confusing to have a sugar plum fairy who dances none of the music that tchaikovsky designated for her instead she leads the waltz of the flowers then young clara steps through a narniatype door that transforms her into a ballerina \( ms zahorian \) this alter ego device is set to a passage from the sugar plum adagio that s taken out of context , right before the adagio then occurs it s a jarringly unmusical effect of structure i m told 85 children appear in each performance here is this surpassing boston ballet s 83 , ballet west s 65 and new york city ballet s 55 a presentday nutcracker record \?
there was no good news in the september the economy lost another 95 , 000 jobs last month , as a modest gain in privatesector jobs was swamped by big losses in government jobs worse , most of the new private sector jobs do not appear to be particularly good ones bars and restaurants added the most positions of any sector , followed by temporary hiring services meanwhile , state and local governments cut good jobs , including 58 , 000 teachers and other education workers who were not called back for the new school year the job market is not stalling , it is regressing there is no evidence that employment will recover on its own corporations now hold an astounding 16 trillion in cash , but they are not hiring government could help , but republicans in congress for political and ideological reasons have relentlessly delayed and blocked action congressional democrats have managed to keep jobless benefits flowing and pass bills for a hiring tax credit , bolstered aid to states and help for small businesses none of these moves are up to the scale of the problem recently proposed 50 billion in infrastructure investments , as well as generous tax credits for business investment he will need to push a lot harder if there is any hope of persuading congress to sign on the republicans' antigovernment pitch is playing well in the polls the jobs report should be the best argument against that here are some more truths that need airing republicans revile last year s stimulus law , but without it , unemployment at 96 percent would be up to 2 percentage points higher , according to the with the stimulus waning , the unemployment number would be higher , but for the grim fact that some 35 million people have either quit looking for work or not entered the labor force during the downturn in all , shows that more than 1 in 6 american workers is either officially jobless , no longer looking for work , or working part time because they ca n't find a fulltime job what will it take to get companies to invest and hire again \? businesses need to believe that customers will be willing to spend , but high joblessness calls future spending into question , causing companies to sit tight a big government agenda for jobs including public private partnerships in energy and transportation could change that mindset , attract corporate investment and create jobs that is , if washington s politicians of both parties had the courage to lead rather than pander so what are corporations doing with all of their money \? instead of investing in the country s future , some are beginning to buy back their shares or buy other companies that will enrich shareholders but is unlikely to lead to more hiring president obama needs to lay out and fight for an ambitious , detailed jobcreating agenda americans need to understand that the alternative is more grim jobs reports for years to come
the same week that lehman brothers collapsed in september 2008 , a swedish crime novel titled the girl with the dragon tattoo was published in america the book did n't receive a ton of hype , not least because the author , a journalist named stieg larsson , was unavailable for interviews he had died in 2004 of a heart attack at the age of 50 the appeared in the back pages of the sunday book review many more readers were riveted instead by a wall street goliath teeters amid fears of a widening crisis larsson s novel , the first of a millennium trilogy he left behind , would nonetheless soar onto bestseller lists in america , it remains a best seller 18 months later , even as the first of what may be two movie adaptations in the many dissections of this literary phenomenon , much has been said about larsson s striking title character , a brilliant , if antisocial , 24yearold female computer hacker who bonds with a middleage male journalist to crack a chain of horrific crimes against swedish women strangely , far less attention has been paid to the equally prominent villains in this novel whether they literally commit murder or not they are , without exception , bankers and industrialists at the time of its american release , the girl with the dragon tattoo was far more topical than most anyone could imagine a bank director who blows millions on foolhardy speculations should not keep his job , writes larsson in one typical passage a managing director who plays shell company games should do time larsson is no less lacerating about influential journalists who treat mediocre financial whelps like rock stars and who docilely regurgitate the statements issued by ceo s and stockmarket speculators he pleads for some tough reporter to identify and expose as traitors the financial players who have systematically and perhaps deliberately damaged their country s economy to satisfy the profit interests of their clients what s remarkable is that larsson wrote all this in a book completed years before the meltdown of 2008 and was referring only to sweden and yet the overlap with our recent history is profound so much so that surely both his prescience and the universal resonance of his villains account for some of his novel s marathon ride through the zeitgeist , its ability to touch the nerves of so many readers in america and throughout the west if anything , the animus driving dragon tattoo seems more timely every day the more we learn about the shell games practiced by our own ceo s during the precrash bubble , the more we share larsson s outrage that none of them are doing time for instance , we now know , as we did n't in september 2008 , that to those in its executive suites the 2 , 200page bank examiner s autopsy released 10 days ago concluded that lehman , in league with its auditor ernst young , used materially misleading accounting gimmicks to mask its losses , duping investors and the evercredulous securities and exchange commission alike far from being held liable for the chicanery and recklessness that would destroy their company and threaten their country s economy , these executives benefited big time in , three harvard law school researchers examined public documents to assess whether one standard narrative of the crash was true that the meltdown of bear stearns and lehman brothers largely wiped out the wealth of their top executives it turned out to be a fairy tale in contrast to what has been thus far largely assumed , the executives were richly rewarded for , not financially devastated by , their leadership of their banks during this decade , the harvard law team wrote the top five executives at both lehman and bear collectively took home 24 billion in bonuses and equity sales that s nearly a quarterbillion dollars each between 2000 and their 2008 demise anyone in washington who thinks these kinds of revelations will stop and that america will just turn the page as the dow rebounds is spending too much time with goldman sachs lobbyists just take another look at the bestseller list the fastestselling nonfiction book in america right now an is an even better storyteller than larsson , lewis chronicles a few lonely financial renegades who saw through wall street s real estate securitization ponzi scheme some are as brainy and idiosyncratic as larsson s fictional geek heroine lewis s heavies are nothing if not american iterations of the villains of dragon tattoo the problem was n't that lehman brothers had been allowed to fail , lewis writes as he surveys the postseptember 2008 wreckage near the end of his book the problem was that lehman brothers had been allowed to succeed without reform of the financial system , that problem remains unsolved wall street will keep incentivizing reckless risk toobigtofail banks will keep getting bigger the system will crash again sooner rather than later , once more taking americans' savings , jobs and tax dollars with it anger over the last crash and the bailout of its high rollers spans the political spectrum , from neonew dealers on the left to tea party protesters on the right as the battle over financial regulatory reform began in earnest with last week , , there is a war that is about to happen over not just who regulates wall street but what the rules are the question for the politicians at the center of this battleground is simple enough which side of the war are they on \? the republican leadership revealed its hand unequivocally last week addressing the american bankers association , the party s house leader , john boehner , do n't let those little punk staffers take advantage of you , and stand up for yourselves , boehner instructed the poor , defenseless bankers the chief executive of jpmorgan chase , jamie dimon , to make a pitch for donations that may have been unnecessary chase and its employees , an atm for the democrats in 2008 , to the gop in the fourth quarter of 2009 republicans in the senate will be no different mitch mcconnell s remains gospel there just as charles grassley and olympia snowe played the democrats with months of fruitless negotiations on health care reform , so richard shelby and bob corker have been stalling a financial reform bill with similarly arid feints at bipartisanship corker insisted that any bill exclude regulation of extortionate payday lenders , who just  unlike the republicans , president obama sends mixed messages on these issues he says a standalone consumer protection agency is a priority a key appointee , gary gensler , the chairman of the commodity futures trading commission , to fight for serious regulation of derivatives but the treasury secretary , timothy geithner , still seems more inclined to preserve , not overhaul , the system that failed during his tenure at the new york fed geithner s major calling lately has been a publicrelations tour , with fulldress profiles in , and even , which filled us in on his humble offtherack brooks brothers suits last week he also contributed a video testimonial to the onair like the heedless casino culture it exemplified , that cnbc program has long been back to speculative businessasusual , pumping stocks as if the crash were just a small , inconvenient bump on the road to larger profits and bonuses the particular mad money episode to which the treasury secretary lent his imprimatur included such choice cramer bits as a reference to nancy pelosi as politburo president and a prediction that the passage of obamacare could cause the stock market to tank let the gop be the party of mad money once the protracted health care soap opera at last becomes history , the pivot to financial reform could be a great opportunity for the president , a decisive bid for his party to repossess that antiestablishment truck from scott brown the republicans will once again squeal that it s political suicide for obama to try to ram through a bill , and once again decry his socialism but while the voters were often genuinely divided about health care , they are not about wall street reform  what these voters crave are leaders unambiguously on the side of true fairness and accountability , not apologists for those traitors , as stieg larsson aptly called them , whose shell games broke the economy and stuck us with the bill the firedup president who energized the health care endgame by taking on insurance companies does n't have a year to find his voice for the war ahead not only is the 2010 election season fast approaching , but it will coincide with angry commemorations of the second anniversary of the fall of lehman brothers politicians who are still seen as soft on the culprits could yet fall too
had already said enough in the last week , and arguably too much he dispersed the encroaching crowd of reporters with a polite statement of policy i do n't talk before games even when he is n't playing \? i might play , he said playfully , though a lingering groinmuscle injury made that highly unlikely arenas did in fact sit out the ' 9290 preseason loss to the knicks at madison square garden on sunday , leaving the wizards in the hands of their extraordinarily capable rookie , john wall whatever the reason , arenas was probably wise to stay silent the spotlight has not been kind , and his expressiveness and candor have too often come back to haunt him last week , the wizards fined arenas their 111 million guard and erstwhile face of the franchise 50 , 000 for faking an injury when he was still healthy arenas made up a knee injury in order to give his teammate nick young a chance to start in the catalog of arenas infractions , it was a relatively minor offense but it eroded the trust and good will that arenas is trying to regain after his 50game suspension for bringing guns to the locker room last season and it made the transition from arenas to wall the no 1 pick of the draft seem all the more urgent to the franchise s health where arenas is unfiltered and unpredictable , wall is controlled and conservative where arenas creates a stir with seemingly every gesture or remark , wall seems eager to deflect the attention , or at least spread it around and where arenas was a pure scorer who passed when necessary , wall is a pure playmaker who scores when needed in his nba debut at the garden , wall showed off his speed and his court sense , and his ample patience with the ball and a young surrounding cast he finished with 6 assists and 19 points , making 8 of 14 shots from the field , none of them forced or indulgent wall scored easily in transition , as the knicks helplessly gave chase , and repeatedly broke down the defense in the half court in the first quarter , he converted a raymond felton turnover into a layup in three seconds later , after a knicks basket , he needed just 39 seconds to fly down the court for a layup knicks coach mike d'antoni called wall probably one of the fastest , most physically gifted players that we 'll have in the league d'antoni added , i hope he never learns to shoot real well , because then , he would be unguardable wall , a former kentucky star , entered the game averaging 156 points and 84 assists in the preseason , although he was shooting 40 percent from the field and was 1 for 10 from 3point range the wizards , who blew up their veteran roster in the wake of the arenas scandal , need wall to revive their hopes and their image wall , who was named a cocaptain by coach flip saunders , seems unaware of or unaffected by the burden i do n't really care about my expectations for myself , he said the main thing i can do is go out there and play basketball like i know how to , try to get better every day individually he added i do n't want nobody to say it s my team or i'm the main guy on the team i just want to be the leader and have this team get back to where they were before that steady humility is surely refreshing to the wizards wall exudes a maturity that belies his age \( 20 \) , which will be critical for this team the wizards have one of the youngest rosters in the league , with an average age of 244 among their top 12 players only three wizards have more than five years of experience , including josh howard , who is recovering from knee surgery and whose checkered history does not qualify him as a leader the linchpin at the moment is kirk hinrich , a sevenyear veteran who was acquired from the chicago bulls in the offseason he is one of a handful of wizards with playoff experience saunders has taken to calling him elmer s , as in the glue when the subject of wall comes up , saunders nearly empties his supply of compliments , praising his leadership , his intelligence , his athleticism , his leadership , his competitive spirit and even his memory we show him a play one time , and he knows where everyone s supposed to be , saunders said it remains to be seen where arenas , once a celebrated star , fits into this new wallcentric universe before his injury , arenas was averaging 103 points , fourth on the team he has already stated that his intention is to show wall the ropes and step aside but arenas averaged 226 points and 72 assists last season before his suspension if engaged and focused , he could still be a key to the wizards' rebirth , even after causing their demise rebounds toney douglas made two free throws with 11 seconds left to deliver the victory and finished with 23 points ronny turiaf left the game in the second quarter because of an upper back strain but later returned
washington the recent conviction of a virginia police officer supports the case for full exoneration of the norfolk four , former sailors convicted of rape and murder , who received conditional pardons from virginia s governor last year , lawyers for the men said in legal briefs filed in virginia this week , the lawyers argued that last week s conviction of robert glenn ford , a police officer in norfolk , va , and the main investigator in the case of the norfolk four , raises new evidence showing the men were wrongly convicted , but their convictions still stand , and the lawyers argue that they should now be overturned the men were convicted in the 1997 murder case of michelle moorebosko in norfolk none of the four sailors had prior criminal records , and the case against them was based almost entirely on confessions they gave to mr ford , who pursued the investigation despite linking the crime to another man , omar ballard but mr ford s conviction for extortion and lying to the federal bureau of investigation covered a period that began in 2003 , long after the norfolk four were convicted , and in a letter last month , judge everett a martin jr , expressed skepticism that the conviction was relevant for the norfolk four case but donald p salzman , a lawyer for danial j williams , one of the former sailors , argued in a response filed this week that mr ford s indictment and conviction was new information that substantially changed the facts of his client s case specifically , mr salzman said , a source has come forward asserting that mr ford had stated he believed the men were not guilty of the crime but in mr salzman s view , mr ford did not back off the case because he was trying to protect his position earlier in his career , mr salzman said , mr ford was caught in what prosecutors said was an effort to elicit false confessions from juveniles , and mr salzman argued that another instance could have endangered his job a detective who was the driving force behind these convictions has now been convicted for manipulating the justice system , said mr salzman , of the law firm skadden , arps , slate , meagher flom he had a motive to continue to pursue these cases a lawyer for mr ford , whose sentencing is scheduled for february , did not return calls seeking comment though mr williams , 38 , is no longer in prison , his conviction still stands along with its consequences he is required to wear an ankle bracelet so his parole officer can monitor him he is a registered sex offender and was given a dishonorable discharge from the navy he is now living with his parents in michigan , washing dishes at a restaurant and taking night classes , mr salzman said the three other men joseph dick jr , derek tice and eric wilson are also trying to overturn their convictions
a lot of nfl games are said to be crucial or mustwin , but many of them do not live up to the hype in the end , they sometimes are not even as important as once thought monday night s jetspatriots certainly did not live up to the hype on the field as the patriots pummeled the jets 453 in a result that will go a long way in determining the fate of two teams who came into this game with super bowl aspirations the patriots improved to 102 and took sole possession of first place in the afc east and now have their sights set on capturing the top seed in the afc and a firstround bye in the playoffs the jets will now need some outside help to take the division and are looking at a possible no 5 seed in the postseason a lot can happen with four more weeks left , but the patriots have all the momentum heading into the final stretch clearly , we feel like we are still one of the best teams in the afc , jets running back ladainian tomlinson said we know that they are and hopefully we will have another shot at them read greg bishop s full report on the game and continue reading to see how the game unfolded in foxborough , mass game set match the patriots win , 453 , and it ll take a pretty strong microscope for the jets to find a silver lining brady was dominant sanchez was forgettable and bill belichick would not be wrong to crow a little , except that he only grunts in postgame news conferences they outplayed us and outcoached us , rex ryan said it may feel like three losses but it s just one loss coming into the game , brady was already having what could have been his best threegame stretch of his career tonight he has added 326 yards and 4 touchdowns and there is still over six minutes left bill belichick has to decide if he s run up the score enough or not greg bishop on brady s recent run for all the accomplishments of tom brady the three super bowl rings , the supermodel wife , the contract with all those zeroes , the rockstar hair he entered monday night s game against the jets on perhaps the most productive stretch of his career in his three previous games , brady completed 70 of 95 attempts , threw for 877 yards and 9 touchdowns with zero interceptions against detroit on nov 25 , brady was perfect at least statistically on the strength of four touchdown passes , he finished with a 1583 quarterback rating and won the afc s offensive player of the week award the patriots decide to run this one in with greenellis , whose statline will certainly be overshadowed by brady s but is looking pretty good itself 72 yards on 18 carries and two touchdowns richard sandomir weighs in on the unnecessary complexity they re using to analyze this rout think back , as we recall don meredith s life , about his brand of game analysis he was , in a way , an antianalyst meredith didn t get hung up on strategy or jargon he was an entertainer and the puncturer of howard cosell s pomposity two of his roles on monday night football , which aspired to appeal to casual viewers meredith knew football but didn t use the booth to overload viewers as if he d come straight from tom landry s film room now think of the gamefilm wonks jon gruden and ron jaworski , the current analysts on mnf they are jargonistas \( gruden more than jaworski \) who fill their commentary with insider phrases like dummy snap counts , an et stunt , wheel routes , agaps , the hook zone , and one of my favorites , the 99 bunch crunch since abandoning its experiment with tony kornheiser , espn has turned mnf into a production for the cognoscenti it would be wrong to try to change gruden s personality he is a coach , through and through but more and better verbal and onscreen explanations would be valuable to those of us who don t sleep with bill belichick s playbooks every drive by the patriots in the second half has ended with a touchdown pass by brady and every drive by the jets has ended in an interception by sanchez brady now looking for his fifth touchdown of the game on the jets 21yard line greg bishop via twitter jets qb mark sanchez has 117 passing yards former jets and current patriots rb danny woodhead has 115 total yards ouch brady hits his tight end hernandez for a 1yard touchdown but the key play of the drive was short pass that danny woodhead took for 50 yards that got the patriots inside the 20 woodhead now has over 100 yards receiving on four catches earlier today on this blog , toni monkovic wrote a patriots victory in which woodhead makes some key plays would be a little extra jab in this rivalry the jets released woodhead earlier in the season and he s gone on to be an integral part of the patriots offense from the patriots 45yard line , sanchez attempted a deep pass to braylon edwards , but was picked off by mccourty sanchez has completed 11 passes on 23 attempts for 117 yards and two interceptions look away , jets fans , look away tom brady just capped an eightplay , 93yard drive with another touchdown , this time on an 18yard toss to wes welker a promising start to the second half ended in another disaster for the jets , who were finally able to put together a drive that seemed destined for the end zone they got inside the patriots 10yard line but a sanchez interception at the 2 put an end to that from the times s richard sandomir the halftime tribute to don meredith would have been more memorable if the taped retrospective of his football and monday night football career had not been on espncom for most of the day with all of espn s resources , it could have done more and better the second half , an alltooshort interview with his friend frank gifford was an emotional few minutes , especially when gifford choked up at the end as he recalled meredith s recent struggles with emphysema the impact of gifford s live interview suggests that the tribute would have benefited from a roundtable with , say , three people who knew gifford as a player and a broadcaster in the final minutes of the first half , the jets drove down to the patriots 37yard line , but the first half ended with a sack from the times s george bretherton when you are trailing tom brady and the patriots , 243 , at halftime there is not much to be positive about can the jets get back into the game \? well , if they do its going to have to be on the arm of mark sanchez he will almost certainly surpass his careerhigh for pass attempts \( 44 \) here in the second half and if there is any upside at all it might be that the ground and pound jets may finally find out how effective sanchez can be in a passheavy offense the jets have had enough problems to deal with in the first half without having to worry about steve weatherford , who has averaged 26 yards on his three punts he s going to have to start putting the patriots in worse field position if the jets have any hope of getting back into this one of course , not having to punt at all would be better brady came into this game having completed 66 percent of his passes one of the exceptions this season was during his first meeting with the jets , where he completed 55 percent in the patriots loss he s done something to figure out the jets secondary as he s back up to 66 percent \( 10 15 \) and the lack of pressure on brady is obviously helping judy battista via twitter no pressure on brady none the jets finally get on the board and the patriots drive right down the field and throw up another 7 points in no time a short pass to woodhead , who took it 35 yards , set the tone for another successful scoring drive on the first play from the jets 32 and brady finished it off with a touchdown toss to tate greg bishop via twitter hey , jets fans , it could have been a worse start the jets did hold the patriots to a field goal on their first possession thanks to a few nice runs by greene , the jets got close enough this time for nick folk to punch in a 39yard field goal judy battista via twitter on folk s first and ugly fieldgoal attempts watching nick folk kick that toward providence , i think for the 1 , 000th time that the jets got a little too cute in not keeping jay feely one quarter in the books i wonder if someone back at the jets offices is quietly calling hotels in kansas city , indianapolis , jacksonville and san diego hello , i m calling about availability on jan 9 starting at the jets 32 after the abysmal punt , the patriots waste no time making things worse for the jets a 12yard sack on first down only means that brady can pad his passing totals two completions of 19 and 25 yards to deion branch are all it takes to cover the distance with a minute left in the first quarter , it s 170 patriots and no , rex , that s not reviewable the jets answer \? a 4yard run , a delayofgame penalty , two incompletions and a 12yard punt ouch the patriots make the jets pay for folk s miss with another scoring drive six plays , 57 yards and 2 48 this time benjarvus greenellis covers the final yard for the score i wonder if anyone ever called him benji as a kid maybe that s when he learned to run over people and before you complain about that interference call on eric smith , don t he was guilty no good the jets drive stalls at the new england 35 , and nick folk pulls his 53yard field goal attempt wide left so it stays patriots 3 , jets 0 brady rises from the bench , fluffs his golden tresses and heads back to work fourteen women swoon in section 110 , but the medical staff has prepared for this rex ryan treats the red challenge hankie like a 6yearold treats a dollar he just can t wait to use it for something after sanchez was stuffed on a sneak on thirdand1 , ryan declared it a spot and asked for a review and , as he often seems to be on these early challenges , he gets it wrong so the jets give the ball to shonn greene on fourthand1 , and he gains 2 why not just do that the first time \? nice patience by sanchez on his first completion , stepping up into the pocket and firing a ball to cotchery on the right sideline for a first down that was fast brady led the patriots right down the field on their first drive 9 plays , 52 yards in 4 03 to a 41yard field goal by shayne graham the jets can take solace in the fact that his aim faltered at the end , with three straight incompletions from the jets 23 the jets jason taylor is the active leader in career sacks with 131 and patriots quarterback tom brady is one of his favorite targets , sacking him 10 times over his carees the times s greg bishop recently profiled taylor and the science behind the sack bishop his patented move remains simple and effective it starts with speed , built by the 6foot6 taylor as he charges an offensive tackle , then transferred to the longest of left arms ideally , he sticks that arm between the numbers of the blocker , as if jousting , to knock him off balance , to move him backward from greg bishop after the jets signed wide receiver laveranues coles earlier this week for his fourth tour with the team , coles was among the inactives on monday night the feeling around the team was that coles was signed in a temporary role , to provide an emotional lift after safety jim leonhard suffered a broken leg in friday s practice not many surprises on the inactives list , including laveranues coles for the jets , but here it is patriots taylor price , wr thomas clayton , rb jonathan wilhite , cb rich ohrnberger , ol mark levoir , t myron pryor , dl eric moore , dl mike wright , dl jets kellen clemens , qb jamaal westerman , lb vladimir durcasse , ol , matthew mulligan , te jeff cumberland , te laveranues coles , wr marcus dixon , dt matt kroul , dl eleven days have passed and thousands of stories have been written since these two teams last played , on thanksgiving , when the patriots defeated the lions and the jets bagged the benglas , the so there s a great chance you know by now what s on the line at gillette stadium but just in case , here s a recap both the patriots and the jets are 92 and tied atop the american football conference east division the winner will take sole possession of the lead and be in line to earn the top seed in the afc and a firstround bye in the playoffs the loser is looking at a possible no 5 seed in the postseason and a chance of meeting up with two dangerous early opponents in the san diego chargers and the defending conference champion ,

johannesburg given that the dutch are former colonial masters and their descendants instigated the harsh racial policies of apartheid , one might think that many south africans , blacks especially , would not cheer for the against spain on sunday in the world cup final in truth , many will not , but mostly for reasons involving the aesthetics of soccer , not a halfcentury of statemandated oppression of blacks loads of us favor spain , but it is because they have a flair , a quality , said lucas radebe , a black south african who was captain of world cup teams in 1998 and 2002 this is all about football history is history on the other hand , many black and mixedrace south africans are rooting for the netherlands , along with white afrikaners , who are of dutch descent radebe said that 16 years after the fall of apartheid , this represented a sign of progress , a recognition of deep historical and cultural connections , and a confirmation of s belief in the healing power of sports in 1995 , a year after being voted president , mandela famously wore the jersey of the springboks , the national rugby team largely supported by whites and resented by blacks , as won the world rugby championship here we forgive and forget , radebe said you 've got to live in the world and you want to do it in peace mandela said we had to tolerate each other somebody has to give in so we can make our way forward sport has the power to unite people and change individuals as could be expected , many afrikaners are supporting the dutch , who are seeking their first world cup title historical links between south africa and the netherlands extend to 1652 , when the dutch east india company established a supply station for ships rounding the cape of good hope definitely , we 're supporting the dutch our roots are there , said cherie smith , 52 , a teacher her daughter , sarah jane , a model , has painted her fingernails orange , the dutch color , bought an orange shirt to wear and even an orange wig she s a redhead , so orange is not her color , but she really feels a connection , smith said generally , people here do not view former colonial powers solely through the prism of the past many south africans supported england , another former colonial overlord , earlier in the world cup and are devoted television watchers of the popular english premier league many black south africans also rooted for the netherlands in its semifinal match against uruguay , mostly because uruguay had earlier defeated south africa and ousted ghana the continent s final hope in the tournament after a controversial play in which a uruguayan player illicitly used his hand to block a shot from going into the goal a soccer connection has existed between the netherlands and south africa for more than half a century the first black south african soccer player to play professionally in europe was steve mokone , who joined the dutch team heracles in the late 1950s , a decade after apartheid had been codified in 1948 in 1999 , a cape town team in south africa s premier league and began operating in a joint venture with the  an important symbolic gesture against apartheid occurred in 1987 , when ruud gullit , the dutch star , was named european player of the year and dedicated his award to mandela , who was still imprisoned at the time gullit met mandela after his release , and that mandela said to him ruud , i have lots of friends now when i was on the inside , you were one of the few such a gesture by gullit further endeared the dutch to many black south africans , said radebe , the retired captain players like him made a difference for people of color , in fighting racism , in making it to the highest level of the game , he said while the dutch reformed church of south africa supported apartheid , antiapartheid activism sprang up in the netherlands diplomatically and among nongovernmental organizations , historians said this is precisely why he was rooting for the netherlands on sunday , said themba ngcobo , 50 , a black business owner from johannesburg i will cheer the dutch because they contributed a lot to the democratizing and developing of this country , ngcobo said we understand the past , but we look at the present the dutch influence in south africa is particularly resonant around cape town cape dutch architecture features rounded gables , thatched roofs and whitewashed walls choral singing in socalled malay choirs features 18th and 19thcentury dutch songs sung by mixedrace , or colored , people , many of whom are descendants of slaves brought to south africa centuries ago by the dutch from indonesia , india and ceylon \( now sri lanka \) afrikaans , one of 11 official languages in south africa , is an offshoot of dutch that is believed to have emerged in colonial times as a way for masters and slaves to communicate among the 185 percent of white and mixedrace people , afrikaans remains the primary language , according to peter alegi , an associate professor of history at michigan state university who is a visiting fulbright scholar at the university of kwazulunatal in durban , south africa yet alegi added at school , my two daughters learn afrikaans , but none of their schoolmates knew that it came from the old dutch how much awareness there is of the dutch connection here is an open question to me another factor may blunt any enmity that black south africans might have for the dutch team , alegi said many of the dutch players are of caribbean or african diaspora connection , he said people look at the dutch team and they seem to be diverse racially and ethnically it might be hard to associate that with a white supremacist past sean bvurero , 18 , who is black , said he had long supported the dutch because he liked their players , especially wing arjen robben his friend thandi mpungose , also 18 , said he was rooting for spain , but added , it has nothing to do with the past thilda dikeledi , 23 , a grocery clerk in the morningside section of johannesburg who is black , said she would support the netherlands because the team played confidently and with passion the past does n't mean anything , dikeledi said football is football in the end , this is a game
villanova , pa in july 2007 , villanova guard scottie reynolds , then coming off a rookieoftheyear season in the big east , played for wildcats coach jay wright with the united states team in the panamerican games in rio de janeiro during one practice , , a meek shooter , failed to perform a defensive drill correctly three times after the third try , wright s silver tongue turned into a leather whip in front of the team get out ! wright told reynolds if you want to act like a smalltown kid , then you 're never going to play at this level ! reynolds , a humble son of huntsville , ala , remained reticent he killed me , said reynolds , whose no 2seeded wildcats will play no 15 robert morris on thursday in the south region of the ncaa tournament that summer alone is why i feel like i 've been here five or six years for all of wright s bigcity polish , whether it is the selfdescribed man purse he carries while recruiting , the tailormade suits or the cologne bottles he stores in his car , desk and travel kit , his gritty makeup may be his strongest trait it is not the that shows through when he visits recruits rather , it is unvarnished truth that impresses the greatest gift i can give you is the truth , wright often tells prospects boston university coach pat chambers , who coached with wright for five seasons , said as an assistant , you cringe when jay comes in for the final meeting and tells the kid he s not going to start right away but you know what \? he told that to an nba player in i rolled my eyes , but i know tyreke respected that , too , has fashioned his team into a winner , largely based on the ability to procure talent along the new yorktowashington corridor favorable impressions allowed him to collect four mcdonald s allamericans on his current roster , but now he has been charged with sustaining the success from last season s team , which reached the final four the transition has not been easy having been ranked as high as no 2 , the wildcats finished the regular season ninth and have five losses in their last seven games the guy can coach and manage the whole program , or else it would n't be , said philadelphia university coach herb magee , who taught wright to shoot in his youth it would be exit university with kids leaving for a guardoriented program , villanova has rebounded well in recruiting no signee in the last four years has been more vital to villanova s revival than reynolds he but changed his mind once coach kelvin sampson uprooted for indiana he knew none of the wildcats when he came to visit wright called reynolds s mother , pam , who adopted reynolds when he was a toddler she told wright that she would have to wait a few days to decide everything seemed too good to be true , she told wright we want to be sure reynolds committed and was welcomed by wright , who likes to refer to his comfortable lot in life as lala land the senior guard randy foye graduated after leading the wildcats to the round of 8 , and wright wanted to remodel reynolds into a point guard at first , they were a mismatch wright , a bucknell frat boy who prided himself on high school basketball runs into philadelphia neighborhoods , where he found bullet holes in his car , was aggressive and wanted reynolds to play similarly reynolds , a pious type with the penchant for overanalyzing , wanted to study every angle i thought this kid ca n't be thinking this deeply , wright said i'm used to new yorkjersey guys who you get in their face and they do it injuries forced reynolds to score and handle the ball , reaching a climax during a latefebruary game at uconn wright let reynolds , a freshman , work off ball screens for 40 points , using the same two plays over and over each time i 'd think there s no way we 'd get away with this again , wright said the big shots came from reynolds s compact motion , which ends with a subtle flick he has continued them through his career , against pitt last march to land villanova in the final four if you ask me what i remember about him , it was the 40 at uconn more than the pitt shot , wright said we maintained the program on his shoulders that year chambers can still hear the echoes from past blowups the last one he saw was last april , before villanova left for the final four wright let reynolds have it , and the exchange made chambers confident whenever they went at it , we usually won , chambers said both locked in now , wright and reynolds start another title pursuit in the spotlight i understand now , reynolds said he s just telling you the truth
there are various opinions on the best way to align your receivers for a hail mary play send three down one side run two together , then slide a third underneath but it is universally accepted football theory that the one place you do not want your two best receivers on such a play is in the locker room , which was where chad ochocinco and terrell owens were on the bengals final desperate play in the first half against the patriots on sunday it s not clear why leading by 243 , new england took over at its 32 with 1 14 left before halftime and quickly drove into cincinnati territory while ochocinco walked to the locker room with a bengals staff member owens followed him before stephen gostkowski lined up for a 56yard fieldgoal attempt with six seconds left but when gostkowski missed the kick , he left a second on the clock enough time for one last carson palmer heave to try to make something of a forgettable half that nearly happened jordan shipley pulled down palmer s pass at the 3 but couldn t get in the end zone no word yet from the twitterfriendly ochocinco and owens on why they left early , but in their defense , at least they played most of the half cincinnati s defense didn t show up at all the ap fills out the picture from the locker room \( sort of \) ochocinco was in the locker room receiving intravenous fluids , coach marvin lewis said after the game lewis said owens was being looked at , but he would not elaborate that s our business , ok \? he said ochocinco declined to comment , telling reporters who crowded around his locker , everything i have to say , terrell will relay for me so for those keeping track owens was speaking for ochocinco , lewis was speaking for owens , and none of them were saying much of anything
on monday , the big east conference and texas christian university entered into a shotgun wedding beginning with the 2012 season , tcu will join the conference in all sports , including football , where their team has just completed an undefeated regular season on paper , the marriage would seem to have been hastily arranged the big east was founded as a basketballfocused conference in 1979 , consisting of teams in urban climes in new york , new jersey , washington dc , and new england it found success almost immediately , qualifying exactly half of its teams for the ncaa basketball tournament during its first six seasons , during which time two of its schools , georgetown and villanova , won national championships tcu is not a basketball school the last time it won an ncaa tournament game was in 1987 and , last we checked , fort worth in texas , where the school is based , it is not anywhere in the direction of the northeast , unless you re navigating there from guadalajara but the big east , which began sponsoring football in 1991 , has long been indiscriminate about adding new members from large state universities like rutgers to smaller , religiouslyaffiliated ones like marquette from elite academic schools like pittsburgh to marginal ones like the university of south florida from colleges with strong football traditions like miami of florida \( which left the conference in 2004 \) to others which do not compete in football at all it has also taken an abstract view toward geography once tcu joins , its 17 members \( including those that don t participate in football \) will be spread between 13 states stretching from rhode island to texas and the district of columbia in an era in which most major conferences have vociferously protected their brands erring on the side of preserving their academic , geographical , and competitive integrity the big east has gravitated toward the other equilibria , having collected a set of squarepeg schools that don t quite fit in elsewhere the big east , however , has not lately been any sort of superconference , at least when it comes to football none of its current members have played in the bcs championship game \( although the sincedeparted miami had done so twice \) only one , west virginia , is currently ranked in the associated press top 25 the university of connecticut , which just began sponsoring division ia football in 2000 and which computer rankings have as only about the 60th best team in the country , will represent the conference in a bcs bowl game if it beats south florida on saturday enter tcu , which has won 10 or more football games 8 times in the last 11 seasons as it has migrated through three different conferences , and which could still play in the national championship game this year if oregon or auburn should falter before that , however , football success had been fleeting for tcu prior to the 2000 season , the last time it had been ranked in the ap top 25 at the end of the season was in 1959 for most of the intervening years , the horned frogs were the doormats of the nowdefunct southwest conference during the 40 seasons between 1960 through 1999 , tcu lost more football games than all but 8 other division ia schools , and finished with a winning record only 9 times how likely is it , then , that tcu will be able to maintain something resembling its current level of football success \? the team shouldn t necessarily have to be a national championship contender to be an asset to the big east but will it be one that plays in a bowl game in most seasons , and a highprestige bowl with some regularity \? without that , tcu isn t worth much to the big east \( it does open up the dallasfort worth television market the fifthlargest in the country to big east football , but it is competing for attention with five other schools there \) the answer , it turns out , is fairly intuitive although it involves a bit of nuance to project how well a college football team is liable to perform in the shortterm that is , over the next 35 seasons look toward how well it has performed in the recent past to project how well it can be expected to perform over the longer run , on the other hand , you ll want to reach further back into the past to track its prior performance i discovered this by downloading power ratings for all division ia college football teams since 1960 , as calculated by james howell the howell ratings run on a scale from 0 \( the worst possible team \) to 1 \( the best possible one \) and are reasonably easy to interpret a score of 5 reflects an average college football team although keep in mind that the average includes teams from minor conferences like the midamerican and the sun belt the average rating for a team in a socalled automaticqualifier \( aq \) conference , on the other hand one of the six powerful conferences , including the big east , that are guaranteed placement into a bcs bowl game is a bit over 6 the average team that appears in a postseason bowl game has a rating slightly over 7 the average rating for one of the 10 teams that appears in one of the five bcssponsored bowl game is a little over 8 finally , the national champion typically has a howell rating on the order of 9 so far this year , tcu has a howell rating of 88 this is , in fact , the best rating in the country , and suggests that it is close to national championship caliber \( unfortunately for tcu , the howell ratings are not used by the bcs computers since they account for margin of victory , which the bcs s arcane rules forbid \) and overall since 2000 , tcu s howell rating is 71 , which is quite a bit better than the average for a team from a typical aq conference it has performed better than any current big east member over this period , the closest being west virginia , whose average rating is a 68 in the 10 years between 1990 and 1999 , on the other hand , tcu s howell rating was just 45 , which is below average over all , and quite a bit below average for a team from an aq conference and its rating was slightly worse still 42 during the 1980s although i won t go into detail on the particulars of the procedure , i used a form of regression analysis to analyze the data , and project tcu s performance out over the next 20 years next year , for instance , tcu is projected to have a howell rating of 75 this is quite strong and although there is a lot of uncertainty in the projection , there is somewhere on the order of a 35 or 40 percent chance that tcu will play in a bcs bowl game again next season tcu s projection begins to fade fairly quickly , however in 2012 , the first year they will play in the big east , it drops to 71 by 2015 , it falls to 64 barely above average for a team from an aq conference and by 2020 , it is 59 , slightly below the typical aq conference team looking further out still , tcu s projection evolves into a steady state of about 53 for a major conference team , that translates into a school that might go 57 in a typical year , perhaps making a bowl game every second or third season several qualifications apply almost certainly , tcu s performance will not be quite that steady they ll have some stronger years and some weaker ones and there is a chance , meanwhile , that they ll build on their momentum from recent seasons and consistently overperform their forecast also , my model is based solely on tcu s past power ratings it does not account for the fact that tcu could get a recruiting boost from having joined a major conference still , the basic ruleofthumb that i suggested above is fairly powerful to project how well a college team is likely to perform over the longrun , look at its past performance over the longrun and there , tcu s track record is a mixed bag as strong as they ve been over the past decade or so , they were bogeying most seasons before that as a relatively small school without the pedigree of a university of texas or a texas a m , tcu has to work its tail off for every recruit under their coach , gary patterson , they ve been a remarkably wellrun program and they ll have little trouble signing talent so long as they re appearing in elite bowl games but should they have a couple of 48 seasons , bluechip prospects from tyler or plano or abeline aren t likely to be excited by the prospect of playing rutgers and connecticut and will go to texas , or a m , instead with that said , if the benefits to the big east in attaching themselves to tcu will come mostly in the shortrun , that is also probably where the conference s focus is as the times pete thamel points out , there were two nightmare scenarios for the big east first , if it were to lose its automatic qualifier status after 2011 when the bcs will review its procedures and second , if it were raided by a conference like the big ten , which has been linked with pittsburgh , syracuse , and rutgers adding tcu makes either of those scenarios significantly less likely tcu s recent performance will count toward the bcs s assessment of the big east , which means that they ll almost certainly retain aq status and the conference which will also add a 10th football member , possibly villanova , by the time tcu joins would remain viable even if two teams like pittsburgh and rutgers were lost and who knows what the conference landscape will look like after 2014 , when the bcs s contact expires and a playoff system may finally be installed it probably won t look very much like it does now tcu , which will have played in five conferences over the span of twenty seasons the big east , the southwest , the mountain west , the western athletic , and conference usa may be on the move yet again

miami gardens , fla mayor greg ballard of indianapolis was expected to arrive in miami on thursday evening his arrival may come as a shock to some here who thought indianapolis did n't have a mayor in the aftermath of in 2005 , c ray nagin , the mayor of new orleans , became the national face of the city and its recovery efforts , said his mission in south florida was to spread the good news of indianapolis and to wrestle away some of the attention from nagin i know that people , because of katrina , know mayor nagin a little bit more , he said that s fine i absolutely understand the sympathy angle , and i do wish them well we know why we should care about the saints we 've been beaten over the head with it the saints are an underdog lover s dream , too great a story to pass up players talk on automatic pilot about the postkatrina devastation a city practically under water , making its way back an nfl team that had been an nfl disaster , reaching the for the first time ok we get it  but beyond rooting interests , why should we care about indianapolis \? why care about the \? there is no devastation , no disaster in fact , ballard said the city s economy was holding its own because of the diversity of the economy , indiana is doing a little better than most , he said as a franchise , the colts have been one of the most successful teams of the decade so why should we care \? because in an era of bells and whistles , there is something to be said for simplicity and efficiency , a familyoriented city one or two cities may be more exciting hosts , but none do it better there are more combustible football teams , but none in the last 11 years have been as consistently excellent as the colts indianapolis is hosting the men s final four this spring the nfl combine makes indianapolis its home , and the city will host the super bowl in 2012 this is no mardi gras city , and the colts are not a mardi gras team we do the big things right , ballard said while nagin became a national celebrity because of katrina , ballard has remained anonymous that is beginning to change if nagin is the face of new orleans , ballard , 55 , is the spirit of indianapolis he was , where he attended an allboys catholic school he also grew up without the nfl the city did not have a team until the colts relocated from baltimore in 1984 everybody was a chicago bears fan , he said not ballard as hard as this is to believe , he said , i was a colts fan my favorite player was i loved him because he was so precise in how he did his work berry was a selfmade player , much like his quarterback , johnny unitas , who played semipro football before working his way up i like those kinds of stories , he said not only indianapolis , but all of indiana appreciates somebody who just does the work , does it for the right reasons you ca n't just win in indiana you 're going to have to win the right way to get full support they do things the right way hard work , they do things smartly , they give back to the community they bring the city together in any city there are differences , but when the colts play , all the differences seem to be cast aside and everybody is just cheering for the colts pretty strongly ballard , where he earned a degree in economics instead of going into the workaday world , he joined the marines his parents were speechless they were shocked , ballard said i came from a nonmilitary family they never saw it coming ballard joined because he did n't want to fall into a daily grind at that time , i saw everybody graduating , he said they looked like they went to work for a company for 40 years they 'd take two weeks off a year , spend two weeks of vacation in florida i did n't see myself doing that for the next 40 years i just wanted something different you ca n't get much different than the marines  ballard retired from the marines in 2001 as a lieutenant colonel after a 23year career that included a tour in the first gulf war and several commendations he said he wanted to be with his two children , who were beginning their first and second years of high school in 2007 , after working in the private sector , he decided to run for mayor no established republican wanted to take on the twoterm incumbent bart peterson despite being an overwhelming underdog , ballard won his victory was called the  the lesson learned one he has applied to this super bowl is that you cut through all the hype , ignore the press clippings you run the race and play the game the new orleans saints have become america s team , a team of destiny there is some of that , and frankly , i understand that fully , ballard said but at the end of the day , when they get on the field , all of that stops i think the colts are a team on a mission this year i think they 're going to be very difficult to stop no flash no dash the colts are just good sunday may very well be a reality check for who dat nation
irvine , calif while resting this week for his swim races , watched the yankees' alex rodriguez strain although phelps , who did not appear to labor when he was chasing history , he could relate to rodriguez s struggle to join the elite fraternity of hitters with 600 home runs before his fortnight in beijing , phelps endured a twoyear stretch in which he failed to improve his time in perhaps his best event , the 200meter butterfly i think everyone goes through little spurts like that in their career , phelps said wednesday , a few hours after to break a 46atbat drought phelps , 25 , has also been struggling to find his stroke though admittedly not in the best physical condition , phelps showed on the second night of the national championships that he had lost none of his mental strength he gutted out a victory in the 200meter freestyle , holding off his longtime rival , ryan lochte , who was closing fast , to finish in 1 minute 4561 seconds , the fastest time in the world this year lochte clocked a 1 4578 an hour later , phelps recorded a wiretowire victory in the 200meter butterfly , clocking a 1 5600 despite feeling terrible with the victory , he passed tracy caulkins as the leader in individual national titles with 49 in the leadup to this competition , which will determine american teams for a number of important international meets , phelps had lost enough races that his failure to win no longer triggered shockwaves in the sport phelps was beaten in the 100meter backstroke in may in charlotte , nc and at the paris open in june , phelps finished third in the 200meter freestyle and last in the 100meter free final after his performances at the past two summer olympics , it was inevitable , perhaps , that phelps would stumble into a valley the focus that fueled his run of 14 olympic gold medals in 2004 and 2008 could not last forever this past year , phelps allowed himself to blink he stayed out of the water for most of the fall and part of the winter , showing up for practices so rarely that his longtime coach , bob bowman of north baltimore aquatic club , began to worry that he was on the verge of losing him in comparison with his postbeijing break , which effectively ended when , phelps did not feel the need to be everywhere at once as if he were trying to experience an adolescence largely sacrificed to swimming asked what he did in lieu of training , phelps said , golfing , sleeping , sitting at home doing absolutely nothing he laughed just being lazy , pretty much phelps added , i just wanted to take some time to clear my mind and get ready for the next couple of years bowman , who has coached phelps since he was 12 , runs a program that leaves little room for rest but he had no problem making an exception for phelps , who went nearly 10 years without missing a day in the water quite honestly i did n't care , bowman said if you have trained every day for a decade , you might want to have some freedom in your schedule of course , there are breaks , and then there are gaps that can swallow even the most solid working relationships when february arrived and phelps had yet to fully commit to his coach s regimen , bowman wondered if he and phelps were headed for a split it was n't like he totally did n't come , bowman said but he might come like two times a week just enough to make me frustrated bowman grew tired of having to explain to his younger swimmers why they had to be at practice when their idol , phelps , was a consistent noshow the clock was ticking , bowman said in february , phelps and bowman traveled to vancouver and attended a few events at the winter olympics bowman saw phelps , who was making appearances on behalf of one of his sponsors , get that hypnotic look and knew a corner had been turned since then , phelps , who plans to make the 2012 olympics his competitive swan song , has been in a race against the clock he is trying to make up for the training time he lost he said that the timing on all of his strokes especially freestyle had been off but that he was starting to feel like his old self not being where you want to be is frustrating , phelps said at the same time , i brought it on myself phelps was 15 in 2000 when he made his first olympic team , in the 200 butterfly ten years later , he is the secondoldest competitor in the championships here bowman said the thing i always have to remember when i get frustrated with michael is he s incredibly savvy about the sport he knows what it s going to take to be his best in london , and he knows that it s got to start now
kabul , afghanistan the chief judge asked god s forgiveness if he had reached the wrong decision , and then he sentenced four members of an afghan family charged with making bombs two brothers to 10 years in prison and two other family members to time already served the courtroom , deep inside the americanrun detention center in parwan , erupted the prosecutors complained that the sentences were too light , and the defense lawyers protested that they were too heavy one of the defendants , masri gul , said he had not been allowed to examine the evidence and the guards tried to quiet everyone in the next room , the american military lawyers and officers who were the trial s godfathers and were watching the proceedings on a closedcircuit television gave a sigh of relief it had gone as well as could be expected for the first of its kind for months they had been working to make it possible for the afghan government to hold trials at the parwan site as part of an effort over time to transfer the center s detainees to afghan control this trial was the beginning of a confusing period in which two legal systems will be running in parallel at the parwan detention center an afghan one and an american one under the american one , detainees , all of whom are detained by american soldiers usually working with afghan forces , can be held indefinitely without charge or trial their cases are periodically reviewed by an administrative hearing board of military officers , first when they arrive in parwan and then every six months to see if they should continue to be detained , released or referred for trial in the afghan courts under the afghan system , detainees are tried and , if found guilty , they serve their time in an afghan prison new cells are being built at parwan that will be entirely under afghan control , and detainees who are sentenced could be imprisoned there previously , a small number of parwan detainees were referred for trial and internment in the afghan prison at policharki , but the referrals were not part of a comprehensive transfer plan the american military made a great effort to showcase the bombmaking trial as a symbol of the transfer of authority , inviting afghan and western news media however , the judges' verdict seemed to depend in large part on crucial work primarily from american technicians , and over all , americans will continue to play a substantial role in decisions about the transfer of detainees so far , afghan and american officials have identified 110 cases for afghan trials there are about 850 people now detained in parwan all but about 30 are afghans most have been held for less than two years , but about 100 have been held for longer and about 20 have been held for more than four years the recent trial reflected the american military s evolving view of detention policy although military officials believe that the united states can legally continue to detain afghans under the law of war , they have come to see longterm detention as creating problems , including increased resentment from the local population that the americans are trying to win over the goal by next summer is to have more afghan trials than american military administrative hearings an ambitious target given that so far this year there has been just one trial , but nearly 1 , 000 administrative hearings the most sustainable detention is a criminal law enforcementbased detention in the afghan system , said brig gen mark martins , the deputy commander of task force 435 , which has jurisdiction over those detained by the americans the americans envision building up the afghan judicial system to make the expansion of trials possible construction is under way for an onsite courthouse and living quarters for the judicial and legal staff to make them less vulnerable to corruption and threats than they would be if they were working in the regular afghan court system , american military lawyers said the newly built parwan detention center is the successor to the notorious one at the air base , where two detainees died in custody and there were charges of other maltreatment parwan is adjacent to bagram but entirely separate in one sense the us military is starting to do today what it should have started to do years ago , which is to allow afghan nationals detained on afghan soil to be subject to afghan law , said jonathan horowitz , a detention analyst for the open society institute , a public policy and advocacy group but he added that the united states was still unilaterally detaining hundreds of afghans those detainees who are no longer considered a threat are released through administrative hearings 150 have been released so far this year even as others are brought into the system , according to american military officials however , those proceedings are not trials and are not carried out under afghan law the american interest in parwan is not only overseeing detention decisions , but continuing to mine intelligence from detainees there are 16 interrogation cubes equipped with oneway windows and cameras to allow monitors to ensure that there is none of the abuse that occurred in the past the interrogations produce a 24hour stream of information that can be filtered and sent to the battlefield one potential problem that has yet to be confronted is that an afghan court could acquit a detainee whom the american review board deems a continuing threat then whose law will prevail \? anybody not found guilty can be released , but we have an interest in not releasing people that pose a risk to the people of and to us , said capt gregory belanger , director of legal operations for task force 435 i'm not going to say it s not binding , but if someone is acquitted in state court , they can still be prosecuted in federal court , captain belanger said it is unlikely , however , that a detainee who the americans believed remained a threat would reach a trial in the near term unless there was substantial evidence against him this group could remain for some time in the american detention system there s a small group of enduring security threats who we 're going to deal with case by case , said general martins you 're never conceding that you throw away the key , you 're always looking for a sustainable , legitimate detention under the afghan legal system the gul family members tried on june 8 were detained less than a year ago , with the evidence gathered in a way usable by the court , something less likely to be true of the older cases at parwan the two men ultimately convicted of bomb making were picked up on suspicions that they were bomb makers and fingerprinted their fingerprints were later lifted by american soldiers from the battery pack of a bomb that exploded and from parts of one that was defused the matching was done by afghan and american technicians , and an american testified about the match the enduring problem is that trials remain a long way off for many detainees , according to human rights experts this is the beginning , a good first step , said nadir nadiry , the deputy director of the afghan independent human rights commission but it comes after a long time of indefinite detention we want trials to be available equally to all detainees

mr birch said that he had been backstage at that moment examining a loose , very wobbly platform that thora and others had to walk across mr birch and ms birch said that he had been her manager for years mr birch and ms birch s mother , carol connors , were stars in pornographic films in the 1970s ms connors is best known for deep throat mr birch has been on film sets with ms birch before a gossip column in the new york post reported in 2007 that he had been present during ms birch s taping of a sex scene for her movie the winter of frozen dreams ms birch said that she did not know if she would pursue legal action against the production or file a complaint with the actors equity union a union spokeswoman said no complaint had been filed ms birch has been replaced by her understudy , emily bridges , whose father is the actor beau bridges ms bridges s role will be played by katharine luckinbill , whose parents are the actors laurence luckinbill and lucie arnaz dracula is scheduled for a 13week run , starring george hearn \( a tony award winner for sunset boulevard and la cage aux folles \) as the vampire hunter abraham van helsing
kansas city , mo eddie lowery lost 10 years of his life for a crime he did not commit there was no physical evidence at his trial for rape , but one overwhelming factor put him away he confessed at trial , the jury heard details that prosecutors insisted only the rapist could have known , including the fact that the rapist hit the 75yearold victim in the head with the handle of a silver table knife he found in the house would later show that another man committed the crime but that vindication would come only years after mr lowery had served his sentence and was paroled in 1991 i beat myself up a lot about having confessed , mr lowery said in a recent interview i thought i was the only dummy who did that but more than 40 others have given confessions since 1976 that dna evidence later showed were false , according to by brandon l garrett , a professor at the university of virginia school of law experts have long known that some kinds of people including the mentally impaired , the mentally ill , the young and the easily led are the likeliest to be induced to confess there are also people like mr lowery , who says he was just pressed beyond endurance by persistent interrogators new research shows how people who were apparently uninvolved in a crime could provide such a detailed account of what occurred , allowing prosecutors to claim that only the defendant could have committed the crime an by professor garrett draws on trial transcripts , recorded confessions and other background materials to show how incriminating facts got into those confessions by police introducing important facts about the case , whether intentionally or unintentionally , during the interrogation to defense lawyers , the new research is eye opening in the past , if somebody confessed , that was the end , said peter j neufeld , a founder of the , an organization based in manhattan you could n't imagine going forward the notion that such detailed confessions might be deemed voluntary because the defendants were not beaten or coerced suggests that courts should not simply look at whether confessions are voluntary , mr neufeld said they should look at whether they are reliable professor garrett said he was surprised by the complexity of the confessions he studied i expected , and think people intuitively think , that a false confession would look flimsy , like someone saying simply , i did it , he said instead , he said , almost all of these confessions looked uncannily reliable , rich in telling detail that almost inevitably had to come from the police i had known that in a couple of these cases , contamination could have occurred , he said , using a term in police circles for introducing facts into the interrogation process i did n't expect to see that almost all of them had been contaminated of the exonerated defendants in the garrett study , 26 more than half were mentally disabled , under 18 at the time or both most were subjected to lengthy , highpressure interrogations , and none had a lawyer present thirteen of them were taken to the crime scene mr lowery s case shows how contamination occurs he had come under suspicion , he now believes , because he had been partying and ran his car into a parked car the night of the rape , generating a police report officers grilled him for more than seven hours , insisting from the start that he had committed the crime mr lowery took a lie detector test to prove he was innocent , but the officers told him that he had failed it i did n't know any way out of that , except to tell them what they wanted to hear , he recalled and then get a lawyer to prove my innocence proving innocence after a confession , however , is rare eight of the defendants in professor garrett s study had actually been cleared by dna evidence before trial , but the courts convicted them anyway in one such case involving jeffrey deskovic , who spent 16 years in prison for a murder in poughkeepsie , prosecutors argued that the victim may have been sexually active and so the dna evidence may have come from another liaison she had the prosecutors asked the jury to focus on mr deskovic s highly detailed confession and convict him while professor garrett suggests that leaking facts during interrogations is sometimes unintentional , mr lowery said that the contamination of his questioning was clearly intentional after his initial confession , he said , the interrogators went over the crime with him in detail asking how he did it , but correcting him when he got the facts wrong how did he get in \? i said , i kicked in the front door' but the rapist had used the back door , so he admitted to having gone around to the back they fed me the answers , he recalled some defendants' confessions even include mistakes fed by the police earl washington jr , a mentally impaired man who spent 18 years in prison and came within hours of being executed for a murder he did not commit , stated in his confession that the victim had worn a halter top in fact , she had worn a sundress , but an initial police report had stated that she wore a halter top steven a drizin , the director of the center on wrongful convictions at the northwestern university school of law , said the significance of contamination could not be understated while errors might lead to , it s contamination that is the primary factor in wrongful convictions , he said juries demand details from the suspect that make the confession appear to be reliable that s where these cases go south jim trainum , a former policeman who now advises police departments on training officers to avoid false confessions , explained that few of them intend to contaminate an interrogation or convict the innocent you become so fixated on this is the right person , this is the guilty person' that you tend to ignore everything else , he said the problem with false confessions , he said , is the wrong person is still out there , and he s able to reoffend mr trainum has become an advocate of videotaping entire interrogations requirements for recording confessions vary widely across the country ten states require videotaping of at least some interrogations , like those in crimes that carry the death penalty , and seven state supreme courts have required or strongly encouraged recording these days mr lowery , 51 , lives in suburban kansas city , in a house he is renovating with some of the 75 million in settlement money he received , along with apologies from officials in riley county , kan , where he was arrested and interrogated he has trouble putting the past behind him i was embarrassed , he said you run in to so many people who say , i would never confess to a crime' he does not argue with them , because he knows they did not experience what he went through you 've never been in a situation so intense , and you 're na ve about your rights , he said you do n't know what you 'll say to get out of that situation
newark zach parise has played for the for less than five years , but he knows how it works around here the devils have been mentioned in trade rumors about other elite players , but the players always end up elsewhere if the devils are named in a rumor , he said , it must not be true so when parise arrived at the prudential center on friday and saw pulling on a red devils sweater to prepare for his first morning skate with the team , he still could not believe what he was seeing it was a jolt to parise and his teammates they were almost giddy , and not just because kovalchuk is good when you can add a player like that who can put the team over the top , that shows what management thinks this team s capabilities are , parise said kovalchuk , the 230pound left wing who made his devils debut friday night in a 43 victory over the , was brought in by general manager to help the devils win the stanley cup this season anything less will probably be judged as a disappointment at the nhl trade deadline 10 years ago , the devils acquired a right wing from russia , alexander mogilny , to add punch to a team that was almost impenetrable the devils won their second stanley cup in 2000 and came within a game of repeating as champions in 2001 kovalchuk , 26 , is a far better player , with 328 goals in 594 nhl games before friday he also has two big incentives he will be an unrestricted free agent in july , and he has never won a stanley cup actually , he has never won a playoff game this is the first time in my career that i 've had a chance to play for a firstclass organization that has won three stanley cups , kovalchuk said friday you just look around the room with guys like martin brodeur legends in this game it s exciting kovalchuk , the no 1 overall choice in the 2001 nhl entry draft , had spent his eightyear nhl career with the atlanta thrashers , who were trounced by the rangers , four games to none , his only postseason action because he has played for a team that does not draw well and does not win much , kovalchuk has been overshadowed by alex ovechkin and sidney crosby but kovalchuk is every bit as good as ovechkin , devils coach jacques lemaire said he s a guy who can change a game , lemaire said of kovalchuk , who had more than 21 minutes of ice time friday and had two assists he s a player who can make other players score he s a strong athlete , a good skater with a great shot there s no doubt he s going to make this team better the thrashers traded kovalchuk because he turned down their offer of a 12year contract extension worth 101 million lamoriello said thursday that he would try hard to sign kovalchuk by july 1 , but he also made it clear that he made the trade to enhance the team now ovechkin and the capitals \( 40126 \) won their 13th straight game friday by beating atlanta the devils \( 36182 \) , a distant second in the eastern conference standings , were shut out four times in 12 games before friday they scored three goals in the final 3 minutes 4 seconds , including two goals in the final minute , to salvage the victory over toronto now that we 've had a little trouble scoring goals , i think he 'll help us out , said dainius zubrus , who centered a line friday night with kovalchuk and jamie langenbrunner and scored but kovalchuk , who will be ovechkin s teammate on the russian squad at the winter olympics , represents much more than a set of jumper cables now the devils have two potent left wings , including parise , so opponents will not be able to focus as much on stopping one line brodeur said kovalchuk gave the devils a different element a big , skilled scorer at 6 feet 2 inches , kovalchuk is three inches taller than parise when patrik elias returns from a concussion , the devils will have more depth than ever on the forward lines , brodeur said we all came in with big smiles to the rink today , brodeur said kovalchuk , who will continue to wear no 17 , joked after the morning skate that brodeur made it tough for him to score kovalchuk smiled when he said that brodeur did not give him much confidence going into his first game with his new team but he said he could live with that he is finally playing for a contender that , for now , is more important than signing a big contract in five months , whether it is in lamoriello s office or somewhere else the devils have a mandate to win , and he is eager to play his part i'm just going to focus on the game , kovalchuk said
the first decade of the 21st century has been a boom time for murderers on television james gandolfini as the mobster tony soprano \( the sopranos \) , michael chiklis as the rogue cop vic mackey \( the shield \) , bryan cranston as the schoolteacher and meth kingpin walter white \( breaking bad \) they 're among the most honored television performances of the era , representing 6 of the last 10 emmy awards for lead actor in a drama \( and another , michael c hall as the expert and serial killer dexter morgan , has been an emmy nominee and recently won golden globes and screen actors guild awards \) those characters have all wrestled with guilt and rationalized their misdeeds \( essential for maintaining credible antihero status \) but none has been quite as guiltwracked , or as creative in his rationalizations , as mr cranston s walter , who returns in season 3 of breaking bad on sunday night on amc walter white is not a killer on the scale of tony soprano or dexter morgan , but in the very first episode of breaking bad in 2008 he dispatched two albuquerque drug dealers , choking one of them to death with a bicycle lock as season 3 begins , the city is reeling from the midair collision of a private jet and a boeing 737 that ended season 2 walter did n't cause that , but as regular viewers of the show know , he and his methcooking prot g , jesse pinkman \( aaron paul \) , are n't entirely innocent either i accept who i am , jesse says , still grieving the season 2 death by overdose of his girlfriend , whose father happened to be an air traffic controller i'm the bad guy walter , of course , never admits to being the bad guy , which is both the crux and , increasingly , the limitation of a series that is often called the best show on television the original premise that a frustrated high school chemistry teacher would team up with a former student to manufacture new mexico s best methamphetamine sounded like an '80s light comedy , a film in which no would get hurt and the teacher , played by michael j fox , would end up running a pharmaceutical company in the late '00s it became a darkly comic cable drama in which the teacher had to cover the medical bills for his stage 3 lung cancer and also make enough to pay for his children s education after his death over the course of a sevenepisode first season , it worked comedy and tragedy were in balance , and plausibility was n't unduly stretched then came the rave reviews , the first of mr cranston s two consecutive emmys and an order for a 13episode second season that was a problem because the logic of the show demanded that the proud , selfrighteous walter , a master of denial , keep lying to nearly everyone about everything not just his criminal activities but also , for as long as he could , his cancer diagnosis as the lies compounded , walter became less and less believable \( so did his wife , skyler , played by anna gunn how could she not see through him \? \) mr cranston managed to keep walter sympathetic through sheer force of personality the narrative bogged down too allowing walter to win over his drug rivals or his cancer would kill the story , so the writers devised a cycle in which walter and jesse would make money but quickly find a way to lose it , or discover that they needed even more for long stretches the action seemed to consist of walter declaring that he was going to stop making meth and then changing his mind meanwhile skyler sulked and nagged him about his frequent unexplained absences \( he missed the birth of his daughter while making his first big score \) skyler finally takes decisive action early in season 3 , a welcome development that does n't really change the status quo once she knows the truth , she s as trapped as walter is she has to keep her mouth shut to protect their son , walter jr \( played with exceptional sweetness by the young actor r j mitte , who has cerebral palsy \) mr paul s jesse spends the first episode moping at a retreat while trying to get over his grief and guilt , which puts one of the show s funniest presences on the sidelines it s nice to see the return to center stage of the mexican drug cartel that figured prominently in season 1 but was mostly offstage in season 2 daniel and luis moncada play twin enforcers who dress and act like the taciturn agents from the matrix some breaking bad devotees may find the drugwar plot a little too arch , but it s more entertaining than the family drama , which may be the heart of the show but has never been as interesting as the meth business mr cranston has said in interviews that breaking bad cannot go on indefinitely walter s situation will demand a resolution before long it might have been best , from an artistic standpoint , if it had been done as a sevenepisode closedend miniseries as long as it continues , we can admire mr cranston s skill at making the prickly , delusional , violenceprone walter white approach likability
judy battista is in foxborough , mass , and will be providing live analysis of sunday s game between the ravens and the patriots , along with andy benoit , the founder of , and connor ennis , who is at the times headquarters in manhattan scroll down to track the progress of the game you can also  the patriots didn t lose this game the ravens won it they forced turnovers early , pounded the ball on offense and shut down new england s depleted receiving corps over the last few years , we ve regularly seen playoff underdogs rise up the 97 cardinals last season , the 106 giants in 07 , the 106 steelers in 05 the ravens have that feel and next week s matchup favors them the defense s physical nature is a stark contrast to the finesse approach of indy s offense on the other side of the ball , the ravens have a dominant betweenthetackles rushing attack that could threaten the colts undersized front seven the dominance of baltimore s run game is most startling it directly contradicts the belief that the nfl is strictly a passing league but the ravens were able to run this week because they built an early 24point lead \( a result of big plays \) can that same formula work in a closer game \? the dolphins ran the ball all over the colts in week 2 , only to lose because of a few quick peyton manning touchdown strikes most likely , joe flacco will need to orchestrate big plays at some point he did a solid job at new england , but greatness , not solidity , is what wins super bowls ab and the ravens advance that means they will go to indianapolis to face the topseeded colts next week , while the jets will play at san diego that stunning first quarter proved to be all that baltimore needed to get through to the next round ce as the ravens get closer to wrapping up this victory , they just saw tight end todd heap go down with an injury his leg got bent under him while he was blocking as andy says todd heap s injury looks bad the poor guy hasn t stayed healthy until this year , and now he gets dinged in a big playoff win ce not a good decision by new england to go for the field goal too many teams think 16 points is a twoscore margin really , it s a fourscore margin a 2point conversion is even harder to complete than a fourthand2 scoring three conventional touchdowns is easier ab a missed field goal from 44 yards out by stephen gostkowski pretty much ends the patriots chances they are down 19 points with less than six minutes left ce the patriots have not completed a single pass longer than 18 yards that s the ed reed factor and while we re on the topic of safeties , dawan landry is one of the most underrated players in the game ab after a few minutes , aiken got up and walked off the field , though he looked shaky ce patriots receiver sam aiken just hit the ground hard after an incomplete pass he s down on the field ce judy , on twitter , on the atmosphere at gillette stadium with 10 32 left fans are leaving gillette wow aisles out are filled up incredible the ravens challenged the 2point conversion play , saying mcgahee got in but the original call was upheld ce marshall yanda is having a tremendous game for the ravens so is guard ben grubbs the sagacity of the veteran center matt birk , who signed as a free agent this past offseason , has been a big plus for this emerging young offensive line another testimony for birk is that the vikings front five has tailed off without him ab a 3yard touchdown run by willis mcgahee makes the score 3314 it s mcgahee s second touchdown run of the game , the same as rice he was stopped on a 2point conversion attempt , however ce it s easy to imagine that the jets and colts are both rooting for a new england comeback the jets would rather face the indy team that they beat in week 15 than san diego , and indy would rather face the jets team that they practically beat in week 15 than this confident ravens club ab the ravens just challenged the spot after a flacco scramble to see if he reached out to get a first down around the patriots 6yard line after a review , the ravens got the first down , allowing them to take more time off the clock and giving them firstandgoal with 12 05 left ce something that s nice about this game is that cbs cameras have given us plenty of fan shots , but not a single shot of anyone holding a believe sign we did just see a pats fan holding a finish ! sign , which is a bit odd when your team is trailing by 13 in the fourth quarter , pats will need at least one big play on defense , one big thirddown stop and an explosive play offensively to have a chance pass protection has been solid after a tough first quarter ab flacco just doubled his passing yardage for the day with a 17yard completion to mark clayton for a big first down the clock continues to tick ce one quarter left the strategy seems pretty clear for the ravens ballcontrol offense and take a lot of time off the clock the patriots , meanwhile , need a few more drives like their last one in the third quarter that ended with edelman s second touchdown catch ce it s a twoscore game one more touchdown by the patriots and we ll remember that running the ball isn t all that important ab can there be a worse feeling for a receiver than to be being held up by a defender and watching helplessly as ray lewis bears down on you that s what just happened to randy moss , whose compensation was that he gained 5 yards that was a few plays before julian edelman continued his attempt to step out of the shadow of wes welker by catching his second touchdown pass of the day , this one a 1yard with 1 47 left in the third that cut the ravens lead to 2714  ce you gotta love the billy cundiff profile picture every time you see it , doesn t part of you think about that famous line i see dead people from the sixth sense \? think haley joel osment has heard of his lookalike in baltimore \? ab the ravens stall down near the patriots end zone and settle for a 23yard field goal by cundiff to increase their lead to 277 with the way their defense has been dominating the patriots offense , they have to feel pretty comfortable ce no way the ravens would be running like this if richard seymour were out there ab new england has the right idea with running a hurryup by the way , it should be noted that baltimore is without two of its top three corners \( fabian washington and ladarius webb \) yet they just intercepted brady for the third time ab joe flacco is 2 of 7 for 9 yards and still , he s having a better game than brady the ravens secondary is stifling the pats receivers randy moss s ineffectiveness is most to blame this offense is basically without its top two wideouts ab here s judy s tweet on the patriots first drive of the second half three and out is definitely not how the patriots wanted to start the second half nothing open over the intermediate or deep middle does anyone else think its interesting that matthew slater is a wide receiver and his father was an offensive lineman \? that s at least a 100pound weight difference ab the turnovers were the story of the first half , but going into halftime , what really stands out are those final two minutes the patriots flat out couldn t stop the ravens in shortyardage running situations vince wilfork sat out last week s game and hasn t stood out at all today the fact that junior seau is on the field in base packages tells you what the coaches think of gary guyton \( guyton is a great athlete but isn t always the smartest player \) with baltimore protecting a lead , it s hard to see the patriots getting back in this game given how the battle in the trenches is playing out ab ray lewis is having a vintage game you can tell he simply gets more out of his film study than typical players randy moss doesn t look healthy he s running like a man who s thinking about a sore knee ab the patriot linebackers are having trouble stopping ray rice and willis mcgahee at the point of attack both runners are showing superb lateral agility and making tacklers miss ab judy , via twitter , has some advice for the ravens offensive coordinator cam cameron flacco looks bad , is injured , ravens have a big lead and great defense run the ball , cam and now we have the proverbial momentum swing joe flacco was just intercepted by tully bantacain , giving the patriots the ball at their own 36 could we see a second quarter just as stunning as the first , except in new england s favor \? the ravens defense will probably have something to say about that ce running back laurence maroney hasn t been in since the opening series , when he was late in reading ray lewis s agap blitz the coaching staff doesn t seem to trust maroney a few weeks ago against jacksonville , maroney fumbled on the goal line early in the game and sat the rest of the afternoon it s surprising that the patriots are trying to run as much as they are ngata and suggs are the best playside run defenders in the nfl at their respective positions ab the patriots first touchdown came on a pass from brady to welker s replacement , julian edelman that cut the ravens lead to 24 7 with 11 23 left in the half ce on her twitter , judy agrees with simms ravens should have challenged that muffed punt would have been overturned strange that they didn t the patriots just recovered a fumbled punt along the sideline , but there was some question as to whether kyle arrington had possession of the ball before he went out of bounds phil simms felt the ravens should have challenged the call , but they decided not to the result is that the patriots got the ball at the baltimore 16 , with a chance to give themselves some life with a score will the decision not to challenge that call come back to haunt john harbaugh \? ce randy moss was a nonfactor in the first quarter he s not an ideal type of receiver for mounting a comeback because he s a terrible route runner and doesn t thrive in timingbased pass plays new england really has more of a methodical offense , which only makes a comeback tougher ab what a stunning first quarter patriots fans can breathe again now that it s over , while ravens fans can bask in the fact that they just dominated one of the nfl s best franchises in a way that they haven t been dominated in quite some time , especially on this kind of stage can the patriots find a way to turn this around \? ce anyone who has ever been to gillette stadium knows that the traffic after games is horrendous \( country roads , no mass transit system in foxborough \) think we ll see blocks of empty seats before halftime \? ab a 27yard field goal by billy cundiff puts the ravens up , 240 , with 1 19 left in the first quarter who would have thought that we would have seen a first quarter like this \? ce another playoff blowout that comes to mind is the jetscolts from about 10 years ago jets fans probably remember that one it was in the meadowlands none of these playoff blowouts have been at the expense of the home teams , though brady looks absolutely bewildered what s most surprising is that the pats are losing the physical battle and the presnap battle brady isn t trusting his first and second reads manhandling ab what s the mood like at gillette stadium \? here s what judy said on twitter  just stunned silence here not even booing just shock ray rice s second touchdown of the game , this one from a yard out , gives the ravens a 210 lead with 3 59 left in the opening quarter the two rushing touchdowns tie a franchise record , and there s plenty of time for him to break that mark he has 94 yards rushing already ce that s not what i meant by go after chris carr ab when is the last time we saw a playoff game with one team coming out so ready to play and the other so unready \? off the top of my head , i d say the 2000 nfc championship game between the giants and the vikings the dolphins and the jaguars had a lopsided blowout in dan marino s last year \( i believe \) and there was the cowboysniners 94 nfc title game any others \? ab judy mentioned that were empty seats in the upper deck at gillette stadium , which is an unusual sight in the playoffs apparently , those fans that are in attendance are making their feelings known , however , because there has been loud booing as well the patriots are in unfamiliar territory , both on the field and in the stands ce ray lewis just ran over running back laurence maroney on his way to sacking brady , leading to this twitter observation from judy that chip from laurence maroney on ray lewis is not going to get it done it s going to get brady killed there are almost two raven defenses the routine one , and the one that plays with a lead the routine version is solid but occasionally inconsistent the playwithalead version has swagger , is hardhitting and aggressive when it comes to forcing turnovers the patriots are in dangerous territory their best hope is to go after cornerback chris carr ab the ravens could not have scripted a better start first , rice rips off a long touchdown run , then terrell suggs strips the ball from tom brady and recovers the fumble , leading to a 1yard touchdown run be le ron mcclain the ravens suddenly hold a 140 lead less than five minutes into the game ce the first play of the game offers a perfect illustration of how ray rice creates matchup problems for the patriot linebackers jerod mayo was slow in his read and , as a result , got tied up in the wash rice s ability to change direction while maintaining speed and power is devastating to a defense the return of jared gaither at left tackle is huge for the ravens it allows michael oher to play right tackle , which keeps backup cousins off the field don t expect the pats to register many sacks today ab well , that didn t take long and no , i m not talking about how long it took for jim nantz to reference ravens offensive tackle michael oher s connection to the sandra bullock movie the blind side \( that took 6 seconds \) i m talking about how long it took for ray rice to make an impact on the first play from scrimmage , he went 83 yards for a touchdown , giving the ravens a 70 lead  ce pregame all week , my thesis for this game has been how julius edelman is not wes welker yes , the two players have a similar skill set and an even more similar physical comportment , but you just don t replace a leading receiver like welker edelman might post big numbers , but he won t draw as much attention however , as the week has progressed and i ve had time to stew and consider outside analysis , i find myself softening in this stance the patriots can survive without welker for this week , at least when these teams met in week 4 , the ravens rolled coverage over the top against randy moss tom brady targeted moss only five times and distributed the ball to a litany of receivers five different patriots had between 26 and 51 yards receiving in that win expect a similar approach from new england today tight end ben watson and running backs kevin faulk and sammy morris will be key in the shortarea passing game lately , new england has employed frequent six and sevenman fronts in a power running game but even with fred taylor back , it s doubtful that they ll look to grind much against baltimore s physical front seven the way to beat the raven defense is through the air , where the heavilypenalized secondary is good at beating itself on the other side of the ball , joe flacco will enjoy a clean pocket against a feeble new england pass rush but the raven offense goes through the budding superstar ray rice baltimore would love to put rice in oneonone situations against the patriots struggling inside linebackers ab when the patriots and ravens played in week 4 , the ravens lost , 2721 , after mark clayton dropped a pass deep in patriots territory late in the game but the more telling result of that game was the pressure the ravens got on tom brady remember those two questionable roughing the passer penalties they drew \? the ravens will need that pressure again in today s wildcard game and good news for baltimore the officiating crew is headed by gene steratore the crew called just three roughing the passer penalties the entire regular season the patriots , who have not lost at home this season , may have trouble with the ravens blitz , because brady s favorite safetyvalve receiver wes welker is gone for the season after injuring his knee last week in the first game against the ravens , welker caught six passes \( brady threw to him 10 times \) for 48 yards but 71 of welker s 123 receptions this season went for a first down , a clear indicator of how critical he is to the patriots offense without him , brady is likely to lean more on running back kevin faulk as his hot read , but the rookie julian edelman the converted college quarterback is a miniwelker he caught 10 passes for 103 yards last week after welker got hurt and with the ravens likely to double team randy moss , edelman might be the one brady turns to the patriots defense had seemed to be rounding into form until they blew a 14point fourth quarter lead to the texans last week the ravens have returned to a more runintensive offense with ray rice , but joe flacco is capable of scorching a patriots secondary that has been shaky if the ravens win , they will play the topseeded colts next week , sending the jets to san diego if the patriots win , they will play the chargers , and the jets will play the colts jb
in the 1950s , onion growers were often shocked at the low prices they were getting casting around for a villain to blame , they alighted on derivatives traders , and they persuaded congress to ban any futures trading in onions today onions are the only commodity for which futures trading is banned not coincidentally , onion prices remain extremely volatile they doubled in 2008 , and then fell by 25 percent in 2009 today , no one is silly enough to ask a member of congress to simply outlaw futures trading in a certain type of contract no one , that is , except hollywood film producers under the proposed financialreform legislation making its way through the senate , the bit of the 1958 bill saying except onions would be amended to read except onions and motion picture box office receipts hollywood was scared into pushing for the new language after the commodity futures trading commission , which regulates futures trading , recently approved two applications for markets in but if the new provision makes its way into law , the biggest losers will be the very film producers who lobbied for it the proposed contracts are simple they would allow traders to bet on the total boxoffice receipts of movies in their first four weeks of release a contract on iron man 2 , for instance , might be trading at 390 , meaning that the market is expecting the film to gross 390 million in its first four weeks if you think it s going to make more than that , you would go long , or buy the contract if you think it s going to make less , you would go short , or sell it at the end of the four weeks , the contract would expire at whatever the fourweek gross is if you went long at 390 and the film ended up earning 450 million in its first four weeks , then you 'd make 60 for every contract you bought hollywood s mouthpiece , the motion picture association of america , that the new market could tarnish the reputation and integrity of our industry and would constitute unbridled gambling though there s nothing unbridled about the regulatory strictures involved in being listed on a chicago commodity exchange the real reason most of hollywood is opposed to this development is unclear , but it is probably simply the ageold story of large , conservative institutions being averse to change top executives at the biggest studios may suspect that smaller and nimbler competitors would get more benefit out of such a market it s easier to hedge a 10 million project than a 200 million one yet as lionsgate films , one of the few studios supporting the market , has recognized , a futures contract on box office receipts would be great news for the industry for one thing , if the market got big enough , it would allow studios to easily hedge their investments in movies just by entering into a simple derivatives transaction studios could essentially sell contracts on their movies' grosses into the open market , and pocket the proceeds they would lose money on the contract if the movie does well , but in that case they 'd make enough money on the movie itself to cover their derivatives losses that kind of thing would be a lot easier , and a lot cheaper , than the studios' current methods of trying to hedge exposure and sell risk the financing arrangements behind a typical hollywood movie , with countless coproducers and incomprehensible accounting , make the average collateralized debt obligation look simple and transparent and even if the studios did n't participate in the market , they would still benefit people care much more about things they bet on , and the fakemoney version of these contracts the online in operation since 1996 has done wonders for increasing awareness of coming films among its users , without a single dollar of publicity and marketing money being spent what s more , the contracts for the proposed market would be based on the first four weeks of boxoffice results , not just the opening weekend a lot of people , of course , would be betting on that openingweekend number , which is more a function of hype than a movie s longterm chances of success just as many , however , would wait until the movie comes out , watch it on its opening weekend , make their own qualitative determination of how well it will continue to perform over the rest of the month and then place their bets accordingly hollywood has an entirely predictable predilection for shooting itself in the fiscal foot , so none of this should come as a surprise but it is sad that the most intriguing derivatives product to be approved in years will probably be banned by congress thanks to the very people who stand to benefit the most from it
united nations as monsoon rains continued to fall in and waterborne diseases were reported to be spreading , international relief officials said the pace of aid donations was still not sufficient to deal with what might be the nation s worst disaster the scale of the response is still not commensurate with the scale of the disaster of almost unprecedented magnitude , said martin nesirky , the spokesman for the united nations secretary general , ban kimoon , reading a statement from the humanitarian affairs office this is a catastrophe that continues to unfold the united nations , which had been saying that as many as six million people needed some manner of emergency assistance shelter , food , drinking water or medical care estimated that figure could reach eight million the asian development bank on thursday said it expected to offer pakistan a 2 billion emergency loan for help repairing roads , bridges and other infrastructure damaged by the record flooding in the country the recovery will require a huge financial commitment from all development partners , citing the loss of life , livestock , homes and the damages to the country s power and transportation grids , the bank said it was continuing to evaluate the toll of the flooding the asian development bank s announcement preceded a scheduled news conference later thursday by the united nations and pakistan to give the latest assessment of the flooding since the weekend the pace of pledges to the united nations' 460 million appeal has accelerated , mr nesirky said on wednesday , but it remains short of its target the funding response to the floods is improving , but much more is needed , he said the effort must be sustained in the days and weeks ahead in order to have the resources to reach the people who desperately need help shortages of the most basic supplies have presented the biggest challenge for aid workers in pakistan , along with the logistics of how to deliver them across a vast part of the country lacking infrastructure the world health organization said wednesday that of the more than 15 million people the floods are estimated to have affected , only about 12 million had access to safe water supplies in the most inundated areas , 200 of 1 , 167 health facilities including several hospitals were damaged reports of respiratory tract infections and fatal diarrhea were growing the united nations began an appeal on aug 11 for 460 million to provide immediate aid to flood victims by wednesday , nations , organizations and individuals had sent 231 million , and had pledged an additional 40 million the united states was by far the largest single donor , with 82 million , according to united nations figures , with australia the next largest donor at 266 million the united states said its total contributions amounted to 90 million , including helicopters , boats and temporary bridges , according to the state department not all the aid was flowing through the united nations britain , for example , has sent more than 40 million , and the european union said it would double its aid to more than 90 million although the disaster has fallen in the muslim holy month of ramadan , when charity is considered a duty , muslim states have donated virtually nothing via the united nations and relatively small sums on their own turkey was the largest such donor , with more than 11 million , and kuwait donated 5 million , united nations figures show saudi arabia has pledged more than 80 million , but united nations records indicate none of it has been delivered to illustrate the size of the need , maurizio giuliano , a spokesman for the united nations relief effort in pakistan , said aid agencies had received 935 , 000 tents , but more than double that number was needed the united nations and the aid agencies through which it works have thus far delivered food to nearly 800 , 000 people , have helped get clean water to at least 14 million and have provided shelter to nearly one million medical stocks covering the potential health needs of 18 million people have also been provided unfortunately , this is only a fraction of what we need to do , said martin mogwanja , the united nations humanitarian coordinator for pakistan the floods are not over the indus river is at 40 times its normal volume , said karen allen , a unicef official in islamabad , the capital , in a statement from the humanitarian coordinator whole cities , of up to 250 , 000 people , have been evacuated , and people have lost everything official estimates put the number of destroyed houses at one million
if you 're elected president or prime minister in pretty much any country in the developed world today , you 're faced with the same set of challenges to reduce national deficits without choking off a fragile recovery to trim the welfare state and raise taxes while still funding the things that lead to longterm growth to try to enact brutally painful measures at a time when voters do n't trust their leaders to do it at a time when politics are polarized and a hundred different interest groups have the ability to block change the chances that the world s leaders are going to be able to do these things successfully are between slim and none it s hard enough to figure out the right mix of spending cuts and tax increases it s nearly impossible to build a political majority willing to enact them sometime over the next decade or so , the world will probably suffer from another series of crushing fiscal crises with significant economic pain and maximum political turmoil but , occasionally , there s a ray of hope occasionally , a country stumbles into a political arrangement that may help it avert a crisis and that s what s happened in britain britain has all the fiscal problems that plague most developed nations british households are carrying more debt than those in any other rich country 170 percent of annual income british general government debt is surging not at greek levels yet , but getting there the political culture is brutally adversarial the political extremes are strong the conservative party did n't win this month s election outright because 5 percent of voters preferred the antiimmigrant parties moreover , the election produced no clearcut result that would seem to make it harder to undertake the sort of necessary painful changes yet over the past few days , many british analysts are coming to the wary conclusion that something good may have happened david cameron , the conservative leader , was forced to confront the fact that even in the best possible circumstances , the conservatives could get only 36 percent of the vote he was faced with the possibility that the two other parties might form a permanent antiright coalition but as , cameron seized the problem and made it an opportunity by cutting a deal with the liberal democrats , he has built a centerright coalition in so doing , he has changed the nature of his own party , and the nature of the liberal democrats , his coalition partner if he had a small majority , he would have been hostage to his most ideological members as it is , he has potentially weakened the strong partisans in both parties , empowered the pragmatists who are bettersuited to coalition politics and created a less polarized political climate that watching cameron and nick clegg , the liberal democrats' leader , was like witnessing a coup millions of viewers will have shared my impression almost of watching two men staging a putsch against their own parties , against the entire british political system , and against the ingrained assumptions of more than a century of parliamentary government parris sees the potential for a softening of the normal adversarial culture , a strengthening of the sort of leader who likes compromise and a weakening of the sort that detests it the two parties are now in an economically conservative , socially liberal embrace that they hope will last for five years the parties disagree on many things \( immigration , europe , electoral reform \) , but they tend to agree on the need for fiscal restraint the efforts to control debt will be strengthened by having a broad coalition behind them the political pain will be shared cameron has the opportunity to look less like a party leader and more like a national leader today s coalition will compel the tories to formulate policies in new ways , and lodge them closer to the center of the electorate it helps that the conservative government has already moved to a more communitarian big society governing philosophy no longer purely free market , the tories emphasize rebuilding social bonds that means they speak less about slashing government as a matter of principle and more about improving it and decentralizing power this little platoons approach has left and rightwing variants and has the potential to break down the old ideologies of course , it all could fail the parties could reject the implant in us terms , it s like a marriage between marco rubio \( the tory base \) and the accumulated wisdom of the ivy league \( the liberal democrats \) but cameron and clegg are nothing if not flexible the entire political class understands what needs to be done the financial markets will insist on some serious budgetary restraint without any planning but by sheer good luck , the british may have stumbled into an arrangement that will be a model for all the other countries in the same desperate straits
after scrutinizing its financial profile in the mirror of its budget , the university of california has decided it s time for a makeover a year of furloughs , layoffs and student fee increases has made it clear that the 10campus system can no longer continue to do business as usual instead , it aims to save an ambitious 500 million over the next five years through a combination of trimming excess expenditures and centralizing operations , as the san francisco chronicle reported on tuesday , at the university system s board of regents last meeting of the school year in san francisco , an update was presented covering costsaving measures that are either in effect or under consideration but not everyone was satisfied with the progress so far i m actually shocked because i thought some of the stuff had already been implemented , leslie schilling , a board member , said during the meeting there s a lot of talk without much action the university s financial picture just got a little rosier last week , gov arnold schwarzenegger made good on his promise to preserve higher education financing in his proposed state budget , restoring 305 million to the system and reinstating the competitive cal grant program but it isn t out of the red by a long shot with a 21 billion annual budget and , said the cal system s president , mark g yudof , an annual deficit bordering on 12 billion that number is just a drop in the bureaucratic bucket mr yudof said at the meeting that , if the university is going to protect its core learning in an era of scarcity , administrative operations are going to need some serious reshaping some costcutting measures are simple for instance , having employees buy plane tickets all at one web site , or buying pencils in bulk others involve sharing and centralizing services that are currently spread across the separate campuses , and aiming for greater energy efficiency in campus buildings an operational excellence initiative to save 75 million through restructuring is already under way at university of california , berkeley there have been nine separate reports on administrative efficiency \( or lack thereof \) at the university system in the past decade , and only last year did mr yudof appoint a chief financial officer , peter j taylor , to analyze and consolidate campuses spending mr taylor immediately identified inefficiencies for instance , the campuses were borrowing money at interest rates as high as 975 percent , while the office of the president could borrow for a fraction of that rate nevertheless , university spokespersons at the meeting bristled at the use of words like inefficient or bloated to describe the administrative operations in just three years , the systemwide headquarters has trimmed enough spending to save 70 million , and to eliminate or transfer around 500 positions and university employees currently use 11 different payroll systems , which the university s vice president of the budget , patrick j lenz , said will soon be consolidated into one this measure alone is expected to save the university tens of millions of dollars in the spirit of keeping the university accountable for its spending , mr yudof urged everyone at the meeting to read the university s second annual accountability report pdf he also expressed regret over the mostdebated cuts furloughs and layoffs which he said the university has been forced to make as you all know , we ve been in crisis mode in the last couple of years and some desperate and temporary measures were taken , none of which i in my heart of hearts feel good about , he said , to the hissing sounds by some audience members
boston was just standing there , on the mound at fenway park last aug 22 , with his arms spread , his back to the plate and one thought and one thought only careening through his head the thought did not stay in there very long , though it left his mouth , a selfindictment captured by television cameras why \? burnett shouted why would you throw that pitch \? instead of throwing the fastball that over the green monster , burnett knew he should have come back with a curveball as they had a few times before that afternoon , burnett and his catcher , , sparred on pitch selection burnett did not blame posada , only himself , for not throwing what he wanted to throw still , burnett made eight more starts in the regular season , and five more in the playoffs and world series , and posada caught him only once , on sept 1 on tuesday , when burnett climbs the fenway mound to face the , he and posada will effectively reunite perfect , posada said let s get it out of the way right away looking forward to it reestablishing a connection with posada was burnett s priority this spring he was sensitive to the perception that he did not like working with posada , that he wanted a different catcher none of that was true , said burnett , who made sure to talk with posada throughout the postseason as jose molina took his place behind the plate posada maintained that burnett wanted him to catch his starts during the playoffs and that it was manager s decision to use molina he told me he wanted me to be there , posada said even though posada had made 88 postseason starts heading into the 2009 postseason , girardi felt molina could coax the best out of burnett , who ended up going 11 with a 527 earned run average the overall numbers for 2009 show that burnett did pitch better when in 16 regularseason starts pitching to posada , burnett had a 496 era and batters hit 270 off him in 17 starts pitching to kevin cash , francisco cervelli or , most often , molina , burnett had a 322 era and limited hitters to a 225 average burnett seemed to pitch in a better rhythm with them for me , i think it took on a bigger picture because we 're in new york , girardi said of the bumpy ride burnett and posada experienced as battery mates it was an emotional time , and we 're fighting for the division and we 're nearing the playoffs it seemed to take on it became a big story as far as them having a problem , i was n't concerned about that every chance they could , posada and burnett worked together this spring after his march 11 start was rained out , burnett was particularly grateful that posada stayed late , past 9 30 pm , to catch his simulated game burnett is polishing a changeup , and posada guided him through his march 27 start against detroit when he did not have a good curveball i noticed he s been a lot more confident and comfortable back there , burnett said of posada obviously , that makes me confident said posada you know what \? he understands we 're not talking about a child here he s a smart kid , a smart guy he s going to go out there and really give it all he s got i understand that sometimes there are emotions , like we were talking about looking back on his 2009 season , burnett knows that perhaps his two best regularseason starts june 27 against the mets and aug 7 against boston came with posada catching him his worst start no question , burnett said also came with posada behind the plate , an april 25 disaster at fenway in which the red sox erased a sixrun deficit to win , 1611 burnett s are at the forefront as he and posada seek to improve their working relationship in his three starts at fenway last season , all pitching to posada , burnett was torched for 20 runs in 12 2 3 innings when he pitched for toronto , burnett was so brilliant against the red sox 50 with a 256 era over all and 30 with a 040 era at fenway that it helped persuade the to sign him as a free agent in preparing for tuesday s start , burnett said he planned to watch videotape from his toronto days i 'd rather see myself doing good , making and executing the right pitches to these guys as opposed to seeing the opposite , burnett said positive encouragement as opposed to the negative inside pitch to stay sharp as he awaits his turn in the rotation , phil hughes threw the equivalent of eight and a third innings monday during a simulated game in tampa , fla hughes , who is scheduled to rejoin the yankees on tuesday , will not make his first start until april 15 against the angels
new delhi indian health officials have struggled to allay domestic concerns about even as the country scrambles to finish construction projects in time for the commonwealth games , which will take place here in less than a month is expecting 8 , 000 athletes and team officials from 71 countries and territories for the games , which bring together nations that were formerly part of the british commonwealth delays and allegations of corruption have already marred india s preparations , and the dengue outbreak is just the latest concern for indian officials , partly because the athletes' quarters will be near a breeding ground for the mosquitoes that spread the disease some countries and have issued travel warnings regarding the outbreak , while in britain that the head of england s delegation had told his team managers that any athlete was free to withdraw from the team at any point over health concerns dr chusak prasttisur , the southeast asia coordinator of communicable disease for the , expressed concerns that the worst of the epidemic was to come dengue in india will peak in coming month , he said but k sujatha rao , the health secretary , said friday that the number of cases in new delhi this year was no higher than usual it is not a runaway epidemic , ms rao said at a news conference it is very much under control dengue is a seasonal , sometimes fatal viral disease transmitted by the aedes mosquito , which bites during the day the season s outbreak is expected to last until the end of october i will never promise that delhi will be free of dengue , but it will be very , very minimal , ms rao said friday ms rao said that none of the commonwealth games sites had reported any dengue cases and all have been under surveillance for last two years the commonwealth games village , where athletes will be housed , is on the banks of the yamuna river ms rao said that if commonwealth games were not happening , little attention would have been paid to delhi s dengue outbreak this year she also said that more cases are reported have been reported from middleclass and upperclass residential areas but private doctors and some health officials have also contended that the number of confirmed cases of dengue is being severely underreported dr r k srivastav , director general of health services said , there will be a large number of milder forms of dengue , which he said patients were less likely to report v k monga , chairman of delhi municipal corporation s health committee , said friday that delays in the games projects had contributed to the high number of dengue cases games projects have been delayed and as a result the diggings carried out have turned into mosquito breeding grounds , mr monga told agence francepresse so far in 2010 , about halfway through the dengue season there have been 1 , 580 cases and 4 deaths reported in the new delhi area this is well under recent highs , officials said sixty people died from dengue in 2003 , and 80 in 2006
as bedbugs proliferate once again in new york city and other major urban areas , it is tempting to pray for a technological miracle to zap the pests into extinction alas , there is none frustrated new yorkers and other victims will have to rely on an array of techniques that can often be costly , cumbersome , timeconsuming and only partially effective after virtually disappearing from this country for decades , bedbugs may have been brought back by travelers from abroad the bugs are showing up in all sorts of places not just where people sleep , like hotels and residential units , but also in the occasional movie house or clothing store a survey last year by the new york city health department found that 67 percent of adult new yorkers some 400 , 000 people reported a problem with bedbugs that required an exterminator in the previous 12 months there are few surefire ways to turn the tide even the original magic bullet , ddt , would misfire if brought back today because bedbugs long ago became resistant to it on a large scale critics who blame environmentalists for disarming us against bedbugs might better blame the inevitable development of resistance , hastened by overuse of chemicals some pest controllers are placing their hopes on resuscitating propoxur , a highly toxic chemical that was phased out of indoor uses because it could cause nervoussystem damage in children ohio and kentucky have asked the environmental protection agency to allow professional exterminators to use it indoors , and other states may follow suit the requests are based in part on laboratory tests by a kentucky entomologist on small groups of bedbugs some of today s leading pesticides could not kill even half of the bugs , while propoxur wiped them all out in two hours the epa is studying whether there might be limited situations a nursing home with no children present where it could be used propoxur would probably kill better than current pesticides , but nobody expects it could be an allpurpose solution the way ddt once was pesticides need to be supplemented with nonchemical options , like heat or steam treatments , vacuuming , tossing infested sheets or clothes into a hot washer or dryer , encasing mattresses to entomb the bugs , and sealing crevices it is hard to know whether these tactics will be enough to reverse the rapid rise of infestations bedbugs are not known to transmit any diseases , and their bite is almost never felt but the bite triggers an allergic reaction mostly itchy bumps or welts and , in rare cases , fatal shock the primary damage , besides the potentially high cost of extermination , is emotional and psychological government and industry need to expedite the search for better solutions the public s tolerance for bedbugs is near zero
washington the patient arrived in critical condition last month at the air base hospital in , with what american military doctors at first thought was an all too typical war injury metal shrapnel from an improvised bomb lodged in his head a showed that the piece of metal , about two and a half inches long , was probably a cartridge fragment again , not at all unusual but as the patient , an afghan soldier in his 20s , was prepared for surgery , the chief radiologist , lt col anthony terreri , took a closer look at the cat scan stunned , he realized the object was an explosive round , primed to go off it looks like we have a problem here , he announced to say the least in a joint telephone interview from bagram on friday , members of the air force medical team recounted the hours that followed dr terreri s discovery maj john bini , a trauma surgeon and a veteran of homemadebomb injuries from two previous deployments in iraq , immediately evacuated the operating room only the anesthesiologist , maj jeffrey rengel , who put on body armor , was left to watch the patient the surrounding hallways were secured , and a bomb disposal team was urgently summoned all electrical monitoring devices in the operating room were turned off for fear of detonating the round to keep track of the patient s vital signs , doctors turned to manual cuffs and a batteryoperated heart monitor , and they began counting drips per minute to estimate the amount of the intravenous they were giving the patient it was taking anesthesia back about 30 years , dr rengel said within a halfhour , the bomb disposal team arrived and confirmed , based on the cat scan , that the patient indeed had unexploded ordnance in his head they said , the way these things are set up , this type of round has an impact detonator on the front of the charge , dr bini said they just said , do n't drop it' with that for reassurance dr bini put on body armor as well , and he began the process of surgically removing the round from the patient s head , joined in the operating room only by dr rengel and a member of the bomb team he cut through scalp tissue and made a large incision encircling the round , which was lodged under a piece of skull bone and jutted down the right side of the patient s head within 10 minutes , he pulled out the live round with care , he handed it to the bomb technician , who put it in a bag and left did dr bini breathe a sigh of relief before handing off to a neurosurgeon \? i did n't even think about breathing a sigh of relief , dr bini said technically , it was n't a very complicated procedure , and i had the confidence that i was n't going to drop it on the floor this is something we train for although it s a very uncommon event in fact , dr bini had taught students how to remove live ordnance from patients in sessions at at lackland air force base , where he is stationed when not at war he just had never expected to have to do it in real time dr bini said that in the nearly nine years of war in iraq and afghanistan , if someone else had removed an unexploded round from a patient , he had not heard of it he said that a quick review of the medical literature found fewer than 50 cases over the last halfcentury the patient , who was not named by the doctors , has since been discharged from the at bagram and is recovering although the patient has brain injuries from bone fragments , dr bini said the afghan was able to walk , to talk and to eat on his own dr bini said he was unaware an unexploded bomb embedded in a patient s chest had been the plot of a tv show a twopart episode of grey s anatomy in 2006 the character hawkeye pierce also pulled an unexploded grenade out of the chest of a wounded soldier in an episode of mash in 1973 none of that stuff you see on tv approximates reality , dr bini said
it s been a longrunning relationship , spanning through good to bad times , from love to angry frustration bobcats coach larry brown clearly still feels a strong bond with his former star 76ers point guard allen iverson , and wishes he could do more to help him iverson and brown took the 76ers to the 2001 nba finals , the peak of their sixyear tenure together iverson , 35 , still wants to play basketball , but is without an interested nba team and even brown has not been able to offer him a home his business partner , gary moore , revealed this week iverson is considering a oneyear , 2 million contract with besiktas cola turka in ankara , turkey cola turka plays in the alevel of the turkish league and for the eurocup , with its current roster made up of turks , poles , russians and an australian none of cola turka s players has nba experience nobody who has done as much as allen has done for this league should have to be in turkey playing , to end his career , brown said thursday to aol fanhouse we have one of the most special players ever in our sport , who still has something left i feel terrible about this that is not how he should be ending his career sanem helvacikoylu , a cola turka staffer in charge of foreign relations , said friday that the team is expecting a timely response from iverson regarding its offer the turkish media is reporting iverson is seeking a contract without penalties , which usually kicks in if a player leaves the team or performs poorly while brown is sure iverson has something left , that sentiment is clearly not shared by the rest of the nba iverson , despite his slight 6foot frame , has been one of the best small guards in league history , averaging 267 points and 62 rebounds in 411 minutes per game over his 14year career the last two seasons , however , have been marred by a questionable commitment to playing iverson was traded from the nuggets to the pistons in 2008 as part of a multiplayer deal for chauncey billups , and promptly became a disruptive force iverson hurt team chemistry by his unwillingness to come off the bench he forced thenpistons coach michael curry to choose him over usual starter rip hamilton iverson developed a back injury in february 2009 , played sparingly and was shut down for the last month of the season the tumult divided the team and ultimately was a factor in costing curry his job the pistons affair ended when the team chose not to resign him iverson fired back , insisting curry deceived him iverson next went to the grizzlies , signing a oneyear deal iverson left the team a month into the new season , with both sides ending the contract by mutual agreement the 76ers welcomed him back in december 2009 , giving him a oneyear deal again , iverson didn t last long he left the team in february 2010 , citing the need to deal with a medical situation involving his 4yearold daughter he never returned to play the 76ers parted ways with iverson at the end of the season , and he s been on the hunt for a new place to play brown still praises iverson , despite the mounting evidence against iverson s commitment to playing within a system and fragile health brown s bobcats , owned by michael jordan , also passed on iverson i remember an nba coaches meeting this summer , someone from the nba staff , talking to me about , hey , this is not the way allen should be ending his career , brown said the commissioner \( david stern \) doesn t want to see it happen like this i feel terrible about it he did so much for me , and my career i wish i was in a position to help him , where it wouldn t affect the other guys i m coaching he needs to be on a great team that has a chance to win and could utilize what he does he doesn t need to be in turkey
in the press room at madison square garden during the last days of the regular season , reporters covering the rangers would speculate on which of the five teams would qualify for only three stanley cup playoff berths would it be the rangers , montreal , boston , atlanta , philadelphia \? before too long , someone would say , what s the difference they 're all going out in the first round anyway , and all would agree talk about a memory lapse how could anyone forget that there are thrilling firstround upsets each year \? last season , the no 1 team in the nhl , the san jose sharks , were eliminated in the first round by the no 8 anaheim ducks why , then , should it seem inconceivable that this year s no 1 team , the washington capitals , would be eliminated by the eighthseeded canadiens \? or , for that matter , that none of the top three eastern conference seeds would advance to the second round \? since the nhl installed the current playoff format in 1994 , the no 8 seed has upset the top seed nine times in 32 matchups in an even stranger record , that no 2 seeds are only 1715 vs no 7s in secondround matchups since 1994 it happened again in april the secondseeded devils \( 103 points \) lost to the seventhseeded philadelphia flyers \( 88 points \) , who did not earn a playoff berth until the final shootout of the season , against the rangers , and the canadiens ousted the capitals such is the nature of hockey firstround upsets occur far more frequently in the nhl than in the nba or nfl a hot goalie , like montreal s jaroslav halak , can shut down a mighty attack like the capitals a couple of decisive breaks boston s mark recchi s knocking over tim kennedy to make a precise centering pass that would win game 3 over the buffalo sabres , or the sabres' getting caught with too many men on the ice in overtime in game 4 and the bruins go on to win the series in six games or a goalie goes flat , as the devils' martin brodeur did against the flyers , while at the opposite end brian boucher suddenly becomes unbeatable and voil three firstround upsets it is important to keep the unpredictability of hockey in mind before anyone assumes the pittsburgh penguins have a clear path to defend their stanley cup it is in the nature of hockey to occasionally produce a cup champion like the 1938 blackhawks , who had a 385 regularseason winning percentage , or the 1949 maple leafs , at 475 but layered on top of the businessasusual surprises were some truly unexpected developments , more so than in recent years the winner in 24 of 49 firstround games trailed at some point a thirdperiod lead , formerly impervious , was successfully overcome nine times scoring was up 59 goals were scored per game , the highest for an opening round since 1996 and half a goal above this year s regularseason average despite the unusually high scoring in the first round , 12 of 49 games went to overtime , the most in the opening round in the last eight postseasons and road teams thrived as never before , setting a firstround record 27 wins , 22 losses three series tied the nhl mark for most road wins , with five each all the excitement seemed to captivate fans television viewership was up 35 percent over last spring on versus and up 18 percent on nbc north of the border , it was up 50 percent on cbc and a remarkable 89 percent on the canadian cable network tsn and what about those teams the rangers were battling for one of those final playoff berths \? at least one of them the bruins or flyers will advance to the eastern conference finals , one step away from the stanley cup finals the canadiens could , too , if halak can shut down sidney crosby and evgeni malkin the way he did alex ovechkin it s hard to believe , but had the rangers won that penalty shootout in philadelphia on the last day of the season , they could just as easily have been one of the triumphant underdogs
johannesburg eyes bulging , jaw clenched , tim howard punched the air with his gloved right fist so hard to make his point that it looked as if he was going to yank his arm out of its socket he had had to stop another of australia s 14 shots , and he was not happy about it howard had little trouble making the save , but the uncontested shot from the left of the penalty box was the result of a defensive lapse in the united states' carefully crafted game plan , one it will have to execute almost flawlessly to defeat england in its world cup opener saturday in rustenburg we 're going to have to defend like bandits , howard said we seem to find a way to usually do that if we get the opportunities in spurts and spells , we 're going to attack the world cup will not be won or lost in the first game , or even the opening round , from which the top two teams in each group advance to the knockout rounds but the urgency for some teams is greater than for others the world cup really is two tournaments , each phase requiring different tactics teams like the united states and the host , south africa , will have to contest every game as if it were the last just to advance from the group stage to the knockout rounds for tournament favorites like spain and brazil , the challenge is to keep their superstar players healthy , happy and motivated through the early games we 're here to first and foremost to qualify for the next round , the american defender steve cherundolo said i look at every game the same of course you do the scouting reports and you have different players on the other side of the field and different things to look out for , but for me , it s a chance to win three points that is the value of a victory a tie is worth one a team will most likely need at least four points to advance , but balancing the deliberateness required in the first round with the urgency of the second can be daunting too much strategizing can knock a player off his game you ca n't be thinking about it nonstop , said clint dempsey , a midfielder for the united states you 'll stress yourself out england , a team that expects to make a deep run in the tournament , will tinker with its lineup , depending on its opponent , perhaps resting players who may be more valuable in elimination games against presumably stronger rivals other teams , like brazil and portugal , who are in group g with ivory coast and north korea , will try to do only what they need to do to get out of the group phase , and hope their players hit their peak when the knockout rounds begin in 2006 , brazil cruised through the group stage , winning all three firstround games and scoring seven goals against weaker opponents , none of whom mustered more than one victory but brazil could not get out of second gear when the knockout rounds began the players were flat in their quarterfinal match against france , a team that hit its stride at the right time and reached the final , where it lost to italy teams can change formations and rotate players depending on the opponent a coach may deploy an offensive lineup against a weaker opponent in the first round to improve a team s goal differential , the first tiebreaker in the standings or he may opt for a more conservative posture against a stronger opponent in a knockout game , with an eye on a tie and a penalty shootout , where luck can trump skill another strategic challenge will be managing the unpredictable but inevitable suspensions a red card results in an automatic suspension for the next match but two yellow cards in any two games will also earn a player a onegame suspension in two of the last three world cups , england has had a player ejected from an eliminationround game , and the team went on to lose both in penaltykick shootouts england s star striker , wayne rooney , who was sent off during a quarterfinal in germany four years ago , will have to be especially careful he is an excitable player who often gets into arguments with referees if he receives a yellow card in an early game , coach fabio capello may bench him to avoid a second yellow and a suspension that would make him unavailable in a knockoutround game the americans have also had players suspended in past tournaments , and they can ill afford to lose players because coach bob bradley s disciplined defense and counterattacking style requires all 11 players to contribute there s a trust in the way we play , in keeping the lines tight and staying disciplined , said midfielder michael bradley , the coach s son we are a group of guys who fight for each other and are committed to the team and are willing to run and tackle and fight and give everything they have for each other the americans , preparing for england on tuesday , said they would not begin to focus on their second opponent , slovenia , until after the first game if you start looking too far ahead , michael bradley said , you 're not even going to get to oneanddone

in a new poll , more than 60 percent of respondents said televising supreme court proceedings would be good for democracy we agree , but the court seems determined to keep its work out of the public s eye since 1988 , cspan which broadcasts congressional debates , white house news conferences , think tank panels , and all manner of washington necessities and some oddities has been asking the supreme court for access the court has consistently refused when the cable network asked for permission to broadcast the arguments in bush v gore in 2000 , the court agreed only to release audiotapes after the fact in the big university of michigan affirmative action case of 2003 , the court again only released audiotapes cameras in the court would allow americans to see for themselves how an extremely powerful part of their government works they would also allow voters to hold presidents accountable for the quality of justices they nominate right now , we see the justices during their confirmation hearings and rarely after that opponents of televising the lower courts argue unpersuasively , in our opinion that cameras could deprive defendants of a fair trial by intimidating witnesses and jurors none of those concerns apply to the supreme court , where there are no witnesses or jurors the main objections are the justices' own concerns about privacy and a vague assertion that televising proceedings would somehow diminish the court in the new poll by new jersey s fairleigh dickinson university , only 26 percent of respondents believed that cameras would undermine the court s authority and dignity rather than opening up , the court has shown signs of turning further inward after president obama , in his state of the union address , criticized the court s recent ruling on corporate campaign spending , chief justice john roberts questioned whether the justices should continue to attend the event in january , the justices blocked a lower court from allowing trial video from a challenge to proposition 8 , california s antigay marriage initiative , to be broadcast on youtube last fall , senator arlen specter , democrat of pennsylvania , introduced a sense of the senate resolution urging the court to permit cameras the senate should pass the resolution to prod the court into the 21st century if the justices still resist , congress should pass a law requiring that the court s proceedings be televised
london the national ballet of cuba came to fame as the project of the ballerina alicia alonso , who founded it in 1948 during her exceptionally long stage career and despite the presence of other good dancers , she often eclipsed her own company now that she has retired from performing , her company and school have gone on producing dancers of note , including carlos acosta , one of the school s most celebrated alumni he and other dancers have become better advertisements for their alma mater than ms alonso herself but apart from its stars , how is the national ballet of cuba faring \? the company , including mr acosta , is appearing at the london coliseum swan lake took up its first week , while a mixed bill is filling its second and final week i chose to watch swan lake on a nonacosta night to get a better sense of the company the main impression left by the fridayevening performance was that of a lively but oldfashioned provincial troupe in most respects its work is havanaaccented russian stuck in a time warp half old soviet , half touring ballets russes this is n't dull it is often bizarre i kept thinking , but i have n't seen anyone dance like this for 20 years the company is also strangely inconsistent in act i the women mostly avoided high extensions of the leg , but then masiel alonso , as a peasant girl , did a solo in which her raised leg in arabesque kept reaching way above her head and in act iii anette delgado , as the antiheroine odile , threw her leg sideways so high she nearly clouted her partner \( javier torres \) in the ear the ensemble tended to keep strict time , with several phrases that made the swanmaidens of act ii look alternately mechanical or martial but in several solos , performers lagged behind the music amid the famous waltz of the swans , the two leading swans did a sequence of identical steps , but one was always a count behind the other the grand simplicity of the arms of the corps de ballet of swanmaidens in act ii and the epilogue was frequently beautiful , yet at times their hands made heavily angled effects that did n't continue the body s line into space they looked instead , at least to this alien eye , like a superimposed and insincere idea of old bolshoi swan deportment in acts i and iii the company was engaged , bright , festive it was a particular pleasure to notice how freely the dancers moved their torsos from side to side they all paid enthusiastic attention to one another the feet were n't elegant , but the footwork was brisk in act ii and the epilogue the swanmaidens were solemnly regimented it seemed as if they could dance up a storm if only they were in some other ballet the drama they suggested kept changing here they stretched those arms like proud swan wings , there they pranced in very emphatic clipclop steps , like horses doing dressage in most respects the production looked like a country cousin of the ones the bolshoi was doing in the 1950s after all the many other swan lakes set in various eras from the renaissance to the 1960s , it s a relief to see this ballet in the mythicchivalric middle ages of grail legends , just as tchaikovsky s music plainly intends the choreography is attributed to ms alonso based on the original by marius petipa and lev ivanov a few of her departures , as in the traveling lifts added to the act i pas de trois , are attractive and fresh , most of them are harmless , and a few are just odd this is n't the first swan lake that ends happily , with the prince vanquishing the sorcerer von rothbart , but it s the first i 've seen in which the heroine odette and her court are restored to colorful medieval clothes and her entire city brought into view there is a peskily cute jester , but one far less intrusive than the one in new york city ballet s version or some russian productions the women all gave the impression that they knew how to hold a static balance on point , and ms delgado , as odile , held several ad tedium tedium anyway pervaded the act iii virtuoso pas de deux that she danced with mr torres , a stodgy affair of pointscoring tricks , dull even as camp melodrama in act ii they showed that they knew theirs was a moving scene even if they themselves were n't actually moving or even moved they drew attention to big moments when this damsel in distress and prince cast beseeching looks at each other without once trying to make the ballet into a psychological drama about adults what s hardest to work out is how these cubans used their backs there was no modern gymnastlike exaggeration there were several good signs of fluidity and freedom , but often there was an inexpressive stiffness as with films and photographs of mid20thcentury ballerinas like tamara toumanova , i could see i was watching a style i just could n't comprehend which bits were meant to be stylish i hope that the cubans' mixed bill , magia de la danza , shows other faces of the company what was most disappointing about this swan lake was that while some dancers were strong , none were compelling you felt that all the best cuban ballet dancers have moved on , and that these are the ones left behind
vernon , vt a storm knocked out kathleen halvey s power for eight hours last wednesday , an event she found both disruptive and prescient i said to my husband , this is what it will be like without vermont yankee , ' ms halvey , 65 , a retired nurse , recalled saying on the day the state senate voted to close the plant here by withholding its operating certificate vermont would lose the source of onethird of its electricity , but residents say the move would forever change vernon , the small town on the connecticut river that has been the reactor s home for 38 years it will ruin this town , said robert miller , 49 , who works in an auto body shop and serves on the vernon selectboard the reactor is the area s largest source of highpaying jobs the average worker makes 100 , 000 with benefits , according to the , the louisianabased owner and the influx of employees has allowed the town to expand its elementary school and to build a library it has also provided residents with a hefty tax break many worry that last week s vote will torpedo their property values some residents said that the vote probably took 100 , 000 off the value of their homes it s always kept our taxes down , donna serviss , 48 , said that s the biggest thing people are worrying about , that they 'll tax us like crazy given the reactor s tangible benefits , vernon residents find themselves defending it against deteriorating support statewide on tuesday , 15 towns voted to call for the decommissioning of vermont yankee and for the state to explore alternative energy in a new survey of vermonters , conducted by opinion research corporation for the nonprofit civil society institute , twothirds of the respondents said they favored closing the reactor because of concerns about leaking radioactive tritium a problem that some two dozen of the nation s 104 reactors have reported , according to the misstatements officials made before the legislature and a cooling tower that collapsed in 2007 also influenced public opinion the majority of vernon residents remain fiercely loyal , arguing that the plant is safe despite the leak they feel that the amount of tritium leaking from the plant is too small to affect their health , and officials said none had been found in the drinking water those guys are n't going to jeopardize their own families , said marion mitchell , 60 , a school bus driver whose late husband worked in security at the plant they do n't want that running into the river , ms mitchell said ms mitchell said she took solace in the plant , which sits on the western bank of the river next to a farm to me , it s comforting , ms mitchell said i know that s weird i think it s pretty i like when the steam rolls up off the river on a clear night and the lights are on residents also take a peculiar pride , joking that the plant lends vernon and its residents a certain incandescence i always make jokes to people that we do n't use electricity in vernon at night because we all glow , ms serviss said for others in the region , last week s vote was a victory in january dozens of protesters marched 122 miles from vernon to montpelier , the state capital , to demand that the plant shut down and to lobby the state to look at alternative forms of energy \( in the recent survey , only 9 percent of the respondents wanted to power their homes \) opposition to the plant became more widespread after the leak was made public in january and increasingly high concentrations of tritium were found people were also angry about accusations that the company that runs the plant made false statements to state regulators about whether its underground pipes contained the material sarah childs gagnon of brattleboro , vernon s fiercely antinuclear neighbor , said it s an old plant that has served its purpose it s time to close it david coriell , a spokesman for gov jim douglas , a republican who is reserving judgment on the future of the plant , said the lights in vermont would stay on , but no one is sure right now who will supply the power if the plant closes it will continue to be an ongoing saga , mr coriell said of the fight to decommission the reactor if it s not relicensed in 2012 , vermont certainly will have power here in vernon , people said they were mostly concerned about the impact of the closing on vermont yankee s 650 fulltime employees and the ripple effect on neighboring massachusetts and new hampshire , where many employees live the plant also pays 138 million in state and local taxes annually with a renewed push for nuclear power in washington , many expect those skilled workers to leave vermont for other plants , leaving vernon , a town of 2 , 100 dotted with dairy farms , with few jobs residents are hoping that the federal government intervenes to save the plant \( considered unlikely \) or that someone files a lawsuit to determine that the federal government , not the state , should have authority over it \( a possibility \) those who have spent their careers in vernon and raised their children here , like wayne nickerson , are loath to leave mr nickerson , who grew up nearby , went to the plant in 1987 as a contractor and now works for entergy , has friends who earn 10 an hour at a lumber yard , while he makes about twice that if the plant closes , he said he would find a job elsewhere in the area , probably for 50

we don t have a million new shows , the cbs entertainment president nina tassler said wednesday at her network s upfront and we re not asking any of them to be selfstarters cbs , the no 1 network among total viewers , is placing established hits in front of its five new shows , hopefully encouraging more viewer sampling of what ms tassler called the cbs freshman class three series first announced 12 months ago undercover boss , the good wife and ncis los angeles now count as bona fide hits , she asserted cbs also canceled half a dozen series , including cold case and ghost whisperer , to make room for the new series the presentation heavily featured the big bang theory , cbs s standout sitcom , which is being moved to thursdays at 8 pm , from mondays at 9 30 for many many years , comedies like friends and the cosby show dominated 8 pm thursdays they owned television , she said , and cbs has its sights set on a renaissance \( advertiser premiums are known to be high on thursdays because movie studios promote their movies having their premieres on fridays \) ms tassler said the new sitcom that will be paired with big bang on thursdays , ! my dad says , proved that new media and traditional media are coming together in very cool ways the sitcom , which will star william shatner , is inspired by an explicit twitter feed \( the title of the show , when spoken aloud , will be bleep my dad says , but will be ! my dad says when rendered in print , cbs said \) cbs also previewed its new replacement for big bang , called mike molly , about an overweight man and woman and their friends ms tassler deemed it an endearing love story about two people who aren t perfect , except for each other on the drama front , cbs previewed three freshmen first up was defenders , a las vegas legal drama which ms tassler likens to a bromance the second was blue bloods , which will star tom selleck  the third , and definitely most anticipated , of the three dramas was hawaii 50 said ms tassler , this isn t a remake it s a thrilling reboot she concluded , he ll love it too , but this is so not your father s hawaii 50' the trailer was actionpacked to the point of being breathless decoder will post the video when it turns up online cbs also highlighted undercover boss , the biggest new reality show this season , which made its debut after the super bowl in the winter in the show , chief executives spend time surreptitiously working with frontline troops the network trotted out the chief executives who were featured on the first season of undercover boss to smile and wave to the audience \( it was quite glaring that none of the executives were female \) we can t wait for you to meet the new bosses , ms tassler said , but she dropped no hints about how cbs would manage to still surprise the unsuspecting employees , now that many if not most americans are in on the conceit of the series let me put it this way , mr moonves said when a reporter asked about the next season of boss , we re just going to have to be a little trickier than having a guy with a camera on his shoulder correction a previous version of this post said that the mentalist was among the three series first announced 12 months ago cbs entertainment president nina tassler actually referred to undercover boss

har bracha , twice a year , american evangelicals show up at a winery in this jewish settlement in the hills of ancient samaria to play a direct role in biblical prophecy , picking grapes and pruning vines believing that christian help for jewish winemakers here in the occupied west bank foretells christ s second coming , they are recruited by a tennesseebased charity called hayovel that invites volunteers to labor side by side with the people of and to share with them a passion for the soon coming jubilee in yeshua , messiah but during their visit in february the volunteers found themselves in the middle of the fight for land that defines daily life here when the evangelicals headed into the vineyards , they were pelted with rocks by who say the settlers have planted creeping grape vines on their land to claim it as their own two volunteers were hurt in the ensuing scuffle , a settler guard shot a 17yearold palestinian shepherd in the leg these people are filled with ideas that this is the promised land and their duty is to help the jews , said izdat said qadoos of the neighboring palestinian village it is not the promised land it is our land is one of many groups in the united states using taxexempt donations to help jews establish permanence in the israelioccupied territories effectively obstructing the creation of a palestinian state , widely seen as a necessary condition for middle east peace the result is a surprising juxtaposition as the american government seeks to end the fourdecade jewish settlement enterprise and foster a palestinian state in the west bank , the american treasury helps sustain the settlements through tax breaks on donations to support them a new york times examination of public records in the united states and israel identified at least 40 american groups that have collected more than 200 million in taxdeductible gifts for jewish settlement in the west bank and east jerusalem over the last decade the money goes mostly to schools , synagogues , recreation centers and the like , legitimate expenditures under the tax law but it has also paid for more legally questionable commodities housing as well as guard dogs , bulletproof vests , rifle scopes and vehicles to secure outposts deep in occupied areas in some ways , american tax law is more lenient than israel s the outposts receiving taxdeductible donations distinct from established settlements financed by israel s government are illegal under israeli law and a decade ago , israel ended tax breaks for contributions to groups devoted exclusively to settlementbuilding in the west bank now controversy over the settlements is sharpening , and the issue is sure to be high on the agenda when president obama and the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , meet in washington on tuesday while a succession of american administrations have opposed the settlements here , mr obama has particularly focused on them as obstacles to peace a twostate solution in the middle east , he says , is vital to defusing muslim anger at the west under american pressure , mr netanyahu has temporarily frozen new construction to get peace talks going the freeze and negotiations , in turn , have injected new urgency into the settlers' cause and into fundraising for it the use of charities to promote a foreign policy goal is neither new nor unique americans also take tax breaks in giving to propalestinian groups but the donations to the settler movement stand out because of the centrality of the settlement issue in the current talks and the fact that washington has consistently refused to allow israel to spend american government aid in the settlements tax breaks for the donations remain largely unchallenged , and unexamined by the american government the internal revenue service declined to discuss donations for west bank settlements state department officials would comment only generally , and on condition of anonymity it s a problem , a senior state department official said , adding , it s unhelpful to the efforts that we 're trying to make daniel c kurtzer , the united states ambassador to israel from 2001 to 2005 , called the issue politically delicate it drove us crazy , he said but it was a thing you did n't talk about in polite company he added that while the private donations could not sustain the settler enterprise on their own , a couple of hundred million dollars makes a huge difference , and if carefully focused , creates a new reality on the ground most contributions go to large , established settlements close to the boundary with israel that would very likely be annexed in any peace deal , in exchange for land elsewhere so those donations produce less concern than money for struggling outposts and isolated settlements inhabited by militant settlers even small donations add to their permanence for example , when israeli authorities suspended plans for permanent homes in maskiot , a tiny settlement near jordan , in 2007 , two american nonprofits the and raised tens of thousands of dollars to help erect temporary structures , keeping the community going until officials lifted the building ban israeli security officials express frustration over donations to the illegal or more defiant communities i am not happy about it , a senior military commander in the west bank responded when asked about contributions to a radical religious academy whose director has urged soldiers to defy orders to evict settlers he spoke under normal israeli military rules of anonymity palestinian officials expressed outrage at the tax breaks settlements violate international law , and the united states is supposed to be sponsoring a twostate solution , yet it gives deductions for donation to the settlements \? said saeb erekat , the chief palestinian negotiator the settlements are a sensitive issue among american jews themselves some major jewish philanthropies , like the , generally do not support building activities in the west bank the donors to settlement charities represent a broad mix of americans from wealthy people like the hospital magnate dr irving i moskowitz and the family behind haagendazs ice cream to bidders at kosher pizza auctions in brooklyn and evangelicals at a recent bible meeting in a long island basement but they are unified in their belief that returning the west bank site of the ancient jewish kingdoms to full jewish control is critical to israeli security and fulfillment of biblical prophecies as kimberly troup , director of the christian friends of israeli communities' american office , said , while her charity s work is humanitarian , the more that we build , the more that we support and encourage their right to live in the land , the harder it s going to be for disengagement , for withdrawal today half a million israeli jews live in lands captured during the june 1967 middle east war yet there is a strong international consensus that a palestinian state should arise in the west bank and gaza , where all told some four million palestinians live ultimately , any agreement will be a compromise , a sorting out of the facts on the ground most jewish residents of the west bank live in what amount to suburbs , with neat homes , high rises and highways to jerusalem and tel aviv politically and ideologically , they are indistinguishable from israel proper most will doubtless stay in any peace deal , while those who must move will most likely do so peacefully but in the geographically isolated settlements and dozens of illegal outposts , there are settlers who may well violently resist being moved the prospect of an internal and deeply painful israeli confrontation looms and the resisters will very likely be aided by taxdeductible donations from americans who believe that far from quelling muslim anger , as mr obama argues , handing over the west bank will only encourage militant islamists bent on destroying israel we need to influence our congressmen to stop obama from putting pressure on israel to selfdestruct , helen freedman , a new yorker who runs a charity called , told supporters touring the west bank this spring israel , too , used to offer its residents tax breaks for donations to settlement building , starting in 1984 under a likud government but those donations were ended by the labor party , first in 1995 and then , after reversal , again in 2000 the finance minister in both cases , avraham shohat , said that while he only vaguely recalled the decisionmaking process , as a matter of principle he believed in deductions for gifts to education and welfare for the poor , not to settlement building per se in theory , the same is true for the united states , where the tax code encourages citizens to support nonprofit groups that may diverge from official policy , as long as their missions are educational , religious or charitable the challenge is defining those terms and enforcing them there are more than a million registered charities , and many submit sparse or misleading mission summaries in tax filings religious groups have no obligation to divulge their finances , meaning settlements may be receiving sums that cannot be traced the times s review of prosettler groups suggests that most generally live within the rules of the american tax code some , though , risk violating them by using the money for political campaigning and residential property purchases , by failing to file tax returns , by setting up boards of trustees in name only and by improperly funneling donations directly to foreign organizations one group that at least skates close to the line is friends of zo artzeinu manhigut yehudit , based in cedarhurst , ny , and cofounded by shmuel sackett , a former executive director of the banned israeli political party kahane chai records from the group say a portion of the 52 million it has collected over the last few years has gone to the israeli community facilities of manhigut yehudit , a hardright faction of mr netanyahu s governing likud party , which mr sackett helps run with the politician moshe feiglin american tax rules prohibit the use of charitable funds for political purposes at home or abroad neither man would answer questions about the nature of the community facilities in an email message , mr sackett said the american charity was not devoted to political activity , but to humanitarian projects and educating the public about the need for authentic jewish leadership in israel of course , groups in the prosettler camp are not the only ones benefiting from tax breaks for example , the , which organized the flotilla seeking to break israel s blockade of gaza , says on its web site that supporters can make taxdeductible donations to it through the american educational trust , publisher of an araboriented journal israeli civil and human rights groups like peace now , which are often accused of having a blatant political agenda , also benefit from taxdeductible donations some prosettler charities have obscured their true intentions take the capital athletic foundation , run by the disgraced washington lobbyist jack abramoff in its irs filings , the foundation noted donations totaling more than 140 , 000 to kollel ohel tiferet , a religious study group in israel , for educational and athletic purposes in reality , a study group member was using the money to finance a paramilitary operation in the beitar illit settlement , according to documents in a senate investigation of mr abramoff , who pleaded guilty in 2006 to defrauding clients and bribing public officials mr abramoff , documents show , had directed the settler , shmuel ben zvi , an old high school friend , to use the study group as cover after his accountant complained that money for sniper equipment and a jeep in terms of complying with the foundation s taxexempt status while the donations by mr abramoff s charity were elaborately disguised the group shipped a camouflage sniper suit in a box labeled grandmother tree costume for the play pocahontas other groups are more open amitz rescue security , which has raised money through two brooklyn nonprofits , trains and equips guard units for settlements its encourages donors to send a taxdeductible check for nightvision binoculars , bulletproof vehicles and guard dogs other groups urge donors to give to one of several nonprofits that serve as clearinghouses for donations to a wide array of groups in israel and the west bank , which , if not done properly , can skirt the intent of american tax rules americans cannot claim deductions for direct donations to foreign charities tax laws allow deductions for domestic giving on the theory that charities ultimately ease pressure on government spending for social programs but the irs does allow deductions for donations to american nonprofits that support charitable projects abroad , provided the nonprofit is not simply a funnel to another group overseas , according to bruce r hopkins , a lawyer and the author of several books on nonprofit law donors can indicate how they would like their money to be used , but the nonprofit must exercise some measure of independence to deliberate on grantmaking , he said a prominent clearinghouse is the central fund of israel , operated from the marcus brothers textiles offices in the manhattan garment district dozens of west bank groups seem to view the fund as little more than a vehicle for channeling donations back to themselves , instructing their supporters that if they want a tax break , they must direct their contributions there first the fund s president , hadassah marcus , acknowledged that it received many checks from donors who want them to go to different programs in israel , but , she said , the fund retains ultimate discretion over the money it also makes its own grants to needy jewish families and monitors them , she said , adding that the fund , which collected 13 million in 2008 , was audited and complies with irs rules we 're not a funnel we 're trying to build a land , she said , adding , all we 're doing is going back to our home late one afternoon in march , vice president joseph r biden jr landed in israel and headed to his jerusalem hotel to prepare for a weeklong effort to rekindle middle east peace talks across town , many of the leading israeli officials on mr biden s schedule , among them prime minister netanyahu , were in a convention hall listening to , an influential american preacher whose charities have donated millions to projects in israel and the territories support for the settlements has become a cause of some leading conservative republicans , like and  israel exists because of a covenant god made with abraham , isaac and jacob 3 , 500 years ago and that covenant still stands , mr hagee thundered world leaders do not have the authority to tell israel and the jewish people what they can and cannot do in the city of jerusalem the next day , israeliamerican relations plunged after israel announced plans for 1 , 600 new apartments for jews in east jerusalem , which the palestinians want as their future capital israeli officials said mr hagee s words of encouragement had no effect on government decision making and the preacher s aides said he was not trying to influence the peace talks , just defending israel s right to make decisions without foreign pressure still , his presence underscored the role of settlement supporters abroad nowhere is that effort more visible , and contentious , than in east jerusalem , which the netanyahu government says must remain under israeli sovereignty in any peace deal the government supports privately financed archaeological projects that focus on jewish roots in arab areas of jerusalem the obama administration and the united nations have recently criticized a plan to raze 22 palestinian homes to make room for a history park in a neighborhood where a nonprofit group called el'ad finances digs and buys up arabowned properties to raise money , groups like el'ad seek to bring alive a narrative of jewish nationalism in living rooms and banquet halls across america in may , a crowd of mostly jewish professionals who paid 300 a plate to benefit the american friends of ateret cohanim gathered in a catering hall high above flushing meadowscorona park in queens to dine and hear john r bolton , united nations ambassador under president george w bush , warn of the danger of a nucleararmed iran a few days earlier , the group s executive vice president , susan hikind , had gone on a jewish radio program in new york to proclaim her group s resistance to american policy in the middle east the obama administration , she said , did not want donors to attend the banquet because it believed jerusalem should be part of some future capital of a palestinian state and who s standing in the way of that \? ms hikind said people who support ateret cohanim s work in jerusalem to ensure that jerusalem remains united the jerusalem reclamation project of ateret cohanim works to transfer ownership of arab homes to jewish families in east jerusalem such efforts have generated much controversy islamic judicial panels have threatened death to palestinians who sell property in the occupied territories to jews , and sales are often conducted using shell companies and intermediaries land reclamation is actually sort of a bad name redeeming is probably a better word , said d bernard hoenig , a new york lawyer on the board of american friends of ateret cohanim the fact of the matter is , there are arabs who want to sell their homes , and they have offered our organization the opportunity to buy them mr hoenig said that ateret cohanim bought a couple of buildings years ago , but that mostly it helps arrange purchases by other jewish investors that is not mentioned , however , on its american affiliate s tax returns rather , they describe its primary charitable purpose as financing higher educational institutions in israel , as well as children s camps , help for needy families and security for jews living in east jerusalem indeed , it does all those things it houses yeshiva students and teachers in properties it helps acquire and places kindergartens and study institutes into other buildings , all of which helps its activities qualify as educational or religious for tax purposes the american affiliate provides roughly 60 percent of ateret cohanim s funding , according to representatives of the group but mr hoenig said none of the american money went toward the land deals , since they would not qualify for taxdeductible donations still , acquiring property has been an integral part of ateret cohanim s fundraising appeals archived pages from a web site registered to the american affiliate taken down in the last year or so described in detail how ateret cohanim quietly and discreetly arranged the acquisition of buildings in palestinian areas and it sought donations for the expected leftwing arab legal battle , building costs and other expenses \( organizational , planning , arab middlemen , etc \) deep inside the west bank , in the northern region called samaria , or shomron , lie 30 or so settlements and unauthorized outposts , most considered sure candidates for evacuation in any deal for a palestinian state in terms of donations , they do not raise anywhere near the sums produced for jerusalem or closein settlements but in many ways they worry security officials and the palestinians the most , because they are so unyielding out here , the communities have a rougher feel some have only a few paved roads , and mobile homes for houses residents men with skullcaps and sidelocks , women with head coverings , and families with many children often speak in apocalyptic terms about the need for jews to stay on the land it may take generations , they say , but god s promise will be fulfilled in november , after the netanyahu government announced , shomron leaders invited reporters to watch them shred the orders david ha'ivri , the public liaison for the local government , the shomron regional council , has positioned himself as a fierce yet amiable advocate as a leader of an americanbased nonprofit , he also brings a militant legacy to the charitable enterprise mr ha'ivri , formerly david axelrod , was born in far rockaway , queens , and was a student of the virulently antiarab rabbi meir david kahane and a top lieutenant and brotherinlaw to the rabbi s son , binyamin kahane both kahanes , who were assassinated 10 years apart , ran organizations banned in israel for instigating , if not participating in , attacks against arabs the united states treasury department later added both groups , kach and kahane chai , to its terrorism watch list as recently as four years ago , mr ha'ivri was involved in running the way of the torah , a kahanist newsletter designated as a terrorist organization in the united states he has had several runins with the authorities in israel over the last two decades , including an arrest for celebrating the assassination of prime minister yitzhak rabin in a television interview and a sixmonth jail term in connection with the desecration of a mosque treasury officials said a group s presence on the terror list does not necessarily extend to its former leaders , and indeed mr ha'ivri is not on it mr ha'ivri said he no longer engaged in such activism , adding that , at 43 , he had mellowed , even if his core convictions had not i'm a little older now , a little more mature , he said a sunday in late may found him in new york , on a stage in central park , speaking at the annual israel day concert we will not ever , ever give up our land , mr ha'ivri said he posed for pictures with the republican national committee chairman , michael steele , and distributed fliers about the 501 c3 irs tax deductible status of his charity , , which has raised more than 26 million since 2004 for the shomron communities although irs rules require that american charities exhibit full control of the donated funds and discretion as to their use , shuva israel appears to be dominated by israeli settlers mr ha'ivri , who lives in the settlement of kfar tapuach , was listed as the group s executive director in its most recent tax filing gershon mesika , the shomron council s leader , is the board s chairman and shuva israel s accountant is based in the settlement of tekoa its american presence is through a post office box in austin , tex , where , according to its tax filings , it has two volunteers who double as board members i 've never been to the board , said one of them , jeff luftig when asked about his dual status as leader of the charity and an official with the council it supports , mr ha'ivri said he was no longer executive director , though he could not recall who was he said he was confident the charity was following the law , adding that the money it raises goes strictly toward improving the lives of settlers if mr ha'ivri has changed tactics , a new generation has picked up his aggressive approach these activists also receive american support their campaign has been named price tag for every move by israeli authorities to curtail settlement construction , the price will be an attack on an arab mosque , vineyard or olive grove the results were on display during a recent tour through the arab village of hawara , where the wall of a mosque had been desecrated with graffiti of a jewish star and the first letters of the prophet muhammad s name in hebrew in the nearby palestinian village of mikhmas , the deputy mayor , mohamed damim , said settlers had come in the dark of night and uprooted or cut down hundreds of olive and fig trees the army has done nothing to protect us , he said though the attacks are small by nature , israeli commanders fear they threaten to scuttle the uneasy peace they and their palestinian authority partners have forged in the west bank it can bring the entire west bank to light up again in terror and violence , a senior commander said in an interview israeli law enforcement officials say that in investigating settler violence in the north , they often turn to people connected to the od yosef chai yeshiva in the yitzhar settlement after the arson of a mosque in yasuf in december , authorities arrested the yeshiva s head rabbi , yitzhak shapira , and several students but released them for lack of evidence rabbi shapira denied involvement he is known in israel for his strong views he was released last year that offered religious justification for killing nonjews who pose a threat to jews or , in the case of young children , could in the future a plaque inside the recently built yeshiva thanks dr moskowitz , the hospitals entrepreneur , and his wife , cherna , for their continuous and generous support another recognizes benjamin landa of brooklyn , a nursing home operator who gave through his foundation , ohel harav yehoshua boruch mr landa said he donated to the yeshiva after its old building was destroyed in an arab ransacking none of the american donations have been linked to the campaign of attacks the israeli military has activated outstanding permit violations that have set the stage for the yeshiva s threatened demolition and officials have barred some of the yeshiva s students from the west bank for months on end od yosef chai s director , itamar posen , said in an interview that the military was unfairly singling out the yeshiva because the things that we publish are things that are against their ideas , and they are frightened mr ha'ivri and mr mesika have charged the military with jeopardizing the men s livelihoods without due process a settler legal defense fund , honenu , with its own american charitable arm , has sought to provide a safety net an online appeal for taxdeductible donations to be sent to honenu s queensbased post office read , if the 3 men can have their families supported it will cause others at the hilltops to brave military and government threats against them reached last month , one of the men , akiva hacohen , declined to say how much support he had received from american donors honenu officials in israel declined to comment as well there is no way to tell from honenu s american tax returns none was available through guidestar , a service that tracks tax filings by nonprofits groups that raise less than 25 , 000 a year are not required to file but a review of tax returns filed by other charities showed that one american family foundation gave it 33 , 000 in a single year , enough to have required filing asked whether it had ever filed a tax return , aaron heimowitz , a financial planner in queens who collects honenu s donations there , responded , i'm not in a position to answer that religious charities are still more opaque the tax code does not require them to disclose their finances publicly mr hagee is one of the few christian zionists who advertises his philanthropy in israel and its territories , at least 58 million as of last year , distributed through a multimedia empire that spins out a stream of books , dvds and cds about israel s role in biblical prophecy mr hagee s aides say he makes a large majority of his donations within israel s 1967 boundaries and seeks to avoid disputed areas yet a sports complex in the large settlement of ariel bears his name and a few years ago , according to officials at the yeshiva at har bracha , mr hagee donated 250 , 000 to expand a dormitory is the main growth engine of the settlement , attracting students who put down roots \( some are soldiers , and the head rabbi there has called upon them to refuse orders to evict settlers \) after the yeshiva was started in 1992 , the place just took off , growing to more than 200 families from 3 , said the yeshiva s spokesman , yonaton behar the goal , he added , is to grow to the point where there is no question of uprooting har bracha various strains of american prosettlement activity come together in har bracha the moskowitz family helped pay for the yeshiva s main building nearby , a winery was built with volunteer help from hayovel ministries , which brings large groups of volunteers to prune and harvest mr ha'ivri s charity promotes the program the winery s owner , nir lavi , says his land is statesanctioned but officials in the neighboring palestinian village of iraq burin say part of the vineyard was planted on ground taken from their residents in a parcelbyparcel land grab such disputes are typical for the area , as are the opposing accounts of what happened that february day when hayovel s leader , tommy waller , and his volunteers say they came under attack and the shepherd was shot they came up screaming , slinging their rockslings like david going after a giant , mr waller said a har bracha security guard came to the rescue by shooting in the air , not aiming for the attackers , he added but , in an interview , the shepherd , amid qadoos , said settlers started the scuffle by throwing rocks at him as he was grazing his sheep on village land a few yards from the vineyard , telling him , you are not allowed here he and his friends then threw rocks in retaliation , he said , prompting the security guard to shoot him in the back of his leg his father , aref qadoos , added , they want us to go so they can confiscate the land , through planting though two volunteers were hurt , mr waller said neither he nor his group would be deterred people are drawn to our work who believe the bible is true and desire to participate in the promises of god , he said we believe the restoration of israel , including samaria and judea , is part of that promise in the last year , he said , he brought 130 volunteers here this coming year , he said , he expects as many as 400
growing up , roger mason jr practiced the moves that were created by america s basketball imagination there was the crossover dribble , with the player moving the ball from one hand to the other , and the fadeaway jump shot , with the player leaping backward while shooting to create distance from the defender but only after he became a professional did mason decide to expand globally , adding fakes and feints and other moves that were manufactured elsewhere he is not alone players in the now often , a move in which a player drives past a defender by stepping one way and then quickly taking a big lateral step in the other direction the move is a crafty way to distribute the two steps allocated to a player after he stops dribbling , and it goes right to the edge of  mason , now with the knicks , learned the move during his two seasons in san antonio , where in practice he had to guard manu ginobili of argentina and tony parker of france , both of them practitioners of the euro step , both of them stars mason eventually began tinkering with the move himself i think that s why people are starting to use it , because it s still a fresh move , mason said everyone in the league thought it was a travel , and they never called it but the euro step is not the only import that has taken hold in the nba argentina s luis scola , of the houston rockets , uses a whole series of pump fakes to throw off a defender before scooping the ball into the basket now , other players are doing the same germany s dirk nowitzki , who has long starred for the dallas mavericks , has his own shot fake , in which he raises the ball from his chest to his chin others have copied that , too and nba coaches are borrowing as well , taking plays out of the notebooks of their european counterparts considering the wellestablished presence of foreign players in the nba 84 international players were on nba rosters when the 201011 season began none of this should be surprising and in the wake of repeated american setbacks in international play over the past decade and with the awakening sense that the best international players have become more clever and skillful than many american players , the mimicry becomes almost necessary their great players have influenced our younger generation of guys to pick up some of their moves , said tony ronzone , usa basketball s director of international player personnel and an assistant general manager for the minnesota timberwolves it s the same thing with the european guys when they were growing up , they were watching tv and mimicking our moves the nba s quickest and most efficient players , americanborn stars like dwyane wade and rajon rondo , now use the euro step to get to the rim kentucky coach john calipari teaches it to his players , and naturally enough , some of those who recently played for him as undergraduates derrick rose , tyreke evans and john wall are using it in the pros that s the beauty of basketball , the miami heat s mike miller said if you 're a basketball player and you want to get better , you 're going to take things from everybody they take stuff from what we do we take stuff from what they do the lithuanian sarunas marciulionis is credited with bringing the euro step to the nba he played with four teams in the 1990s before it became common for international players to join the nba ginobili then  in the recent preseason , several nets practiced the euro step in their layup line demar derozan , a secondyear guard for the toronto raptors , said he started using the move in high school in california after watching ginobili pull it off it s different , derozan said it s really different you 're showing the illusion that you 're going one way , and you 're really going another it s a creative move to some observers , the euro step helps underscore the difference between the way players develop in the united states , where the emphasis has traditionally been on athleticism , and the way they develop in europe , where young players tend to spend hours on skill development americans tend to play in straight lines , where europeans are craftier going around a guy , noted david thorpe , a private trainer for several nba players and an espn basketball analyst thorpe teaches a variation of the euro step in which he instructs players to decelerate as they start the move to get a defender more off balance he also teaches another european move that calls for a player who has the ball to fake a crossover dribble but instead keep the ball in the same hand and whip it back in the other direction imagine the ball as a clock , he said when you cross over for a righthanded player , your hand is at 2 when the ball is switched to the left hand , the ball is at 7 but , thorpe said , in this move , the dribbler rolls the ball in his right hand toward 9 30 or 10 on the clock and then pushes it back to around 4 mitch lancaster , a private trainer for hoops city u in durham , nc , instructs players who are 5 years old and some who are playing professionally overseas he began teaching the euro step about three years ago and , like thorpe , sees it as emblematic of a style of basketball that is more nuanced and driven by technique the main problem we have in america , and the reason people are starting to look to europe , is because they 're more focused on player development , lancaster said here , we 're not now , we 're trying to take it a step further we 're teaching kids at third grade the euro step the younger you can teach them , the more advanced they 're going to be a variation on this theme comes from raptors coach jay triano , who served as an assistant for the united states in the recent world basketball championships , a tournament won by the americans in preparation for the event , triano scouted opponents like lithuania , turkey and russia and took note of plays that he could use for the raptors he observed how european players received open shots through quick ball movement instead of the nba s normal reliance on the pickandroll i stole a bunch of plays , triano said as coaches , we do that a bunch of times my goal is to incorporate the same athleticism of our players into the ability to run continuity and movement sets the way that the european teams do we are learning from them , and hopefully it helps us amid those borrowing innovations from outside the united states , there are still players in the nba who do not necessarily look abroad the allstar point guard steve nash is often lauded for his onehanded passes and because of his ability to jump from either foot on a layup nash was born in south africa and raised in canada , and some have assumed that his game must have roots in european play not at all , nash said , i 'd say isiah thomasinspired
lemont , ill although the prospect of winning the pga tour playoffs for the fedex cup and its 10 million bonus is real for some of the 70 players in the bmw championship , there are others , like tom gillis , whose entire year will be made just by making the 30man field for in two weeks it is a little stunning , however , when gillis , an obscure 41yearold journeyman , says he thinks some of the fedex cup perks may be a little too much like exemptions into the first three major championships in 2011 , and into the world golf championship event at doral you could have someone getting into the major championships just because they got hot for a couple weeks in the playoffs , said gillis , who has qualified for three united states opens and two british opens during his 20year professional career i think that s a little too high for the value received i think it should still be based on the money list that provides a glimpse into the work ethic of gillis , a solidlybuilt man who is the very embodiment of a journeyman until last week , few beyond the golf world knew who he was even after he finished fifth at the deutsche bank championship his highest finish on the pga tour one writer who regularly covers the tour summarized his knowledge of gillis by saying , i could not pick tom gillis out of a lineup of guys named tom gillis gillis is now in a lineup with guys named tiger woods and phil mickelson , on the game s biggest stage , playing for more money than he ever imagined during his odyssey through golf s hinterlands , which began in 1990 with five unremarkable years in europe and was later highlighted by finishes of 139th and 156th during pga tour seasons in 2003 and 2005 , gillis suffered through three wrist operations and a lot of self doubt if we talked about the journey we 'd be here a long time , gillis said wednesday , adding , i still know for a fact and i believe in my heart i can win out here it s very gratifying i mean , i'm humbled that i'm this far , and i still think i can go farther it is telling that gillis believes he can win he was on the verge of quitting professional golf a few years ago , but decided instead to work his way through , to somehow get back to the pga tour before his small window of opportunity closed for good in 2007 , he began working with a canadian teacher , jeff leishman , who lives in jupiter , fla , where he also coaches tour players like richard johnson and will mackenzie by 2009 , gillis had completely changed his swing , eliminating a steep move that had caused his wrist injuries and making over his putting , which improved from 130th in the rankings during his last stint on the tour to 17th this year the changes in gillis s game began last year on the nationwide tour , a place he said he believed was beneath him when he first went there after his years in europe this time around , he made the most of the opportunity , moving up the money list with a lateseason win in the players cup and continuing the climb with a secondplace finish and a tie for third that put him second over all on the money list that gave him a pga tour exemption for 2010 now gillis is at 48th on the points list , one spot ahead of angel cabrera and three ahead of woods , who is in a battle of his own to get to the tour championship in atlanta woods has none of the eligibility concerns that gillis has for next season , but both have an intense desire to win and a belief that they can to be quite honest with you , i would say i'm disappointed right now , gillis said i would have thought i 'd have had more chances to win i think some of it is probably just a little inexperience for being in those situations and on that stage there s a lot going on on sunday , and i think you learn to deal with it , and i believe i dealt with it much better last week i think that s probably what i'm proudest of , finishing 6565 on the weekend , he added i'm really happy with the way i handled that part of it , the mental part that i had been struggling with before if he can duplicate the finish this week at cog hill that he had last week at tpc boston , he will be in the tour championship he says he can has it taken a little longer than i thought to be in contention \? he said i 'd say , yeah , it has' i really , in my heart i think as a player you 've got to think , why would you play if you did n't think you could win \? and i thought i could , and i still think i can

president obama has spoken eloquently about his vision of a world without nuclear weapons it is a lofty goal that will not be achieved during his presidency or for years after that but in a very dangerous time , he is taking important steps to make the world safer and bolster this country s credibility as it tries to constrain the nuclear ambitions of iran , north korea and others two decades after the end of the cold war , the united states and russia still have a combined total of more than 20 , 000 nuclear weapons mr obama has revived arms control negotiations , and later this week , he and president dmitri medvedev of russia will sign a new agreement \( the first since 2002 \) that will reduce the number of strategic warheads each side has deployed from 2 , 200 to 1 , 550 on tuesday , his nuclear posture review it does not go as far as it should , but it is an important down payment on a saner nuclear policy the document substantially narrows the conditions under which the united states would use nuclear weapons the last review done in 2002 by the george w bush administration gave nuclear weapons a critical role in defending the country and its allies and suggested that they could be used against foes wielding chemical , biological or even conventional forces the new review says the fundamental role of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack on the united states and its allies , and it rules out the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries , even if they attack the united states with unconventional weapons there is an important caveat that assurance only goes to countries that are in compliance with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , which leaves out north korea and iran it would have been better if mr obama made the sole purpose of nuclear weapons deterring a nuclear attack no one in their right mind can imagine the united states ever using a nuclear weapon again america s vast conventional military superiority is more than enough to defend against most threats this formulation seems mainly intended to deter hardline critics on capitol hill but any loophole undercuts washington s arguments that nonnuclear states have no strategic reason to develop their own arms mr obama has wisely made the prevention of nuclear terrorism and proliferation a central strategic priority and the administration has rightly decided to lead by example we were especially encouraged to see the review s statement that the country will not develop new nuclear warheads there is still some wiggle room , which we hope is not exercised new nuclear warheads are not needed the review commits to pursuing further arms reductions with russia and it says that future talks must also focus on cutting back the 15 , 000 warheads , in total , that the united states and russia keep as backup the socalled hedge and shortrange nuclear weapons the united states has 500 tactical nuclear weapons , which are considered secure , but russia has 3 , 000 or more that are far too vulnerable to theft any agreement will take years to complete , and mr obama and mr medvedev should start talking now the review also commits to talking to china about its arsenal mr obama has committed to maintaining the safety and security of america s nuclear stockpile he has already backed that up with an extra 624 million in next year s budget for the nuclear labs and promised far too generously , in our view an additional 5 billion over the next five years to build up their aging infrastructure mr obama has also promised support for more advanced conventional arms none of those measures are likely to quiet his critics , who already are charging that mr obama is weakening america s defenses they will likely get even louder when it comes time to ratify the new start treaty with russia and the longdeferred comprehensive test ban treaty the stakes for this country s security are high and most americans are n't paying attention mr obama has a strong argument he will need to push back hard
a seat on the supreme court was once a natural terminus of a career in public service after years in the sweaty tangle of state fairs and backrooms , many a senator , governor and even president yearned for the quiet power of the court and many from charles evans hughes to earl warren served there with distinction which makes it strange that some people now regard the idea as unwise we 've come to believe that anyone who has ever stated a position on anything of consequence cannot be confirmed cynics question why we would invite craven , beholden , goodfornothing politicians onto the court , where they might do real damage or behave , well , politically and we all know justices do that the counterarguments are more persuasive politicians are dealcutters , consensusbuilders , and our divided court needs those there ought to be a place on the bench for judges who understand , as president obama put it , beyond this , constitutional interpretation has never been the sole province of appellate judges our understanding of the constitution evolves in a dialogue among judges , yes , but also legislators , academics , journalists and ordinary people as franklin d roosevelt said , the constitution should be seen as a layman s document , not a lawyer s contract when justice john paul stevens retires , the supreme court will be left without a sitting war veteran he enlisted in the navy the day before pearl harbor and , as an intelligence officer , was involved with the codebreaking efforts in the pacific decades later , justice stevens s service gave him a visceral appreciation for war and the military institution , and left in him a healthy skepticism toward executive power , particularly the use of that power in wartime this carried forward into some of his most important opinions , as in in 2006 , which ruled military commissions inconsistent with the geneva conventions and america s system of military justice the court s impending military gap reflects america s widening civilmilitary divide fewer than one percent of americans serve in the armed forces and , consistent with these numbers , fewer veterans now serve in congress or on the federal bench than at any time since world war ii but our nation remains at war , and many of the court s toughest cases arise out of these wars , from battlefield contracts to warrantless surveillance the supreme court needs a new justice who will bring national security credentials , and a personal connection to the military , to its cloistered chambers youth may be wasted on the young , but its distinct experiences and perspectives can add a lot to a group that skews old even minus the nonagenarian justice stevens , the current supreme court has four justices born in the 1930s , one in the 1940s and three in the 1950s maybe it s time to move past the baby boomers and choose a justice for whom the internet is not some newfangled contraption with youth comes openness , new ideas and energy joseph story was appointed to the court at age 32 by james madison his generation of northerners had a fresher perspective on slavery than the framers who preceded him he went on to write the opinion freeing the enslaved africans in the famous amistad case william o douglas , named at age 40 by franklin d roosevelt , devised the right to privacy that gave us reproductive freedom , while also becoming a leader in the creation of environmental law postboomers have grown up during not only a technological revolution but a demographic one they are comfortable with people who live and think differently the justices have the job of applying the constitution to the problems of a fastchanging world given that john mccain won a majority of voters over 40 in 2008 , does n't it make sense for at least one justice to come from the america that made barack obama president \?  the supreme court must understand that the promise of religious freedom , as understood by the founders and by most americans today , is that we may choose our religion , or choose to have none this voluntaristic view is particularly american , particularly protestant and particularly important to evangelical protestants evangelicals also preserve the founders' notion , embodied in the constitution s division of powers , of human fallibility , in which concentrated authority is dangerous and an earthly utopia unreachable justices who understand this are likely to protect liberty against governmental encroachment and to recognize that they may misuse their own powers evangelicals have no monopoly on this perspective , of course , nor should there be a religious test for a supreme court nomination yet choosing an evangelical justice to fill john paul stevens s vacant seat would bring valuable diversity to the court and enhance trust among evangelicals perhaps a third of the country who may wonder whether the court understands their most important commitments while it s true that a protestant , muslim or buddhist justice would diversify the supreme court s religious makeup once john paul stevens leaves , the remaining members will all be either jewish or roman catholic it might be even better for the country if president obama were to pick someone who is not a member of any mainstream religion at all his nominee should be someone who is either atheist or agnostic or spiritual but not religious , a fastgrowing demographic in recent decisions , the supreme court has resisted acknowledging the country s religious diversity , instead attempting to characterize the united states as monotheistic , as though that captures the actual variety of beliefs most recently , in justice anthony kennedy , writing for the majority , treated a christian cross as though it was the standard grave marker for all fallen american soldiers yet arlington national cemetery itself offers 41 different images for gravestones any limitation on religion is considered by the conservatives on the court as hostility toward that faith rather than liberty for people outside it a nonbelieving justice most likely would challenge that approach this is an opportunity for president obama to affirm to the world the one absolute right on which this nation is built the right to believe anything whatsoever the united states is a nation founded on , and constantly rejuvenated by , the labor , creativity and diversity of its immigrant communities and as recent events have shown , struggles over the future of immigration are to the 21st century what the civil rights movement was to the 20th this is why the supreme court needs a justice who is a naturalized citizen from 1907 to 2009 , nearly 24 million immigrants were naturalized as citizens some seven million in the past 10 years alone still , millions of undocumented immigrants who contribute daily to our country s economic and cultural vitality are forced to live in the shadows a supreme court justice with experience as an immigrant would signal america s commitment to maintaining its pluralistic society for gay americans , civilrights breakthroughs tend to happen most when they matter least with the important exception of gay marriage , courts and legislatures have tended to follow rather than lead public opinion waiting until public sentiment changed before doing things like overturning sodomy laws , and passing antidiscrimination bills the appointment of an openly gay supreme court justice looks likely to follow the rule it wo n't happen until having an openly gay justice is fairly uncontroversial but it would still matter it would signal that the era of the closet is over for good , that even in the highest reaches of public life , open and responsible homosexuality is now a fact , not a scandal perhaps more important , though , is what would happen the great lesson of the gay civil rights movement is that fears that homosexuality will disrupt the social order are invariably wrong in families , in schools , in workplaces and in \( other nations' \) military forces , gays turn out to be far less different than even , in many cases , gays themselves had initially supposed so , too , on the supreme court an openly gay justice s sexual orientation would prove to be a nonevent , in terms of both the court s jurisprudence and its comity the real breakthrough of an openly gay justice would be that , after about a week , it would not look like a breakthrough at all  president obama has been admirably attuned to making the judiciary look more like america yet even though 5 percent of americans are of asian decent , only 1 percent of our federal judiciary is , with only one asianamerican \( denny chin of the second circuit \) a fulltime federal appellate judge \( atsushi tashima of the ninth circuit has taken senior status and goodwin liu has been nominated but not yet confirmed \) asianamericans have long been cast as perpetual foreigners that stereotype might make it harder to see that an asianamerican supreme court justice could be a decisive interpreter of our nation s founding document , which , over the past 200 years , has told the story of an everexpanding we , the people diversity is a fine thing but nine justices can supply only so much of it and the more we focus on identity groups , the less we attend to the diversity of professional experience here i stress a singularly underrepresented background on the court this particular kind of person possesses a deep understanding of why the court needs to be clearer in its decisions than it too often is state and local policymakers a high percentage of the big \( and small \) constitutional cases comes from state legislatures and agencies , city and county school boards , city councils , county commissions which then have to figure out how to put the court s rulings into practice think of abortion , guns , affirmative action programs , the death penalty , school integration programs , tuition vouchers , laws affecting free speech rights , decisions to display the ten commandments on courthouse walls or state capitol grounds and much more state and local policymakers are among the most important consumers of the court s work yet no current justice has significant state or local policymaking experience only clarence thomas \( an assistant attorney general of missouri long ago \) and sonia sotomayor \( a prosecutor in new york city long ago \) have any such experience at all that paucity may help explain why those citizens most affected by the court s work frequently get so little value from its alltoocommon nondecision decisions there will be no dearth of brains , legal learning or technical skills among the supreme court justices remaining on the bench after justice john paul stevens retires however , when the stony indifference to ordinary people s suffering of our conservative justices is factored in , an essential quality that will be in much shorter supply is empathy there is an urgent need to correct this deficiency when president obama fills the vacant seat it is empathy that will make the new justice sensitive to the concerns of underrepresented groups , and not membership in one particular group or another fortunately , president obama understands this truth he has as an essential ingredient for arriving at just decisions and outcomes similarly , president bill clinton , learning that justice byron white would retire , with a fine mind , good judgment , wide experience in the law and in the problems of real people and someone with a big heart a great heart that is the unmistakable characteristic that distinguishes justice john paul stevens , and has distinguished justices with philosophies and personalities as different as \( and in some cases , as conservative as \) oliver wendell holmes jr , louis brandeis , felix frankfurter , hugo black , thurgood marshall , harry blackmun , earl warren and william rehnquist in these harsh times , the nation needs judges with great hearts to bridge the differences in economic and educational status or race , religion , gender and sexual orientation that divide us , and stand guard over america s great tradition of generosity and hope
earlier this week , yahoo sports reported that reggie bush was expected to have his heisman trophy taken away by the end of the month this stems , of course , from the ncaa s determination that bush committed multiple violations during his heismanwinning 2005 season at usc , including accepting cash , gifts and other benefits bush would become the first winner to be stripped of his heisman not surprisingly , the reaction to this news has been varied let s take a look at three columnists , who each take a different view of the situation first , william c rhoden of the times , who writes that bush should simply give the trophy back  according to the ncaa investigation , bush received lavish gifts from two sports marketers who wanted to sign him they paid for hotel stays they paid for a rentfree home where bush s family apparently lived they paid for a limousine for his use they even bought a new suit for bush s heisman acceptance in december 2005 if bush had any sense of honor , he would return the trophy and save the committee the embarrassment of having to ask for it if he had any selfrespect , he would return it bush was effectively a kept man at usc , which is probably not something he wants scrawled on his sports tombstone bush has apologized to the university , but an apology means little coming from a man in the safe haven of the nfl , watching his college team he should share in usc s shame , and the best way to do that is to give back the trophy his mother and stepfather , who were culpable as well , should insist on it yahoo s dan wetzel writes that bush s heisman should be awarded to vince young , who finished second to bush in the voting after an outstanding season at quarterback for texas if miss america is unable to fulfill her duties as champion usually because she showed up sans swimsuit in a magazine then the first runnerup is crowned the winner so vince young is mr heisman a heisman trust source said they wouldn t follow that plan they prefer to go the ncaa way of vacating the award and just pretending the season never happened and no one was given the trophy the plan is for bush to return his trophy and it will not be sent back out it s a mistake the heisman should admit what it is , a vapid , politicized process worthy of a cheesy atlantic city ballroom don t let the manhattan address fool you , the process of creating a winner long ago stripped the heisman of its class unless you think cheap trinkets , unabashed campaigning and even changing the pronunciation of last names \( theismann didn t always rhyme with heisman \) is anything more than an attempt for perception to overrun reality there s no sense in pretending otherwise the fact bush will be stripped of his award is already controversial the heisman trust has never done it before no less than oj simpson is still a recognized winner last we have joe posnanski of sports illustrated and the kansas city star posnanski is a heisman voter who says he will stop voting if the heisman is taken away from bush what is the heisman trophy anyway \? it s an award given , in theory , to the most outstanding player in college football many years this turns out to be a quarterback who is not nearly good enough to play in the nfl but that s ok there s something dreamlike about the heisman it s a trophy that allows us to connect generations davey o brien to doak walker to pete dawkins to ernie davis to archie griffin to eddie george to tim tebow what the heisman trophy really does is offer us a fabulously hazy world where leadership trumps talent and heart trumps a great arm and the most outstanding player isn t necessary the best player it s fun it s a winkwink , nudgenudge world , perfect for the fantasy that is college football but if they take away reggie bush s heisman , what are they saying then \? there s no more winking , no more nudging no , they re saying they believe their nonsense they re saying , point blank , reggie bush isn t pure enough to be in our club they re saying one of two things 1 that none of the other heisman winners took money while playing and this isn t just laughable it s grotesque it s offensive and it s insulting 2 that none of the other heisman winners got caught taking money which , to me , is just hiding behind legalese \( and it s dangerous , too , because there are still plenty of boosters and teammates and coaches and heisman winners out there who could come forth and talk about payments of yesteryear \) what do you think is the correct decision \? should bush be judged for his play on the field , something that has not been questioned \? should the 2005 trophy be vacated \? or should it be awarded to young \? and what kind of precedent will the heisman trust be setting when it makes its decision , especially in an era where agents have become so prevalent that coaches like nick saban , urban meyer and jim tressel have talked to the nfl about the issue \?
michael kimmelman , the times s chief art critic , and gerry marzorati , editor of the sunday magazine , are covering the open from uncommon perspectives each morning , they discuss what s happening join the conversation or ask a fanoriented question by sending in a comment gerry marzorati morning , michael you wrote perceptively yesterday about a certain kind of open goer , the guy or gal who revels in the midway the proximity to a spectacle , the feeling of being close enough to sports stars and television broadcasts and a decent bar to sense fun , or even importance i sat close to a different sort of open goer those men and women longing for a next american men s single s sensation especially during ryan harrison s victory , i sensed this desire , one that i frankly don t harbor i think with federer and nadal , we are living in a golden age of men s tennis , and that neither is an american matters not at all to me but it clearly matters to a lot of people what s that about \? is it something you feel , or can relate to \? do you think your love of tennis is diminished by the lack of a johnny mac or sampras or agassi \? michael kimmelman and after roddick s fall last night , the last american to win a major , oh those many years ago in flushing meadows , is out yet again i m with you on this one i ve never felt tennis was more or less interesting depending on whether the best players were american , and this is an incredible era because of federer and nadal but , living in germany at the moment , where there s a great tennis tradition but far less interest in watching the sport than i would have imagined , i am constantly reminded how much national identity does matter to fans , and not just to americans that country had becker , graf and stich and especially when becker was on top , germans followed the sport , but now , although the country has a bunch of good tour players , none has won a major , and so most germans have tuned out try finding some bar or restaurant in which to watch wimbledon in berlin it s next to impossible that said , wherever you travel in europe , germany included , those who do follow the sport follow their own national players their national media focuses on the country s own britain is the obvious example at the open , we watched a dozen swedes in the sweltering heat cheer on soderling and i sat in front of a trio of aggrieved cypriots with a flag draped over their legs implore baghdatis from the stands the united states isn t exceptional this way if anything , being so big and diverse and with such a vast media industry , we do the best job of covering the spectrum of players and events the big difference here , i think , is expectation americans have come to expect homegrown champions , to feel that we , at least partly , own the sport and would always do so , the way we feel about basketball and baseball call it entitlement or jingoism if you want i don t think it s either , merely i think it s that we have the same pride other countries do but with the presumption that , should we put our minds to it , we have the resources , money and talent to dominate the sport the \( aging \) williams sisters aside , because increasingly we don t dominate , therefore we assume that we must somehow be squandering our opportunities that we re failing , not that switzerland and spain and croatia and so on are succeeding i think what other countries may , quietly or not , resent about us is the presumptuousness that said , tennis insiders will give you a slew of reasons for why we don t have the best male players at the moment , and no great prospects on the women s side , either , but that s another discussion in the end , all it takes is some teenaged mcenroe or sampras to emerge , or \( don t count them out yet \) isner or querrey to win here , the way roddick once did , for the for the congenital handwringing temporarily to stop gm of course , the young americans like professional tennis players everywhere , like pro athletes of all kinds are not like you and me as we ve been talking about at courtside and elsewhere the past few days , they have moved away from us , are in many ways a breed apart ryan harrison the son of a division i tennis player who went on to coach and the product of a florida tennis boot camp began playing , he told us at his press conference yesterday , at the age of 2 think about that for a moment and then , perhaps , shudder this changes the dynamic with fans rod laver , save for his forearm , looked much like those who came to watch him , and probably made less money than most of those paying to see him play not so now mk really good points , not least the money one we want to see superhuman tennis but then we re taken aback to find superhumans playing it , and we fret about lost childhoods , steroids , the multibilliondollar industry that cultivates these players tennis isn t alone a friend reminded me yesterday how refrigerator perry seemed like a freak of nature when he played football and now he would be one of the smaller linemen compare usain bolt with armin hary , the 1960 olympic 100meter champion \( who , speaking of how the money has also changed , got suspended for claiming train fares to the meets on his expense account but hitching rides that was before he retired and became a genuine swindler , but i digress \) there s another musical analogy here middleclass people used to play instruments the only way to hear music at home was to make it yourself the ability to play the piano or sing was a basic part of a certain bourgeois upbringing , of public education and this meant that audiences who went to hear professionals play had a direct and immediate relationship to the performance many people listening to paderewski in carnegie hall had played or had tried to play the music he was playing , or at least could relate to what he was doing the gap in ability was great that s where the thrill came from but not so great that it was incomprehensible then recordings came along and the relationship between listener and performer shifted , became far more remote and abstract millions of people play tennis and get a thrill out of seeing what the pros can do now but the gap is getting to be so wide that it s becoming incomprehensible , and that can be disturbing which is why you hear complaints about the equipment , and calls for the men to use wood rackets again in effect , to narrow the gap again gm as for today s matches in keeping with today s theme , those heading to flushing meadows might want to watch a couple of american guys mardy fish , who is playing the best tennis of his career , gets things going on armstrong against pablo cuevas , the uruguayan who has been at his best playing doubles and for those who want to see how fast a groundstroke can be hit , there is , in the grandstand later in the afternoon , taylor dent slugging it out with robin soderling me , i m at my desk again today , where i plan to be combing the twittersphere for open posts to retweet pretty social of me , no \? mk i m with you on dent and soderling it s hard to root for soderling , he s like the school bully but easy with dent , the refrigerator perry of tennis and federer plays andreas beck on ashe what can i say \? i always find it a pleasure and privilege to see him once upon a time , we ll eventually be saying
it wasn t 7 up but rather 007 that propelled michael apted toward his first fantasy film , the latest installment in the narnia franchise the james bond movie he directed in 1999 , the world is not enough , had also been a departure if he could do highoctane action , why not children s adventure \? the untried tempted he leaped anyone looking for patterns in mr apted s work is immediately thrown off he is the rare director who moves effortlessly from documentary to feature films and back again his subjects , too , range , although he tends to put struggling , striving , achieving women at the center a lot coal miner s daughter , agatha , nell , gorillas in the mist and social issues like class and slavery , marriage and faith , crop up regularly only one thing remains constant , however , in mr apted s halfcentury in film every seven years you can mark your calendar by it he checks in on the lives of 14 britons he has been tracking since 1964 , when they were 7yearsold in an interview in new york this week , we asked him how his commitment to the up documentary series has set an inviolable rhythm for his career what drew you to narnia \? i m not an auteur , so you know i don t create my own material so i m always looking around for material , and always looking around for challenges , and really the bond offer set it off i thought they were joking when they inquired whether i would be interested in it doing that film was somewhat seductive , because it was wonderful for the notion that there was an audience out there waiting for something i spent all my life doing this stuff and then struggling to get it seen especially documentaries are hard to get seen , and also the kind of middlebudget films and lowbudget films that i ve worked in it can get dispiriting because every film takes a huge amount of work and commitment , effort , stress , strain and all that and then it comes out , and very few people get to see it films have a long life or a long tail , as they say , but even so and then , the idea of bond it s kind of scary and exciting that there s expectation out there and you d better fulfill it you don t want to be the person that screwed up the franchise in a fictionalized film you can work with a child actor whose character changes in some way eustace from narnia seems to be a great example you have a couple of equally engaging , forceful boys in up , but they exemplify the give me the child until he is 7 and i will give you the man idea , with little in the way of transformation evident how is it different to work with children in roles whose transformation you can control \? it s the fun of it and the difficulty of it that s why i love going between the two you think of the reality that you can create in a documentary , which really hits you in the gut i mean things which you know have never been said or even maybe thought of for the first time you see them i m not talking necessarily about my stuff but just seeing documentaries , when you re right in the middle of something that s happening for the first time , has a freshness to it and then on the other hand you get tired of the fact , well , why couldn t they say this more economically or quicker or whatever you say , if only i had a good writer and i had the situation and then we could do this so much more precisely and economically so i swayed back and forth between the two i love the authenticity and the challenge and really thinking on your feet doing a documentary contrasted with the way that you can actually shape something and compress some very complex thoughts into a sentence with the help of a skilled writer , a skilled actor so the muscles are so different between doing a documentary and a movie to what extent are the logistics and rhythms of your life dictated by the demands of that very first project more than 40 years ago , and does it go beyond 56 \? is there a point where you say that s it i ve never had any plans to shut that down i always worried is it going to get boring , and i found that it wasn t i suppose the big test was really 28 up one is , the physical changes started reducing seriously you know , 7 14 21 oh , my goodness , look what s happening to them twentyeight , that physical thing wasn t so operational , and yet the film is more compelling , i think , than any of the ones before it i found that the kind of emotional geography of the series is richer than just the physical geography of it , so i never thought it would get boring and it hasn t it got richer got harder but it s got richer i suppose the only real reason i d shut it down is if enough of them pulled out , and then i would spend my whole time trying to explain why they had it s always a worry for me , how many are going to do it there s never any guarantee and it does fluctuate i lost two forever one at 21 and one at 28 not lost in a deceased sense but lost you know other people have dropped out then come back i m now preparing 56 , and i may well lose someone else in it , but that would be the only reason i d stop , if so many pulled out that it would kind of somehow make it all irrelevant because it s the counterpointing and the contrasts that s some of the richness of it , and to lose that , i think , is to lose one of my aces in the hand are you ready to start rounding up the usual suspects \? not yet i ve already been given a broadcast date which is may the 13th , 14th and 15th of 2012 , and so i back into that and shoot it as late as i possibly can , so i ll shoot it in the autumn , in , wherever i shoot , next year this project has followed you from the beginning of your career it s been a profound influence on my life i mean it s my signature piece , but in terms of choice of work , it sort of guaranteed me a place at the documentary table when you select your fiction projects , do any of them relate directly to up \? nell , for example somebody on the fringes of society , like up s neil yes and no in a sort of profound way it really affected my interest in women , which i suppose is a bit of nell because i think i missed the boat in the up films with women , and i can t beat myself up about it , but you know we didn t have enough women there were 14 , of which four were women and 10 were men , and you know the biggest social revolution in my life , growing up in england , has been the change in the role of women in society we didn t have civil rights and vietnam in england , but i think that particular social revolution is the biggest thing and i missed it by not having enough women and because i didn t have enough women , i didn t have enough choice of what options were in front of women who were building careers and having families and all this sort of stuff i suppose in some way the choice of movies has been to compensate for that i do find the drama of women in life to be very central and usually much more interesting than men i am not a big one on thrillers and violence and stuff like that , and so looking at everything from agatha through coal miner s daughter , from nell and continental divide , they re all to do with women s role in society and what women have to do to have a role in society or the choices women have to make to stay in society or have a voice in society , in both straightforward and eccentric ways that s always interested me and that i think stems from the feeling that i slightly missed out i ve compensated in the up films by making partners of the male original 10 important , so you feel there are more women in the film than in fact there really are , because none of those women have been tracked since they were 7yearsold so it s a bit smoke and mirrors have you ever been tempted to fictionalize up \? you had that pairing before with thunderheart and incident at oglala \( a feature film and a documentary about the same events \) i laugh because someone did come to me , some verywell known people , and said would i be interested in doing a broadway musical of it which i thought was pretty out there , and i thought , well , yes , i suppose , but i never heard any more about it in up , the subjects to varying degrees exhibit resentment about being in the film and you seem to encourage them to express themselves i don t encourage them to be resentful , but i encourage them to speak their minds they certainly seem to there s an incredible amount of what seems to be real honesty in those films by a lot of people who are very reluctant does it take a while to get that out of them \? generally , what i like about the project is that it s one of the few things that gives ordinary people air time it gives them space to tell us who they are at a low level by that i mean at a very profound level it doesn t have to be dramatic it s not death and blood and murder and all that stuff , the stuff of so much popular entertainment and even documentaries this is simply people s thoughts about who they are and where they are and what s going on so you re not asking for high drama i mean , this is the stuff of soap opera this is those minuscule step forwards that we take , those acts which change our life , the small acts that add up to the whole accumulation of life , and it sort of celebrates and honors those nothing else really that s ever been done i don t just mean by me , except in this longitudinal style gives people the space for that to do it what other film would have spent 50 years , as we nearly will have done , examining somebody s journey through life \? to me , what s moving about it is everybody has a story and every life is sort of heroic what people go through , decisions you have to make and the up films sort of celebrate that in a kind of who knows whether it s true or honest , you know i don t know that level of truth i get , how much people are totally open with me and how much they want to conceal from me who knows \? none of us know the seven years between the films can seem like a long time or can seem like a very short time i keep going back to how this might govern your life and your projects in between now i have finished this film , i ve finished narnia , now i know that i ve got to do 56 up practically , i ve got to shoot it next year and get it ready for spring of 2012 , so now i ll have to , this is the tough part , i m now going to have to , in a sense , figure out my career to fit into that but that s a small price to pay if i don t actually work on anything until i do that , it won t be much fun for me , it won t be ideal , but it s a price i have to pay and so far over all these years i ve managed to figure it out i ve managed to figure out sometimes doing two jobs at once , but i ve managed to figure out how i can keep the rhythm of the 7 things going and yet get in other important things as well there s always well , maybe there s going to be a horrible clash and i m going to get offered something really wonderful that is going to clash with the up films , but i know at the end of the day i ve got to do the up film how long does it take to put it together \? the finding people you can do over a period of time and i have a colleague , claire lewis , in england who has worked with me since 28 up , because i haven t lived in england for a long time so she handles that part of it and we each look after different ones , of people some i get on with better than others , some get on with me better , some get on with claire better than me , so the actual tracking them down and preparing it all is the hardest part , but it s not time intensive , it s patience intensive the shooting of it probably takes about a month , that s all , and then the editing is quite complicated and that would take three or four months so me focused full time on it nonstop is probably under six months , and a lot of it s flexible they ll allow me to , if i m preparing a film in timbuktu , they ll allow me to cut the up films in timbuktu what do you get out of documentary that you don t get out of fiction film and vice versa \? i think what i get out of documentary is very important because it s a sense of authorship you know , i don t write , and i m nervous of it , and i ve read enough scripts to know that if you can write you ll write and if you can t write then you think about it but with documentaries i get a sense that i create something , that i m an author you have an idea for a documentary , it might not even be my idea , but i have an idea on the table and i take it and i run with it and i try and figure it out and i harvest material and i have to be light on my feet to figure out what s a good way to go and what doesn t work , and then you get all this material together and then you write it then you actually construct it and dramatize it and tell a story and i find that thrilling because that s the nearest i get to writing stuff so that is a great gift from documentaries and what really drives me on i feel much more of a sense of ownership in a documentary for example , i will never do a documentary unless i had final cut of it for that reason , that i think i ve created it with a movie , i never really get final cut but in a sense that doesn t worry me because in a movie you can negotiate stuff , it s diplomacy , it s give and take and all this sort of stuff so i get a very powerful sense of ownership doing documentaries , much more than i get in movies , but again in the sense of movies what i think you have is more complex material to deal with a movie can exist on many different levels like i hope narnia exists on many different levels
two prominent rhode island democrats announced on saturday that they would run for the congressional seat held by  mayor of providence and bill lynch , the chairman of the state , declared their candidacies a day after mr kennedy said he would not seek reelection both candidates said that if elected they would focus on job creation , a crucial issue in a state with the nation s thirdhighest unemployment rate , 129 percent i have three priorities on the day i get to washington jobs , jobs , jobs that s the issue in rhode island , mr lynch said we were one of the first states to get into the recession , and most people seem to think we 're going to be one of the last out of it the no 1 priority has to be the creation of jobs and turning the economy around despite the federal bank bailouts , mr cicilline said , small businesses in the state are having trouble obtaining loans and cities and towns are slashing their budgets we need someone fighting for small businesses , mr cicilline said the middle class is still suffering , and none of that relief came to cities and towns mr lynch said more money needed to flow from washington to rhode island people are constantly upset and angry at this point with washington , and the inability to access any kind of meaningful funds from the government to rhode island , mr lynch said i do n't think we 've done a good job at that mr cicilline , 48 , a lawyer , was elected mayor of providence in 2002 and promised to clean up corruption in city hall months after former mayor vincent a cianci , jr was convicted of a racketeering conspiracy charge mr cicilline , the city s first openly gay mayor , was reelected in 2006 , and said he had planned to seek another term this year mr lynch , 52 , also a lawyer , has been chairman of the state democratic party since 1998 a pawtucket native , mr lynch comes from a political family his father served as mayor of pawtucket from 1973 to 1981 , and his brother , patrick , is the state attorney general and a candidate for governor a state representative , john j loughlin ii , a republican , announced his candidacy for his party s nomination earlier this month
washington americans are scrambling to understand yemen , where al qaeda has recently surged and the christmas day plot against northwest flight 253 was hatched it s not easy yemen has 5 , 000 years of history , complicated politics and daunting economic challenges but we 've made it more difficult to understand by allowing several myths to cloud our vision challenging these misconceptions is a first step toward comprehending and overcoming significant threats to american , yemeni and international security it s true that the government of president ali abdullah saleh faces several security problems al qaeda has operated there since the early 1990s , with its strength waxing and waning depending on the effectiveness of the government s counterterrorism efforts since 2004 , the government has faced an insurrection in the north from a group called the houthis , who would restore a religious ruler there has also been growing separatist feeling in the southern regions that tried to secede in 1994 and many of the tribes in the north are well armed and operate largely outside the government structure none of this , however , means that the government is confined to ruling a citystate centered on sana the yemeni army and national police exert significant daytoday control over most of the country , and almost everywhere else on an ad hoc basis yemen is much like the united states in the latter half of the 19th century , when the government faced a rebellious south and a wild west , but was hardly powerless outside the east coast osama bin laden s father , muhammad , was one of many yemenis who achieved great success outside his native country but the bin ladens are not part of any politically significant tribe or clan , nor has the family sought to convert its wealth into power in yemen osama bin laden has some popularity , but no more so than elsewhere in the islamic world the qaeda virus which has been present in yemen since 1992 , when qaeda members bombed a hotel in aden where american troops had been staying on their way to somalia is the problem for yemen , not mr bin laden s ancestral ties the houthi rebellion is often described as shiite resistance against a sunni establishment in fact , both the houthis and president saleh are followers of the zaidi sect of shiite islam generally , there is no clear divide between sunnis and shiites in yemen , although the shiites tend to live in the north and northwest while the sunnis , mostly members of the moderate shafii school , predominate in the south and southeast in any case , one s sect matters far less in yemen than in countries like lebanon or iraq , and it s not unknown for yemenis to convert from sunni to shiite as a matter of convenience in 2002 , abu ali alharithi , then al qaeda s leader in yemen , was killed by an american drone in a strike that was coordinated with the yemeni government by tribal custom , any perceived illegitimate killing would have been grounds for a claim by the tribe against the government no such claim was made in fact , when receiving the body for burial , one of his kinsmen noted that he had chosen his path , and it had led to his death this was not an anomaly in my experience , there is no deepseeded affinity between yemeni tribes and the qaeda movement tribes tend to be opportunistic , not ideological , so the risk is that al qaeda will successfully exploit opportunities created by government neglect there are also family affinities cousins , linked to uncles , linked to brothers these do matter but what matters most is the mujahedeen fraternity yemenis with jihadist experience in afghanistan , iraq , saudi arabia or elsewhere finally , what would matter and significantly would be innocent casualties resulting from counterterrorism operations , which could well set off a tribal response  forging an effective american counterterrorism policy in yemen will be as difficult as it is necessary but misreading yemeni history and society can only complicate its conception and jeopardize its execution
virtually every playwright has an unfinished or unresolved script tucked in a drawer somewhere for tony kushner , that play was henry box brown , a one act written in the early 1990s while he was finishing his epic angels in america , whose two parts went on to win backtoback tony awards for best play in 1993 and 1994 mr kushner wrote henry box brown for juilliard school of drama students to perform while he was playwrightinresidence there from 1990 to 1992 , but the play never ended up being mounted through juilliard , or anywhere else , until now for just seven performances that conclude on tuesday night , graduate acting students at new york university s tisch school of the arts are quietly holding a world premiere production of the play , now titled henry box brown politicalhistoricaldoggerelvaudeville , in a tiny theater space in the east village the reallife title character , a virginia slave in the 19th century , became internationally known for encasing himself in a box used to ship tobacco and then sent via mail delivery to the safe hands of a group of abolitionists in philadelphia brown eventually left the united states for great britain , to insure his continued freedom as a fugitive slave , and began touring music halls through northern england to share his life story mr kushner , in an interview on monday , said that his play unfurled brown s story during a tour stop in the yorkshire industrial town of todmorden , where his tale finds unusual resonance with the local citizenry mr kushner had talked over the years with successive leaders of london s national theater about mounting the play there , but none of those discussions led to a production , he said , and the play remained a workinprogress in his mind then , about two years ago , the british director mark wingdavey , who is chairman of the tisch graduate program , came across a copy of henry box brown \( in an interview monday , he declined to say how , and even mr kushner wasn t sure \) after reading the script , mr wingdavey said , he felt that he had a group of students who would be a strong fit for the roles , and he began seeking permission from mr kushner , with whom he had been friends since directing angels at american conservatory theater in san francisco during the 199495 season there is a wonderful theatricality to the play , a great inventiveness to the language , a setting in todmorden that is richly rendered all hallmarks of tony s work , mr wingdavey said at first mr kushner said no , convinced that he would be too busy with film projects and preparing for the 201011 off broadway kushner season at signature theater company , which includes the first major new york revival of angels since the broadway run , and the new york premiere of a new play \( coproduced with the public theater \) , the intelligent homosexual s guide to capitalism and socialism with a key to the scriptures i had put the play away , and my memory of it was that it was an honorable attempt at something that i wasn t pleased with , and that i thought i wouldn t have any time to work on , mr kushner said , noting that , among other bits of unfinished business , he had written lyrics for eight to 10 songs that were still in need of music eventually mr kushner went to listen to a reading of the play by the nyu actors , directed by mr wingdavey \( who also collaborated on the music with one of the students \) i was excited by the reading , very excited they were able to bring the play to life for me again , mr kushner said , speaking by telephone during a trip to see his family in louisiana he plans to attend the final performance on tuesday of the production , which runs about 100 minutes mr kushner said that while the next year still seems certain to be busy one , his interest in working on henry box brown had been revived by the nyu experience i ll figure out what to do with it some time soon , mr kushner said i do think i ll be working on it again
cumberland , me sat , act , ap ib \? the alphabet soup of college admissions is getting more complicated as the international baccalaureate , or ib , grows in popularity as an alternative to the betterknown advanced placement program the college board s ap program , which offers a long menu of singlesubject courses , is still by far the most common option for giving students a head start on college work , and a potential edge in admissions the lesserknown ib , a twoyear curriculum developed in the 1960s at an international school in switzerland , first took hold in the united states in private schools but it is now offered in more than 700 american high schools more than 90 percent of them public schools and almost 200 more have begun the long certification process many parents , schools and students see the program as a rigorous and more internationally focused curriculum , and a way to impress college admissions officers to earn an ib diploma , students must devote their full junior and senior years to the program , which requires english and another language , math , science , social science and art , plus a course on theory of knowledge , a 4 , 000word essay , oral presentations and community service here in cumberland , greely high school adopted the ib this year to make students more aware of the world beyond the united states when our grads would visit from college , they 'd tell us that while greely gave them great academic preparation , they 'd had no idea there was a big wide world out there , said david galin , greely s ib coordinator to that end , greely s ib 11th graders read literature from india \( god of small things \) , south africa \( master harold and the boys \) , what is now the czech republic \( the metamorphosis \) , chile \( the house of the spirits \) , egypt \( midaq alley \) and colombia \( chronicle of a death foretold \) our students do n't have as much diversity as people in some other areas , so this makes them open their eyes , said deb pinkham , the program s english teacher the ib program is used in 139 countries , and its international focus has drawn criticism from some quarters some parents say it is antiamerican and too closely tied to both the united nations and radical environmentalism from its start in 1968 until 1976 , the program was financed partly by unesco it is now associated with the united nations economic and social council , and until recently it endorsed the earth charter , a declaration of principles of sustainability that originated at the united nations when there is a program at the school with a specific agenda , which in this case is the united nations agenda , i have a problem with it , said ann marie banfield , who unsuccessfully opposed the adoption of the ib program in bedford , nh others object to its cost the organization charges 10 , 000 a year per school , 141 per student and 96 per exam and say it is neither as effective as the ap program nor likely to reach as many students we have 337 kids , and 80 of them take at least one of our 16 ap classes , said john eppolito , a parent who opposes the planned introduction of the ib in incline village , nev if we switched to the ib , the district estimates that 15 kids would get a ib diploma in two years ib opponents have created a web site , truthaboutibcom , to serve as a clearinghouse for their views many schools , and many parents , see the ib partly as a way to show college admissions offices that students have chosen a rigorous program , with tests graded by ib examiners around the world i do n't think there is anyone who does not respect the ib , said panetha ott , an admissions officer at brown fewer colleges give credit for the ib than for ap , but dozens give students with an ib diploma sophomore standing and some offer special scholarships the ib is also being offered now in some struggling urban schools where educators say it helps put lowincome students on par with their richer peers last fall , the bill and melinda gates foundation gave the program a threeyear 24 million grant to prepare lowincome and minority students to participate in the ib california and florida have the most ib schools , and new england the fewest in cumberland , some parents questioned the ib s cost , but none complained about the program s content , according to chris mosca , greely s principal no question , the people who founded the ib were sitting in geneva , postworld war ii , thinking about how to ensure world peace , so the clear philosophical bent is that by integrating learning and understanding issues from multiple perspectives , we can promote global thinking , he said but what sold me on the program was that it s good pedagogy , that it really shows kids how things go together still , mr mosca has no plans to eliminate the school s advanced placement offerings ap is great for contentbased traditional learning , he said it s great for kids who like to memorize but for more creative kids , who want to make those connections , there s nothing like the ib on a spring tuesday , greely s ib history class was working in small groups , analyzing the suez crisis with original source documents from israel , egypt , the soviet union , the united states and the united nations emily hill , presenting a document from the soviet foreign office s middle east desk , reminded the group that it was a secret memo , translated several times emily , who said she was bored with school last year , said the ib program had been more interesting and challenging because it is so rigorous , the ib is not for everyone at greely , only 21 juniors started the full program this year , and three subsequently shifted to a mix of ib and regular classes but those who stayed with it seemed enthusiastic it s like a little club of scholars , said maggie bauer , a junior it seems more realworld than how we used to learn , and it s changed how we look at the world down the coast , where kennebunk high school just graduated its first group of ib students , sue cressey , the ib coordinator , said that most of the students in the program the first year had thought about dropping out there was a bad period after everybody flunked a biology exam , she said i had to send a letter home to parents , reassuring them it s a new way of thinking , but the kids grew into it i feel better about sending these kids to college than any group i 've ever sent the graduates , too , say they feel well prepared in our theory of knowledge class , when we debated health care , my role was to take rush limbaugh s position , which could n't be further from my own , said michael tahan , one of the graduates ib taught us how to think through a position , and support it , he

in the book review on sunday , mary jo murphy reviewed i just lately started buying wings missives from the other side of silence , a first book of autobiographical essays by kim dana kupperman her sentences can be as ethereal and elusive as her subjects , murphy writes , but their descriptive power makes them worth the chase kupperman has been a writer and editor for over 25 years , and is the founder of welcome table press , an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to publishing the essay form in this interview , which appeared in 2008 on beth blevins s blog writing home , she explained why she writes and specifically why she s concentrated on the personal essay she s been doing it since she was a child my mother , when i lived with her , left me alone to the point of neglect and so i learned to amuse myself , seeking refuge in my imagination , which was a territory of unending possibility and joy it was also a place where i resolved my fears and this is very much akin to what writing is all about , especially writing personal essays that seek to examine the unexamined life kupperman is also the managing editor of the gettysburg review , and in the same interview she describes her job as a literaryjournal editor but especially fun is her response about what she dreamed of accomplishing in the next five years i hope to get my first collection of essays published , a scary proposition considering how essayphobic the publishing world is fastforward less than a year and i just lately started buying wings won the 2009 katharine bakeless nason prize for nonfiction , bestowed by the bread loaf writers conference  sue halpern chose the winning manuscript , and the award assured kupperman publication by graywolf press halpern writes in her introduction to the book that kupperman s is a voice we trust implicitly it is unsentimental , undramatic , curious , wounded , poetic suicides , drug addiction , adultery , custody battles , aids and all the other modern plagues that supplanted the boils and locusts and killing of the firstborn of the bible are part of her story , yet none are the story itself i recently asked kupperman to look back on 2008 , and to consider how soon after that interview with blevins everything seemed to fall into place she was stunned to win the bakeless prize , she wrote in an email , particularly as prizes in nonfiction so often go to memoirwriters she added collections of discrete essays , especially by unknown writers , are still rare and before i won the prize , i was sending out the manuscript and having it rejected i was , frankly , ready to give up on the entire project winning the prize was a vindication of sorts and then i had the great honor of sue halpern s introduction , in which she praises the form of the essay , and that sealed something for me so are things looking up for the essay these days \? people are reading essays all the time , kupperman noted they are sometimes called other things , including the generic creative nonfiction , literary journalism , articles , blogs i d say that the public is hungry and always has been hungry for the essay one goal of welcome table press is to reach out to people who aren t necessarily circulating in the world of arts and letters and urge them to think beyond the fiveparagraph essay that most folks think of when they hear the word essay to remember , for example , that our country is founded on an essay \( called a pamphlet in those days \) and that all social justice movements have been guided by the works of essayists \( think of thoreau , mary wollstonecraft , ida b wells , frederick douglass \) kupperman s observations about the public s interest aren t based on mere speculation , she points out earlier this year , she was on a panel called the essayist s dilemma at the association of writers writing programs conference in denver , in which the panelists addressed the trend , in mainstream publishing , of repackaging as memoir books that were originally essay collections i was amazed by the number of people who attended \( close to 200 , i think \) , she wrote , and i was cheered that phillip lopate was in the audience that same month , welcome table press sponsored a symposium with fordham university called in praise of the essay practice and form we were close to capacity , she said , something that signals a love of the essay among writers , readers and teachers , all of whom composed our audience in the next three years the remainder of that fiveyear projection blevins asked her to make kupperman said she ll be wrapping up a second book of essays and hopes to start work on a third in addition , welcome table press is compiling two anthologies of essays , for which she says she s still trying to raise funds \( for more on kupperman , see the nonfiction selfinterview she recently gave to the nervous breakdown \)
you know things are going well for the flyers , winners of six straight games , when ville leino emerges as a playoff hero with detroit , leino played so softly that , according to the detroit news s chris mccosky , red wings coach mike babcock converted his name into a verb for a player who was easily taken off the puck , as in he got leinoed on that play but after jeff carter went down with an injury , leino \( who the salary cappedout wings moved to the flyers in february \) found himself on a line with danny bri re and scott hartnell in bri re , the skillful leino found a skillful partner in hartnell , a physical role model suddenly , lieno started racking up points and playing with determination and purpose he has 11 in 10 playoff games , including this goal on tuesday in game 2 which secured the flyers 20 conference championship series lead against the canadiens game 3 is thursday night in montreal leino is one of the many flyers attacking the net , which is a tactical point of difference so far in this series between philadelphia and montreal i think we re at our best when we re at our simplest , flyers defenseman chris pronger said wednesday \( quoted by dave caldwell in the times \) that s getting pucks in deep using our speed , crashing , banging , imposing our will on a team that difference between the teams is something don cherry showed during the cbc hockey night in canada telecast of game 2 both on his coach s corner segment \( about 1 40 in \) and after the game \( about 2 30 in \) since the canadiens have yet to score on the flyers going back to their remarkable comeback in game 7 against boston , in which they scored four straight after falling behind , 30 , the flyers have scored 13 straight goals the flyers will want to keep that streak going because when the habs scored the first goal in games this spring , they are 72 they are 16 when the opponent scores first montreal obviously does not play well when it is behind , which even coach jacques martin has admitted the flyers , conversely , are pretty good when surrendering the first goal 43 for the next two games , however , they re not just facing the habs but also the deafening home crowd at the bell centre , probably the most inspirational fans in the nhl it s not that the habs started badly in philadelphia chuck gormley of the camden courierpost pointed out that montreal has been more dominant in both first periods , outshooting the flyers by a combined 2912 but the flyers went to their dressing room leading , 10 , in both games cherry also showed in that postgame segment how montreal tried in consecutive rushes to penetrate the flyers defense at the blue line , only to be turned back by disciplined defenders the flyers big defense corps , augmented by a forward joining them to clog the neutral zone and strong backside pressure , have taken away one of the habs strengths , attacking with speed off the rush on his ottawa radio team 1200 segment thursday morning \( audio \) , pierre mcguire said if he was in martin s position , he d put more pressure on the flyers defense by , for example , putting pucks into pronger s corner and pursue with two players , one to seal off the boards so he can t smash the puck to safety off the wall and the other to take away any move he d make to the inside if pronger gave the puck to his defensive partner , either the third forward or the farside defenseman would be there to take that option away mcguire s plan is designed to create turnovers and get sustained presence in the offensive zone , which montreal has lacked much of the talk surrounding montreal has been about who should be in and who should be out of the lineup tsn s bob mckenzie , team 990 s mitch melnick and pat hickey in the gazette all believe the situation calls for the big defenseman ryan o byrne to be back in the lineup , helping in front of the net blogging in la presse , fran ois gagnon agreed , and said that o byrne should replace the littleused forward sergei kostitsyn , adding that he d also employ roman hamrlik on the left point of the power play instead of p k subban , who is not adept from the left side at setting up the big shot of marcandre bergeron at the other point the habs greatly miss andrei markov in that role \( and he s now officially done for the season , having had knee surgery wednesday \) news from the canadiens morning skate reveals that the proo byrne faction will get its wish those already in the lineup are feeling the heat , none more than tomas plekanec , the pending freeagent center who was montreal s most consistent forward this year on montreal s radio team 990 morning show , the hosts denis casavant , elliott price and shaun starr played the old showtune from gigi sung by maurice chevalier , thank heaven for little girls giving plekanec some static for a nowfamous \( in montreal , at least \) selfcritical assessment from two years ago during montreal s firstround series against boston in 2008 , plekanec confessed he had played a couple of games like a little girl and hockey night in canada s glen healey expressed a similar sentiment tuesday night after game 2 when he characterized the entire montreal team as playing as if they were scared of the bigger flyers team toward the end of this postgame segment \( about seven minutes in \) and suggested the habs had to physically challenge pronger , which is easy for anyone to suggest from the safety of the stands still , somehow neutralizing pronger , a physical force who makes a great first pass out of the zone , has to be on montreal s agenda but credit the flyers who didn t get much attention early in the postseason while the habs were playing giantkillers for not just being big and mobile , but also for outstanding execution and some courage of their own after an injuryplagued , tumultuous , underachieving regular season injured twice this season , simon gagn \( the subject of kevin allen s usa today article \) has points in every game , six goals and an assist , since he came back from a broken foot to win game 4 of the series against the bruins with an overtime goal , which ignited the flyers run allen wonders if gagn s foot is completely healed truth is , everybody s hurt this time of year just his presence in the lineup changes everything bri re said of gagn \( quoted by sean gordon of the globe and mail \) his fellow francophones bri re and claude giroux have also been major contributors bri re , who is very unpopular among habs fans for choosing philadelphia over montreal when he was a free agent two years ago , also has points in each of the last six games , 5 goals and 4 assists , while giroux has 3 goals and 4 assists in the same stretch the flyers power play has been exceptional thus far as well , having scored four of their nine goals martin said he thought it was the difference in game 2 , and credit for that goes to joey mullen , the hell s kitchen product who went from roller hockey to nhl stardom now an assistant coach with the flyers , mullen has most likely detected something in the habs penalty kill that that eluded both the penguins and the capitals i think that joe mullen does an excellent job trying to prepare the players , coach peter laviolette told frank sevarelli of the philadelphia daily news i think we ve got good personnel for the power play we ve got the right people on the back end we ve got some skilled forwards up front and the flyers are getting perfect goaltending from michael leighton , perfect penalty killing led by blair betts , strong play from their entire defensive corps , contributions from youngsters like james van riemsdyk , and overall excellence from captain mike richards , who seems to have no weaknesses in any facet of his game a goal like the one leino scored has rekindled the everpresent debate in montreal of who should be in goal , jaroslav halak , who looked weak on that one , or carey price , who has only one start in the habs playoff run damien cox of the toronto star thinks price should play , but replacing halak would be a drastic move , even though the flyers have found his glove side has become a good place to aim but the canadiens will need to do a lot of things differently thursday night to crawl back into this series , and it s uncertain if they can do it melnick wrote on his blog , as a wise songwriter who will turn 69 on monday once put it it s not dark yet but it s getting there
though essential cast members are missing , above all and yelena isinbayeva , track and field will start its latest road show friday in doha , qatar the spectacle is called the diamond league it is an expanded , reimagined version of the golden league , which was for 12 years the standard for oneday meets before being scrapped for this more ambitious marketing concept the golden league was an exclusively european affair , made up of six events of varying prestige and financial stability the diamond league , in contrast , is the most serious attempt to create an elite global , annual circuit , along the lines of formula one or the top tier of men s tennis tournaments just below the grand slam events you normally say it takes 25 years to build a brand , said patrick magyar , the director of the prestigious zurich meet who was one of the driving forces behind the diamond league we have lots of free media maybe we can do it in five years that s kind of the timeline we 're looking at they have a long way to go , considering that the top result this week in a google search for diamond league in the united states was for a youth baseball league in northeast ohio but it seems well worth the effort to rise in the rankings at this stage , track and field s only real opportunities to generate global buzz come at its biennial world outdoor championships or the quadrennial olympics \( or when one of its superstars see marion jones , justin gatlin and ben johnson runs afoul of the doping police \) the brain trust behind the diamond league wants to expand the starmaking machinery and create a coherent alternative in the quest for growth and greater relevance , particularly with the young it s a good year to start , considering there are no major championships to steal the thunder it s not a secret that athletics has lost public interest over the last two decades , and partly we believe that is because , more and more , the championships were the only thing that became meaningful , magyar said if we ca n't get exposure all year long , at least we need summerlong exposure of athletes to really build stars , to build people others can identify with and see as role models none of the diamond league meets are new they are simply being repackaged and tied together with stronger thread but there is meaningful change here , too above all , the decision to stage all 32 core disciplines in track and field during the series golden league competition at least that which led to golden league bonuses generally comprised just five or six men s events a year and four or five women s events a year in the diamond league , each meet will stage a minimum of 16 core events , which means that the sport s great variety consider the body types of the average shot putter and average 10 , 000meter runner will be on more consistent display meet directors also have the option to add events of local interest if they are not on their standard program the prefontaine classic in eugene , ore , is , for example , going to add an 800meter race to accommodate the interest in the american middledistance runner nick symmonds we have permission , as long as we do n't bring in the best in the world and sabotage the diamond league meet five days later in lausanne , switzerland , which does have an 800 race , said tom jordan , the meet director in eugene the diamond league remains eurocentric ten of its 14 meets will be in europe , including those in zurich and brussels , the two heaviest hitters , serving as a twostage finale for the series in late august but there are also two meets in the united states , in new york \( at randalls island on june 12 \) and eugene one in shanghai and another in qatar , which continues to push hard with its wealth of natural resources and geopolitically vulnerable location in the middle east for sporting events that put it more prominently on the map that will not be easy on friday without bolt , the sport s breakout figure , who is not scheduled to compete in the diamond league until may 23 nor will it be easy in doha without isinbayeva , the serial recordbreaker from russia who was originally scheduled to compete but is instead on an extended sabbatical after failing to clear a height at last year s world championships in berlin and then finishing fourth at the world indoor championships kenenisa bekele , the world s foremost distance runner , will also be missing because of injury , as will the newly married sanya richardsross , the leading women s 400meter runner in recent seasons but the women s 400 is still one of the more interesting races in doha , with the american allyson felix and the former world champion christine ohuruogu of britain competing felix , the reigning world champion in the 200 meters , is prepared to run plenty of 200s and 400s this season the new league structure is an incentive to run more often against richardsross generating such duels is one of the goals of the diamond league , where stars like richardsross are under contract the golden league was an event that focused on certain events mainly , and the 200 really was n't contested as much , felix said in a conference call last week the diamond league really includes all of them and gives everyone a shot at it i'm really looking forward to it and really interested to see how it turns out doug logan , the chief executive officer of usa track and field , believes the jury will be out a year or two , maybe even three he likes the business model , the geographical mix of events and that the diamond league has contracted star athletes like bolt and richardsross it s what tennis did when the first of the real tours got put together , he said but logan is less convinced by the alternating event format , with , say , new york staging a men s 100 and the prefontaine classic having to wait i think that is probably going to be confusing to the public , he said but the proof in the pudding is television , whether or not they 'll be able to drive eyeballs i think they have a fighting shot at doing it , but i think it will take at least through and past the london olympics in 2012 and maybe even longer img , which is selling the television rights , has , according to magyar , attempted to emphasize audience reach over a money grab magyar believes that most meets will see an increase of 50 percent in television viewers outside their home markets and is also convinced that there will be more duels , with bolt and tyson gay scheduled , for now , to sprint against each other at least three times that was a mismatch in berlin last year , with bolt obliterating his own world record in the 100 , but mismatches have been no impediment to bolt becoming one of world sport s prime attractions as a marketer , i can tell you it is our challenge to let this transcendent figure we have in this sport be the tide who raises all the ships , logan said

poughkeepsie , ny in the nearly 23 years since s death , a veritable factory s worth of people have claimed that they worked by his side during the glory years of the 1960s , when he was revolutionizing art with his silkscreens and surfaceluster vision of life billy name , who lives in a neatly kept apartment in a rundown house near the train station here , has never had to make that case for himself because his photographs have always done it for him for seven years , beginning in late 1963 , when warhol gave him a 35millimeter honeywell pentax camera , mr name was the resident photographer of the factory , capturing the perpetual swirl of superstars , celebrities and hangerson he left in 1970 , traumatized by the shooting of warhol by valerie solanas two years earlier and disillusioned by the increasingly businesslike direction of warhol s career and in the years since , mr name s income , such as it is he describes himself as an anarchic buddhist who has never cared much about money has mostly come from magazine editors , curators , filmmakers and others who pay him for the use of his 1960s images , produced from several thousand negatives the pictures provide rare documentation of nearly every aspect of warhol s world at the socalled silver factory on east 47th street in manhattan and at the studio s later incarnation near union square but sometime in the last two years , mr name s archive of negatives went missing mr name left it in the care of a photography agent , kevin kushel , a former director of the associated press s photo archive who went on to form his own stockphotography company , and whom mr name said he had not been able to contact for months the disappearance of the negatives has alarmed not just mr name and his circle of friends and supporters but also scholars , who describe the images as an important historical record of a pivotal time in art history his documentation of that era is really irreplaceable , said callie angell , the adjunct curator of the whitney museum of american art s andy warhol film project there were really only four photographers around the factory for any length of time in the 1960s , and billy name was the only one of them who lived there his pictures were warhol s press photos they were his chosen representation of his work in 2006 ms angell completed the first volume of the catalogue raisonn of warhol s films , a book that includes many of mr name s pictures she is now at work on the second volume , and she said that she worried that she would be unable to find crucial photographs that she needed for it mr name \( who was born william linich \) grew up in poughkeepsie and in the 1950s moved to new york city , where he became a theatrical lighting designer and had a brief romantic relationship with warhol , before moving into the factory in an interview at his home , he described a chaotic chain of events that leaves many questions about what has become of his negatives , which he kept with him for years in several ringbinder notebooks he said that mr kushel , who became his agent more than a decade ago though the two never had a written contract took the negatives in several batches from poughkeepsie to his own apartment in manhattan , to scan them for many years , mr kushel struck agreements with magazines , publishers and others to provide images when they were requested , and mr name said he was happy with his work , trusted him and felt that the negatives were in good hands but in 2007 mr kushel left new york and moved to palm springs , calif , and later to hawaii , where he lives now after months of what mr name said was erratic behavior that included mr kushel s not responding to requests for images , mr name severed their relationship and asked for his negatives back but none have been returned i never really had an agent before kevin and i was not well during much of the time period when all this was happening , said mr name , 69 , who has diabetes and arthritis and i did n't know i still do n't know how to deal with something like this mr name said that mr kushel had not responded to other requests to provide him , at the very least , with scans he made of the negatives , so that mr name could begin to earn an income from them again but in a brief telephone interview on friday , mr kushel denied this accusation , saying he had made all of the scans available to mr name mr kushel declined to comment further about the negatives , citing advice from his lawyers , whom he would not name but he said that he was working to ensure that the archive was returned to mr name i'm moving as fast as possible to rectify a situation in which i was basically sabotaged , he said , declining to elaborate asked about the whereabouts of the negatives , he said only they are not missing they 're just sort of being held captive when he was asked by whom they were being held , he added , by people who want money kymara lonergan , a gallery owner in maine who befriended mr name several years ago and now works as his manager and agent , said that mr kushel had not replied to numerous requests from her for the negatives or for an explanation she said that she and mr name had gotten highresolution scans of several dozen pictures from magazines and other places that had them in their computer files prints had also been made from some negatives over the years , and mr name has sold those to collectors and museums but he does not know how many of the 3 , 000 negatives were ever scanned by mr kushel , and he said he worried that some of his photographs could be lost for good if negatives that were never scanned or printed were lost my negatives are in ghost land , man , said mr name , whose flowing gray beard and everpresent sunglasses now make him look more like billy gibbons from the band zz top than like the skinny factory regular he once was ms lonergan said that she was contacted last year by a veteran chelsea photography dealer , steven kasher , who was interested in representing mr name , and that mr kasher told her that he had been approached by two antiques dealers , whose names he did not divulge , who said they had bought the negatives at an auction for an unclaimed lot of material left in a lower manhattan ministorage warehouse asked about ms lonergan s account , mr kasher , who has represented sales of vintage prints from several important archives , including that of the new york times and the national geographic society , would say only , i 'd prefer not to comment because i do n't know all the facts ms lonergan said that she and mr name were exploring the possibility of pursuing a lawsuit against mr kushel and that she had met with sally pritchard of the special prosecutions bureau of the manhattan district attorney s office a spokeswoman for the office would not comment on whether prosecutors were looking into the issue photographic negatives , even historically important ones like mr name s , generally do not have value in the art market the way prints do and because mr name owns the copyright to the images , giving him control over their publication or reproduction , he and others like ms angell , who have been aware of the archive s disappearance for several months now , said they were bewildered by the thought that someone might have them and be trying to sell them billy told me one time when he was talking about andy getting shot that andy was always getting involved in these tacky tragedies , ' ms angell said and you might say it s happened again this is a pretty tacky tragedy , but it s one i really hope has a happy outcome
in new england , bill belichick wished good luck on the rest of his hall of fame receiving career but it was another part of belichick s statement in which the announced the stunning trade of moss to the on wednesday that offered a more subtle window into how the patriots felt about moss belichick said he had been talking to moss and his representatives for several months about moss s role and his future it was apparent on the field that moss s role was declining and that his future , at age 33 and with a history of uneven effort , was going to play out elsewhere that elsewhere is minnesota , which is in such winatallcosts mode that in august , coach brad childress the vikings are taking a calculated risk that moss , who has not received a contract extension as part of the trade , will give their offense \( 30th in points scored \) the kind of effort and explosiveness he provided the patriots in 2007 , his first year with the team the spread offense moss thrived in that year has been replaced this season by multiple tight end sets and an attempt at a power running game with benjarvus greenellis , the most obvious indication that the patriots were already well prepared for life after moss that is the style with which they won three super bowls none of them with moss in week 2 against the jets , tom brady threw to moss 10 times , but he caught only two passes , and the offense looked disjointed that might have been the beginning of the end in the next two games , the patriots turned away from moss he has only for the season tight end , and the secondyear receiver  childress confirmed wednesday that the trade was in the works on monday , before moss had a blowup with a patriots assistant coach at halftime of a game against the miami dolphins belichick said , in this business , there are complex and often difficult decisions , but it is my responsibility to make them based on what i feel is best for our football team , in both the short term and long term belichick has made those decisions before last year , he shipped defensive lineman richard seymour , also in the final year of his deal , to the raiders in exchange for a 2011 firstround pick the move diminished new england s defense , raising the question of whether it was anywhere near ready to shoulder the load that the defenses of the championship years did with lessthanexplosive offenses and this offense is unquestionably diminished by moss s departure moss drew double teams in almost every instance , and his absence probably will mean less room for wes welker and hernandez to roam the patriots' biggest vertical threat now is tate , who is also an explosive kick returner , with two returns for touchdowns , including a 103yard dash against the dolphins with the patriots in a bye week , brady , who raved about moss and said he loved him , did not comment on the trade cris carter played with moss in minnesota as an espn analyst , he has been critical at times of moss s effort but on wednesday , he said moss was a nightmare for offenses and was blunt about whether he thought the patriots still possessed a championshipcaliber offense without moss absolutely not there s no way you take randy moss away from any quarterback in this league and that quarterback gets better , carter said but the trades of seymour and moss have helped belichick build a stockpile of draft picks he has two in each of the first four rounds in 2011 that is the crux of how belichick runs the patriots he constantly keeps his eye on the future although he is not giving up on the season , he is also willing to leverage one year against the promise that he will be able to draft enough players to keep the patriots going to the playoffs for years to come that is the polar opposite of the vikings' allin ethos this was a gamble worth making for the vikings , who sputtered to a 12 start and seemed to be losing ground to the packers and the bears in what may be favre s last season they badly needed the downfield threat that moss provides , not only as a balm for favre , who has longed to play with moss since he was still in green bay favre has clearly missed his preferred receiver , sidney rice , who is out until at least the middle of the season after hip surgery i'm always excited to add a good piece to the puzzle , childress said for moss , the return to minnesota represents the most unexpected of homecomings he was a brilliant talent who immediately made the vikings relevant when he was drafted in 1998 the vikings are plenty relevant now what they need for 13 weeks is the content and productive moss the patriots had in 2007 not the one who pouted his way through 2010
bradenton , fla a typical class aaa baseball team has three kinds of players those going up , those going down and those in the middle the ones going up do not stay long the ones going down have played long enough in the majors to know where they fit the ones in the middle just get older garrett jones spent four years with the same class aaa team , the rochester red wings , an affiliate of the minnesota twins , and hit 81 home runs he was mostly a first baseman in the second season , the player ahead of him , justin morneau , was the most valuable player in the american league jones led the international league in games played that season , 2006 , then played some more in venezuela it was his eighth year in the minors without a callup i did n't feel old at all , said jones , who turns 29 in june i still feel young but yeah , on paper , it s like , this guy s got to make it or he s going to be a triplea lifer' it s definitely a tough situation each year you 're stuck in triple a , you just get that much older waiting for that opportunity plenty of players are like jones , their talent seemingly ranking somewhere between class aaa and the majors most never shed the 4a label , but jones did with the , he hit 293 with 21 homers and 44 runs batted in while playing just 82 games jones led major league rookies in homers and slugging percentage \( 567 \) , and was named to the baseball america allrookie team at 28 , he was its oldest member nobody else was even 27 i wish i could sit here and say we thought garrett jones was going to hit 20 home runs , neal huntington , the pirates' general manager , said the bottom line is we thought he was a bigleague player that is a more generous evaluation than the pirates , and every other major league team , gave jones in 2007 that was when he passed through waivers with no team claiming him it was not the first time jones had been rejected the atlanta braves drafted him out of an illinois high school in 1999 jones had a scholarship to purdue but signed with the braves instead their bonus offer included college tuition if he ever wanted to enroll i figured , playing baseball every day , i could improve , and then just see where it takes me , jones said it took him nowhere , at least in the braves' system in 2000 , atlanta drafted first basemen scott thorman and adam laroche , both of whom passed him on the depth chart jones asked for and was granted his release in 2002 , then signed with minnesota and rose steadily before stagnating at class aaa dangerous hitter he had a knack for driving in runs , said pirates manager john russell , who saw jones often when he managed in the minors this guy could hit , he could hit with power , he could run he was a very interesting guy he was one of those guys you looked at and said , i 'd like to see this guy in the major leagues' when he finally made it , for three callups in 2007 , jones disappointed himself he was 1 for 8 the first time , 3 for 17 the second time he hit better the third time but could lift his average to only 208 , with two home runs i was pretty nervous , jones said i was just kind of overwhelmed , still in shock it did n't really register for a while i was just kind of in awe and i was n't really focused on playing the game i was more caught up in being in the big leagues , like , wow , i made it , this is awesome after a final full season at rochester in 2008 , jones signed with the pirates as a minor league free agent a month later , they signed eric hinske also a lefthanded powerhitting first baseman to a major league deal despite a strong spring training , jones went back to the minors he was still there when he turned 28 in june that is past the age by which most players are considered serious prospects probably around 26 or 27 , you start moving out of the prospect phase , said shelley duncan , 30 , who had 30 home runs and 99 rbi at class aaa last season people look at you like you 're what do they call it \? a minor league lifer , or 4a people start saying that duncan , who spent parts of the past three seasons with the yankees , played against jones in class aaa he called jones humble and unassuming , not the kind of player to draw attention to himself he also said he thought of morneau every time he watched jones hit he was almost like the same type of hitter , duncan said and when he got his chance , it was n't a surprise to see how well he did duncan hit five home runs in his first eight major league games , then hit three in his next 60 jones , likewise , had a hot start for the pirates last summer , bashing 10 home runs in his first 75 atbats after hinske was traded june 30 he cooled off for a bit but finished strong , and only four major leaguers hit more home runs from july 1 through the end of the season ryan howard , prince fielder , derrek lee and mark reynolds as the league adjusted to garrett , he adjusted back , huntington said he still showed doubles power and hit some home runs there were some encouraging signs that he may not be a onehit wonder , because he could manipulate the barrel of the bat and hit that pitch away or handle that fastball in there were no real glaring holes in his swing russell says jones has a maintenancefree swing , and no leg kick or hitch with his hands that can cause a long slump the think they have a middleoftheorder slugger for just over the minimum salary , 400 , 000 jones thinks he is finally where he belongs he does not seem bitter about his time in the minors , and said he only briefly considered what else he might do with his life a career in law enforcement , perhaps but none of it could really compare to baseball , jones said you can only play baseball so long i 'd always think , well , you 're going to have plenty of time to do something else just enjoy playing ball as long as i can , and when it s over , it s over three months short of his 29th birthday , his major league journey is just beginning
bill walsh had figured out every angle of his west coast offense by the time brent jones was a young tight end for the san francisco 49ers but more than 20 years later , jones is still struck by an edge walsh had divined that never appeared in a playbook every year he said , if you get a chance , the umpire is sitting right there , they 're not athletic , you can use them as a pick , jones said last week so developed one of football s unwritten snippets of strategy the umpire , plunked precariously into the middle of the defense near the linebackers , evolved into something of a 12th man for the offense , with some players , defenders at their hip , running at him purposely , the intention being to turn him into an unexpected , nonetoonimble obstacle in black and white the offense popularized by walsh , with its emphasis on crossing patterns , continues to thrive , but this season the tight ends , wide receivers and running backs who troll the middle of the field are losing their stripes a year after there were more than 100 collisions involving umpires three sustained concussions and two others needed surgery for their injuries the official is being plucked from the defensive side and dropped into the offensive backfield , 12 to 15 yards deep and to the left of the quarterback , opposite where the referee is stationed from that vantage point , he will continue to fulfill his main responsibilities scouring the line of scrimmage for holding or illegal blocks he will return to the defensive end of the field only for fieldgoal attempts and for the last two minutes of each half the official reason for the change is to protect the most vulnerable member of the officiating crew , the only one in the middle of the action , a nonhelmeted middleager without pads in a maelstrom of big , fast players the practical effect is something else and has been the source of conversation among coaches pages are not being torn from playbooks , but receivers will find that they either have less help or more running room , depending on their perspective in the past , some astute coaches scouted the officiating crew to determine which way the umpire moved on certain plays , the better to use him to full advantage , said herman edwards , the former jets and chiefs coach giants coachtom coughlin said smart veteran receivers were adept at using the umpire on changeofdirection routes , so that when one defender was recovering , the second still had to run around the umpire , giving the receiver an extra step of separation the umpires were especially useful on routes over the middle against mantoman coverage if you had to take an extra step to get him in your line , you did it , jones said it became intuitive when coach walsh first said it , i thought , this is pretty cool this can work or not keyshawn johnson , the former receiver and current espn analyst , said that although he occasionally used the umpire as a pick , he more often found him in his way \( the longtime umpire chad brown was a particular speed bump , johnson said \) and recalled that coaches told him to simply bowl over the umpire if he was in his path pittsburgh steelers receiver hines ward remembers a pass ben roethlisberger threw over the middle , anticipating that ward would be there to catch it but the umpire got in ward s way and the ball caromed off him into the hands of a defender a similar chain of events decided a game in 1995 between the chiefs and the raiders in overtime , raiders quarterback jeff hostetler threw a pass over the middle intended for tim brown but brown became tangled with the umpire jeff rice chiefs cornerback james hasty intercepted the pass and returned the ball 64 yards for a touchdown , giving the chiefs a 2317 victory he needs to get out of there , ward said it s just another defender you 've got to get around the concern for most coaches , though , is more prosaic how will the move affect holding calls \? that s a particular cause of angst for offensiveminded coaches , who believe that defensive linemen , whose hand placement will be blocked from the umpire s view , may have an advantage in their trench tussles with their offensive counterparts but that may be balanced a bit because the nfl concedes that moving the umpire will make it harder to detect false starts by centers and guards the umpire , perched far behind the 6foot6 behemoths on the offensive line , would not seem to have as clear a view of the slight twitches of the head and hands as he would from behind the defense he would have essentially the same view of the defenders as the referee , whose primary job is to watch the quarterback and determine sacks , roughing the passer and incompletions what s he looking for that the other referee is not looking for \? said jon gruden , the former tampa bay buccaneers coach and now an analyst on espn s monday night football you do n't have two thirdbase umpires , gruden said you do n't have two behind home plate being an official is not for everybody , either maybe he should wear equipment umpires who call balls and strikes wear equipment wearing equipment was considered , but rejected , in part because of concerns it would be too cumbersome the league s competition committee , which recommended the umpire move , reviewed offensive holding penalties those calls increased in 2009 , but the committee thought too many were still being missed now , the officiating crew will get two looks from the offensive side , where , the nfl believes , it is easier to spot holding referees , from their vantage point in the offensive backfield , have called more holding penalties than umpires each year since 1994 we think he will have a better view , said carl johnson , the nfl s vice president for officiating he s not running for his life when he s trying to make a call running , in fact , may prove to be the biggest problem with the move one of the umpire s jobs is spotting the ball for the next play but a 25yard pass down the middle of the field could stretch the limits of an umpire s aerobic conditioning , forcing him to run 25 yards to spot the ball , then 15 yards back to get into position behind the offense to help compensate , spotting will be done by committee , johnson said coughlin said he was most interested to see how umpires operate when teams go to a nohuddle offense he could get an early upclose view the giants play the indianapolis colts in week 2 of the regular season that could be quite a workout for the umpire , but there will be one boon for the giants at least dallas clark will not have any zebrastriped help getting open this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos officiating in chicago , fred bryan was knocked down in one of the more than 100 collisions involving umpires in 2009 three sustained concussions \( photograph by charles rex arbogast associated press \) the 49ers' garrison hearst gained some separation from the bears' defense in 2001 after the umpire carl madsen was sent to the turf \( photograph by stephen j carrera associated press \) \( d1 \) unlike chad brown in 2008 , umpires will not be in the line of fire as often because they will start most downs in the backfield \( photograph by ben margot associated press \) \( d5 \)

kabul , afghanistan despite rampant fraud in the parliamentary elections last month , whose preliminary results were announced wednesday , the afghan independent election commission appears to have tried to do an honest job of counting the ballots , an effort that was lauded by the united nations and even by some losing candidates the voting itself , however , was so tainted by ballotbox stuffing and armed intimidation of voters , among other tactics that many candidates are appealing the vote totals to a second electoral body , and in some cases a political solution may have to be found to deal with the inequities in one province with many pashtuns , not one was elected to the parliament because pashtundominated areas were so insecure that people were afraid to vote the number of votes invalidated and identified by the iec point to considerable fraud and electoral irregularities on election day , said staffan de mistura , the special representative for to the united nations secretary general mr de mistura , however , praised the commission s efforts , saying it has shown significant improvements in the management of the postpollingday process president hamid karzai appointed two new leaders to the commission last spring , and several western observers , as well as afghan leaders , praised his choices commission officials and others closely involved in the vote counting said wednesday that neither mr karzai nor members of his inner circle had pressured them , but privately they said that other senior government figures and provincial power brokers did try to influence the election s outcome in all , 13 million votes from 2 , 543 polling stations were invalidated because of fraud , about the same number that were disqualified in the presidential election last year , and 224 candidates were referred to a second electoral body , the electoral complaints commission , for review , said the independent election commission s chairman , fazal ahmad manawi the independent election commission has authority to exclude polling stations where voting appears to have been fraudulent for example , if a polling place recorded more ballots than it was issued , the commission could throw out all the ballots after an investigation the same thing would be likely to happen at a polling station where the votes were evenly divided between two candidates the commission does not throw out votes for an individual candidate based on allegations of voter bribery or intimidation that is the responsibility of the electoral complaints commission most observers expect that vote totals for some candidates will change once the complaint commission weighs in as of sunday , the complaint commission had nearly 2 , 300 category a complaints those that could change the outcome of the election from individual candidates , said ahmad zia rafat , a commission member the large number means that the final election result is likely to be delayed at least until the end of the first week in november it remains to be seen if the afghan people will perceive the election as fair after the presidential election last year , which was tainted by widespread fraud , most afghans appeared to accept president karzai as the winner many reasoned that even after the fraudulent ballots were discarded , he had still received the most votes it is unclear , though , that the results of the parliamentary elections will be similarly accepted the general feeling among afghans if they see lots of commanders win is that the election was hijacked , said martine van bijlert , a codirector of the afghan analysts network , who has tracked afghan elections for several years and that is despite the disqualification of a large number of votes people will be closely watching the outcome of the appeals process in ghazni , kandahar and nangarhar , all populous provinces with a number of seats in ghazni , a majority pashtun province with a couple of districts where members of the hazara ethnic group predominate , hardly a vote for a pashtun candidate was cast because it was too dangerous in pashtun areas for people to go to the polls people wo n't sacrifice their lives to vote for you , said khalid mohammed khan , a pashtun incumbent parliament member from ghazni the election commission did its part , but the security forces failed to provide security i wo n't call these elections legal and legitimate , mr khan added , because even though we have a majority of pashtun people in ghazni , we do not have any pashtun representative in kandahar province , where president karzai s halfbrother is chairman of the provincial council , most candidates who appear to have won seats in parliament are either members of mr karzai s tribe or are his allies the candidate with the greatest number of votes was a cousin , hashmat karzai , who lived in the united states for several years several candidates who are not close to mr karzai appear to have lost and they say their votes were discarded i do n't want to talk about fraud , but my ballots have been stolen , said khan mohammed mujahid , a candidate from the arghandab district of kandahar province i had 15 , 000 votes from all over , especially from arghandab , but now the election commission announced that they counted only 1 , 500 in nangarhar , almost every winning candidate was a former local commander , and some still have gunmen under their control , none of which gives people confidence in the legitimacy of the vote there the clean votes were almost none in nangarhar province , said babrak shinwari , who is an independent and lost his seat in the election last month those votes which were cast on election day , he said , were all bought
there seems to be a strong sentiment in congress that the only constitutional right suspected terrorists have is the right to bear arms i think you 're going too far here , said senator lindsey graham of south carolina at a hearing of the senate homeland security committee on wednesday he was speaking in opposition to a bill that would keep people on the fbi terrorist watch list from buying guns and explosives say what \? yes , if you are on the terrorist watch list , the authorities can keep you from getting on a plane but not from purchasing an ak47 this makes sense to congress because , as graham accurately pointed out , when the founders sat down and wrote the constitution , they did n't consider flying the subject of guns turns congress into a twilight zone people who are perfectly happy to let the government wiretap phones go nuts when the government wants to keep track of weapons permits a guy who stands up in the house and defends the torture of terror suspects will nearly faint with horror at the prospect of depriving someone on the watch list of the right to purchase a pistol we make it so easy for dangerous people to get guns if it s the second amendment , it does n't matter if they 're osama bin laden , said paul helmke , the president of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence graham wanted to make it clear that just because he does n't want to stop gun purchases by possible terrorists , that does n't mean he s not tough on terror i am all into national security i want to stop reading these guys their miranda rights , he said the obama administration has been criticized by many republicans for having followed the rules about how long you can question a terror suspect before you read him his rights these objections have been particularly loud since the arrest of faisal shahzad in the attempted times square bombing no one seems moved by the fact that shahzad , after being told that he had the right to remain silent , continued talking incessantly nobody in their right mind would expect a marine to read someone caught on the battlefield their rights , graham said terror threats make politicians behave somewhat irrationally but the subject of guns makes them act like a paranoid mother ferret protecting her litter the national rifle association , the fiercest lobby in washington , grades every member of congress on how well they toe the nra line lawmakers with heavily rural districts would rather vote to legalize carrying concealed weapons in kindergarten than risk getting less than 100 percent the on terrorists and guns the nature of the threat and proposed reforms , concerned a modest bill sponsored by senator frank lautenberg of new jersey it would allow the government to stop gun sales to people on the fbi terror watch list the same way it does people who have felony convictions because congress has repeatedly rejected this idea , 1 , 119 people on the watch list have been able to purchase weapons over the last six years one of them bought 50 pounds of military grade explosives mayor michael bloomberg of new york city and his police commissioner , ray kelly , dutifully trekked down to washington to plead for the bill on behalf of the nation s cities the only thing they got for their trouble was praise for getting the city through the times square incident in one piece and almost everyone had a good word for the tshirt vendor who first noticed the suspicious car and raised an alert really , if someone had introduced a bill calling for additional tshirt vendors , it would have sailed through in a heartbeat gun legislation , not so popular lautenberg s bill has been moldering in committee , and that is not going to change let me emphasize that none of us wants a terrorist to be able to purchase a gun , said senator susan collins of maine , who nevertheless went on to argue against allowing the government to use the terrorist watch list to keep anyone from being able to purchase , um , a gun some of the people pushing this idea are also pushing the idea of banning handguns , said graham , darkly i do n't think banning handguns makes me safer the terrorist watch list is huge , and some of the names on it are undoubtedly there in error the bill would allow anyone denied the right to purchase a firearm an appeal process , but that would deprive the wouldbe purchaser some precious gunowning time before we subject innocent americans to having to go into court and pay the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back , i want to slow down and think about this , said graham slow is going to be very slow , and the thinking could go on for decades
philadelphia just because the canadiens took three times more shots in the first period than the philadelphia flyers did not mean montreal had a better chance to win tuesday michael leighton was in goal for the flyers , and he calmly withstood barrage after barrage aided by a defensive corps that helped prevent second chances , leighton stopped all 16 shots in the first period and 30 over all to boost the flyers to a 30 victory and a twogamestonone lead in the eastern conference finals tonight , they were on us right off the bat , leighton said but i felt good the flyers received goals from danny briere , simon gagne and ville leino to win their sixth straight game leighton stretched his scoreless streak to 165 minutes 50 seconds , including the 60 shutout of montreal in game 1 on sunday and part of game 7 against boston in the conference semifinals leighton became the first flyers goaltender to post backtoback playoff shutouts in 30 years bernie parent , honored at wachovia center with an orange banner with his retired no 1 jersey , shut out toronto in consecutive starts in 1975 the year the flyers last won the cup leighton , out eight weeks with an ankle injury , took over as the starter on may 10 after brian boucher sustained a knee injury in game 5 against the bruins but leighton , a journeyman who turns 29 on wednesday , was unbeatable once again to me , tonight , he looked as good as i 've seen him , philadelphia coach peter laviolette said leighton said he would have been just as happy if the flyers had won , 31 , but he did not play that way late in the game , he landed on the seat of his pants , legs spread , to make a glove save on a sizzling shot from the point by montreal s p k subban briere and gagne scored powerplay goals , but philadelphia s ability to kill penalties was just as important montreal was 0 for 4 on the power play for the second straight game the canadiens were 0 for 3 in the first period , which ended with only five flyers shots i think we need to find a way to get a better net presence , montreal coach jacques martin said the canadiens went on the power play 2 02 into the game because defenseman lukas krajicek received a slashing penalty but the power play ended after 53 seconds when montreal s scott gomez was called for a hooking penalty the flyers needed 14 seconds of the ensuing power play to score a goal on a pictureperfect rush claude giroux chugged deep into the canadiens' zone before slipping a crossice pass to briere , who only had defenseman hal gill in front of him briere moved to the outside as he faked a shot , using the 6foot7 gill as a screen then briere fired a rising shot that sailed over montreal goaltender jaroslav halak s glove and into the goal at 4 16 it was briere s ninth playoff goal , and his fifth in his last six games the puck is just finding us right now , giroux said of the team s powerplay success as they had in the first period of game 1 , the flyers withstood a ferocious montreal attack as they protected a onegoal lead midway through the first period , the canadiens had a 133 edge in shots on goal the flyers killed a holding penalty on leino and another for having too many men on the ice during the penalty on leino , montreal took six shots on goal and had the flyers frenetically scrambling to swipe the puck from the area around the goal leighton held on sometimes , you need your goalie to steal one for you , briere said the flyers stretched their lead to 20 with a powerplay goal at 15 49 of the period montreal forward brian gionta was called for holding as the flyers controlled the puck in the canadiens' zone kimmo timonen , the philadelphia defenseman , then missed a close shot but the flyers were persistent gagne won a battle for the puck behind the goal , nudging the puck to mike richards , the philadelphia captain , to his right richards slipped the puck to leino in front , and he and gagne whacked at it until it went in we 're at our best when we 're at our simplest , philadelphia defenseman chris pronger said sharks take 20 series lead dustin byfuglien and jonathan toews scored on deflections 90 seconds apart in the second period and the chicago blackhawks rolled to their recordtying seventh straight road win in the playoffs , 42 over the san jose sharks in game 2 of the western conference finals andrew ladd and troy brouwer also scored , and antti niemi made 25 saves for the blackhawks , who have a 20 series lead this is the closest chicago has been to making the stanley cup finals since getting there in 1992 the series moves to chicago for game 3 on friday night and game 4 on sunday that may not be the best thing for the blackhawks , who are only 33 at home this postseason chicago has had its most success on the road , clinching the first two series in nashville and vancouver before taking the first two against the topseeded sharks in a heavyweight conference finals \( ap \) photo the flyers' danny briere

despite consecutive incidents at philadelphia s citizen bank park involving fans who ran onto the playing field during phillies games , major league baseball is not yet reconsidering game security we play 2 , 400 games over the course of a season , the mlb spokesman pat courtney said when this happens two games in a row , in the short view it seems to be a concern but over the course of the season , you see it s an isolated thing the first field trespasser , 17yearold steve consalvi , became notable because the police subdued him by using a taser gun , which was instantly debated because of the potential for harm the second trespasser was simply run down by nonuniformed security personnel and ushered off the field the two incidents in philadelphia highlight a relatively modern concern for many years , broadcasters have not shown people who run onto the field to remove the motivation to do it as a way to get on television but now , in the youtube age , those incidents find an instant media outlet the taser incident was not shown on the television broadcast , but was posted on youtube by dozens of people our policy is not to show fans how run on the field at all , said jay levy , senior coordinating producer for espn s baseball game and studio broadcasts we have n't and we wo n't there s no reason to show it but now we are making sure to record the incident in the truck , not because we are going to immediately show it , but in case it becomes a news story after the fact that is exactly what happened with consalvi , because of the use of the taser gun and espn , like many other news outlets , subsequently showed footage of the incident many online publications also linked to or embedded the youtube video we do n't actively look to show this on our highlights shows , but this quickly became a news story , levy said people were talking about it it took on a life of its own and that might have directly led to the second incident tuesday night before he ran onto the field , the man posted this on his twitter page turn on the phillies game , im about to be on the feild ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the irony of that is that television would not have shown him there were a few , poorquality youtube videos of it , but none drew many visits there was no dramatic taser shooting involved , even though phillies fans were actually chanting , tase him the philadelphia police did decide the officer acted appropriately in using the taser gun , but have said they will review whether officers should use them in nonthreatening situations in the future this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
boise , idaho those who are skeptical of the hype surrounding the no 3 boise state football team might as well get in line behind the broncos' coach , chris petersen , and his players petersen cringes as the inevitable question arises about the team s standing in the polls at his weekly news conference i think if we had our druthers , we would like for people to be talking about us at the end of the year because then it s much more meaningful than it is right now , petersen said this week as the broncos \( 10 \) prepared to play wyoming \( 11 \) on saturday after an impressive victory over virginia tech , which was then ranked no 10 although the broncos were undefeated during the past two regular seasons , petersen said he doubted that his team would escape unscathed again his cautiousness is not because seemed in their second game , probably costing boise state some votes in the coaches' poll this week his constant tempering of expectations reflects his belief that every opponent boise state plays will be going all out to upset the broncos bearing the burden of maintaining a perfect record can be tiresome even in the western athletic conference , which bowl championship series conferences regard as a notch below them there are just a lot of good football teams out there with a lot of good players , petersen said everybody s got 85 scholarships and really good coaches and if you start getting caught up in it meaning the polls it puts more pressure on the kids , and they 're not going to perform as well despite his 504 record at boise state , petersen has learned that the broncos' success is as much about his ability to maintain level heads among his players and staff as it is about x s and o s hearing a boise state player gripe about not getting enough respect is as rare as a broncos loss on their signature blue turf instead , players echo classic coachspeak we 're excited to play again , the senior safety jeron johnson said there s not as much excitement in the media about this game , but we 're excited to play wyoming they 're going to be a great challenge for us beating virginia tech was just one game , said the senior tight end tommy gallarda , whose onehanded touchdown catch against the hokies may remain a tv highlight all season it was a big game , but just one you watch the film and put the game to rest now , we 've moved on to wyoming while college football experts and fans express strong feelings both for and against , the team s story is riveting regardless of perspective boise state s season opener with virginia tech became espn s mostviewed college football game for number of households with growing attention and a mounting number of victories over more established programs , boise state players might be expected to lobby for a place in the national title game but players like billy winn , a junior defensive tackle , refuse to demand anything we understand our place in the system , winn said we accept the position where we are , but we 're not going to listen to what people say of course , we hear it , but we 're just going to play our game none of that stuff really matters until later on in the season so , right now , we go day by day , working on our techniques and the fundamental side of things the boise state coaching staff views that approach as an essential part of laying the foundation for success going into fall camp each year , we always talk about the history of this program , the junior running back d j harper said we talk about where it came from and what we 're a part of right now and how each player on this team is leaving a mark on this program for the next guys that come in going over our past really brings meaning to this program harper exemplifies that focused mentality , even after perhaps the biggest regularseason victory in team history i do n't pay attention to polls , he said i'm just being really honest i do n't even know where we 're ranked i do n't think it matters we just look at it as one game at a time , and where we end up in the end is where we end up
america s courts are built on a system of rules and procedures that assume that almost everyone who comes to court has a lawyer unfortunately , the reality is quite different an increasing number of civil cases go forward without lawyers litigants who cannot afford a lawyer , and either do not qualify for legal aid or are unable to have a lawyer assigned to them because of dwindling budgets , are on their own pro se what s more , they 're often on their own in cases involving lifealtering situations like divorce , child custody and loss of shelter as the economy has worsened , the ranks of the selfrepresented poor have expanded in a recent informal study conducted by the selfrepresented litigation network , about half the judges who responded reported a greater number of pro se litigants as a result of the economic crisis unrepresented litigants now also include many in the middle class and smallbusiness owners who unexpectedly find themselves in distress and without sufficient resources to pay for the legal assistance they need as judges , we believe more needs to be done to meet this growing challenge an inaccessible , overburdened justice system serves none of us well california took a major step forward in october when it became the first state to recognize as a goal the right to counsel in certain civil cases \( the state also committed to a pilot project , financed by court fees , to provide lawyers for lowincome citizens in cases where basic human needs are at stake \) but this is only a beginning it is essential that we promote other efforts to close the justice gap one such effort involves the unbundling of legal services fortyone states , including california and new hampshire , have adopted a model rule drafted by the american bar association , or similar provisions , which allow lawyers to unbundle their services and take only part of a case , a costsaving practice known as limitedscope representation that , with proper ethical safeguards , is responsive to new realities traditionally , lawyers have been required to stay with a case from beginning to end , unless a court has excused them from this obligation now , in those states that explicitly or implicitly allow unbundling , people or businesses can hire a lawyer on a limited basis to help them fill out forms , to prepare documents , to coach them on how to present in court or to appear in court for one or two hearings for example , a lawyer could advise a client in a divorce proceeding about legal principles governing the division of marital assets or provide assistance in calculating childsupport obligations a lawyer might also draft pleadings or legal memos or provide representation at a hearing to obtain a domesticviolence restraining order what could be wrong with this \? well , some lawyers have expressed concern that limited legal representation will encourage litigants to dissect their cases in an effort to save money , sacrificing quality representation that the litigant might otherwise be able to afford we have also heard the argument that by offering too much assistance to selfrepresented litigants , the courts themselves are undermining the value of lawyers and the legal profession apparently , some are concerned that the court system will become so userfriendly that there will be no need for lawyers we respectfully disagree litigants who can afford the services of a lawyer will continue to use one until a case or problem is resolved lawyers make a difference and clients know that but for those whose only option is to go it alone , at least some limited , affordable time with a lawyer is a valuable option we should all encourage in fact , we believe that limitedscoperepresentation rules will allow lawyers especially sole practitioners to service people who might otherwise have never sought legal assistance we also believe that carefully drafted ethical rules allowing lawyers to handle part of a case give the legal profession an opportunity to help the courts address the evergrowing number of litigants who cross our thresholds this cause has special relevance now as state courts are faced with serious cutbacks in financing , forcing some to close their doors one day a week or a month , lay off frontline staff members and delay jury trials none of this bodes well for the judicial system or for those seeking to vindicate their rights through the courts , whether they have a lawyer or not we need members of the legal profession to join with us , as many have done , in meeting this challenge by making unbundled legal services and other innovative solutions like selfhelp web sites , online assistance programs and court selfhelp centers work for all who need them if we are to maintain public trust and confidence in the courts , we must keep faith with our founding principles and our core belief in equal justice under the law
the most familiar ideas of geometry were inspired by an ancient vision a vision of the world as flat from parallel lines that never meet , to the pythagorean theorem discussed in last week s column , these are eternal truths about an imaginary place , the twodimensional landscape of plane geometry conceived in india , china , egypt and babylonia more than 2 , 500 years ago , and codified and refined by euclid and the greeks , this flatearth geometry is the main one \( and often the only one \) being taught in high schools today but things have changed in the past few millennia in an era of globalization , google earth and transcontinental air travel , all of us should try to learn a little about spherical geometry and its modern generalization , differential geometry the basic ideas here are only about 200 years old pioneered by carl friedrich gauss and bernhard riemann , differential geometry underpins such imposing intellectual edifices as einstein s general theory of relativity at its heart , however , are beautiful concepts that can be grasped by anyone who s ever ridden a bicycle , looked at a globe or stretched a rubber band and understanding them will help you make sense of a few curiosities you may have noticed in your travels for example , when i was little , my dad used to enjoy quizzing me about geography which is farther north , he d ask , rome or new york city \? most people would guess new york , but surprisingly they re at almost the same latitude , with rome being just a bit farther north on the usual map of the world \( the misleading mercator projection , where greenland appears gigantic \) it looks like you could go straight from new york to rome by heading due east yet airline pilots never take that route they always fly northeast out of new york , hugging the coast of canada i used to think they were staying close to land for safety s sake , but that s not the reason it s simply the most direct route , if you take the earth s curvature into account the shortest path from new york to rome goes past nova scotia and newfoundland , then heads out over the atlantic , and finally veers south of ireland and across france for arrival in sunny italy this kind of path on the globe is called an arc of a great circle like straight lines in ordinary space , great circles on a sphere contain the shortest paths between any two points they re called great because they re the largest circles you can have on a sphere conspicuous examples include the equator and the longitudinal circles that pass through the north and south poles another property that lines and great circles share is that they re the straightest paths that might sound strange all paths on a globe are curved , so what do we mean by straightest \? well , some paths are more curved than others the great circles don t do any additional curving , above and beyond what they re forced to do by following the surface of the sphere here s a way to visualize this imagine you re riding a tiny bicycle on the surface of a globe , and you re trying to stay on a certain path if it s part of a great circle , you won t ever need to steer that s the sense in which great circles are straight in contrast , if you try to ride along a line of latitude near one of the poles , you ll have to keep turning the handlebars of course , as surfaces go , the plane and the sphere are abnormally simple the surface of a human body , or a tin can , or a bagel would be more typical they all have far less symmetry , as well as various kinds of holes and passageways that make them more confusing to navigate in this more general setting , finding the shortest path between any two points becomes a lot trickier so rather than delving into technicalities , let s stick to an intuitive approach this is where rubber bands come in handy specifically , imagine a slippery elastic string that always contracts as far as it can , while remaining confined to the surface with its help , we can easily determine the shortest path between new york and rome , or for that matter , between any two points on any surface tie the ends of the string to the points of departure and arrival and let the string pull itself tight , while clinging to the surface s contours when the string is as taut as these constraints allow , voila ! it traces the shortest path on surfaces just a little more complicated than planes or spheres , something strange and new can happen many locally shortest paths can exist between the same two points for example , consider the surface of a soup can , with one point lying directly below the other then the shortest path between them is clearly a line segment , as shown above , and our elastic string would find that solution so what s new here \? the cylindrical shape of the can opens up new possibilities for all kinds of contortions suppose we require that the string encircles the cylinder once before connecting to the second point now when the string pulls itself taut , it forms a helix , like the curves on old barbershop poles this helical path qualifies as another solution to the shortest path problem , in the sense that it s the shortest of the candidate paths nearby if you nudge the string a little , it would necessarily get longer and then contract back to the helix you could say it s the locally shortest path the regional champion of all those that wrap once around the cylinder \( by the way , this is why the subject is called differential geometry it studies the effects of small local differences on various kinds of shapes , such as the difference in length between the helical path and its neighbors \) but that s not all there s another champ that winds around twice , and another that goes around three times , and so on there are infinitely many locally shortest paths on a cylinder ! of course , none of these helices is the globally shortest path the straightline path is shorter than all of them likewise , surfaces with holes and handles permit many locally shortest paths , distinguished by their pattern of weaving around various parts of the surface the following video by the mathematician konrad polthier of the free university of berlin illustrates the nonuniqueness of these locally shortest paths , or geodesics , on the surface of an imaginary planet shaped like a figure8 , a surface known in the trade as a twoholed torus the red , yellow and green geodesics all visit very different parts of the planet , thereby executing different loop patterns but what they all have in common is their superior directness compared to the paths nearby and just like lines on a plane or great circles on a sphere , these geodesics are the straightest possible curves on the surface they bend to conform with the surface , but don t bend within it to make this clear , polthier has produced another illuminating video here , a motorcycle rides along a geodesic highway on a twoholed torus , following the lay of the land the remarkable thing is that the motorcycle s handlebars are locked it doesn t need to steer to stay on the road this underscores the earlier intuition that geodesics , like great circles , are the natural generalization of straight lines with all these flights of fancy , you may be wondering if geodesics have anything to do with reality of course they do einstein showed that light beams follow geodesics as they sail through the universe the famous bending of starlight around the sun , detected in the eclipse observations of 1919 , confirmed that light travels on geodesics through curved spacetime , with the warping being caused by the sun s gravity at a more downtoearth level , the mathematics of finding shortest paths is critical in everything from the gps navigation systems in our cars to the routing of traffic on the internet in these situations , however , the relevant space is a gargantuan maze of addresses and links , as opposed to the smooth surfaces considered above , and the mathematical issues have to do with the speed of algorithms what s the most efficient way to find the shortest path through a network \? given the myriad of potential routes , the task would be overwhelming , were it not for the ingenuity of the mathematicians and computer scientists who cracked it sometimes when people say the shortest distance between two points is a straight line , they mean it figuratively , as a way of ridiculing nuance and affirming common sense in other words , keep it simple but battling obstacles can give rise to great beauty so much so that in art , and in math , it s often more fruitful to impose constraints on ourselves think of haiku , or sonnets , or telling the story of your life in six words the same is true of all the math that s been created to find the shortest way from here to there when you can t take the easy way out two points many paths mathematical bliss notes thanks to robert vanderbei , for sending the link to his presentation about estimating the earth s diameter from a photograph of a sunset margaret nelson , for preparing the line drawings doug arnold , bob connelly , paul ginsparg , jon kleinberg , andy ruina and carole schiffman , for their comments and suggestions and konrad polthier , for generously sharing his videos of geodesics need to print this column \?

when the idea of the euro was first broached , there was extensive debate about whether europe constituted an optimum currency area the key question was whether european nations would have an adequate way to adjust to asymmetric shocks , which left some economies more depressed than others when countries have their own currencies , they can deal with such shocks , at least in part , by devaluing an argument made most eloquently by none other than milton friedman \( pdf \) lacking that alternative , something else is needed so now we have a euro crisis , which to me at least hinges crucially on that very issue what makes greek problems so intractable is the fact that there s little hope for growth for years to come , because greek costs and prices are out of line and will need years of painful deflation to get back in line spain wouldn t be in trouble at all if it weren t for the fact that the bubble years left its costs too high , again requiring years of painful deflation yet if you look at many discussions of the euro crisis , they simply ignore the adjustment issue not to especially bash marco pagano , but how can you write a whole essay on the euro s troubles without so much as mentioning the problem of getting relative costs and prices in line \? it s tempting to psychoanalyze here to note that if you pretend that it s all about fiscal profligacy , the problem seems solvable with a bit more discipline , but if you admit that the original optimum currency area issues are key to the situation , you wonder whether the common currency really makes sense but whatever the reason , it s stunning to see so many smart people pretending not to notice the elephant in the room
in his overture to carmen , bizet introduces a recurring motif that listeners have invariably associated with fate and with the fatal liaison of carmen and don jos the composer meant it to be played with the curtain lowered then , as the stage action proceeds , he develops it powerfully , bringing it back often , in hauntingly different versions like a flash of lightning , like a slow but tremendous warning , like an irresistible undertow during the overture in richard eyre s new production of the at the house , a bloodred diagonal gash in the front curtain opens \( this is later echoed by a red diagonal slash on the dress carmen is wearing when she is killed \) , so that we can see a danced treatment of this fate motif by christopher wheeldon man \( martin harvey , formerly of the royal ballet \) meets woman \( maria kowroski of the new york city ballet \) to make love in a red arena the main point of this choreography is its image of sex she lies on the floor and opens her legs wide for him at another point \( though this was none too clear on opening night \) , as he lifts her high , she seems to stab his upper back as if he were a bull , she the toreador man , woman , sex , death get it \? this is scarcely subtle , but it prepares us for the rest of the production \( which will be performed on saturday afternoon and broadcast live in highdefinition to movie theaters around the world \) never mind that , when carmen and jos the singers finally meet as lovers in act ii , she announces that she will dance for him never mind that carmen s first three big solos the habanera , the seguidilla and the danse boh mienne are all dance numbers in their rhythm so , when she tells jos that she s going to dance for him in act ii , we might presume that she means it , especially as bizet gives her castanets and a rhythm that subtly recalls that of the habanera for mr eyre and , apparently , mr wheeldon dance , however , is not what carmen intends she \( elina garanca \) takes off her shoes , nuzzles jos \( roberto alagna \) from behind , wraps a leg round him , then lies on the floor and opens her legs wide to him get it \? just as the woman did in the overture and never mind that bizet does n't give us the fate motif here the idea of fate in carmen \( as the heroine tells us in the card trio \) is n't difficult carmen has had many lovers and would have gone on to have many more her final lover , the toreador escamillo , is among those who know that her affairs are short but in choosing the hitherto innocent jos as her sexual victim , she actually chooses the man who will kill her and that s both her fate and his what is remarkable is the change in him , from innocent country boy to jealous killer not for nothing did the bass feodor chaliapin the most extraordinary singing actor in opera a century ago say that jos was the only role that made him want to be a tenor when bigname choreographers are brought into carmen , they are usually given dances \( sometimes to noncarmen music \) in act iv in the 1937 met revival with rosa ponselle as carmen , the act iv dances were choreographed by george balanchine \( unlike ms garanca , ponselle was among the many carmens who have tried some real dancing \) here , however , all the dancing is over before the main action of act iii mr wheeldon starts the first part of the act ii gypsy dance without musical accompaniment , then runs it into bizet s music inevitably , this gives us the feeling that mr wheeldon s intentions are greater than bizet can satisfy mr wheeldon gives us percussive spanish footwork and a phalanx of dancers , but the number is not a big deal ballet abounds in spanish numbers more exciting than this this is , nonetheless , the production s finest dance its worst \? having associated ms kowroski and mr harvey in our minds with the fate death aspect of carmen in the act i prelude , mr eyre and mr wheeldon bring them back to dance another pas de deux in the idyllic prelude to act iii their presence makes little sense of musicdrama this is the part of the opera where the music is freest from fate , death or sex and their duet is all romantic clich ms kowroski repeatedly makes standard gestures \( not unlike the swan queen in swan lake \) to get away from her partner , then returns to his embrace that kind of staginess is n't found elsewhere in this production mr eyre generally knows how to make his singers look like characters with their own lives and motivations , even if those do n't always make sense within the framework of carmen but his characters never once moved as if the music impelled them this will not be an important staging of carmen unless the onstage action starts to show what is musically dramatic about this musicdrama the met , under peter gelb , is making an impressive effort to win highlevel choreographers for its operas \( as i 've written before in these pages \) but too often the house s current stagings , new or old , lack those qualities of musically attentive action that can make operatic acting akin to great choreography in act iii of les contes d'hoffmann , the villain dapertutto sings the aria scintille , diamant , telling his magic gem to lure giulietta attirela ! \( lure her ! \) as soon as he ends , a rapid figure in the strings seems to indicate her running on at his behest , whereupon at once he addresses her , cher ange that rapid writing for the strings recalls a similar passage in act ii , scene 2 of la traviata , and i have always hoped to see a violetta run in on the music , as the critic michael scott has described maria callas doing in the 1958 covent garden revival of traviata , her feet hitting the semiquavers like a ballerina but there are other possibilities in the 1951 michael powellemeric pressburger film the tales of hoffmann , frederick ashton s choreography gives giulietta a glamorously chilling entrance in which black rose petals trail through her fingers in bartlett sher s new staging of the opera at the met , however , giulietta lazily saunters on during dapertutto s aria he fastens the diamond about her neck while he continues to sing , and so he ends the aria by repeating the words attirela ! \( lure her ! \) , which have now become wholly meaningless elsewhere in this met hoffmann , doudou huang provides coarse choreography for both the dolls in the prologue s kleinzack story and for five couples who are clones of the doll olympia and hoffmann himself the dancers tend to face front in germanexpressionist style mr huang s rhythmic choices are obvious at every moment the effect makes offenbach s music \( which i love \) far less fresh and appealing choreography and opera direction are separate arts , and few have excelled at both but , though they proceed by different methods , they are intimately related much of the best choreography helps us to hear the music better i ask the same of opera direction
mark mcgwire s admission last week that he used performanceenhancing drugs did not improve his hall of fame candidacy , according to an informal poll by the times david waldstein surveyed 35 hall of fame voters , and none who had bypassed mcgwire said the confession would make a difference twentysix respondents said they had never voted for mcgwire and did not expect to change their minds , although many reserved that right nine , or 26 percent , said they had voted for him , and all but larry stone said they probably would continue to do so before mcgwire s confession , one who had left him off the ballot eventually voted for him the reason i didn t vote for him before is because i suspected he used steroids during his career , tim brown of yahoo sports said now that he s confirmed it , i won t be changing the vote share your thoughts in the comments section below
the mets have seemingly made more changes to citi field this offseason than to their roster all were cosmetic think more blue and orange in and around the ballpark but none were about to affect the course of a game at least until tuesday , when it was revealed that the mets will chop in half the 16foot wall that shields a sliver of straightaway center field otherwise known as the area that houses the home run apple when the mets begin the 2010 season april 5 against florida , that fence , 408 feet from home plate , will stand 8 feet high the modification was first reported by the daily news none of the dimensions will change , and , just as significant , neither will the heights of any other outfield wall it s still 15 feet 8 1 2 inches in left field , 186 1 2 below the rightfield overhang and 11 feet on either side of this new notch so , why did the mets decide to change such a modest section \? according to a club spokesman , it had nothing to do with promoting a more homerunfriendly environment or increasing the visibility of the apple not that it popped up much last season , anyway the mets , rather , wanted to make the heights more uniform by reducing the obtrusiveness of that 16foot rise even though some metrics , like park factor index , show that citi field actually favors home runs , it has developed a reputation around baseball as a pretty stingy place fueling that perception is its combination of high walls and cavernous dimensions , especially in the gaps , which sapped more than a few potential homers in 2009 from david wright among the 16 national league ballparks , citi field ranked 11th in home runs yielded per game , 160 the mets , destroyed by injuries and flummoxed by a bewildering power outage from wright , hit 95 home runs last season 49 at citi field that was the fewest in baseball any uptick in home runs for 2010 was going to come from a consistently healthy lineup \( already , carlos beltran is facing an uncertain return \) or an improved offense aside from jason bay , whose 30to35homer potential should translate well to citi field , the mets will enter this season with familiar faces and not ones known for power at first base , second base and catcher , all positions that could have been improved over the offseason those moves would have been more than cosmeticben shpigel
as an irishamerican , i do n't usually trumpet the work of a nation that kept my ancestors under its boot heel for nearly 300 years but having just finished the memoirs of two great exports of britain , i rise to praise a pair of brits in the season of bookbuying christopher hitchens , the polemical polymath , is to modern american discourse what lenny bruce was to comedy he changed the game , and in so doing forced us to examine our core beliefs his story , hitch22 , was hitting the bestseller lists this year just as he was diagnosed with a killer type of esophageal cancer he has vowed to go to his grave as an intellectually curious atheistthe beautiful ruin that is keith richards , guitarist and guiding musical force behind the rolling stones , is best known for being a living cadaver a heroin addict during his most productive years , richards the author is now competing with former president george w bush for bragging rights to the most popular nonfiction book in this country in his story , life , the united states and its black music saved him as a man and an artist the atheist poked the most religious of western democracies , assailing us for flabbiness of spirit and outright ignorance the junkie found the best of chicago blues lost in the back alley of american pop culture , and made those soulstirring chords mainstream forever both men , on paper at least , are hard to love , but impossible to dislike in the united states , they got what so many from other shores have obtained renewal life in britain had seemed like one long antechamber to a room that had too many barriers to entry , hitchens writes of his move across the atlantic in 1981 , becoming a citizen 26 years later a product of oxford , he displays none of the educated english habit of using unnecessary modifiers and disclaimers no bit of cancer or spot of bad luck from him he greeted one reporter in august with , how am i \? i'm dying in his words , sarah palin is a disgraceful opportunist and real moral coward the jihadists who attacked the united states represent the mirthless , medieval , deathobsessed barbarism of islamic fundamentalism and recreational drugs keith richards s nutrients are a form of weakminded escapism almost as contemptible as religion of course , he does share his countrymen s taste for the grape and grain , describing his daily intake as at least one bottle of wine and two drinks of mr walker s amber restorative and as with any english bad boy , he fell in with the wrong crowd for a time , finding common cause with president bush in a dishonest war of choice against iraq that was his oneoff , and it was a big one his lasting contribution will be his challenge to religion once , while waiting in line for coffee with hitchens , i asked him why his book god is not great was such a big hit in a nation with so many believers he said it was because many of those believers are actually skeptics and , indeed , after reading his provocative but not entirely convincing tract against faith , i kept hearing the voice of a jesuit teacher from my high school , who urged us to be in constant search of your god and yourself hitchens may not have long to live but he will not go gently a few days ago he debated religion with tony blair , comparing god to a kind of benign north korea by audience consensus , hitchens handily won the match with the former british prime minister richards will be 67 later this month , and long ago fell off the list of rock stars most likely to die soon so what if he once stayed up for nine days in a row , and displayed the junkie s paranoia for sleeping with weapons \? if that was the price for the musical genius of tumbling dice , rip this joint or midnight rambler , so be it his music grew out of devotional listening to howlin' wolf , muddy waters , jimmy reed and other american bluesmen chicago blues hit us right between the eyes , richards writes , and as long as we were together , we would pretend to be black men he has never thought otherwise you can come from anywhere and be any color , he writes we found that out later should it surprise us that richards is now a longmarried connecticut gentleman , a fierce reader of history , living out his years with a wellstocked library \? or that he was pardoned for reckless driving by a governor of arkansas , the evangelical mike huckabee \? not really for all of our current miseries , this country nurtures second acts better than any other and produces its share of first acts , as well this oped appeared in print on december 4 , 2010 this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

nfl head coach , with the jets in 1994 and new england from 1997 to 1999 he had a 3331 record in four seasons and made the playoffs twice , but his tenures , particularly with the patriots , appeared doomed from the outset in new england , carroll followed bill parcells , and worse yet , he after a appearance carroll wanted to install a system similar to san francisco s , but he said he failed to properly convey the tenets he said his west coast mentality clashed in an east coast environment on personnel matters , he to general manager bobby grier it was disconnected , and that was my responsibility , carroll said i was n't able to make it come together , when i knew that that s what you have to do , or else you fail tedy bruschi , a turned espn football analyst , remembered the energy with carroll , that always stood out energy in meetings energy in practice as if red bull powered carroll instead of oxygen but bruschi said some of his teammates disdained that enthusiastic , energetic , collegetype approach they lived the parcells way , loved the parcells way , and carroll s methods stood in stark contrast he met resistance at the time , bruschi did not notice the disconnect between carroll and the front office but later , when he watched bill belichick and scott pioli operate seamlessly and the patriots won super bowls , he saw the difference carroll had run a team divided there were veteran players , key , important players , who only wanted to do it parcells s way , bruschi said pete should have gotten another year , and if he did , there s no doubt in my mind we would have been successful instead , carroll had enormous success in college he said he never at least five nfl teams inquired over the years , but none of those overtures , carroll said , advanced beyond an initial conversation he considered his philosophy at odds with typical nfl philosophy he refused to divide the approach in any manner , because i knew it would be doomed to fail when the seahawks called , at the behest of the owner paul allen , what most surprised carroll was his reaction to their offer he surged with excitement , bordering on euphoria he called friends and asked what they thought about a return to the nfl do n't be crazy , one told him but every important element aligned carroll , a selfdescribed west coast guy , had found a west coast team , in a lackluster division , with two draft picks in the first 14 over all ownership ceded almost total control \( skeptics note again the ncaa investigation at southern california carroll testified last month before the ncaa s committee on infractions \) the most important thing was that they were willing to accept our philosophy and approach , carroll said they came after that they hired the philosophy that was important to me , the key carroll described the philosophy in vague terms the short version to perform better than before , to pursue a competitive edge , to maximize potential but carroll is selling the same in seattle that he sold in southern california himself asked for an example of his philosophy in practice , he said nine years every single moment of the time i was at sc was an example and i feel different now we 're already off on a totally different path it s a cultural shift i do n't know the right way or the wrong way i just know our way carroll said he could already feel the atmosphere changing , in the building and from the players no longer charged with recruiting , he found a quieter , more footballcentric environment and filled it with familiar assistants , the same philosophy , the same music blasting from his ipod bruschi pointed to belichick as an example of a head coach whose later tenure proved more successful than his first there s no reason to doubt pete , bruschi said he s already done it in the nfl he won he took teams to the playoffs and he 'll do it again carroll inherits a roster in transition as he returns to the nfl the seahawks went 923 the past two seasons , as the front office feuded and the talent dwindled a house divided sure failed is how tod leiweke , the , described the dynamics to the seattle times the pillars that led the greatest run in franchise history shaun alexander , mike holmgren , matt hasselbeck and walter jones are gone or nearing the end jones , a 36yearold offensive tackle , could retire before this season that would leave only hasselbeck , who will compete for the quarterback s job with charlie whitehurst , in a move that raised eyebrows across the nfl the super bowl after the 2005 season , with alexander scoring almost at will and holmgren scowling on the sideline , seems like a distant memory where carroll failed in new england , he must connect his program here , with swirling , continual change he says the process is not instant then he says he will not be patient then he says he wants to win instantly , right now he grabs the digital recorder on his desk and holds it near the speakers some philosophy , a little foo fighters , for the road this is classic carroll , nfl version , 30 come and feel the sunshine
louhe , china xu lindong , a poor village farmer with closecropped hair and a fourthgrade education , knew nothing but decades of backbreaking labor even at age 50 , the rope of muscles on his arms bespoke a lifetime of hard plowing and harvesting in the fields of his native henan province but after four years locked up in zhumadian psychiatric hospital , he was barely recognizable to his siblings emaciated , barefoot , clad in tattered striped pajamas , mr xu spoke haltingly his face was etched with exhaustion i was so heartbroken when i saw him i cannot describe it , said his elder brother , xu linfu , recalling his first visit there , in 2007 my brother was as strong as a bull now he looked like a hospital patient xu lindong s confinement in a locked mental ward was all the more notable , his brother says , for one extraordinary fact he was not the least bit deranged angered by a dispute over land , he had merely filed a series of complaints against the local government the government s response was to draw up an order to commit him to a mental hospital and then to forge his brother s name on the signature line he was finally released in april , after six and a half years in zhumadian and a second mental institution in an interview , he said he had endured 54 electricshock treatments , was repeatedly roped to his bed and was routinely injected with drugs powerful enough to make him swoon fearing he would be left permanently disabled , he said , he attempted suicide three times mr xu s ordeal exemplifies far broader problems in china s psychiatric system a gaping lack of legal protections against psychiatric abuses , shaky standards of medical ethics and poorly trained psychiatrists and hospital administrators who sometimes feel obliged to accept anyone sane or not who is escorted by a government official no one knows how often cases like mr xu s occur but human rights activists say confinements in mental hospitals appear to be on the rise because the local authorities are under intense pressure to nip social unrest in the bud , but at the same time are less free than they once were to jail people they consider troublemakers the police know that to arbitrarily detain someone is illegal they have to worry about that now , said huang xuetao , a lawyer in shenzhen , in guangdong province , who specializes in mental health law but officials have discovered this big hole in the psychiatric system , and they are increasingly taking advantage of it worse , ms huang said , the government squanders its meager health care resources confining harmless petitioners like mr xu while neglecting people desperately in need of help she and a colleague recently analyzed 300 news reports involving people who had been hospitalized for mental illness and others who had not those who needed to be treated were not and those who should not have been treated were treated and guarded , their study concluded liu feiyue , the founder of civil rights and livelihood watch , a chinese humanrights organization , said his group had compiled a database of more than 200 chinese citizens who were wrongly committed to mental hospitals in the past decade after they filed grievances called petitions in china against the government he said he suspected that the real number was much higher because his organization s list was compiled mostly from accounts on the internet the government has no place to put these people , he said china no longer discloses how many petitioners seek redress , but the government estimated in 2004 that more than 10 million people write or visit the government with petitions each year only two in a thousand complaints are resolved , according to research cited in a study this year by tsinghua university in beijing in annual performance reviews of local government officials , reducing the number of petitioners is considered a measure of good governance allowing them to band together , and possibly stir up broader unrest , is an significant black mark that can lead to demotion classified as crazy the most dogged petitioners are often classified as crazy in an interview last year , sun dongdong , chief of forensic psychiatry at prestigious peking university , said , i have no doubt that at least 99 percent of china s pigheaded , persistent professional petitioners are mentally ill he later apologized for what he said was an inappropriate remark yan jun , who heads the ministry of health s mental health bureau , declined repeated requests for an interview on whether petitioners were wrongly confined and other issues with the mental health system

nbc got the best and worst of intimate commentary during its coverage of the olympics on wednesday night , thanks to some strategically placed microphones the network was able to bring viewers in on perhaps the most emotionally spontaneous moment of the games when the triumphant american downhill skier rushed into the arms of her husband and coach , thomas vonn , and exploded into joyous sobs the moment and their full conversation was captured by s audio every sob , every word of encouragement and even the smack of their lips as the couple kissed before she went off to be interviewed a couple of hours later , a microphone caught another conversation just as clearly between american coaches and the halfpipe snowboard star , who had already but was being encouraged to take another run just for fun the encouragement included some spontaneous expletives normally avoided at all costs by broadcast networks in this case , the conversation was captured live nbc does not have a delay on its audio feed during its live coverage and thus could not be edited out nbc s announcers apologized immediately for the inappropriate language in the first case , nbc was directly involved in ensuring that the exchange between the vonns would be heard in full mike mccarley , a spokesman for nbc sports , confirmed that the network had placed a microphone on thomas vonn we wanted to be able to capture him yelling encouragement to her as she came down the course , mccarley said then , after she won , the mic provided the extra benefit of capturing the high emotion between the couple we just let it run , mccarley said at the halfpipe area , none of the coaches were wearing microphones , but nbc has placed boom mics at many locations to pick up as much of the sound from the action as possible \( in this case , to capture the schuss of the snowboards heading down the starting point \) mccarley said one of those microphones had captured the chargedup comments from the coaches to white , barnyard references and all but nbc should not be in any danger of repercussions from the comments going out on the air live , as it was in 2003 , when the singer bono live after winning a golden globe award in that episode , nbc was threatened with a fine after the declared broadcasters liable even for unintended live obscene language but the rules for broadcasters change depending on the hour that certain words are uttered after 10 pm , the rules for inadvertent expletives are more lenient in this case , the verbiage was heard even later , after 11 pm

many chicago political axioms have come under assault from reformers and federal prosecutors in recent years , including where s mine \? and we do n't want nobody nobody sent but you ca n't beat somebody with nobody remains as true as ever with the 2011 mayoral election less than six months away despite polls showing that he is less popular now than at any other point in his 21year tenure , mayor seems poised to glide into his seventh term over what appears to be weak opposition in a city where one richard daley or the other has been mayor for 42 of the last 55 years , it is much easier to criticize the boss than to find a candidate who can raise the campaign money , build the citywide stature needed , and clearly articulate an alternative plan to lead chicago the few who might be most capable are unwilling to cross mayor daley and prefer to wait until the 67yearold mayor steps down voluntarily several potentially strong candidates did not deny that they would love to have the job but only if mr daley bows out , something he appears unlikely to do now , if ever in that category are rahm emanuel , the white house chief of staff and former mayoral campaign aide , as well as tom dart , the cook county sheriff a handful of local elected officials , including alderman scott waguespack \( 32nd ward \) , alderman robert fioretti \( 2nd ward \) and state representative john fritchey have ramped up their criticisms of mr daley none have committed to challenging the mayor in the february election , but if they do , even some mayoral critics doubt that they could mount an effective insurgent campaign pondering their options most loudly are mr fioretti and mr waguespack , two freshmen city council members at this point , though , both are circulating nominating petitions to run for reelection as aldermen , not for mayor each would begin a mayoral campaign with a fraction of the nearly 15 million that mr daley has in his political war chest , state records show it s almost like daley wins by default , said don rose , a veteran democratic consultant he is more vulnerable than four years ago i just do n't see a formidable figure who is willing to challenge him mr rose played central roles in two of the biggest political surprises in the city s history jane byrne s election as mayor in 1979 , and the 1983 victory of harold washington , the first black mayor of chicago but this time , mr rose said , he does not see the makings of a close race , much less an upset it s going to take something more than a fioretti or a waguespack , he said as has been his custom , mr daley has not yet announced whether he will run for reelection but william daley , the mayor s brother and longtime political adviser , told the chicago news cooperative last week that he expected him to seek a seventh term william daley said he was skeptical that potential challengers who have recently emerged would end up on the ballot next year we 've seen this movie six times , he said other mayoral supporters echoed william daley s expectation that his brother was not ready to step down from the office he has held without serious challenge since 1989 he seems totally engaged in it not that he enjoys every minute , said john schmidt , the mayor s first chief of staff the economy has made his job much more difficult the mayor s notoriously prickly skin is pulled thinner than ever as the city s budget deficit grows to record levels the dire economic times have emboldened some elected officials to increasingly distance themselves from the mayor he does n't have a vision for the city , mr waguespack said in an interview last week the alderman has sought to capitalize on his vote against the unpopular privatization of the city parking meter system he was one of only five council members to oppose the 115 billion deal in december 2008 mr fioretti sharply criticized the mayor at a recent fundraiser , blaming him for the decline in the number of police officers and for the city s budget crunch we 're facing a 6547 million deficit because of mismanagement , he said i will tell you , mismanagement not of one year , two years or this economic crisis , but of 20 years last month , the mayor made a surprise announcement that he would dedicate a park in mr fioretti s ward , two days before a similar event the alderman had planned he must be very frightened of something , mr fioretti said , accusing the mayor of purposely upstaging him that or he s just being the child that he is greg goldner , who ran the mayor s landslide reelection in 2003 , said that many residents are discontented with the way things are , but that they would have to be convinced that a mayoral hopeful offered an alternative vision for leading chicago these selfproclaimed challengers need to be more sophisticated in their criticisms if they want to connect with voters , mr goldner said mr daley s lopsided reelection victories have usually been against black challengers like dorothy brown , the clerk of the cook county circuit court , who ran in 2007 no major black or hispanic leaders have suggested that they would run this time , with representative jesse l jackson jr remaining quiet since his name surfaced in the corruption case of former gov rod r blagojevich alderman howard brookins \( 21st ward \) said black business leaders would not want to contribute to a rival for fear of reprisal by the mayor before supporting someone else , mr brookins said , they 're going to wait until it s the bottom of the ninth to see if he s still in the game before they 'd be willing to back him the mayoral aspirants who have already announced that they plan to run are william walls iii , a perennial candidate , and jay stone , who said he worked as a clinical hypnotherapist mr walls finished last in the threeway race for mayor in 2007 , with 9 percent of the vote , and mr stone lost a 2003 bid for a council seat candidates have until nov 22 to file nominating petitions for the feb 22 nonpartisan primary if nobody wins a majority , the top two votegetters would have a runoff election in april the mayor said last week that it was too early to make political plans and declined to comment specifically on potential challengers he is only slightly more willing to address policy criticisms from wouldbe opponents without naming names , he responded heatedly last month to proposals from mr fritchey , who questioned the administration s use of tax increment financing , a development tool relying on tax dollars that would otherwise go to schools mr daley held three news conferences across the city in the span of a few days to point out that he had used tax increment financing to complete such projects as a new playground at a north side park and the visibly irritated mayor told reporters he would not heed fiscal advice from state and federal lawmakers or from the city s economically struggling news media mr fritchey suggested that the mayor s reactions reflected an inflexible management style not every proposed idea has to be seen as a challenge to his authority , but that has been the case , he said mr fritchey said he thought chicagoans were more interested in having a viable option for mayor than they had been in decades although he said some had approached him about being that alternative to mr daley , mr fritchey quickly added that he was merely thinking about running and would only do so if i felt there was a broad core of support out there

correspondents who covered the war in iraq are reflecting on their time there and the official end of us combat operations sabrina tavernise covered iraq between 2003 and 2006 i remember an interview with an illiterate man who was a powerful member of a shiite militia group in the summer of 2006 he was important , but he was also odious a braggart and smallminded man who took pleasure in others' pain the meeting provoked profound despair in my iraqi friend and colleague , a woman in her 40s named yusra people like this rule us now , she said it was iraq s darkest time , when thieves and murderers reigned a year later , the killing began to subside the ebb was gradual , and at first none of us believed it but by fall the pattern was clear fewer and fewer bodies what was behind the change \? in part , american soldiers there were more of them , and they were doing more and iraqis , emboldened , had begun challenging the illiterate and often teenage militants who had been terrorizing them but there was also the fear of life in free fall , of a society with no rules , more frightening than a society with too many in the summer of 2008 , one father told me that the killing tore through like a violent storm whose worst moments had so deeply scared people that they were willing to do almost anything to keep it from happening again the effect , after it subsided , was an entire nation taking shallow breaths it felt then like a fragile turning point , a tenuous peace that could easily be interrupted the country today is at another turning point and its peace may be no less fragile this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo central baghdad , march 22 , 2003 trenches full of heavy oil were ignited by iraqis in the first days of the war to create a smoke screen to protect the city from american bombs \( photograph by tyler hicks the new york times \)
newark world lasts about as long as a fresh sheet of ice the have lost in the first round of the stanley cup playoffs the last two years last year in about the worst way imaginable and now face a team that has their number in the last 14 months , brodeur , the goaltender who has helped the devils win three stanley cups , has returned from the worst injury of his spectacular career and a benching as canada s starting goaltender in the and none of it matters every time you have a chance , you can do something great , he said tuesday the devils will open a wednesday at prudential center against the , a team that staggered into the playoffs with a backup goaltender , brian boucher but that beat the devils in five of six games during the 82game regular season brodeur had an 847 save percentage in the six games against the creasecrashing flyers , much lower than his overall 916 save percentage the flyers' pugnacious , punishing style already seems to have become an issue they can be there as long as they do n't interfere with the goaltender , devils coach jacques lemaire said tuesday if they do , i 'd have to leave that to the league and the referees two years ago , when the devils tumbled to the rangers , sean avery pestered and perhaps distracted brodeur last year , the carolina hurricanes , young and fast , did not present that kind of a problem , but they did eliminate the devils in seven games the hurricanes scored twice in the last 80 seconds of regulation , the second by eric staal with 317 seconds left , to turn a 32 deficit into a stunning , seriesclinching 43 victory to this day , brodeur thought he generally played well in the series against carolina it just kind of brings you back , he said it s all about winning who cares how good you play \? brodeur talked for a while about how the bitter loss might have benefited the team fortified by the coaching change to lemaire and the addition on feb 4 of the bigscoring forward ilya kovalchuk , the devils \( 48277 \) won at least s for the 13th straight season although lemaire has placed more importance on a fasterpaced attack , the devils were still sound on defense , allowing a leaguelow 191 goals brodeur , who won 45 games , finished with the league s fourthbest goalsagainst average , 224 jamie langenbrunner , the devils' captain , said tuesday of facing the flyers in the playoffs this is a new time i think we 're going to have a stronger focus it will make the games more interesting but they still will probably be determined by the quality of the goaltending boucher won a shootout with the rangers and goalie henrik lundqvist in the regularseason finale sunday afternoon for a playoff spot , but he has not started a playoff game in eight years but boucher and the flyers \( 41356 \) , who finished seventh in the eastern conference , would appear to have much less to lose than brodeur and the secondseeded devils , who won the atlantic division over pittsburgh , the defending stanley cup champion devils forward zach parise said of boucher you treat him like any other goalie you make it hard for him any goalie in this league can stop any puck he sees brodeur , who is to celebrate his 38th birthday on may 6 , has been doing this for a long time wednesday s game will be his 177th playoff game not only has he won 98 , but he has 23 shutouts and a career playoff goalsagainst average of 198 still , he said he felt as if this would be a new experience perhaps because he had played in only 31 games in 20089 because of an elbow injury , brodeur said he enjoyed this regular season he played in 77 games in 200910 , was not injured and did not feel too worn out it was a fun year , he said brodeur and his teammates like to think they are capable of doing well in the playoffs , or at least extending the season longer than the last two the last time brodeur was still playing hockey on his birthday was four years ago he said he would live with the flyers' creaseinvading tendencies , because he really does not have a choice the devils will be trying to help him out by attempting to slow the flyers before they have much of a chance to cross the blue line nothing new there give marty that extra second to see a shot , defenseman mike mottau said they say brodeur is still good enough to stop more shots than the other goaltender mottau said the game 7 loss to carolina felt as if it happened more than a year ago , but brodeur said they have had to learn to let it go a fresh sheet of ice awaits
new orleans early one morning in june 2006 , when this city was only half full and in many areas still desolate from the flooding after , five men were shot to death in an suv in the central city neighborhood the killings sent the city into an uproar , galvanizing politicians , who spoke of hurricane crime , and adding urgency to the city s request for hundreds of louisiana national guard soldiers to return and patrol the streets the criminal case that followed was just as incendiary in many ways , and it ended this past august with a death penalty verdict , the first in a dozen years in a new orleans murder case , against a 23yearold man named michael anderson it was a trophy verdict for the district attorney s office , a sign that law and order had triumphed in one of the city s most heinous and highprofile crimes but there is a problem new evidence from the state s key witness released in early january by the district attorney s office evidence that the office had for over two years could put a hole right in the middle of the case against mr anderson richard bourke of the , a nonprofit organization that represents mr anderson and others facing the death penalty , routinely pushes for new trials in capital cases but while these motions are standard practice , and sometimes take up a single page , this one is different , mr bourke said mr bourke cited crucial evidence that was never handed over to the defense during the trial , including a videotaped interview with prosecutors in which the state s central witness contradicts her testimony on significant points we 've done some meritorious motions for new trial cases , he said but i 've never seen a case like this nobody has on monday , the first day of the hearing for a possible new trial , prosecutors said that none of the evidence now available was significant enough to have changed the outcome of the jury trial , and said efforts to get current and former prosecutors to testify were little more than a witch hunt the orleans parish district attorney s office has had a problematic history with capital cases of the 36 people sentenced to death in the parish since 1976 , more have been exonerated than have been executed five compared with four two have been retried and acquitted , and more than half are no longer on death row after their cases were reviewed by the louisiana supreme court , according to an in the southern university law review by bidish sarma , a new orleans lawyer the prosecution of mr anderson has been a trial , in many ways , of the district attorney s office itself at the time of the murders , mr anderson had a significant arrest record , on charges of extortion , armed robbery , drug possession and attempted murder but he had only two convictions , one for a misdemeanor the inability to turn the other arrests into convictions made him , in the of the director of a local police watchdog organization , the poster boy of what was wrong and what is wrong with the local criminal justice system then , nearly a year after mr anderson was arrested , the district attorney , eddie jordan , dropped the charges , citing difficulties tracking down and believing torrie williams , 33 , the witness on whom the indictment depended and on whom a trial would depend the police department held a news conference lambasting the decision and even ms williams , who told reporters she was willing to testify a city councilwoman called for mr jordan to resign , and the mayor called on the state attorney general to investigate with political pressure intensifying , mr jordan reindicted mr anderson several weeks later lashanda webb , an assistant district attorney initially assigned to the case who left the office last year , said she did not consider ms williams to be credible no one wanted to touch it , she said are we prosecuting cases because of sufficient evidence or because that s what the public wants \? ms webb said after mr anderson s conviction , leon cannizzaro , the current district attorney , called ms williams the essence of our case , and proof that people should not be afraid to cooperate with the authorities then , at a hearing in january , an assistant district attorney disclosed that a videotaped police interview with ms williams had been found during an office move the tape was made shortly before mr anderson s second indictment , but was never turned over to his lawyers in the video , ms williams , sitting at a long table in front of prosecutors and investigators , gives an account that diverges from the one she gave on the witness stand , and which lines up with the testimony of several defense witnesses ms williams , who had come down from baton rouge with her boyfriend the day before the killings , said in both accounts that she saw the shooting of the five men firsthand but at the trial , she testified that she had left her hotel room around 3 30 am and had seen the killings by streetlight on the tape , ms williams said she stayed in her hotel room late enough to watch the 5 am news , a timeline corroborated by two defense witnesses , including her boyfriend at the time when she saw the shooting , she said on the tape , there was just enough daylight to see without any streetlights given that the murders took place around 4 am , this would have been impossible prosecutors at monday s hearing argued that the trial jury knew of other occasions on which ms williams had contradicted herself , but that they had nevertheless found her believable enough to convict mr anderson
africa is everywhere , so pervasive in our lives that we barely see it since it is in all likelihood the continent where human evolution began , it is literally in the bloodstream of everyone dna aside , huge portions of everyday life and cultural achievement are unthinkable without africa what would modern art be like if matisse had never gone to morocco or if he , picasso and the german expressionists had never set eyes on the sculptural innovations of subsaharan africa \? very hard to say and popular music \? around the world , it incorporates sounds and rhythms that originated in africa more locally , jazz not abstract expressionism was the first american art form of international stature the global africa project at the tries to survey this pervasiveness , in terms of contemporary visual endeavors of all kinds jewelry , fashion , architecture , basketry , ceramics , painting , utilitarian design this sprawling cornucopia has been wrested into existence by lowery stokes sims , former director of the studio museum in harlem and , since 2007 , international curator at the museum of arts design and leslie kinghammond , former dean of graduate studies at the maryland institute college of art and , since 2006 , founding director of the institute s center for race and culture this show presents 200 works by nearly 120 people , teams and collectives it represents artists , designers , artisans , diy improvisers and people engaged in various combinations of those already fuzzy job descriptions , toiling in ways that blur aesthetics , sociology and philosophy astoundingly ambitious for a relatively small institution , global africa aims , in the words of its news release , to explore the impact of african visual culture on contemporary art , craft and design around the world unsurprisingly , the exhibition does not fully meet that tall order it suffers from an excess of highend luxury items and a shortage of genuine qualityoflifechanging design solutions and unfortunately , it almost completely ignores africa north of the sahara it is also plagued by too much ersatz stuff in all categories but ultimately this show s strengths surpass its weaknesses , or maybe merge with them if it lacks coherence , that is because there is none to be revealed while there are individual references to distinctly african traditions and formal vocabularies , no single look or style emerges , and that s the point the show s massing of information and accomplishment is often incredibly moving as you make your way through the crowded displays , you can almost hear the seams of the building creak under the strain though that sound may sometimes be simply your brain , boggled by the inundation of insights and attitudes , or even the fresh juxtaposition of familiar entities i loved seeing the work of joyce scott , the baltimore bead sculptor extraordinaire , in the same vitrine as the beaded and sequined voudon flags , or drapos , of the haitian artist george valris likewise , the nearby grouping of j d okhai ojeikere s photographs of the ostentatiously sculptural headdresses and hairdos of african women , with the majestic hats of evetta perry , owner of harlem s heaven hat boutique , and the softer , nonetheless crownlike , crocheted hats of the artist xenobia bailey most but not all of the participants are of african descent one exception is the italian photographer daniele tamagni , who is represented by photographs of proudly stylish congolese dandies mostly men known as the society for the advancement of people of elegance his images are among the exhibition s several photographic high points along with the irreverent , cultural polyglot selfportraits of the nigerianborn ik ud , and the reallife style mixings captured in nontsikelelo veleko s street photographs of imaginatively dressed south africans and most but not all of the participants work in the united states , europe , the caribbean or africa the exceptions are ramijabi madarsahib and kairumbi karimsahib , members of the siddi women s quilting cooperative in karnataka , india , descended from east africans who started coming to india as early as the seventh century as sailors , slaves , servants and merchants each woman is represented by a small , bright , gemlike quilt made from discarded saris the loose geometric patterns are a result of a process of allover stitching \( back and front \) that is different from traditional american piecework call them art , crafts or textiles , these quilts are among the most extraordinary aesthetic objects to be seen in any new york museum right now if everything else here measured up to them , this show would be great beyond belief despite its ups and downs , the exhibition delivers overreaching insights with inarguable immediacy one of these is that categorical neatness is an exaggerated curatorial value all museums should periodically assemble shows that ignore the distinctions among contemporary art , design and craft the resulting friction between nonfunctional and functional , spiritual and practical , handmade and machinemade , and professional and selftaught is music to the eyes what s more , it is closer to the way visual culture really happens other insights relate more directly to life foremost is the doityourself ethic nothing happens if you do nothing taking action is a way to take responsibility , but also a way to inspire others to act and often something can be made out of almost nothing equally important is the role of wellmade and or beautiful things , functional and not , as lifesustaining nourishment the visual vitality of objects foments human vitality one example argues both points tyree guyton s heidelberg project , documented here in photographs and a video it began one day in the late 1980s when mr guyton , with help from his family , began to clean out an abandoned house on their drugdealerinfested block in detroit mr guyton arranged the gathered debris in colorful assemblages and reliefs in vacant lots and went on to clean out and decorate other houses and lots in the neighborhood heartwarming , yes , and it also began a process that helped rid the neighborhood of drugs another pertinent concept at large in the show is recycling trash and , related , the repurposing of existing materials this occurs in the cosmopolitan dresses made from several patterned fabrics by the nigerianborn fashion designer duro olowu , who lives in london a sturdy cabinet made from recycled metal oil drums by the senegalese furniture designer ousmane m'baye and a marvelously evocative columnar sculpture , tchintchin , bp ! , that romuald hazoum , born in benin , fashioned from plastic oil canisters inspired by the bp oil spill this year , it transcends the artist s description of it as a kind of ironic champagne flute to merge suggestions of human , tree and anthill recycling is also apparent in the industrial design team of birsel seck s low , curving stools , made in dakar from one of the country s most plentiful byproducts discarded plastic bottles and bags wahala temi s afrikea chair made from ikea stools puts a conceptual spin on it there are seemingly stark contrasts of intention and effect among the more opulent inclusions are the handsome hammered silver vessels of ndidi ekubia , a britishborn daughter of african immigrants , and the bmw handpainted with geometric patterns by the south african muralist esther mahlangu \( surely the best result of the company s selfserving artcar campaign \) among the least opulent displays is a book set in a plexiglas sleeve on the wall the boy who harnessed the wind creating currents of electricity and hope tells the inspiring story of william kamkwamba of the landlocked republic of malawi forced to forgo school as a teenager to help his family survive , mr kamkwamba scavenged materials to build a windmill that took electricity and clean water to his village for the first time but again and again , simplistic oppositions do n't hold up it helps to see each item on display as a marker for a larger story , like mr kamkwamba s book , to be extracted from labels or the show s catalog the glassbead necklaces of nomoda ebenezer djaba , also known as mr cedi , have an attractive luminosity the label reveals that they are made of recycled bottles , a process , the catalog elaborates , that has helped mr cedi make his craft , handed down through several generations , more viable this exhibition is full of such local success stories , in which craft traditions , recycling and human ingenuity coalesce , and lives are changed and even saved the global africa project has a brilliant , conceptcompressing name the glowing alloy of its first two words global africa invokes a large continent and its worldwide influence , while project paradoxically signals openendedness work in progress , loose ends , an interim report rather than a finished exhibition it is the kind of show that had to be done , that deserves to be done better and that may take a few attempts to get right the museum of arts design should consider making it a recurring , truly continuing project , like the whitney museum s biennial or the new museum s triennial every four or five years , take a transmedium look at africa and its global legacy they will never become less important
george balanchine s cort ge hongrois is not one of the master s greatest ballets , whereas his liebeslieder walzer is yet as s winter season ended sunday , i found myself forgetting the one performance i did see of this season s only liebeslieder cast but pining to have seen one particular cast change in cort ge the ballerina for the cort ge i missed was sara mearns , who has suddenly become the company s most remarkable dancer i'm inclined to think she is now also new york s finest ballerina , even america s , though she is in some ways \( including maquillage \) immature as titania in a midsummer night s dream , as the lilac fairy in the sleeping beauty , as odetteodile in swan lake , as the second ballerina to appear in balanchine s emeralds and finally in the central role of diamonds , the luster of her dancing of her very presence outshone everyone else onstage her only peer is jared angle his quietly attentive partnering grows ever more eloquent , his firmness of line and phrasing more assured his very hands , both as partner and soloist , are poetically compelling for other dancers too , notably the ballerinas ashley bouder and tiler peck , this was a good winter season i was often happy watching the way robert fairchild , for example , and chase finlay kept plucking the moment and making it a chance to grow still , some achievements are disproportionate nothing in the sleeping beauty this season was as powerful as just the way ms mearns mimed her gestures plunged straight from the heart into the wide open air the season featured two world premieres peter martins s na ve and sentimental music \( which was first seen at the company s november gala but joined the repertory only in january \) and alexei miroshnichenko s lady with the little dog a teenager who s never been to a ballet nor read chekhov s short story could tell you some of what s wrong with mr miroshnichenko s work by contrast , it s hard for experienced connoisseurs to say what s wrong with na ve and sentimental music , which features a score by john adams and has the commendable goal of showcasing almost all the principals of the company \( including ms bouder , ms mearns , ms peck , mr angle and mr fairchild \) and yet i hope nobody is foolish enough to think the lady with the little dog was the worse of these two new pieces at the end of it i knew new and good aspects of its two leads , sterling hyltin and andrew veyette , whereas naive and sentimental music left me none the wiser about anybody its innumerable principals took to the stage in twos , threes and larger groups as one group followed another in dour , dreary and doomladen tides , it was like watching the goths , visigoths , ostrogoths , huns and lombards who poured over europe to create the last dark age and like watching the death of hope mr martins means well , and for what feels like several centuries he earnestly paves the stage of the david h koch theater with his good intentions among those is his son , nilas , who has been a principal of the company for 17 years and who made his only appearances of the season in this ballet these eight weeks featured five fulllength ballets \( counting the plotless jewels \) and five mixed bills i skipped one of each of the ballets i saw , liebeslieder despite its men was another blank , and the same cast danced all its performances this brings us to a more depressing side of mr martins s work as ballet master in chief too many balanchine ballets have grown gray and small under his supervision robbins ballets too why does the company keep reviving fancy free while american ballet theater also keeps doing it but with men who are so much more vivid \? city ballet is heading into a real crisis of male dancing i keep hoping that gonzalo garcia , who joined from san francisco ballet in 2007 , will find his form his dancing is not without beauty , but tension keeps blotting his solos and his partnering the company is too full of underachievement above all , its dancing too seldom turns its music into movement that matters in space on operahouse scale at saturday afternoon s jewels it was good to see jenifer ringer \( in emeralds \) doing attitude turns as if borne by the wave of the musical phrase , but she ca n't maintain that kind of concentration throughout a whole dance , and it was good to see ms hyltin \( in rubies \) having impish fun , though with too flippant an emphasis then ms mearns appeared in diamonds , arching her wonderful back to catch individual moments within musical phrases , bringing to each section of the role a bold and different hue , eating up space with easy courage and finally flinging herself into the finale to lead the company with gleeful love of dance itself rightly , she won an ovation the pluses and minuses of city ballet add up differently at every performance
as long as the beatles and apple have coexisted , fans of both have wondered when are these crazy kids finally going to get together \? it has finally happened , but it was n't easy the two sides have been fighting off and on since 1978 when the beatles accused apple computer of infringing on the trademark of their business concern , apple corps they settled that one the beatles licensed the apple name to the computer company fought again over apple s music synthesizer , settled again , fought again over itunes' apple logo and settled that one too and now , 32 years later , the two are ready to do business , with apple selling beatles singles and albums on itunes this fighting and making up could almost be the plot of a romantic comedy , but it s not as a business matter , the beatlesitunes deal provides a case study for the art of negotiation how did the two sides get it right \? and where did they go wrong \? dealbook spoke with robert h mnookin of the harvard law school , where he is director of the negotiation research project , chairman of the steering committee of harvard s program on negotiation and the author of the recent book , bargaining with the devil when to negotiate , when to fight from that conversation , we drew some useful lessons that the beatlesitunes negotiations imply for closing a deal 1money \( that s what i want \) make sure you come to the table only when you have something to gain professor mnookin noted that he often tells his students , before you go into any negotiation , any party should ask , what are my interests , what do i care about , and what are my alternatives if i do n't make this deal \? it is not immediately obvious that the beatlesitunes agreement had to happen now apple owns 90 percent of the online music market , but its exclusion of the beatles was something of an embarrassment it was , however , an embarrassment the company had already borne lightly for years on the other side , the beatles are one of the very few bands that has managed to ignore much of the online music revolution and draw huge profits from cd sales but recent wall street history suggests that a third player the emi group may have been the one with the most to gain in a deal emi is in dire financial straits and trying to fend off citigroup , to whom it owes a considerable amount money in a long , bitter court battle , speculation has reigned that citigroup may well take over emi and sell it to warner music if emi s financial profile does not improve considerably emi executives have ruled out a breakup or selling the record company s rich catalog assets enter the beatles , whose ability to mint money with their music is unquestioned after all , when michael jackson died last year , his 50 percent stake in sony atv music publishing which owned rights to some of the beatles' songs was worth enough to help offset a good portion of his 500 million in debt whether emi opened the talks this time or apple did , it was a case of good timing when both sides could capitalize on a rich asset in a way that was not absolutely necessary before a corollary to this lesson is that potential business partners should carve out a lot of time when a negotiation has more than one party with apple , emi and the beatles' apple corps as only three of the entities at the table , this deal was bound to be timeconsuming i suspect part of the reluctance for the beatles was the complexity with which its music rights were sliced and diced in various ways , professor mnookin said 2 hello , goodbye and hello again persistence pays apple was repeatedly sued by the beatles and paid millions of dollars to settle those suits the computer company never let that discourage it from pursuing its goal of rounding out the itunes catalog with beatles songs , however consider that apple was forced to license its own name from the beatles' apple corps , which got there first by 2007 , however , it was the beatles' apple corps that was licensing its name from apple staying objective about the benefits of a deal and not getting emotional about what happened in the past enabled the various sides to keep the door open for profitable deals later on 3ca n't buy me love relationships change in the words of the hiphop band outkast also carried on itunes nothing is forever so , to adapt the rest of the lyric , what makes deals the exception \? nothing markets change , as do people and financial interests in 2007 , the beatles hired jeff jones as the chief executive of apple corps , replacing neil aspinall , who stepped down for health reasons mr aspinall had been a childhood friend of paul mccartney and george harrison and was focused on protecting the beatles' legacy from all comers mr jones , an american executive with sony bmg who had experience in repackaging old albums , had none of those sentimental ties that inaugurated a new era for dealmaking for the company and likely opened the door to the deal with itunes besides that , apple and the beatles have lots of other business interests and they are not directly competitive with each other giving them less reason to hold grudges
qandil , iraq the land of the medea is a nickname given to a group of villages located here in the qandil mountains in the semiautonomous kurdish region of northern iraq where the rebels of the kurdistan workers party , known as the pkk , are active the name comes from the ancient kingdom of the medes it is a place without a government , yet also without disorder it is , perhaps , in many ways , an ideal example of what philosophical anarchists wish to see in a larger community the rebels , who are the sole maintainers of security , hold a marxist view of the state it is a tool of the bourgeoisie to suppress the working class thus , they have organized villagers to manage their own affairs through a local elected body called a sharewani each village has its own sharewani , independent of the others the pkk , which has been designated a terrorist organization by turkey and the west , has been in a deadly conflict with turkey since 1984 , demanding an independent region for kurds since then , more than 40 , 000 people , mainly kurds , have been killed turkey has long pressed the kurdish regional government in northern iraq to blockade the rebels and stop visitors from bringing them supplies to maintain their war against turkey the rebels first moved here to qandil in 1999 , after their leader , abdullah ocalan , was expelled from syria more than 150 families are thought to live in the mountains , which are about 11 , 500 feet high and straddle the iranian border some 60 miles from the turkish frontier recently , the pkk declared its seventh unilateral ceasefire , to coincide with the muslim holy month of ramadan that drew a rare visit from journalists bouzan tekin , one of the rebel leaders , said the ceasefire followed a message from the stillimprisoned mr ocalan and calls from prominent politicians such as the the kurdish leader of northern iraq , massoud barzani this is our own decision made under no pressure , mr tekin said but of course we have taken calls of many public figures into consideration his excellency barzani is one of them as we arrived in qandil , ahmed deniz , a spokesman for the rebels , took us to a village populated by iraqi kurds this village and a handful of others are not under the practical control of the iraqi government or the kurdish regional government their security is maintained by the rebels the one we visited looked normal fighters and families were living together children were playing hideandseek on the illpaved streets a few kilometers away , we saw smoke rising from the intermittent bombing by turkish planes turkey has not recognized any of the pkk ceasefires , saying that it does not negotiate with terrorists in this village you see a life different from elsewhere in iraq the fighters are both men and women , but they are prohibited from having sex or getting married we cannot marry until we make our wish come true , said azima , a 33yearold syrian woman who joined the movement when she dropped out of high school 15 years ago in 1984 , the dream was to create a kurdish state within turkey but now the pkk has compromised , seeking more political and cultural rights for ethnic kurds even that is uncertain my generation may never see it , azima said wistfully i admire ocalan s views on women , she said he says that justice will never be achieved if women remain subordinated here you can see a number of crosscultural contradictions in the house of one villager in which we had lunch , a picture of mr ocalan hung next to a portrait of iraq s president , jalal talabani however , the television was set to a turkish channel broadcasting the news of the end of the term of the chief of the turkish general staff , ilker basbug , who assumed office in 2008 and had launched a number of deadly assaults on the pkk
for a glimpse of how venomous and debased the discourse about islam has become , consider a in the new republic this month written by martin peretz , the magazine s editor in chief , it asserted frankly , muslim life is cheap , most notably to muslims mr peretz added i wonder whether i need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the first amendment , which i have in my gut the sense that they will abuse thus a prominent american commentator , in a magazine long associated with tolerance , ponders whether muslims should be afforded constitutional freedoms is it possible to imagine the same kind of casual slur tossed off about blacks or jews \? how do america s nearly seven million american muslims feel when their faith is denounced as barbaric \? this is one of those times that test our values , a bit like the shameful interning of japaneseamericans during world war ii , or the disgraceful refusal to accept jewish refugees from nazi europe it would have been natural for this test to have come right after 9 11 , but it was forestalled because president george w bush pushed back at his conservative ranks and repeatedly warned americans not to confuse al qaeda with islam now that mr bush is no longer in the white house , nativists are back on the warpath some opponents of president obama are circulating baldfaced lies about him that are also scurrilous attacks on islam itself one email bouncing around falsely accuses mr obama of lying and adds , his muslim faith says it s okay to lie or there s the email i received the other day from a relative , declaring president obama has directed the united states postal service to remember and honor the eid muslim holiday season with a new commemorative 44 cent first class holiday postage stamp in fact , it was that first issued the eid stamp in 2001 and that issued new versions after that astonishingly , a finds that 52 percent of republicans believe that it is definitely true or probably true that barack obama sympathizes with the goals of islamic fundamentalists who want to impose islamic law around the world so a majority of republicans think that our president wants to impose islamic law worldwide that kind of extremism undermines our democracy , risks violence and empowers jihadis a taliban operative , zabihullah , about opposition to the mosque near ground zero by preventing this mosque from being built , america is doing us a big favor it s providing us with more recruits , donations and popular support mr zabihullah added , the more mosques you stop , the more jihadis we will get in america , bigoted comments about islam often seem to come from people who have never visited a mosque and know few if any muslims in their ignorance , they mirror the antisemitism that i hear in muslim countries from people who have never met a jew one american university professor wrote to me that every muslim in the world believes that the proposed manhattan islamic center would symbolize triumph over america that reminded me of pakistanis who used to tell me that every jew knew of 9 11 in advance , so that none died in the world trade center it is perfectly reasonable for critics to point to the shortcomings of islam or any other religion there should be more outrage , for example , about the mistreatment of women in many islamic countries , or the like christians and ahmadis in pakistan europe is alarmed that muslim immigrants have not assimilated well , resulting in tolerance of intolerance , and pockets of wifebeating , forced marriage , homophobia and female genital mutilation those are , but sweeping denunciations of any religious group constitute dangerous bigotry if this is a testing time , then some have passed with flying colors hats off to a rabbinical student in massachusetts , rachel barenblat , to replace prayer rugs that a drunken intruder had urinated on at a mosque she told me that she quickly raised more than 1 , 100 from jews and christians alike above all , bravo to those christian , jewish and muslim leaders who what they called the antimuslim frenzy we know what it is like when people have attacked us physically , have attacked us verbally , and others have remained silent , said rabbi david saperstein it cannot happen here in america in 2010 cardinal theodore mccarrick put it this way this is not america america was not built on hate shame on you , the rev richard cizik , a leading evangelical christian , said to those castigating islam you bring dishonor to the name of jesus christ you directly disobey his commandment to love your neighbor amen
lately , financial news has been dominated by reports from greece and other nations on the european periphery and rightly so but i 've been troubled by reporting that focuses almost exclusively on european debts and deficits , conveying the impression that it s all about government profligacy and feeding into the narrative of our own deficit hawks , who want to slash spending even in the face of mass unemployment , and hold greece up as an object lesson of what will happen if we do n't for the truth is that lack of fiscal discipline is n't the whole , or even the main , source of europe s troubles not even in greece , whose government was indeed irresponsible \( and hid its irresponsibility with creative accounting \) no , the real story behind the euromess lies not in the profligacy of politicians but in the arrogance of elites specifically , the policy elites who pushed europe into adopting a single currency well before the continent was ready for such an experiment consider the case of spain , which on the eve of the crisis appeared to be a model fiscal citizen its debts were low 43 percent of gdp in 2007 , compared with 66 percent in germany it was running budget surpluses and it had exemplary bank regulation but with its warm weather and beaches , spain was also the florida of europe and like florida , it experienced a huge housing boom the financing for this boom came largely from outside the country there were giant inflows of capital from the rest of europe , germany in particular the result was rapid growth combined with significant inflation between 2000 and 2008 , the prices of goods and services produced in spain rose by 35 percent , compared with a rise of only 10 percent in germany thanks to rising costs , spanish exports became increasingly uncompetitive , but job growth stayed strong thanks to the housing boom then the bubble burst spanish unemployment soared , and the budget went into deep deficit but the flood of red ink which was caused partly by the way the slump depressed revenues and partly by emergency spending to limit the slump s human costs was a result , not a cause , of spain s problems and there s not much that spain s government can do to make things better the nation s core economic problem is that costs and prices have gotten out of line with those in the rest of europe if spain still had its old currency , the peseta , it could remedy that problem quickly through devaluation by , say , reducing the value of a peseta by 20 percent against other european currencies but spain no longer has its own money , which means that it can regain competitiveness only through a slow , grinding process of deflation now , if spain were an american state rather than a european country , things would n't be so bad for one thing , costs and prices would n't have gotten so far out of line florida , which among other things was freely able to attract workers from other states and keep labor costs down , never experienced anything like spain s relative inflation for another , spain would be receiving a lot of automatic support in the crisis florida s housing boom has gone bust , but washington keeps sending the social security and medicare checks but spain is n't an american state , and as a result it s in deep trouble greece , of course , is in even deeper trouble , because the greeks , unlike the spaniards , actually were fiscally irresponsible greece , however , has a small economy , whose troubles matter mainly because they 're spilling over to much bigger economies , like spain s so the inflexibility of the euro , not deficit spending , lies at the heart of the crisis none of this should come as a big surprise long before the euro came into being , economists warned that europe was n't ready for a single currency but these warnings were ignored , and the crisis came now what \? a breakup of the euro is very nearly unthinkable , as a sheer matter of practicality as berkeley s barry eichengreen puts it , an attempt to reintroduce a national currency would trigger the mother of all financial crises so the only way out is forward to make the euro work , europe needs to move much further toward political union , so that european nations start to function more like american states but that s not going to happen anytime soon what we 'll probably see over the next few years is a painful process of muddling through bailouts accompanied by demands for savage austerity , all against a background of very high unemployment , perpetuated by the grinding deflation i already mentioned it s an ugly picture but it s important to understand the nature of europe s fatal flaw yes , some governments were irresponsible but the fundamental problem was hubris , the arrogant belief that europe could make a single currency work despite strong reasons to believe that it was n't ready
to the editor re \( editorial , march 4 \) too many americans know the costs of the current health care system , both financial and in terms of personal stress having been left to insurance companies and the other private participants in the system , costs continue to rise unreasonably those in need of medical care must often fight with their insurers regarding care , and too many more must negotiate the system without any insurance at all these costs are far too high for a necessity of modern life the democrats are in control of the government , and the expectation of those who elected them is that they use the art of compromise to pass the best health care bill they can this is not a time for ideology to control decision making apparently , no republican intends to try to resolve the national health care problem therefore , it necessarily falls to the democrats to fulfill the duty of their offices and get the job done bruce neuman sag harbor , ny , march 4 , 2010  to the editor your editorial is an excellent summary of the current democratic challenge growing up poor , we were often reminded that half a loaf is better than none the senate bill is much more than half a health care loaf the republicans continue to show contempt for any reasonable compromise on health care it is up to the democrats , who have historically claimed and occasionally showed themselves to be the party of the people , to support and vote for health care reform it will not be a perfect bill but it will be far less imperfect than those who would obstruct it theodore s voelker copake , ny , march 4 , 2010  to the editor you write that republican opposition seems to be as much a matter of politics as principle its only principle appears to be naked selfinterest the party that opposed social security , civil rights and medicare has no business claiming to speak for the american people , citing speciously worded polls or being johnnycomelately defenders of the elderly during the clinton administration , republicans refused to cooperate on health care because they knew it would reinforce the image of democrats as saviors of the middle class today , the gop unhesitatingly resorts to similar tactics , dividing and confusing the electorate through fearmongering and distortion here s one idea that wo n't fall from the lips of any republican , the only idea that represents true reform medicare for all bryan l tucker boston , march 4 , 2010  to the editor paul starr s noble attempt to bridge the health reform divide seems to miss the mark \( , oped , march 4 \) his fiveyear optout provision might appeal to some conservatives , but the objections of most republicans to mandatory health insurance seem motivated more by politics than by libertarian ideology they would probably vote down a health reform bill even if it included an optout provision it s distressing that americans find a health insurance mandate so alien after all , we are required by law to buy car insurance to protect against losses due to accidents and damage caused by others in the same way , a health insurance mandate would pool risk and cover health care costs incurred by others that are now reflected in everhigher insurance premiums how the mandate is structured \( that is , penalties imposed for noncompliance \) is the real question we must address allowing people to opt out , even temporarily , and hoping that they learn from the error of their ways seems like wishful thinking alan b cohen boston , march 4 , 2010  to the editor i enjoyed reading paul starr s clever solution to the congressional roadblock surrounding a universal mandate for americans to buy health insurance the idea is unworkable , however , unless doctors and hospitals are absolutely committed to turning away severely ill patients who are uninsured and unable to pay i am skeptical that we are flinty enough , and uncaring enough , to allow patients to die on the doorsteps of our hospitals rather , i suspect that we will treat them gratis , as we always have given this , people will exploit mr starr s proposed mechanism to avoid buying insurance so long as the nation insists on acting in a humane and caring manner \( and would we really want it otherwise \? \) , we will need to require people to buy insurance as a way of having everyone pay his or her fair share of the total cost jonathan engel new york , march 4 , 2010
armed with a death sentence and the best meth in new mexico , walter white , the protagonist in amc s breaking bad , has become one of the most celebrated characters on television since the series debuted in 2008 bryan cranston has won two best actor emmys for his portrayal of the high school chemistry teacher who began cooking methamphetamine after receiving a terminal cancer diagnosis mike hale , a television critic for the new york times , compared the character to other antiheroes like tony soprano and noted that none has been quite as guiltwracked , or as creative in his rationalizations , as mr cranston s walter white prior to breaking bad , mr cranston was probably best known as the daffy dad on the fox sitcom malcolm in the middle for the amc drama , his brief was a little different vince gilligan series creator told me right from the beginning that he wanted to do something that never been done on television , mr cranston said he wanted to take mr chips and turn him into scarface breaking bad , which also stars aaron paul as jesse pinkman , walter s sidekick , returns for its third season on sunday below , mr cranston discusses the evolution of his character , breaks down a scene from the premiere and offers tips on the best way to fashion an impotent mustache so did you construct walter white out of whole cloth or were there some models you used \? walter really has become an amalgam of imagination and some real people that i know he felt older than his years he was depressed so i started doing some research on that and i concluded that there are two basic types of depression manifestations one is to go outward , and to blame everyone else for your downfall , your lack of opportunity or whatever the case may be and then there s walter white he imploded , he just went invisible and started going to seed that was very interesting to me someone who became invisible to society and to himself so that informed what kind of makeup , hairstyle and clothing colors we eventually chose , because i wanted him to literally blend into the scenery how did you flesh out the character \? i created a back story in which his depression evolved from missed opportunities that he was either too afraid to take or just did not recognize more likely too afraid to take that informed the rest of his adult life it just kind of wears you down , your shoulders slump over , your appearance is blah i remember going into the makeup trailer and i said i want this mustache to look impotent so we were able to create that you thin it way out , you lighten the color and you make sure that no hair comes down past the corners of the mouth so then the show takes this beaten man and thrusts him into a narcotics underworld , which both terrifies and , to a certain extent , invigorates him for the first time in his life he can intimidate another person he s never had that he s got money in his pocket for the first time he s got adrenaline pumping through his veins sometimes feeling fear is better than feeling numbness that s his new outlook now he has this ability to become a new person there is black comedy in breaking bad but it s never played for laughs is the strategy just to always play it straight , or what \? yes in malcolm in the middle my character s core emotion was fear so hal was able to create a lot of comedy because fear set him up nicely to be a foil this is different i look for opportunities to have something humorous , a little bit of levity because i think all the best dramas do have some element of that but walter certainly has no clue that there s anything funny about any of this business so we re not in on the joke how does the character evolve this season \? the first season was all about the decision what he s done , what that means and how it affects his new life and his family the second season explored the ramifications of that decision and its consequences the third season is really the adjustment season it s walter and jesse starting to adjust to new lives , accepting who they are and going on with it for as long as it will last mr cranston discusses a scene from the premiere , which he also directed
until its clock ran out in may , the fox thriller 24 told the realtime , minutebyminute story of one person from a shadowy government agency doing whatever it takes to keep the nation safe from evildoers and sinister global conspiracies and that person was chloe o brian , the dour , drywitted computer expert played by mary lynn rajskub , who each week provided invaluable support to jack bauer , the counterterrorism unit \( ctu \) field agent played by kiefer sutherland \( your perspective on the series and its heroes and sidekicks may vary , of course \) if the somewhat abrupt decision that the eighth season of 24 would be its last did not allow you to grieve properly for the series , 20th century fox home entertainment is giving you another chance on tuesday , it is releasing 24 the complete series , a whopping 57disc dvd package containing all eight of jack bauer s daylong adventures , the madefortelevision movie 24 redemption , and much more to mark the occasion , artsbeat spoke recently to ms rajskub , the comedian and actress \( punchdrunk love , mr show with bob and david \) who spent six unlikely years on one of television s grittiest dramas these are excerpts from that conversation so they re finally putting out the entire show in one convenient package what else have we got in there \? are they putting a knife in the package \? a gun \? see , humor ! i just threw out seasons 1 and 2 because you weren t in them oh my god you really know what to say to a lady i don t even know why they included them did you find it surprising that you were even considered for 24 given that you came from a comedy background \? yeah , i was really surprised i tried not to go on the audition , because i had just had a bad csi audition , and i never got sent out on dramas a lot of my comedy is like chloe it s things you take way too seriously and they end up being funny i was like , i don t want to do this today i don t want to get in my car and drive it s hot i m just going to pass on this one and my agent said , i really think you want to go my mom is actually pretty savvy about tv , and she said , it s the best show , you have to go so we basically have your mom to thank for your being on 24 i can also credit paul thomas anderson , because joel surnow ended up seeing me in punchdrunk love and was like , i want to write a part for you and i thought , i m glad i came this is such a huge compliment , but i didn t think it would ever happen then he wrote the part , and it just kept growing and growing you were only booked for a handful of episodes at first \? they signed me on for four , and i had fox executives giving me backhanded compliments , like , we didn t know you could do drama thanks \? i think it got interesting , because i went from being this character who people were like , you re weird , you re annoying , to , oh , but you re really loyal , and you re helping jack we like you now it wasn t until i got hired for six episodes of a comedy sketch show that shot in london i went to london for nine weeks and when i came back they offered me a contract on 24 was that a coincidence or because you finally had some bargaining clout \? oh , i ve never had leverage to use against them please now that it s all said and done , did you have a favorite chloe moment \? my favorites have always gone along with what the fans are i really loved this last season , getting to become the head of ctu , and grow up a little bit for as much as there are things that were somewhat repetitive i m going to be directing jack down a hallway , directing him to dismantle stuff , i m going to be sitting in front of a computer there was always new stuff yes , i was ready to move on , but i never got tired of that character up until the end it was like , oh , cool , now we get to see her confronting jack and having this level of responsibility that aspect could have continued by the same token , were there moments over the course of the series where even you had to admit to yourself , this is totally preposterous \? oh , there were tons of those there were a lot of eyerolls , honestly there were some times where i would come to work and be like , i m going to say that \? and then once you get into the world of it , sometimes things would surprise me the only thing that s fresh in my memory is season 8 i love katee sackhoff , i loved her character , i love her acting but i was like ok , really \? she s a double agent , now she s a triple agent no one detected that before \? i thought she did an amazing job , as an actor , dealing with that it s a puzzle they re putting together , and sometimes certain pieces of the puzzle maybe the dog chewed on them a little bit there was a question mark hanging over season 8 for a long time , as to whether it would be the last year of the show when the decision was made , do you feel you were given sufficient warning to make your peace with it \? yes and no we all kind of knew , we all felt it coming we felt it the year before it happened and the only thing that i can complain about is they waited and waited and waited to let the crew and everybody know it was just that feeling of , ok , come on , just tell us because it was really down to the wire on the other hand , from the little that i heard on the business side of it , i think it was something they were grappling with down to the wire it s a strange thing in some ways , you re like , why couldn t they make this work \? this show could go on forever but then , on the other hand , it s like , we ve had our time and why push it further \? let s make the ending work the best that it can kiefer sutherland always struck me as an enigmatic guy do you feel like you got to see a side of him that the home audience never did \? oh , kiefer totally has a warm side , and i don t even properly know how to use the word enigmatic , although i like the way it sounds i think it was a very safe environment but at the same time , for me , i was on edge working with kiefer because he definitely would be in a certain mind frame to be jack bauer i learned from him what a person can do in that position the pacing on the show you would say things faster than you thought , and i learned that from him you could see him going , let s not waste time with this stuff let s get to where it s at he was making it as exciting as possible , making the stakes as high as they could be , and riding that line between ridiculous and believable he s a serious guy , but he has a sense of humor i realize that this aspect of it is ridiculous , and this other aspect i m going to play with my heart and soul similarly , joel surnow seems like someone who comes across much differently in person than would lead you to believe he s a funny guy , because he s outspoken about his politics but he s so creative , he s so sharp he cares and he s driven the combination of a guy like him and a guy like kiefer , i know they didn t see eyetoeye all the time , but it was a great combination of making it work , and ultimately everybody caring about what it was that s the enigmatic thing was it a surreal experience for you when the show got invited to the heritage foundation and you got to meet people like clarence thomas and michael chertoff \? i didn t think about it when i was asked i was like , yeah , of course and then i got there and was like , whaaat \? where \? who am i \? i m an actor and then when i got home , i was like , oh , that was kind of weird there s something very cool about not thinking about the politics of it i know saying that sounds a little bit na ve , maybe , but i m not going to say , no , i m not going because of my politics i wish everybody could have that opportunity , to spend an evening , a lunch , with people in these positions but the little i was around them , you re not going to be debating issues , but that is what they live , think and breathe anyway and none of them to me were overthetop republican in a gross way it was cool to be around people of that stature does it feel strange that you re now probably better known to the public as chloe from 24 than as a comedy performer \? oh , for sure i just did a guest spot on modern family , and steve levitan , he s like , can you believe you were on this show for six years \? i was like , i know ! he knew me before , when i was all about comedy , and i just assumed i would end up on a sitcom he s like , can you believe that happened \? no , i can t
boca raton , fla nhl general managers moved closer tuesday to recommending measures to penalize certain shoulder checks to the head , league officials said we are moving toward a set of rules or a specific rule to curb blindside shoulder checks to the head , said darcy regier of the buffalo sabres , one of eight general managers who since november have been studying hits to the head the eight general managers , who include brian burke of toronto , ken holland of detroit , paul holmgren of philadelphia , lou lamoriello of new jersey , joe nieuwendyk of dallas , jim rutherford of carolina and doug wilson of san jose , will present their findings to all 30 general managers wednesday clearly the blind side and unsuspecting player is what we 're talking about , said nieuwendyk , who added that suspensions were also likely to be used to curtail shoulder checks to the head , which results in several concussions each year colin campbell , the nhl vice president for discipline , added , we 're going in a direction where we change the definition of what s allowed the game is faster now , but unfortunately , one of the side effects of that is we have bigger train crashes , said campbell , who referred to recent hits that were not penalized that resulted in david booth of florida and marc savard of boston being carried off the ice with concussions the managers in their heart of hearts feel something s wrong here , but it s not against the rules that s what we 're trying to attack ray shero , the pittsburgh general manager , said he was one of several who thought that one aspect of the current charging rule , taking three steps before hitting a player , ought to be revised with greater player safety in mind any rule change proposed by the general managers needs approval by the competition committee , which includes players , and the league s board of governors the group studying hits to the head was one of four that met on tuesday to discuss proposals , most of which were dismissed as untenable among the notions dismissed were proposals for a playin tournament to determine the eighth playoff seed in each conference the installation of an nflstyle coach s challenge changing overtime to four minutes of fouronfour play followed by three minutes of threeonthree play and allowing the captains at the nhl allstar game to choose sides also dismissed was a proposal floated by columbus to eliminate the socalled loser point for a defeat in overtime or by shootout instead , teams winning in regulation or overtime would get 2 points and the loser none , but teams winning a shootout would get one and a half points while the loser got a halfpoint the columbus proposal suggests continuing dissatisfaction with the nhl s current system among fans and some executives , in which a game can be worth 2 points or 3 , depending on whether it extends past regulation in the past , the nhl has dismissed proposals to go to the straight 3210 system used internationally and at the olympics however , islanders general manager garth snow said there was support to make total victories , excluding shootout wins , the first tie breaker in the standings currently the first tie breaker is all victories , including shootout wins
they looked deflated the faith in their quarterback seemed to be wavering their coach was on the verge of becoming the butt of jokes around the nfl but the jets were never defeated , and they displayed their resolve against the rival new england patriots in a 2814 win over the patriots on sunday , the jets put a seasonopening loss to the baltimore ravens behind them , and with it , perhaps some of the questions that followed them as a result their quarterback , mark sanchez , had a career afternoon , throwing three touchdown passes their coach , rex ryan , has told anyone who will listen that his team would win the super bowl , and on sunday , it looked like it had the pieces to do it after looking stiff in the opener , sanchez played with confidence and worked into a nice rhythm , leading the offense with 220 yards passing , completing 21 of 30 attempts ladainian tomlinson also provided a spark with 76 yards rushing on 11 carries meanwhile , new england quarterback tom brady met a ballhawking jets secondary that played well without the star cornerback darrelle revis who reinjured his sore hamstring after being beat by randy moss on a onehanded , 34yard touchdown reception in the second half after his early departure brady was intercepted twice and his fumble after being sacked by jason taylor at the jets 16yard line with five minutes to play effectively ended the game the jets looked like a different team than the one that lost to baltimore in their first game at new meadowlands stadium last sunday they looked like the kind of team ryan had been describing all offseason namath likes what he sees on his twitter page , he wrote , now we re talkin ! ! jets ! jets ! jets ! jets ! ! ! like sanchez , cromartie has done well to distance himself from a poor week 1 performance following the jets touchdown that put them up by 14 points , cromartie made a great play to bat away a pass intended for moss cromartie has taken a heightened role with revis out of the game with a hamstring injury simms noted that cromartie , who played for the san diego chargers from 20069 , seems to be getting more comfortable in a new system regardless of the final outcome of this game , the conversation about sanchez from week 1 to week 2 will have a remarkably different tone sanchez threw his third touchdown pass of the afternoon a 1yard pass to dustin keller on thirdandgoal to put the jets ahead by 2814 the patriots have allowed the jets to score 21 consecutive points sanchez has thrown for 220 yards , and he took chances on the drive that highlighted a new level of comfort , or at least a commitment to a different approach from the stuff tack against the ravens last sunday the jets defense steps up the jets received the ball back \( after a review , initiated by rex ryan \) on an interception by brodney pool moss tipped the ball on a pass from brady cromartie was covering him and wrapped him up when the ball floated in the air poole swooped in and plucked the ball there were obvious questions about how the jets secondary would perform without revis , especially after how poor it looked last sunday but it has been remarkable how different the defensive backfield looks in this one , though revis is out , mangold is off the field , but the jets have taken a 2114 lead with 38 seconds remaining in the third quarter sanchez capped the drive with a 2yard touchdown pass to jerricho cotchery the jets then went for 2 and edwards made a leaping grab over darius butler , who was simply a few inches too short to defend the leaping edwards after the catch , edwards taunted butler the second time he s taunted a defender but wasn t flagged although sanchez finished the drive , it was tomlinson that motored it tomlinson has been running with real heart earlier in the game , simms noted that tomlinson seemed to be running harder in new york than he did in san diego , saying that tomlinson has been fighting for the extra yards , never taking a play off at one point , nantz said , there s some life in those legs nick mangold just headed to the locker room with a shoulder injury his return is questionable the bad news keeps coming for the jets revis is out for the rest of the game with the hamstring injury that s not good news for the jets the jets made it a 1413 game with a field goal by folk although the jets couldn t punch it it , they put together a nice drive in particular , tomlinson was impressive his 11yard run up the middle particularly stood out his extra effort and hard running after the first hit were the marks of a man running with a purpose as for sanchez , simms praised his presence and rhythm in running the offense it is there , simms said of sanchez s talent just give him a chance of course after my last entry wondering about the jets secondary , cromartie intercepted brady on a deep attempt to moss down the sideline it was cromartie s second interception of the season his interception , and subsequent 66yard return , against the ravens last sunday was overshadowed by four penalties the pass was unbradylike he had all day to make the throw , but he plopped the pass into cromartie s hands , not moss s nantz just said that revis s return was questionable because of a hamstring injury brady will have a chance to expose the jets secondary , which was a weakness \( aside from revis \) against the ravens last sunday drew coleman , a fifthyear cornerback , is playing in revis s place sanchez is hurting after being sacked for a third time this time by gerard warren sanchez writhed on the ground and then got up slowly the pocket collapsed around sanchez , and warren swallowed him up from his blind side , driving him into the ground the hit was legal sanchez looked pained in the subsequent plays of the possession , which ended with a punt for the jets how will this affect him going forward \? after a half , the jets have seen improvements \( the offense \) and reasons for concern \( revis \) sanchez threw for 121 yards , completing 12 of 16 passes , and he seemed to get a little looser in the pocket , able to think on his feet and make plays a nice effort , over all meanwhile , brady is being brady he completed 13 of 20 passes for 179 yards and two touchdowns , none prettier than the 34yard touchdown pass to moss , who has two receptions for 38 yards the bradymoss connection was among the nicest touchdown throws you will see it also was particularly notable in this game , for the reasons addressed earlier regarding revis the big question for the jets is what revis s availability will be the second half nantz and simms , at the start of the second half , reported that revis had not been spotted on the field nick folk drilled a 49yard field goal to cut the patriots lead to 1410 at halftime that certainly sends the jets into the locker room on a positive note , but you have to wonder if revis is truly healthy he appeared to grab at his hamstring after moss s touchdown catch as noted earlier , the jets training staff evaluated him after the play , and he headed to the locker room early also , it s worth noting that he likely sustained a bruise to his pride on the touchdown , though it s unclear if that played any role in his early exit from the field so how about this revismoss storyline , eh \? moss just added a highlight to his career reel with a onehanded , 34yard touchdown reception to put the patriots up , 147 it was his 150th career touchdown , according to the broadcaster jim nantz not bad for a slouch the play was catalyzed by the quickthinking brady , who snapped the ball before the jets defense was set as moss sped past revis off the line , leonhard dropped down in coverage , leaving revis alone that is a benefit of having a shutdown corner like revis but almost from the snap , moss knew he was going to be wide open he raised his hand immediately to call for brady , who found him the touchdown came in a series that also featured a great play by revis to break up a little underneath route to moss after the touchdown , cameras showed revis being evaluated and stretched by a trainer on the sideline he headed to the locker room early the jets pulled even , 77 , with a 10yard touchdown reception by edwards , from sanchez the pass was thrown firmly , not lofted , into the corner of the left end zone edwards made a leaping grab , then was flagged for taunting \( a 15yard penalty assessed on the kickoff \) sanchez went 7 for 7 for 64 yards on the 12play drive there were a few plays that stood out sanchez s nifty flip to ladainian tomlinson for a 10yard gain , tomlinson s shoetop catch for a 5yard gain on a little flair route it was just what the jets needed though edwards s penalty put an ugly bow on it this is what joe namath wrote on his twitter account been so long since edwards scored he forgot how to behave properly in what is being hailed as breaking news on twitter , the jets have converted on third down for the record it was a pass to braylon edwards from sanchez it was only the jets second thirddown conversion of the season the jets have an offense \? i can confirm this because i just saw sanchez and company take the field with the way the patriots have owned the time of possession , though , it might have been easy to forget that was the case let s see what the jets can do here they would do well to put together a nice possession , to at least get their feet under them otherwise it could be a very long afternoon yes , welker must be fine he just caught a 6yard touchdown pass from brady to put the jets ahead by 70 with 13 17 remaining before halftime cromartie gave welker a generous cushion , which allowed the patriots to play pitch and catch brady made an onthemoney throw and welker ran a crisp , quick out route , allowing him to duck into the end zone just inside of the pylon it was a simple , effective play call , and the patriots ran it with surgical precision as the times judy battista noted on twitter eric smith of the jets should get his wallet out because he s going to get fined for that hit to the head on wes welker , who was checked out and appears to be ok the patriots are just chewing the clock , owning the time of possession in the first quarter the patriots have controlled the ball for 13 minutes 27 seconds , the jets for 1 minutes 2 seconds the patriots have run 23 plays , the jets 3 the patriots made eight first downs , the jets none the teams were tied at 00 after the first quarter cbs showed revis warming up in the pregame you ll remember his hamstring injury caused some worry about his readiness he appeared to move cautiously in the drills , not wanting to test that hamstring too much the cameras spotted a patch on the lower portion of revis s hamstring , apparently where the injury is the lower the injury , the better for guys who run fast , the broadcaster phil simms said in the patriots second series , which followed the media timeout , we got another glimpse at the revismoss battle moss leveraged to inside , but throw off from brady was off revis allowed moss to slip him because he safety help in middle of field who said the jets were not taking chances with sanchez \? on the jets first offensive play of the game , sanchez attempted a deep strike to dustin keller the throw was high , skimming off of keller s fingertips and falling into the hands patrick chung of the patriots , nearly for an interception \( the review , prompted by jets coach rex ryan , ruled that it was not an interception \) all week , the conversation around the jets has largely included questions about whether they were being too conservative in limiting sanchez it appeared that sanchez could throw to a shorter route , then he went over the top to keller you wonder if the background noise affected his thinking , if he wanted to come out and make a statement the possession ended in a jets punt , however well , the jets got lucky to cap their first series , patriots kicker stephen gostkowski missed a 37yard field goal just a shade left brady made a very athletic play to dodge the blindside blitz from wilson , completing a pass to wes welker that was just short of first down , which precipitated the field goal attempt patriots quarterback tom brady just unleashed a bomb to randy moss , which provided the first highlight in the matchup between revis and moss brady looked to his underneath receivers on his first two pass attempts , but on this one , moss cut through the field on a post pattern , breaking away from revis with his speed revis received helped over the top from safety jim leonhard but when brady s pass connected , moss a step out of bounds out of the end zone a very close call for the jets pregame happy sunday , everybody it is another big afternoon in east rutherford , nj there are storylines aplenty surrounding the jets and the new england patriots , and that has provided a rich undercurrent for this meeting what s more , the baltimore ravens quieted the jets , who talked all offseason , in week 1 for the jets , falling to 02 to start the year will not be an easy hole to climb out of for a team supposedly on its way to the super bowl among the interesting things to watch will be the matchup between darrelle revis and randy moss revis called moss a slouch last year moss said he spent the offseason trying to figure out a way to get off revis island the tangential effect of this matchup will also be worth noting last sunday , ravens quarterback joe flacco did not throw in revis s direction , which burdened the jets other defensive backs , especially the rookie kyle wilson and antonio cromartie both struggled , the weaknesses in an otherwise strong defense meanwhile , the biggest issue facing the jets now and perhaps in the coming years is the progress of quarterback mark sanchez the jets did not take many chances with deep throws against the ravens , and sanchez looked rigid sanchez did not want to take turn the ball over , and as a result , he appeared creatively handcuffed , completed only 476 percent of his passes and was sacked twice the last time the sanchez faced the patriots , at new england in november , he threw four interceptions the jets need sanchez to improve , but as the times s greg bishop asked in a story about sanchez this week , have the jets expected too much from sanchez too soon \?
of all the pictures i saw from the iraqi elections last weekend , was on an iraqi expatriate mother , voting in michigan , holding up her son to let him stuff her ballot into the box i loved that picture being able to freely cast a ballot for the candidate of your choice is still unusual for iraqis and for that entire region that mother seemed to be saying when i was a child , i never got to vote i want to live in a world where my child will always be able to god bless her this was a very good day for iraq to say that mere voting or an election or two makes iraq a success story would obviously be mistaken an election does not a democracy make and iraq s politicians still have yet to prove that they are up to governing , nationbuilding and both establishing and abiding by the rule of law but this election is a big deal because iraqis with the help of the un , the us military and the obama team , particularly vice president joe biden overcame two huge obstacles they overcame an array of sectarian disputes that repeatedly threatened to derail this election and they came out to vote shiites , sunnis and kurds despite the bombs set off by al qaeda and the deadend baathists who desperately want to keep the democracy project in iraq from succeeding this latter point is particularly crucial the only way al qaeda , baathism and violent islamism will truly be defeated is when arabs and muslims themselves not us show they are willing to fight and die for a more democratic , tolerant and progressive future al qaeda desperately wanted the us project in iraq to fail , but the iraqi people just keep on keeping it alive and how about you , president mahmoud ahmadinejad of iran \? how are you feeling today \? yes , i am sure you have your proxies in iraq but i am also sure you know what some of your people are quietly saying how come we iranianpersianshiites who always viewed ourselves as superior to iraqiarabshiites can only vote for a handful of prechewed , predigested , approved' candidates from the supreme leader , while those lowly iraqi shiites , who have been hanging around with america for seven years , get to vote for whomever they want \? unlike in tehran , iraqis actually count the votes this will subtly fuel the discontent in iran yes , the us s toppling of saddam hussein helped iran expand its influence into the arab world saddam s iraq was a temporary ironfisted bulwark against iranian expansion but if iraq has any sort of decent outcome and becomes a real shiitemajority , multiethnic democracy right next door to the phony iranian version it will be a source of permanent pressure on the iranian regime it will be a constant reminder that islamic democracy the rigged system the iranians set up is nonsense real islamic democracy is just like any other democracy , except with muslims voting former president george w bush s gut instinct that this region craved and needed democracy was always right it should have and could have been pursued with much better planning and execution this war has been extraordinarily painful and costly but democracy was never going to have a virgin birth in a place like iraq , which has never known any such thing some argue that nothing that happens in iraq will ever justify the costs historians will sort that out personally , at this stage , i only care about one thing that the outcome in iraq be positive enough and forwardlooking enough that those who have actually paid the price in lost loved ones or injured bodies , in broken homes or broken lives , be they iraqis or americans or brits see iraq evolve into something that will enable them to say that whatever the cost , it has given freedom and decent government to people who had none that , though , will depend on iraqis and their leaders it was hopeful to see the strong voter turnout 62 percent and the fact that some of the largest percentage of voting occurred in regions , like kirkuk and nineveh provinces , that are hotly disputed it means people are ready to use politics to resolve disputes , not just arms we can only hope so president obama has handled his iraq inheritance deftly , but he is committed to the withdrawal timetable as such , our influence there will be less decisive every day we need iraqi leaders to prove to their people that they are not just venal elites out to seize the spoils of power more than to seize this incredible opportunity to remake iraq we need to see real institutionbuilders emerge , including builders of a viable justice system and economy and we need to be wary that too big an army and too much oil can warp any regime iraq will be said to have a decent outcome not just if that young boy whose mother let him cast her ballot gets to vote one day himself it will be a decent outcome only if his life chances improve because he lives in a country with basic security , basic services , real jobs and decent governance i wish i could say that that was inevitable it is not but it is no longer unattainable , and i for one will keep rooting for it to happen
bruins forward milan lucic waited at the faceoff circle , his back to the goal , for the deflected puck to land when it hit the ice , lucic tapped it with his stick to settle it and then , in one motion , turned and shot lucic s turnaround slap shot broke a thirdperiod tie with 2 minutes 57 seconds left , and host boston beat the philadelphia flyers , 32 , on monday to take a 20 lead in their bestofseven eastern conference semifinal series i was trying to block the defense out and wheel and shoot , said lucic , who had not scored in the playoffs and had only one goal since march 25 luckily , it found a hole tuukka rask made 24 saves , and miroslav satan and johnny boychuk also scored for boston the no 6 seed in the east , the bruins inherited homeice advantage when the conference s top three teams were eliminated in the first round they protected it heading into game 3 on wednesday night in philadelphia brian boucher stopped 24 shots for the flyers , who rallied from 10 and 21 deficits but have yet to hold a lead in the series boston won game 1 on marc savard s overtime goal it s almost like backtoback overtime losses , they scored so late , said flyers forward danny briere , who scored a goal and assisted on one by mike richards the good thing , the positive , is we know we can play we know we 're right there it could be a bounce going one way or the other that can change the outcome the scored was tied , 11 , after one period and at 22 after two it stayed that way until lucic got the puck between the circles and slapped his shot past boucher lucic missed a month early in the season with a broken finger and another month in the second half with a high ankle sprain , injuries that limited him to career lows of 50 games and 20 points when he returned , he was a steady presence in the bruins' lineup but not on the score sheet he had only one goal in the last 10 games of the regular season and none in the first seven games of the playoffs he obviously had a tough season , with everything he s gone through with the ankle and everything like that , savard said he s battling , and that s a huge goal it helps his confidence and he is only going to get better because of that the game started in chippy fashion , and both coaches were warned 18 seconds in when a scrum developed and the players pushed after the whistle daniel carcillo complained during the canadian television broadcast that savard bit his finger during a secondperiod skirmish last time i have been bit was in grade school , carcillo said it is not a good feeling it is pretty cowardly guys do n't bite men do n't bite savard pointed the finger back at carcillo he pummeled on my face , savard said he pulled on my teeth , so i guess that s biting when a guy tries and pull your front teeth out kris versteeg scored the goahead goal from the left circle with 1 30 left and host chicago evened its western conference semifinal series at 11 game 3 is wednesday night at vancouver in a furious final rush , versteeg lost the puck near the goal it went out to duncan keith , who slid a pass to versteeg for a shot that beat goalie roberto luongo patrick kane added an emptynet goal with 477 seconds left vancouver scored twice in the first 5 02 of the game , but chicago tied the score early in the third on patrick sharp s shorthanded goal

my doctor s call came early last month just as i was noting that 41 percent of americans come down with cancer that statistic felt as remote as a puff of cloud in the stratosphere until my physician , gary raizes , gently began to break the news to me that i had a tumor in my right kidney the result was a grim monthlong whirlwind of doctors' visits , medical tests and furrowed brows the doctors agreed that the odds were 10 percent that my tumor was benign , 90 percent that it was malignant i had no option surgery was essential my builtin optimism was shaken when i read that fiveyear survival rates for kidney cancer are less than 50 percent ten days ago , i had a threehour operation i lost 10 percent of my right kidney , along with a tumor a bit more than an inch long afterward , i felt as if i 'd been hit by a truck , and i gained a sixinch scar that won grudging admiration from my hardtoimpress teenage kids and , boy , did i feel lucky ! the main reason that kidney cancers are so deadly is that they are typically discovered late my tumor was discovered early only by accident , through a ct scan ordered for another reason entirely i confess that i had been committing thought crimes against the physician who ordered the scan , mark fialk , wondering if it was an example of outofcontrol testing and now i felt that dr fialk might have saved my life but i also felt lucky in another way this is trite but also so , so true a brush with mortality turns out to be the best way to appreciate how blue the sky is , how sensuous grass feels underfoot , how melodious kids' voices are even teenagers' voices a friend and colleague , david e sanger , who conquered cancer a decade ago , says , no matter how bad a day you 're having , you say to yourself i 've had worse' , a friend in the times s business section , is now undergoing radiation treatment for cancer after surgery on his face and neck he wrote on his blog it is not fun , but it has been inspiring in a way , i am happier about my life than at any time i can remember i do n't mean to wax lyrical about the joys of tumors but maybe the most elusive possession is contentment with what we have there s no better way to attain that than a glimpse of our mortality my surgeon , douglas scherr , said that his patients frequently derive additional satisfaction from life after a cancer diagnosis , and at least for a time are more focused on what feels more important like families in contrast , none of us want this for an epitaph he sweated many weekends at the office , ignoring his family but earning a huge bonus as regular readers know , i 've written frequently about suspected links between chemicals and health in my own case , i ca n't help wondering if there might not be a connection as well i grew up on a sheep and cherry farm in oregon , and as a kid i helped mix the pesticides in the sprayer dogs on the farm have often died from cancer , and some have had unusual kidney cysts and deformities could the orchard pesticides perhaps have some impact on kidneys \? nobody knows after four days in the hospital , i spent a week recovering at home from the surgery as i was finishing up this column , the pathologist s report on my tumor finally came back dr scherr told me that my tumor turned out to be an oncocytoma , which is benign astonishingly , against all odds and expectations , i had n't had cancer after all my wife tells me she no longer feels sorry for me , and i'm beaming so today i have an impressive scar , a bit less kidney , a big bellyache , and far more appreciation for the glory of life my hope is that when you put this column down , you 'll think about what you can do to reduce the risk of getting an ominous doctor s call like mine last month stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke slather on sunscreen and avoid tanning salons avoid charred meats check yourself over for lumps , changes or irregularities , whether in breasts or testicles or skin , and consult a doctor if you have doubts try to microwave food in glass or ceramic containers rather than plastic toss out plastic food containers that are marked 3 , 6 or 7 at the bottom \( unless they say bpafree \) buy a radon detector to check radon levels around your house and , believe me , it s never too early cancer or no cancer to start appreciating our wondrous world , instead of disparaging its imperfections
beijing a security guard apparently angered by a courtimposed divorce settlement shot and killed three people and wounded three others at a courthouse in hunan province before turning the weapon on himself , the state media reported the rampage , a rare instance of gun violence in , follows five seemingly unrelated knife and hammer attacks at schools that left 17 people dead and have deeply unnerved chinese society private gun ownership is illegal in china according to , the official chinese news agency , the assailant , zhu jun , 46 , was the head of security at a local postal savings bank branch and had access to a small arsenal xinhua said that mr zhu had told coworkers he was taking three weapons , including a shotgun , for a requisite inspection but instead headed to the lingling people s district courthouse in yongzhou , in hunan province there , he burst into a fourthfloor office and opened fire , spraying bullets at anyone coming his way , xinhua reported among those killed were the chief judge , a deputy judge and a court clerk , none of whom were connected to mr zhu s divorce case , the local police told xinhua news accounts suggested that mr zhu , who lived with his parents and a son , was angry over the way a judge had divided assets during a settlement three years ago calls to the local information office in yongzhou went unanswered on tuesday afternoon in two other instances of random violence that captured the public s attention on tuesday , a woman on an overnight train in northeastern china slashed and stabbed fellow passengers with a piece of metal , wounding nine people as they slept and in henan province , a man seeking to halt the demolition of homes in his village drove a truck into a group of workers , killing 3 and injuring 13 others the school attacks but also left officials on edge as they tried to maintain the chinese communist party s goal of social stability although most of the assailants in the school attacks were thought to have been mentally ill , the events have raised questions about societal injustice and the lack of pressure valves in a tightly regimented society on monday , the authorities executed a man blamed for an assault in late april that wounded 29 kindergartners and 3 teachers in eastern jiangsu province information about the courthouse killings was quickly curtailed by propaganda officials with the central government , who ordered the country s major news portals to remove articles about the rampage from their front pages the order follows similar directives after the school attacks at the time , officials said they were worried about copycat attacks before they were removed , many of the comments posted beneath news of the courthouse attacks expressed sympathy for the assailant , revealing the disdain many citizens feel toward china s judicial system if you give justice back to the people , this kind of tragedy would n't happen , one reader wrote there are more and more people at the grass roots who have nowhere to turn to clear their names another was even more blunt when you push someone into a corner , anything can happen
my thursday column argues that the crucial element of health care reform is its effort to increase access to the uninsured of course , i think it s also crucial to hold down costs that helps assure access in the long run and i think that the obama plan will help curb costs in the long run i would have loved to see tort reform part of the package , but even the legislation s promotion of research into which medical interventions work will over time presumably lead to some cost savings i wrote the column partly because i think we tend to be more dazzled than we should be by new medical technologies one reason people often say that we have the best health care in the world is that american hospitals have far and away the best medical technology in the world it s true that some technological advances have been revolutionary antibiotics , blood transfusions , anesthesia , vaccinations , and so on but by and large , i think , we exaggerate the impact of clinical breakthroughs and fail to appreciate the importance of public health measures and of access to the medical system the three most important advances in health care in my lifetime were what \? plausibly , they were the cigarette tax , seat belts and airbags , and the ban on lead in gasoline and paint each had a major impact on american mortality and morbidity , and yet they don t get the attention that heart transplants do getting more people access to the health care system what happened in the 1940 s comes into the same category , as the kind of intervention that isn t sexy but has a huge impact on the quality of life and the health statistics when i was reporting in and around louisiana after hurricane katrina , i was struck by the complexity of health care delivery it s not just about insurance , but also about getting people who don t have vehicles to doctors offices or helping a single mother with a fulltime job figure out how she can take a sick child to a doctor when her boss won t let her off none of that is easy , and it ll require some rethinking about health care delivery but it has to be on the agenda as well on the issue of abortion that i mention , there s little doubt that the key to reducing abortion isn t law but is provision of universal health care here s wha t the guttmacher institute , the gold standard of research on reproductive health , has to say legal restrictions on abortion do not affect its incidence for example , the abortion rate is 29 in africa , where abortion is illegal in many circumstances in most countries , and it is 28 in europe , where abortion is generally permitted on broad grounds the lowest rates in the world are in western and northern europe , where abortion is accessible with few restrictions one reason i feel so strongly about health care is that if this opportunity is missed , we may be stuck with this dysfunctional system for another couple of decades \( it has been 17 years since the last effort \) and if at least 25 , 000 people die per year for lack of insurance \( it may be twice that \) , that s a greater toll than america suffered in world war ii so join me in praying that health care reform passes update some folks , including this blog , have wondered about my data sources i did link from the column but i should have used my blog to explain a bit more i used life expectancy data from the national vital statistics report on the cdc site they are broken down by year , race and gender their numbers unequivocally show the 1940 s the best decade for increase of life expectancy there are other data sources , including decennial estimates also on the cdc site the figures prior to 1928 are less reliable , but the numbers i relied on seem the best of the bunch and allow you to look at the trends quite clearly and they show , for example , that from 1910 to 1920 , the rise in overall life expectancy was only 41 years \( and that s generous , because 1910 was a notch below the trend line \)
santa fe , nm for years , billy and angela flores pleaded with their son nicolas to wear a helmet while hurtling down the slopes on his snowboard and each time , nicolas shrugged off his parents' urgings with the typical aplomb of a freespirited teenager he kept saying he could n't fly with the helmet on , angela flores recalled that it was n't cool to wear one but on dec 6 , nicolas , 17 , was riding down an icy run at the in northern new mexico when his board caught an edge , sending him careening down a closedoff portion of the mountain and headlong into a tree nicolas sustained bruising of the brain and a collapsed lung he was in a coma for five days his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet underscores the increasing concern over the risks posed to recreational skiers and snowboarders from head injuries it also highlights one of the bigger shifts in ski and snowboarding culture over the past halfdecade once used exclusively by professional and competitive amateur skiers or snowboarders , helmets have become far more common across the united states and are now widely considered to be a critical piece of equipment , even for novices it is very obvious that helmet use has gone up , and that s a good thing because we 're going to see less brain injuries , said , a denver neurosurgeon who studies head injuries among skiers and snowboarders to the casual observer on the slopes , it looks like almost everyone is wearing one helmet use has increased rapidly over the past few years , in large part because of the attention brought by a rash of highprofile accidents involving celebrities michael kennedy , sonny bono and were all killed in ski accidents , and none of them were wearing helmets these days , the says , nearly half of all skiers and snowboarders in the united states wear helmets , up from 25 percent in the 20023 ski season helmets are selling at a record pace this season , according to , a trade association and helmets , once viewed as clunky and awkward looking , are starting to be seen as hip helmet styles and fitting options have come a long way in the last five seasons , particularly for children , said troy hawks , a spokesman for the ski areas association , which recommends that all skiers and snowboarders wear them you can look more like a professional athlete interestingly , experts say two groups have resisted the trend oldtime skiers who refuse to change longtime habits and infrequent skiers who travel to resorts from out of state although no state has passed legislation mandating helmet use , some resorts are starting to take a more regulatory approach this year , for the first time , , which includes five major ski areas in colorado , california and nevada , began requiring all of its employees , including instructors and lift attendants , to wear helmets while skiing and snowboarding on the job more and more of our guests were actually asking why our employees were n't required to wear them , said john garnsey , copresident of the resort s mountain division we felt it was the right thing to do garnsey said vail handed out 6 , 400 helmets to employees this season it also requires children 12 and younger to wear helmets if they are participating in ski and snowboard schools , another major mountain resort group , has had a similar requirement since 2002 after a series of deaths , including an incident in which a 5yearold florida girl died after skiing into a tree during a private lesson levy , the denver neurosurgeon , said that wearing a helmet could reduce the chance of sustaining a brain injury by 50 to 80 percent \( although other experts believe the number is lower \) richardson , for example , died last year of a brain hemorrhage after what initially appeared to be a minor fall on a beginner s slope at mont tremblant in canada levy said he believed she would be alive had she been wearing a helmet it is one of the most preventable types of injuries when you 're wearing a helmet , he said still , levy warned that wearing a helmet could give skiers and snowboarders the dangerous impression that they could take more risks while increased helmet use has caused a marked reduction in head injuries , particularly minor ones , helmet use has not made any difference in fatal accidents , said , a professor emeritus at the rochester institute of technology , who has studied head injuries among skiers for 30 years more than 90 percent of deaths on the slopes involve a person striking a fixed object at a high speed , with head injuries being the most common cause of death , shealy said but when a skier is flying down a mountain at 27 miles an hour or more the average maximum speed adult skiers and snowboarders travel down a blue run a helmet will not matter , his research shows at that speed , if you suffer a direct impact with a fixed object , then death is a likely outcome , he said under those circumstances , it is likely that you will need more than a helmet to make a difference deaths on the slopes are still relatively rare , and the number fluctuates each year for no readily apparent reason , according to data from the ski areas association last season 39 people were killed , down from 53 in 2007 but up from 22 in the 2006 season of the 39 deaths last year , 20 of the skiers and snowboarders were wearing helmets the public needs to know this , and not get oversold on a helmet , said shealy , who is not entirely convinced a helmet would have made a difference in richardson s death , particularly if there were other complicating factors at play though emphasizing that he had not been granted access to richardson s death certificate , shealy said that an unhelmeted head actually has more time and distance to decelerate when the snow is soft as was the case in ms richardson s fall and the fall is slow , because it will penetrate further into the snow than a helmeted head it is not a panacea , it is an effective means of reducing some head injuries , but it has significant limitations , he said while emphasizing that he still believed skiers should wear them there are also the yet unknown effects of repeated concussions while skiing and snowboarding , even with a helmet this winter the , in partnership with , began a study to take on that question lindsay harris , an orthopedic surgeon , and zach stutzman , a sports trainer , have rigged the helmets of more than 300 young skiers and snowboarders with wireless equipment to measure the number and force of any head injuries sustained on the slopes the researchers also hope to measure the severity of those head injuries against ones sustained in other sports , like football , which has recently come under scrutiny because of the damaging longterm effects head injuries have had on nfl players each year , the kids are watching the x games , harris said the bar gets raised a little higher the jumps get a little bigger it s scary big air on some of these things in new mexico , nicolas flores s parents expect him to be released from a santa fe hospital this week they say he has a lengthy recovery ahead of him knowing their son , they imagine he will want to get back on a snowboard this whole thing has been a nightmare , his father said he is going to wear a helmet next time , or he wo n't go

when the victorians were feeling gloomy about their prospects they used to compare themselves to the ancient romans they read gibbon , plutarch and tacitus and looked for parallels a society burdened by empire , corrupted by wealth , deficient in manly virtue lately we have been doing much the same , only instead of consulting the latin texts we turn to screen epics like gladiator , the hbo series rome , and the 2007 zack snyder film 300 , which , strictly speaking , was about spartans , not romans , but let s not be fussy the cable channel starz , as part of an effort to expand its slate of original programming , is extending this classical tradition with spartacus blood and sand , a 13part series that starts friday , and has already taken the unusual step of commissioning a second season before the first one even runs overtaxed , militarily overextended and with an increasing gap between the haves and the havenots , the romans , we learn , were a lot like us , but for entertainment purposes they had some signal advantages they were more violent , they wore skimpier clothes and they had orgies spartacus blood and sand , a retelling of the history of the famous slave and his rebellion , does not neglect any of these traits it features abundant nudity , both male and female \( in the early days we had a lot of conversations about how many penises we could show in a single episode , rob tapert , one of the producers , recalled recently \) there is a great deal of simulated sex , of both the gay and straight variety and the subtitle is not false advertising the characters do not merely bleed they spray great fountains and gouts , arterial geysers , that splash up on the inside of your tv screen or else hang in midair like red rorschach blots mr tapert and his coproducer , \( better known as the director of the spiderman films \) , got their start with the evil dead horrormovie franchise , and the new show at times suggests their early experiments with highpressure circulatory systems the apple does n't fall far from the tree , mr tapert admitted much of the violence in spartacus is stylized , even balletic many of the people working on the show were big fans of 300 , and , especially in the early episodes , spartacus frequently borrows from that movie s graphicnovel look , its gray and coppery color scheme and slomo action sequences the show s creators were also fans of rome , and they say they learned two important lessons from that series one was not to spend a fortune on building sets \( spartacus relies instead on greenscreen technology and cgi \) and the other was that their story line needed , like that of rome to be character driven the early episodes include a number of welldrawn personalities , many of them plucked \( or embellished \) right from plutarch , our main source for what little we know about spartacus , a man , the text says , not only of high spirit and valiant , but in understanding and in gentleness superior to his condition \( plutarch does not mention abs or lats , which andy whitfield , an australian actor who plays the character , has in abundance , but they probably go without saying \) in some ways the series is more historically faithful than either the 1960 stanley kubrick picture or its source , howard fast s 1951 novel , which was in part an allegory denouncing mccarthyism the series gives spartacus a back story , which the kubrick version does not , and gets a lot of mileage from plutarch s brief account of the ludus , or gladiator gym , where spartacus was imprisoned run by a financially strapped promoter named batiatus , the place resembles an outpost of vince mcmahon s world wrestling empire , and is a reminder of yet another way we resemble the ancient romans our appetite for violent spectacle and reality entertainment according to everyone involved , selling starz on a 13hour series set in antiquity was not a gladiatorial struggle bill hamm , the executive vice president in charge of original production and development , explained that the channel had already been looking for an rrated action show something that did n't yet exist on premium cable to join its other original programming like crash looking at the spartacus story , you find that the real history was more tawdry and sexy than you ever knew , he said , and i thought we might as well enhance that mr tapert recalled that he , mr raimi and the third member of their team , joshua donen , had been talking to nbc about an action series , and when those discussions did n't go anywhere , were invited to meet with starz josh is highbrow is the wrong word , mr tapert said but he s very literate sam is quite populist , and i'm more lowbrow as for who first thought of ancient rome , he said , laughing , i wish i could give sam credit , but none is due , and added that he had been thinking about a rome project for years but it was mr donen , everyone agrees , who first uttered the word spartacus , and that , together with the notion that the project be modeled on the style and technology of 300 was enough for starz to greenlight it in an email message stephen shelanski , the executive vice president in charge of programming , said success in the premiumcable business increasingly depends on distinctive original programming , as hbo and showtime have demonstrated we see a value in having a balance of compelling original series to complement our strong movie lineup , he wrote the head writer of the show is steven s deknight , who also worked on smallville and buffy the vampire slayer he was finishing up some episodes of the scifi series dollhouse when starz called him , and he said he signed on partly because of mr raimi s involvement i'm a huge fan , going back to evil dead , ' he said i remember trying to break up with my girlfriend at the drivein when that movie was playing , and i kept looking back at the screen he also had a lot of affection for the original spartacus do you remember when movies had overtures at the beginning \? he asked i kept thinking i ca n't believe they 're thinking of remaking a kubrick film' mr deknight went on to say that he had included a homage to the famous i'm spartacus ! moment , when all the movie slaves claim to be the kirk douglas character , and had tried not to overlook the film s epic feeling it was a great time for men especially a period when men were men , he said , referring to the spartacus era and the end of the roman republic and definitely there s that voyeuristic element everyone loves a good potboiler , and we do n't shy away from any of it as long as it comes from the character and the story starz almost never censored him , he added , and even encouraged him to include an explicit orgy in episode 6 , though the higherups drew the line at a scene involving a ladle they also objected to having spartacus rip out the throat of a gladiatorial opponent with his teeth they said that was ok for another one of the gladiators , he said they just did n't want the hero doing it about the show s explicitness , he said we wanted to push the envelope we 're fine with graphic sexuality , graphic violence as long as it comes from a place in the story and i think the violence has an operatic element we wanted to make it beautiful in a way and within reason , he said , he also wants the show to be accurate he even hired a couple of phd candidates in classics to pelt him with memos and email messages about details like whether or not capua had a governor and the winedrinking habits of

the latest silicon valley squabble sounds like an unusually esoteric episode of gossip girl this one involves a couple of mobile internetbased phone services last week fring , which sells software that allows people to talk and chat over mobile phones on the web , announced a fancy new feature to its service the ability to videochat using the iphone 4 over a 3g mobile phone data connection currently , the iphone requires a wifi connection to use its builtin facetime video chat feature skype , which runs a service for making calls over the internet , was none too pleased fring said in a company blog post that skype had decided to block fring members from using its chat service fring gets a little nasty in its blog post , calling skype cowards , and saying that skype once championed the cause of openness and is now trying to muzzle competition , even at the expense of its own users skype quickly fired back in a company blog saying that fring s accusations are untrue robert miller , skype s vice president and general counsel , wrote that fring was using skype software in a way it was n't designed to be used and that it was damaging the skype brand and its reputation some of the anger might be the result of an earlier blog post by fring that said its latest video feature caused a huge jump in traffic on its service it said it would temporarily reduce support to 3rdparty skype , implying skype provided poor service who is right and who is wrong may , at this point , almost seem irrelevant the vitriol thrown back and forth suggests the companies probably wo n't be working together in the near future this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
when historians look back at 200810 , what will puzzle them most , i believe , is the strange triumph of failed ideas freemarket fundamentalists have been wrong about everything yet they now dominate the political scene more thoroughly than ever how did that happen \? how , after runaway banks brought the economy to its knees , did we end up with ron paul , who says i do n't think we need regulators , about to take over a key house panel overseeing the fed \? how , after the experiences of the clinton and bush administrations the first raised taxes and presided over spectacular job growth the second cut taxes and presided over anemic growth even before the crisis did we end up with bipartisan agreement on even more tax cuts \? the answer from the right is that the economic failures of the obama administration show that biggovernment policies do n't work but the response should be , what biggovernment policies \? for the fact is that the obama stimulus which itself was almost 40 percent tax cuts was far too cautious to turn the economy around and that s not 2020 hindsight many economists , myself included , warned from the beginning that the plan was grossly inadequate put it this way a policy under which government employment actually fell , under which government spending on goods and services grew more slowly than during the bush years , hardly constitutes a test of keynesian economics now , maybe it was n't possible for president obama to get more in the face of congressional skepticism about government but even if that s true , it only demonstrates the continuing hold of a failed doctrine over our politics it s also worth pointing out that everything the right said about obamanomics would fail was wrong for two years we 've been warned that government borrowing would send interest rates skyhigh in fact , rates have fluctuated with optimism or pessimism about recovery , but stayed consistently low by historical standards for two years we 've been warned that inflation , even hyperinflation , was just around the corner instead , disinflation has continued , with core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy prices now at a halfcentury low the freemarket fundamentalists have been as wrong about events abroad as they have about events in america and suffered equally few consequences ireland , george osborne in 2006 , stands as a shining example of the art of the possible in longterm economic policymaking whoops but mr osborne is now britain s top economic official and in his new position , he s setting out to emulate the austerity policies ireland implemented after its bubble burst after all , conservatives on both sides of the atlantic spent much of the past year hailing irish austerity as a resounding success the irish approach worked in 198789 and it s working now , alan reynolds of the cato institute last june whoops , again but such failures do n't seem to matter to borrow the title of a by the australian economist john quiggin on doctrines that the crisis should have killed but did n't , we 're still perhaps more than ever ruled by zombie economics why \? part of the answer , surely , is that people who should have been trying to slay zombie ideas have tried to compromise with them instead and this is especially , though not only , true of the president people tend to forget that ronald reagan often gave ground on policy substance most notably , he ended up enacting multiple tax increases but he never wavered on ideas , never backed down from the position that his ideology was right and his opponents were wrong president obama , by contrast , has consistently tried to reach across the aisle by lending cover to rightwing myths he has praised reagan for restoring american dynamism \( when was the last time you heard a republican praising fdr \? \) , adopted gop rhetoric about the need for the government to tighten its belt even in the face of recession , offered symbolic freezes on spending and federal wages none of this stopped the right from denouncing him as a socialist but it helped empower bad ideas , in ways that can do quite immediate harm right now mr obama is hailing the taxcut deal as a boost to the economy but republicans are already talking about spending cuts that would offset any positive effects from the deal and how effectively can he oppose these demands , when he himself has embraced the rhetoric of belttightening \? yes , politics is the art of the possible we all understand the need to deal with one s political enemies but it s one thing to make deals to advance your goals it s another to open the door to zombie ideas when you do that , the zombies end up eating your brain and quite possibly your economy too

now the nfl knows what happens during free agency without a salary cap the chicago bears turn into the and the redskins morph into the bears the bears , one of the most conservative spending franchises , went on a dan snyderesque shopping spree on the first day of free agency friday , agreeing to terms with defensive end julius peppers , running back chester taylor and tight end brandon manumaleuna peppers was the jewel of a depleted 2010 freeagent class and the bears made sure that no other suitor like the new england patriots got a crack at him coach lovie smith flew to charlotte early friday morning and accompanied peppers and his agent to chicago to close the deal peppers s contract is believed to pay him 40 million guaranteed , slightly less than albert haynesworth got from the redskins last season peppers , who said playing for smith and the wellregarded defensive coordinator rod marinelli were big factors in his decision , had 10 sacks last season he is expected to bolster a defense that was once the bedrock of the franchise but withered last season when middle linebacker brian urlacher dislocated his right wrist in the season opener and was lost for the year taylor agreed to a fouryear contract that was believed to include 7 million guaranteed in the first year he ran for 1 , 216 yards for the vikings in 2006 then adrian peterson came to town and taylor became a capable passcatcher out of the backfield , which makes him attractive to mike martz , the bears' new offensive coordinator manumaleuna , who played for martz in st louis , is one of the best blocking tight ends in the nfl the best days are when you win a championship , smith said but you have to have days like this , when you improve your ball club the players we added today will help us win a championship the ravens filled a glaring need by trading their third and fourthround draft picks for arizona s anquan boldin and the cardinals' fifthround draft pick boldin agreed to a fouryear , 28 million contract with the ravens anquan is a player who makes the tough catches , and he is outstanding getting yards after catches , ravens general manager ozzie newsome said in a statement boldin has been unhappy in arizona , but he will join the recently acquired donte stallworth to bolster the ravens' passing game boldin is regarded as one of the nfl s most physical receivers he was the offensive rookie of the year in 2003 he had at least 80 receptions for 1 , 000 yards in four of the past five seasons , but he requested a trade after the 2007 season when his arizona teammate larry fitzgerald received a 40 million contract extension the were active , too , with coach jim schwartz arriving at defensive lineman kyle vanden bosch s home minutes after free agency began and wooing the former titan schwartz was vanden bosch s defensive coordinator in tennessee vanden bosch , a 31yearold pass rusher , has seen his numbers decline in the last two years \( 12 sacks in 2007 , 3 in 2009 \) but he is a respected veteran who will be critical in establishing schwartz s system in detroit the lions are widely expected to take one of the top two defensive tackles gerald mccoy or ndamukong suh with the second overall pick in the draft the lions also signed nate burleson , who will be the no 2 receiver behind calvin johnson in the meantime , the redskins , with the new general manager bruce allen calling the shots , all but sat out the first day of the freeagency frenzy after cutting 10 veterans from their roster in a massive housecleaning thursday within hours of free agency s opening last year , the redskins had signed haynesworth and deangelo hall to large contracts but perhaps chastened by the results of years of uncontrolled spending four wins in 2009 and the firing of coach jim zorn the redskins changed course the cannot be too active in free agency because they were one of the final four teams in 2009 so they filled one of their biggest needs with a trade , sending a thirdround pick to the chargers in exchange for cornerback antonio cromartie and , barring any lastminute change , safety kerry rhodes will remain with the jets next season and receive his 2 million roster bonus next week rhodes has four years remaining on his contract , but his benching last season , due to issues with defensive assistant coaches , led to speculation that he would be traded or released cromartie will play opposite darrelle revis , giving the jets the potential to have the best tandem in the nfl cromartie is 25 years old , loves to play the mantoman defense that rex ryan loves and is gifted in 2007 , he had 10 interceptions but he will arrive with considerable baggage he is a reluctant tackler \( 33 last season \) , as the jets know because cromartie s halfhearted effort on shonn greene s run in their playoff game turned a short gain into a 53yard touchdown he was so disgruntled in san diego that even teammates turned on him and he has been the target of multiple paternity suits he is the father of seven children in five states , a situation that cromartie once acknowledged distracted him in san diego jets general manager mike tannenbaum said the team researched cromartie and felt confident it could help him both on and off the field still , cromartie will play out the final year of his contract without an extension , perhaps providing additional incentive for him to perform well we understand some of those issues he has , tannenbaum said we felt like the risk was reasonable given the price we had to pay we feel he has some great years ahead of him cromartie , in a conference call , said he made mistakes in his first two years in the nfl and had taken responsibility for his children he is working out a schedule with the mothers of the children none of whom he is currently involved with so that he can visit them cromartie said his play dropped off in recent years \( three interceptions last season \) because of injuries and because coaches wanted to play more off coverage i feel for me it s a fresh start , cromartie said i believe a change of scenery will work out great i have to take on the responsibility of being a father to my kids they wo n't impact my focus on the field i can separate my personal life and offfield issues i'm going to have a clear head this season if i'm not playing the way i'm supposed to , i ca n't provide for them
anything great in this world has come from neurotics , marcel proust wrote he could easily have been referring to a string of manic , morose and sometimes quite mad artists who came and went over the centuries , creating a popular impression that creativity and craziness were inextricably linked psychological quirks clearly shaped artists' careers long before van gogh was on the scene a detailfreak streak in leonardo da vinci s personality led him to leave many projects unfinished the 16thcentury painter federico barocci was plagued by a psychosomatic malaise so crippling that for 50 years he worked only two hours a day and spent the rest of the time , in agony , in bed \( he must have worked extrahard in those hours because he turned out a lot of product \) leonardo and barocci got off lightly , though , compared with suicidal peers the mannerist painter francesco bassano , in a frenzy of paranoia \( he thought the police were after him \) , jumped out a window and died the dutch artist emanuel de witte , best known for his immaculate church interiors , is thought to have drowned himself the architect francesco borromini , damned by a critic as a complete ignoramus , a corrupter of architecture , and the shame of our century , ended it all with a sword to the annals of aesthetic pathology we can also add the slightly milder case of the 18thcentury german sculptor franz xaver messerschmidt , who is the subject of a small but potent retrospective at the neue galerie as was not necessarily true of the artists mentioned above , his mental disturbance manifested itself in his art , specifically in a series of bizarrely conceived busts known as character heads among the more outlandish artifacts of the age of reason , 19 of these sculptures have been brought together for the show franz xaver messerschmidt 17361783 from neoclassicism to expressionism , which has been organized in collaboration with the louvre and travels to paris from new york messerschmidt was born in a small town in bavaria and trained as a journeyman sculptor in munich at 18 he was at the academy of fine arts in vienna , where he caught the eye of its director , martin van meytens , who was also official painter to the habsburg court thanks to van meytens s advocacy , the brilliant young sculptor soon had commissions for imperial portraits , including two of the empress maria theresa wanting further experience , he traveled to rome to immerse himself in antiquities , paying particular attention to roman republican portraiture after this , like most enterprising enlightenment artists , he shifted his style from a baroquerococo m lange to neoclassicism , evident in two of the earliest portraits in the show one , in cast metal , depicts the viennese art theorist franz von scheyb , a close friend of van meytens the other , carved from alabaster , is of gerard van swieten , maria theresa s physician in both portraits , the baroque coiffeurs and draperies are stripped away in their place we have , in a new plain style , unglamorous , faceforward images of two notyoung , notbeautiful men looking much as they must have looked in life around the time of these busts , messerschmidt was hired to teach at the academy , with the understanding that he would inherit the position of professor of sculpture once a senior colleague had retired a bright future seemed assured then everything went awry , as damaging rumors circulated that he was mentally unbalanced academic politics ca n't be discounted , especially after his champion , van meytens , died but messerschmidt s personality , commandingly idiosyncratic , had always set him apart , and by the early 1770s his eccentricities were more pronounced possibly after contact with secret societies , of a sort that proliferated at the time like a return of a gothic repressed , he was having hallucinations , seeing ghosts commissions dried up when the academy professorship became available , it went to someone else in anger he rejected the compensatory offering of a pension and left vienna for good after some wandering he ended up not far from vienna in 1777 in the city now called bratislava , where he crashed with a younger brother , then found a home and studio of his own in vienna he had already begun producing his slightly largerthanlife and entirely selfcommissioned character heads in bratislava he made many more some are obviously selfportraits others may have been modeled on specific sitters , and still others are fanciful nearly all are marked by facial contortions in one selfportrait cast in tin an inexpensive and easily worked metal messerschmidt is wearing a bratislavastyle sheepskin cap and grinning so strenuously that his eyes are all but buried in folds of flesh in a second selfportrait the aggressive hilarity is gone his features are bunched and twisted in a look of tearful , abject fear in a third , he gives a vehement scowl , under thick , solderedon eyebrows this bust had traditionally been called a surly old soldier , but none of the titles on the heads are by messerschmidt himself they were added after his death , and most seem descriptively inaccurate a sculpture of a shavenheaded man with tightly shut eyes and a stretchedopen mouth is called the yawner , though he seems to be screaming and the moralizing label of a hypocrite and slanderer has little pertinence to the image of an elderly figure staring downward , his chin pressed into a collar of fleshly wrinkles at his neck , as if he were lost , even trapped in profound selfreflection in 1781 the staid but dauntless journalist friedrich nicolai visited messerschmidt and asked him what had inspired the sculptures the artist explained that he was periodically tormented by malign spirits , the most frightful of which he called the spirit of proportion but if he greeted them with sculptural expressions of extreme emotions , the spirits could be kept at bay \( had he told the same story to anyone back in vienna \? if so , that might explain a lot \) it s tempting to view messerschmidt in bratislava as an outsider , isolated , strictly on his own track but this was n't so his reputation as a former sculptor to the viennese court brought him a prestigious new clientele , so that at the same time he was creating his character heads , he was working on commissions for aristocratic portraits these late portraits are a fascinating combination of accuracy and exaggeration he depicts duke albert of saxeteschen , one of maria theresa s sonsinlaw , with flaring norma desmond eyes and a chin so large as to verge on being abnormal , like the protruding upper lip in his own beak heads messerschmidt s 1782 image of the enlightenment historian martin georg kovachich is even more forcefully expressive with its large , swollen features and scowlcreased forehead , it seems to be shoving its way through space in the kovachich portrait , messerschmidt welded together , much in the way his nearcontemporary francisco goya did , two sides of his identity as an artist , the public and the private , the realist and the visionary in the character heads , he had long been doing the same after his death , at 47 , a group of more than 40 of these busts were sold en masse , shipped to vienna and exhibited , accompanied by added names and a brochure , as a freakshow attraction in a carnival then gradually , with changes in taste , one by one they entered private collections , then museums , being valued most recently as precursors to the early20thcentury german expressionist painting that is a neue galerie specialty they fit effortlessly into the context of a contemporary art that encompasses images of physiognomic distortion by artists like bruce nauman , tony oursler , arnulf rainer , cindy sherman , ashley bickerton and keith edmier , among many others \( mr edmier has made a limitededition sculpture based on a messerschmidt head to accompany the show \) and messerschmidt s sculptures , which once struck audiences as alien and nuts , simply make some human sense in our century , when everyone could use some psychotherapy even the uptight nicolai eventually became comfortable with his reclusive subject s art the journalist kept a portrait bust that messerschmidt made of him on his work desk for the rest of his life , in memory , he wrote , of a strange and really great artist proust might not have agreed with this evaluation , but he understood that the descriptive terms can be one and the same
in 2007 , as the association of tennis professionals began a crackdown on gambling and disciplined five lowerranked italian players for making bets on matches , it knew that gambling accounts were maintained in the names of some of its topranked players , who bet on matches , and did not follow up and discipline them , according to evidence revealed in a federal lawsuit they went after the lowhanging fruit that would not impact their bottom line , said robert f elgidely of genovese , joblove and battista of fort lauderdale , fla , a lawyer for the five players who were fined from 20 , 000 to 50 , 000 and suspended anywhere from six weeks to seven months the atp was aware that gambling accounts were maintained in the names of highranked players a confidentiality agreement prohibits me from disclosing the names of those players to third parties and even my clients the atp , citing the court s confidentiality order , declined to comment the year the crackdown began , ted forstmann , chairman of the sports and entertainment conglomerate img worldwide , was betting on one of his company s clients , roger federer , at the 2007 men s final forstmann acknowledges betting 40 , 000 on federer the atp released a statement last week that it had sent a message that we consider his behavior inappropriate and that he will be in violation of the rules if he engages in such activity in the future forstmann recently said he stopped gambling in 2007 elgidely said that the atp showed a double standard in its lack of a punishment for forstmann the anticorruption policy in the atp rule book at the time , he said , prohibited gambling on tennis by any coach , trainer , manager , agent , family member , tournament guest or other affiliate , or associate of any player but on friday , gayle bradshaw , an atp spokesman , said that the gambling prohibition at the time extended only to a player and or his regular travelling support team \( player support personnel \) he added , the important thing is that tennis adopted a uniform anticorruption code in 2009 , which was a significant advancement for the sport on friday , elgidely questioned the response of course , the atp is free to interpret its rules as it deems appropriate , he said , but an interpretation that excludes forstmann from its reach would seem to be contrary to its professed zerotolerance policy and the presumably intentionally broad terminology used in the rule forstmann , 70 , is being sued in los angeles county superior court by agate printing inc , which alleges fraud , interference with contract and breach of contract in the complaint , jim agate , the head of agate printing , is seeking extensive damages for lost business that he says forstmann promised him agate also contends in the suit that he served as a conduit for hundreds of bets totaling millions of dollars that forstmann placed on events in various sports besides representing many of tennis s top players , including federer and rafael nadal , img has deep business ties with the professional tennis tours it owns and operates several tournaments , including the sony ericsson open , held every spring in miami gavin forbes , a senior vice president of img , is also a member of the atp s board of directors the atp s gambling crackdown began on nov 10 , 2007 , when one of elgidely s clients , alessio di mauro , after being found guilty of betting with an online bookmaker from nov 2 , 2006 , to june 12 , 2007 none of the bets were on his matches and no results were affected , according to the investigation , and the amounts were nominal he was ranked 107th at the time he was notified that he was under investigation , and his penalties were subsequently reduced to seven months and 25 , 000 the disciplinary action came in the wake of suspicions of match fixing in tennis after , voided 7 million in bets after nikolay davydenko , then the world s no 4 player , withdrew from a match against 74thranked mart n vassallo arguello of argentina at the prokom open in sopot , poland it also set off that they had been asked to throw matches or had heard of similar approaches to others federer said that after the lawsuit charged that forstmann had increased a bet on the 2007 french open final after consulting with federer while acknowledging his bet on federer , forstmann has rejected the claims in the lawsuit , questioned agate s credibility and denied receiving inside information from federer lawyers for agate have requested that forstmann be deposed on dec 13 in new york today we filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the previous agreement mr forstmann had with mr agate and to stay the case , as allowed under ca law , said michael sitrick , a spokesman for forstmann thus , no discovery could take place sitrick continued with respect to the case itself , the allegations in james agate s complaint are beyond false , they are preposterous knowing he has no case in a court of law , agate continues to attempt to try this case in the court of public opinion
washington in june , the supreme court issued a decision on the privacy rights of a police officer whose sexually explicit text messages had been reviewed by his employer ever since , lower court judges have struggled to figure out what the decision means the case touches issues of farreaching significance , justice anthony m kennedy wrote then he explained why the court would decide none of them a definitive ruling should be avoided , he said , because it might have implications for future cases that cannot be predicted justice antonin scalia went along with the decision , but he blasted his colleagues for issuing opaque opinions a month later , judge frank m hull of the federal appeals court in atlanta complained that the privacy decision featured a marked lack of clarity , and was almost aggressively unhelpful to judges and lawyers the supreme court under the leadership of chief justice john g roberts jr is often criticized for issuing sweeping and politically polarized decisions but there is an emerging parallel critique as well , this one concerned with the quality of the court s judicial craftsmanship in decisions on questions great and small , the court often provides only limited or ambiguous guidance to lower courts and it increasingly does so at enormous length brown v board of education , the towering 1954 decision that held segregated public schools unconstitutional , managed to do its work in fewer than 4 , 000 words when the roberts court returned to just an aspect of the issue in 2007 in parents involved v seattle , it published some 47 , 000 words , enough to rival a short novel in more routine cases , too , the court has been setting records the median length of majority opinions reached an alltime high in the last term critics of the court s work are not primarily focused on the quality of the justices' writing , though it is often flabby and flat instead , they point to reasoning that fails to provide clear guidance to lower courts , sometimes seemingly driven by a desire for unanimity that can lead to fuzzy , unwieldy rulings the privacy decision that angered justice scalia was unanimous so was a decision in march , on mutual fund advisers' fees , that was , nevertheless , vague enough that both sides plausibly could and did claim victory writing for the court , justice samuel a alito jr told lower courts little more than that the law requires that all relevant circumstances be taken into account in deciding whether advisers' fee arrangements were proper he acknowledged that this guidance may lack sharp analytical clarity one measure of whether unanimity is authentic is the number of separate opinions in nominally unanimous decisions this last term set a record for such opinions , known as concurrences , in which justices join or vote with the majority but also issue their own opinions to express qualms about some aspect of the majority s approach but divided decisions can be maddeningly vague , too , of course a decision in may striking down lifewithoutparole sentences for juvenile offenders who did not kill anyone said only that states must provide some meaningful opportunity to obtain release in dissent , justice clarence thomas wondered what that could possibly mean a decision last year that required a judge to step aside from a case involving a coal executive who had spent millions to help elect the judge left many questions unanswered about when recusal is required how many questions \? chief justice roberts , dissenting , listed 40 in a pair of civil procedure decisions in 2007 and 2009 that have been cited many thousands of times , the court gave trial judges more authority to throw out cases early based on , in the words of the later decision , their experience and common sense that standard , arthur r miller wrote last month in the duke law journal , is shadowy at best and has caused confusion and disarray among judges and lawyers unanimous in name only chief justice roberts , who has led the court for more than five years , early on expressed his preference for unanimous opinions even as he seemed to recognize a potential cost in providing guidance to the lower courts the more cautious approach , the approach that can get the most justices to sign on to it , is the preferred approach , he said in 2006 as it happens , his project has not been particularly successful two of the roberts court s five terms ranked among the top 10 since 1953 in the average number of dissenting opinions per case , according to an analysis by lee epstein of northwestern university and andrew d martin of washington university in st louis none of 19 terms overseen by chief justice william h rehnquist from 1986 to 2005 made the top 10 but it is in the area of faux unanimity that the roberts court is really making its mark in the last term , there was at least one concurring opinion in 77 percent of unanimous rulings that is a record concurrences present the bench and bar with a particular difficulty
there are only two dancers in balanchine s duo concertant , and each has some time to think onstage while listening to the pianist and violinist play the opening of its stravinsky score what a torrent must have flooded yvonne borree s mind on sunday afternoon at the david h koch theater surely it included her 1992 performance of the duet , when she was cast alongside mikhail baryshnikov \( who appeared as a guest artist \) that was her first time dancing the role and sunday was the last , as ms borree , a principal dancer , retired after 22 years with city ballet , the same company her mother , susan borree , danced in before her yvonne borree s duo concertant debut , which came while she was still in the corps , helped start her career she danced it well then writing in the new york times , anna kisselgoff deemed her a confident young ballerina and praised her swanlike beauty on sunday ms borree radiated a tremulous joy and a welcome incisiveness , her now seasoned confidence aided by jared angle , her sure and elegant partner their warm , shared glances were a pleasure to see so were the deft , rhythmic exchanges of their steps , as they played off each other and the music \( sunday s violinist was kurt nikkanen , the pianist cameron grant \) ms borree was forever flitting out of reach , as if to say not quite yet , i'm not ready to stop , only to let herself be caught and then to sink down luxuriously over mr angle s arm duo concertant , from 1972 , is a quiet ballet , a fitting finale for a performer who has had a quiet career it can seem a slight , fussy conceit of a work , built as it is around the two onstage musicians but here ms borree gave such care to each gesture , her varied \( surely conflicting \) moods shading each moment in the end , as the role dictates , she stood alone , perhaps a muse , perhaps a wraith , a small spotlight slowly tightening to enclose her outstretched hand in darkness this melancholy solitude did n't last long , as ms borree , taking her bows , soon became a onewoman receiving line for city ballet principals past and present one after another they came , flowers and confetti raining down damian woetzel drew an affectionate laugh from the crowd upon presenting her with a big red heart , and the most poignant moments came when albert evans and darci kistler wrapped ms borree in bear hugs their final bows will follow soon enough , as city ballet sees five retirements this spring \( philip neal and the conductor maurice kaplow are also leaving \) these exits are the countermotif to a city ballet season that is all about the new , with seven premieres one of those new dances , christopher wheeldon s estancia , was also performed on sunday retirements can make us take stock of who remains in the company , so it was good to see such a young and vibrant cast leading estancia , including tyler angle and andrew veyette , but especially the marvelous tiler peck , the ballet s fierce , earthy heroine all three dancers paid their respects to ms borree , who will be missed by many , as evidenced by the prolonged standing ovation she basked in , her eyes often bright with tears but ms borree has not left an indelible mark on the company , and in her other performance of the afternoon , the third andante section of balanchine s brahmsschoenberg quartet \( 1966 \) , she reminded you of why partnered by a gallantly attentive benjamin millepied , ms borree was pleasant and pretty , moving carefully through her steps as if hesitant to stir up trouble she skated lightly through her point work , the lush karinska tutu rising and settling about her like gossamer as she delicately unfurled her limbs moment by moment she acquitted herself with perfect competence but never offered anything more there was none of the abandon jenifer ringer brought to the intermezzo section , or the wit maria kowroski doled out in the rondo alla zingarese there was nothing here to hint at the singular powers of a ballerina it was lovely to see the unbridled smile ms borree shared with mr millepied , but difficult , as it often has been for this viewer , to connect with this fragile , dolllike dancer how strange , upon seeing her perform for perhaps the final time , to feel as if you 'd hardly yet seen her at all

judy battista was in indianapolis and john woods was in manhattan providing live analysis of saturday s game between the ravens and the colts scroll down to track the progress of the game , as it happened you also can follow  the colts looked a little like a team that maybe should have been adding to an undefeated record , not that i am trying to start an argument they were efficient and aggressive early in the game , chewing up big chunks of clock and converting on two scoring chances late in the second quarter peyton manning , playing very much like this year s mvp , had two touchdown passes , leading the colts into the afc championship game with a resounding victory the colts will host the winner of tomorrow s game between the chargers and the jets but as sharp as manning was , it was the colts defense that made a bigger difference indianapolis held baltimore to 87 rushing yards a week after the ravens gained 234 at new england the ravens could get nothing going through the air , either flacco was 20 of 35 for 183 yards and 2 interceptions the ravens offense spent almost the whole second quarter on the sideline as the colts , who had a nearlyeightminute advantage in time of possession , swept to a 173 lead in the end , it was the mistakes the ravens made not the plays they didn t that cost them they were penalized 7 times for 64 yards \( the colts drew 4 flags for 25 yards \) , and it seemed like every whistle hurt the ravens their first erased a long kick return nos 2 and 3 pushed the colts closer to their first touchdown three penalties helped stall their first two drives of the second half , and the final flag negated a long interception return by ed reed it was too much to overcome flacco keeps throwing but the completion streak ends and a streak of incompletions begins a few plays later , that ends with an interception all the colts need to do is take a knee this game is over flacco comes out throwing three in a row , probably his only three pass plays in a row all game they get 16 yards before the twominute warning , with the ball at the colts 27 and that has to be the last straw the ravens had something working on offense there a lot of energy , some good , crisp gains , but flacco just missed the mark on that last pass the colts go back to work and pound the rock three consecutive running plays , very little gained , and they line up to punt with 3 17 left the ravens get it back at the colts 43 the ravens gamely keep at it consecutive first downs brings the colts midfield helmet into view , and a third first down a short pass to and 16yard run by ray rice sends the ravens offense into colts territory on a secondand10 from the colts 39 , flacco tries to stretch the offense again he launches a deep pass to inside the 5 , intended for mason , but it is picked by antoine bethea mason was open for a score , but flacco s pass was short the colts will take over at their 2 gumbel just said the clock was slooowly becoming an enemy for the baltimore ravens the colts offense goes right back to the ravens game plan short run short pass on a slant route and all with the clock ticking on thirdand1 , as the clock slips under seven minutes , manning tries to lob the ball on a timing pattern to collie , who is looping out of the slot the pass is incomplete and an observer has to wonder why the colts didn t run the ball again after the punt , the ravens take over at their 22 the ravens , with nine minutes left , like i said , are sticking with rice they run inside with rice on first down and , about 30 seconds later , flacco throws incomplete to the sideline thirdand8 with 8 16 left flacco is under center , and he faces heavy pressure the pass is incomplete , intended for washington , who has the ball hit him in the hands , though a step behind him the ravens punt and the colts will take over their their 25 the ravens defense , which has to be stunned by that last play , rises to the occasion the colts , though , weren t trying anything fancy they go three and out , and punt it back to the ravens with about nine minutes left , the ravens will have the ball at their 21 the ravens get the kick out to the 28 the ravens go right back to rice and short gains on thirdand5 , though , flacco stretches out and finds kelley washington for 11 yards and a first down and then the ravens offense starts to build momentum after a nice 7yard pass to heap , rice takes a handoff up the middle and he finds lots of room and when the colts close in on him , he just bulls ahead his jersey is stretched he s butting heads he drives 20 yards deep into the heart of the colts defense and then a solid hit jars the ball loose clint session recovers for the colts they take over at their own 20 ouch strangely , with a chance to put the game away , the colts start moving backward on firstandgoal , and the colts try a run , out of a singleback set the play had nothing to recommend it they lose 3 on second down , manning tries the gun , but is flushed to his right and he slides to the turf after losing 4 on third down , manning tries for the end zone and his pass is long but just getting that far might have been enough stover makes his second field goal of the game , and the colts lead , 203 manning keeps the colts on the move as time winds down in the third quarter , he finds dallas clark for 5 yards for a first down at the ravens 9 the third quarter ends from judy ravens just burned their second timeout with 4 24 left in the third quarter time is slipping away , for the ravens and the theme of selfdestruction continues , too is a fumble on an interception not enough for you \? how about another interception by ed reed and another long return negated by a passinterference penalty \? that s exactly what happens a great pick by reed , and this time he hangs onto the ball but there are flags down and the colts go from possibly having the ravens at their doorstep , with firstandgoal from the 10 to getting the ball back and penalty yards to boot from the ravens 37 , the colts dial it back a little with consecutive runs , but manning airs it out on thirdand4 , finding wayne for 11 yards to the ravens 20 from judy that s two ed reed picks on this drive and the colts are inside the ravens 35 yard line anyway bizarro world my thoughts exactly so , a big thing happens on the next play manning throws to garcon , but ed reed picks the ball off and takes off like a shot he s up the sideline and he goes 30 some yards and you don t notice that garcon was following the whole way he finally catches up , and pops the ball out and the ball bounces right to dallas clark you go from turnover to turnover in a blink of an eye manning gets the colts almost all the way back to the 45 two plays later it s like reed s big play never happened the ravens seem dead set on stopping themselves they lengthen the field with a holding penalty on the next play , and then flacco throws incomplete on thirdand3 and fourthand3 colts take over at their 45 , poised to possibly pull out their pot of spackling and put the finishing touches on this game ngata is not as corpulent as some of the wide bodies who play on the interior of the defense , but manning was wise to avoid a direct hit the ravens start with their best field position of the game , by far and they go right back to rice two runs and they are facing a thirdandohsoshort the wilder monkeys in the crowd amp up their screeching , but flags are thrown and it s a false start on the ravens \( penalties are killing them so far in this game \) the ravens shrug it off , though , and flacco finds todd heap over the middle for 10 yards and a first down you don t have to wear an ugly suit and stand in front of a tv camera to know that the ravens need to stop the colts here , and get back on offense they have the colts pinned back , though , so a turnover could be a gamechanger manning gives himself breathing room right away , with completions to brown and wayne but that is where the good feeling stops on his third play , manning is forced to take a dive , disappearing under the pumpkinshaped haloti ngata on second down , manning throws deep and incomplete his thirddown pass is dropped by pierre garcon no return on the punt , but the ravens will have decent field position at their own 34 so , on third down , flacco niftily dodges the pass rush , and dumps a pass off to rice , who gains 26 yards , up the right sideline , finishing his run by blowing right into a tackler an exclamation point on a powerful run , which brought the ravens to midfield but on thirdand3 , the ravens offense shorts out flacco throws incomplete , and the punt is downed at the colts 7 greg gumbel muses , as the colts kick off the start the second half , about how long the ravens can stick with their game plan a long time , i say there is a lot of time left in this game , and flacco might be a young player , but he has shown plenty of composure in his short career the ravens start with rice , who runs for short yardage and after an incomplete seconddown pass , flacco lines the ravens up in the shotgun and calls timeout wow i just checked manning s numbers it s the story of the game so far he was 21 of 29 for 180 yards and 2 touchdowns he had completions to seven different players , led by dallas clark , who has 6 catches for 54 yards flacco was 5 of 10 for 55 yards , but i think that works out to be 1 of 4 for 1 yard in the second quarter the colts big timeconsuming drive in the second quarter prevents us from getting a solid feel for the ravens offense , but so far it has been onedimensional the 55 yards of pass offense were all to derrick mason , in just 3 catches ray rice has shown some power running with the ball he has 28 yards on 8 carries , but his longest run was only 6 yards flacco is sure to face a strong pass rush in the second half , so rice is going to have to make some plays running the ball if the ravens are going to have a chance judy writes , peyton was right he wanted one more play td to wayne two td lead at the half is that the game \? that s the end of the first half the colts get an important score after an impressive twominute drill by manning the colts went 64 yards in 8 plays and 1 48 manning can be heard on tv shouting at his teammates to move , move , move ! on secondand10 from the 14 , ray lewis is flagged for a helmettohelmet hit on austin collie the colts creep closer to the goal line , but time is slowly slipping away on firstandgoal from the 7 , manning finds clark for a 3yard gain , and the colts have to call their final timeout with 11 seconds left they line up for another play , though the colts are showing that they are not afraid to be aggressive manning works out of the gun , and he throws incomplete he had pressure coming up from his backside , and he was knocked down after he threw with 7 seconds left , manning wants to take another shot he is slow coming out of the huddle , though , and the colts are flagged for delay of game the colts will still go for it , though , possibly turning their back on a sure 3 points \( never mind \) manning finds wayne , who is right at the goal line , almost straddling it he goes down , but gets the ball in the end zone touchdown colts add to their lead , 173 brown is the colts backup running back , and he went from pass catcher to runner on the very next play he bulled off the left side , out of the shotgun , for 13 yards , breaking tackles in oldtime earl campbell style the colts catch a huge break on the next play , with the ravens getting flagged for pass interference that moves the ball safely in fieldgoal range at the ravens 27 with 34 seconds left the ravens have to be disappointed they needed either to bleed the clock , or gain yards instead , they give manning a very real chance to expand the colts lead manning wastes no time , rattling off three completions , including one to his seventh different receiver 8 yards to donald brown they bang across midfield to the ravens 40 with 55 seconds left the ravens starting field position had been gradually inching away from the goal line , but on the ensuing kick it slips backward two minutes left , they take over at their 18 they start with rice , a bullish run behind the right guard and then call timeout on secondand6 , flacco is jolted hard as he threw , a deep pass toward the post it s incomplete which brings up third down and a seemingly louder wave of crowd noise flacco throws incomplete again , and the ravens meekly prepare to turn the ball back over to the colts with plenty of time for them to score again from judy , referring to the ravens domonique foxworth , foxworth beaten on that td by collie 8 minute drive ravens defense was out there a long time the colts are much more methodical on this drive they have chewed up six minutes so far they bounce inside the 20 on a pass to mike hart , a player who began the season on the colts practice squad gain of 9 up the sideline to the ravens 11 and they take the lead back on a 10yard pass from manning to austin collie touchdown colts move back in front , 103 the colts go 75 yards in eight minutes we ve hit the twominute warning the colts weren t bluffing it s fourthand4 from the ravens 35 not a bad place to do something like this , when you consider the distance a field goal would be manning passes to the right side to addai who appears to have room to run , but dannell ellerbe arrives for a solid hit right at the firstdown marker and the officials have to measure they give it to the colts , the fourth first down of the drive the colts move inexorably on , though now in smaller steps after addai is stuffed on a thirdand2 at the ravens 33 , the colts line up as if to go for it on fourth down the ravens , perhaps caught off guard , call timeout manning finds reggie wayne on first down for 12 yards , which is wayne s first touch of the game on the next play , as if to emphasize wayne s importance to the colts offense , manning goes to him again , and wayne makes a spectacular catch gain of 11 to the colts 48 the colts have done a good job of spreading the workload manning has completions to five receivers but the hardest worker so far is dallas clark , who has four catches for 39 yards his fourth was a nice 7yard gain on thirdand6 from the ravens 48 the ravens stick with rice he runs , he catches on third down from their 24 , however , flacco doesn t have a chance to get rice the ball flacco disappears under a white and blue wave of plastic loss of 6 yards and an entree for the punt team flags fly like crazy on the ensuing punt it was , you might have guessed , a nifty return all for naught colts take over at their 25 the colts drive ends as effectively as the ravens did there was a brief blip when joseph addai pulled down a tipped pass for a short gain manning throws long and incomplete on third down , and the colts are forced to punt about the only thing you can take from those four plays are the fact that the punt went out of the end zone the touchback gives the ravens their best starting field position of the game the ravens bring the hammer for their second drive they start with consecutive runs up the middle by ray rice , but on thirdand2 an unremarkable incompletion sends the ball back to the colts the punt is returned close to midfield manning was 7 for 11 and 75 yards in the first quarter as judy writes , we can also stop talking about peyton being rusty yeah , he s not looks better than he did against jets by a mile flacco was 4 of 6 for 55 yards a very fastmoving first quarter the colts punt , and the ravens fair catch inside their 10 more bad field position the colts begin their second drive with the kind of precision passing that manning is known for he finds clark on a short crossing route the tv heads agree that the defensive coverage was pretty good , but manning puts the ball right where it needs to go and the colts pick up 19 yards a clutch 8yard completion to austin collie on thirdand6 gets the colts close to midfield but they can t get back across on thirdand7 , manning finds clark on the left side , but he is pulled down after 3 yards the quarter ends , and the colts are likely to punt a tweet from judy says it all flacco is obviously much healthier than last week is throwing to the edges with ease but that s a killer to not get 7 there the ravens erased their next third down with a sneak by flacco for 2 yards to the colts 8 closing in on the end zone , the ravens try to run they try a pass and on thirdandgoal , flacco is nearly picked off by antoine bethea , who would might have taken it to the house had he been able to hang on the ravens settle billy cundiff is good from 25 yards and the ravens tie the score , 33  the ravens erase the bad taste of a short gain on their very first play with a short pass on second down that derrick mason turned into a 16yard gain and with that , their offense stretches its legs five plays go by before they face their first third down , thirdand7 from midfield they get 5 yards on a penalty and then the ravens joe flacco toss his first deep pass , 18 yards to mason down the right sideline first down at the colts 18 judy said the colts would be looking for a fast start i am not sure that qualifies , but the indy offense did look crisp to start and they moved quickly across midfield and in big strides the ravens cause a bit of a stir on the ensuing kick the returner jalen parmele found some room up the left sideline , and ripped of a 64yard return that was called back because of an illegal block ravens ball at their 7 the colts start with bold passing strokes , straight up the middle of the field 20 yards to austin collie 10 yards to dallas clark then they shorten their reach , starting with a pass underneath to pierre garcon , who shrugs off a tackle and gains 8 after a nice offtackle run by joseph addai , to bring the colts to the ravens 26 , the ravens defense stiffens backtoback incompletions , including a wicked collision between ray lewis and clark , end the colts drive they line up for a 44yard field goal , and matt stover converts colts move ahead , 30 we are on the colts won the toss , and they chose to receive \( inexplicably , cbs cut to commercial just as the coin flip was being resolved \) it was a deep kick and a touchback  the game starts at 8 15 pm eastern time and is broadcast on cbs you can check out the breakdown from the nfl here the indianapolis star notes that it s put up or shut up time for the colts while in baltimore , the sun has a todo list for the ravens we begin our coverage with this from judy this game , indeed the entire indianapolis colts season , boils down to this did they rest too much or just enough , will they be rusty or ready in time to beat the baltimore ravens to reverse a troubling part of their history they are 03 after playoff byes , and in eight previous playoff appearances this decade , they have been oneanddone five times the colts are the afc s top seed and finished with the league s best regularseason record \( 142 \) , and coach jim caldwell tweaked their byeweek preparations , having his offense s starters practice against his defense s starters in an effort to keep his team sharp they had seven fourthquarter comebacks this season , but a quick start is critical tonight they don t want doubt to creep in , but more important , the ravens are illsuited to play from behind they depend heavily on their running game joe flacco attempted just 10 passes against the patriots last week the colts will put extra players at the line of scrimmage to force flacco , who is playing with a hip contusion , to throw when these teams played two months ago , flacco managed the game well and was not sacked but he threw a costly interception late in the game the colts defense , particularly the pass rushers dwight freeney and robert mathis , are healthier than they were then and the colts figure to blitz flacco the ravens hope to handle the undersizedbutfast freeney and mathis man to man , but left tackle jared gaither was hobbled in practice this week and freeney and mathis will have an advantage because of the fast indoor turf and crowd noise the ravens hope to run ray rice and willis mcgahee at the defensive ends or up the middle because the colts defense playing faster with the return of linebacker clint session and safety melvin bullitt will limit runs to the outside as usual , the colts hopes rest with peyton manning , the league s most valuable player the ravens will blitz him , but that s a dangerous strategy manning has an uncanny knack for unloading the ball in time , and he was sacked just 10 times none of them by baltimore in november in the november game , the colts mixed their zone coverages , and manning finished with one touchdown and two interceptions the ravens catch a small break today , though the baltimore sun reported that carl cheffers s officiating crew has called the fewest passinterference penalties this season just five in 15 regularseason games still , if manning is sharp he wasn t in the halfplus he played against the jets in his last meaningful action it is hard to imagine how the runintensive ravens will be able to score enough points to keep up with the colts
norton , mass corey pavin s list was in his back pocket , folded with edges as sharp as the crease in his tailored pants on it were the names of the 20 or so golfers he had been talking to at the deutsche bank championship eight of them have qualified for the united states ryder cup team by points the rest would like to make it as one of the four captain s selections by monday night , pavin , the 26th united states captain in the history of the , will have made his final selections then he will begin making calls four of the calls will be easy the rest will be difficult it will narrow down quickly , said pavin , standing in the locker room at the tpc boston clubhouse there were sweat lines on the front of his shirt he had been busy , working the range , trying to encourage without raising the expectations of the more than 20 ryder cup hopefuls we 've got this tournament to watch and we 'll see what happens , he added there s a lot of people in the running , and i want to keep a very open mind this weekend just watch , and hopefully , some of it will take care of itself in a couple of cases , it may already have but pavin will concede nothing he responded guardedly to a question about whether , with his climb back to form in the past few weeks , has taken care of business well enough to be one of his picks , saying it does n't hurt put it that way that is as close to a hint as he will give pavin makes no promises , and he hopes he has given no false hopes to anyone so when his four choices are announced tuesday morning at the new york stock exchange , none who have been directly involved in the process should be surprised pavin said he had misled no one throughout the year he had spent scrutinizing players who might fit his criteria for selection i 've tried to talk to the guys and let them know they 're on my radar , and if they play well this week , it would certainly help their case , he said there s no promises out there to anybody , and i think everybody s mature enough to understand that it s just going to come down to what myself , the assistant captains , what the guys already on the team feel and think talk to everybody on the team about it and they all have their opinions about it , and i do n't think anybody has come up with just four guys it s like , most guys have about seven or eight on their list , too most unofficial lists start with woods , who has demonstrated how much he wants to make the team by his increased work on his game , his improved results and his words last week , he summed it up by saying i'm focused on just winning if i win golf tournaments , then i think our captain , hopefully , will pick me then comes zach johnson , who has had a solid year , with a victory at colonial in may and a strong performance at the pga championship , where he tied for third johnson is just the kind of toughminded competitor pavin had in mind when he described the type of player he is looking to add to the team that will face the european squad early next month at celtic manor in wales what i'm looking for is someone who i think can handle ryder cup pressure in europe , pavin said friday if that s a rookie , that s fine if it s not , that s fine johnson won 1 points and was one of the few bright spots on the 2006 united states team that lost to europe , 18 9 , at the k club in ireland that was his only ryder cup appearance he was passed over in 2008 by paul azinger , whose four picks j b holmes , hunter mahan , chad campbell and steve stricker performed well although he could have helped the '08 team , he did not criticize the selections and was vocal in his support i was cheering for them like crazy , he said he hopes to be on the receiving end of the cheers this year , but does not seem obsessed by it it would be an honor , and i want to get on that team very , very bad , he said but , you know , like we were just talking about , you can justify the case for a number of guys those players include stewart cink , a fourtime ryder cup participant who is playing well ben crane , a tough competitor who won the farmers insurance open early this year anthony kim , who slipped seven spots to no 9 on the points list during a twomonth absence after thumb surgery sean o'hair , winless this year but starting to come around nick watney , a bundle of talent with unlimited potential and rickie fowler , a secondyear professional with two runnerup finishes this year they are all on the list in pavin s back pocket late monday , everyone on the list will learn whether he made the team on tuesday , pavin will tell everyone else until then , he is not saying anything
after analyzing the championship games or series of the nfl , nba , major league baseball and nhl , and the major finals in golf and tennis , we identified 50 championships characteristics in our book , who will win the big game \? a psychological and mathematical method based on similar research , we focused on several championship characteristics that might help predict the winner of this year s ncaa men s basketball tournament with an eye toward concepts of sport psychology , we looked at factors like biggame experience , leadership from the bench , leadership on the court , error control and consistency so important are these concepts to winning championships that they have proven to be common themes across all sports we studied over the past 25 tournaments , 14 of 25 champions have had final four experience from the previous three years this factor favors michigan state , the only remaining team that has a recent final four appearance \( 2009 \) big game experience has proven to be one of the strongest and most consistent championship characteristics in every sport we have studied experience is related to confidence , focus , successfully managing big moments and relaxed aggression on average , teams and athletes that have more big game experience have won about 70 percent of championship games coaching leadership is also a key ingredient this factor favors duke and coach mike krzyzewski s 107 record once he reaches final four michigan state s tom izzo has been to five previous final fours , but he is only 34 in the national semifinals and finals , winning one championship west virginia s bob huggins lost his only final four game , while butler coach brad stevens is in his first national semifinal leadership on the court is also important over the past 25 years , teams with more allamericans have gone 117 in championship games this factor points to duke and west virginia , each with one allamerican , as opposed to michigan state and butler , with none research has shown that shooting consistency and limiting errors are important to winning championships below is a chart that shows several key statistics for each of the final four teams , along with other categories we listed above over all , the factors point to duke , but michigan state is the only team to have a final four appearance over the past three seasons in addition , butler s strength in consistency statistics and limiting errors shows that the bulldogs are a threat to michigan state in the semifinal game
the effort to restore florida s everglades has been revived thanks to the efforts of president obama and florida s republican governor , charlie crist the obama administration has committed more than 300 million in new money , and construction on important projects including lifting a section of the tamiami trail to bring freshwater to the everglades is under way last week , the state agency that oversees the restoration voted unanimously to press forward with mr crist s controversial but potentially gamechanging 536 million deal to buy 73 , 000 acres of land from the united states sugar corporation the land would eventually be taken out of agricultural production , removing a major source of pollution , and converted into reservoirs and artificial marshes to store and clean water for later release into the everglades during the dry season the agency the south florida water management district had been under mounting pressure to kill the deal florida crystals , another big and politically connected sugar company , lobbied ferociously against the deal with its rival some environmentalists complained that mr crist paid too much and that the cost of the deal would crowd out other restoration projects but some of those projects a string of underground storage wells , for instance made little sense to begin with and none are as important as the land deal the payout to united states sugar and some other aspects of the deal seem excessive but the agency can negotiate the price downward or cancel the arrangement if united states sugar refuses to bargain or if the economy keeps tanking and the deal becomes unaffordable what the taxpayers need to remember is that this is a very good deal for the environment without an ample supply of clean , fresh water , the everglades will never be restored to anything approaching their former vitality there is no shortage of rainfall in florida what s in short supply is places to store it during the rainy season when lake okeechobee overflows , places from which the water can be released when it is needed during the dry season to nourish wildlife , prevent catastrophic fire and provide clean water to florida bay far more will have to happen to restore the water flows that once sustained the everglades but the united states sugar lands are a critically important first step
when kristyna pliskova of the czech republic takes the court for saturday s girls final at wimbledon , she needn t look beyond her own family for inspiration her twin sister , karolina , has already captured one of the four 2010 junior slams the australian girls championship so kristyna has access to advice from a player who knows exactly what she s facing karolina defeated the british teen laura robson in the australian final , but at wimbledon , kristyna will face no 10 seeded sachie ishizu of japan instead in friday s semifinal , ishizu surprised robson , the 2008 wimbledon girls champion , 75 , 76 \( 5 \) pliskova , the ninth seed , advanced to the final with a 61 , 64 win over no 15 seed yulia putintseva of russia after needing three sets , the last of which ended 97 , to down the unseeded american sloane stephens in the quarterfinals pliskova , an 18yearold lefthander , won last week s junior warmup tournament at roehampton , so her winning streak on grass has now reached 11 matches ishizu , who turns 18 in september , did not play roehampton , but her confidence is high , having won a tournament title last month on the international tennis federation s women s circuit pliskova and ishizu met recently , with pliskova taking a 60 , 63 decision in the semifinals of a 50 , 000 itf women s tournament in japan , a tournament pliskova won with a victory over her sister in the final in the boys final , scheduled for sunday , the qualifier ben mitchell of australia will meet no 13 seed marton fucsovics of hungary australia had high hopes for a title heading into the tournament , but the top seed jason kubler or no 8 seed james duckworth were considered the more likely contenders yet in a repeat of last year , when the american jordan cox qualified and advanced all the way to the final , the 17yearold mitchell has found his form at precisely the right time after dismissing unseeded oliver golding of britain in the semifinals , mitchell earned an opportunity to avenge his australian open quarterfinal loss to fucsovics , a defeat that saw him win only three games fucsovics , 18 , has not lost a set in his five wins this week particularly impressive was his straightset semifinal victory over unseeded facundo arguello of argentina , a finalist last week at roehampton none of the four finalists has played in a junior slam championship match before , but australia , japan and the czech republic have all had wimbledon junior singles winners should fucsovics triumph on sunday , he would be the first hungarian boy to capture singles title at a junior slam
cj chivers is answering your questions about his book , the gun the most recent questions and answers appear at the top of this post in the past you ve blogged about the extraordinary variety of ammunition found amongst insurgents such as the taliban have your studies of the ak47 taught you anything about the complex logistics that must be necessary to keep all those millions of rifles wellstocked with bullets \? john a john , your question goes to one of the reasons the kalashnikov has been as influential as it has been in order for the rifles to have the effects that they have , they need ammunition and automatic rifles , especially in the hands of the marginally trained irregular fighters who often carry kalashnikovs , consume a lot of ammunition this means that new supply is necessary for any force that hopes to have success , much less longevity those who fielded kalashnikovs understood this beginning in the 1950s , as the kalashnikov moved about the globe , ammunition plants tooled up to keep it fed many of the plants were in the soviet union many more were not by the late 1950s , for one example , technical intelligence specialists in the united states military were examining 762 39 millimeter ammunition that was being manufactured outside the eastern bloc , including in egypt , where the ammunition was soon used in wars against the israel defense forces and in terrorist acts against israeli civilians in vietnam in the 1960s , ammunition of chinese provenance was common and the technology spread further to the balkans , to cuba , to several plants in africa , to finland , to elsewhere in the middle east , to the united states the output of some plants was extraordinary , and stockpiles were amassed that would be made available after the cold war , at often at remarkably inexpensive wholesale prices , to graymarket and blackmarket buyers a few years ago , when we were examining the activities of aey inc , a firm that was buying surplus kalashnikov ammunition from albania and flipping it to the pentagon , the documents and interviews from tirana , the albanian capital , showed that albania was selling its excess stock for as little as 22 cents a round \( this is an amazingly low price , as anyone who has bought ammunition during the last few years in the united states knows \) the albanian ammunition was several decades old , and not ideal but for an insurgent group , or government hoping to gather ammunition on the cheap \? it was available to arm a force and a large number of charter cargo airlines that you likely have never heard of are available to move that ammunition to destinations in asia and africa this is a glimpse at the logistics system you mention the last part of your post reminds me of i always get a kick out of that mike a mike , that s priceless next week i m going to put it up on my personal blog , and i have already passed it around what else do you have \? this lighter moment gives me a chance to mention something many of these questions have been technical , or deal with distinct historical questions i enjoy these questions very much , and will answer them but those of you who are not as interested in the technical aspects of firearms , or details of their development and origins , don t think that this is the how the book the gun is constructed , because it is not the book does cover technical aspects of arms design , but in layman s terms , and briefly it focuses much more on people , and on how war changed as technology changed and governments adapted to it , either well or poorly the book tells stories the stories have a purpose , yes but they are stories with characters and scenes and action the gun is not a technical treatise , though again , it presents enough technical information for the stories to make sense now back to the readers questions 60 , 000plus dead in the 7year vietnam war \? what proportion due to the ak47 \? that s how effective it was popsiq a dear popsiq , i will answer this one later , likely next week , when i get back to my collection of records at home it s a good enough question that it deserves it s own separate post as an answer let me get to work on that the book looks excellent i look forward to reading it after the fall of the soviet union i purchased two sks 762mm semi automatic rifles that were made in the soviet union in 1953 they are excellent guns , rarely jam and were quite cheap what was the impact of the sks on the ak47 from a soviet export perspective \? did the soviets try to export the sks in conjunction with the ak47 \? did they view the guns as complementing one and other \? do you know roughly the number of sks s that were produced in the soviet union compared to ak47 s \? thanks ml a ml , i owned an sks , too , though mine was chinese i think i paid 105 for it in the late 1980s or early 1990s , when i was still in the marines that was the price for a new rifle in its packing grease i wanted to use it for deer hunting but frankly , after firing it several times , i was so unimpressed with its accuracy that i opted not to carry it as a hunting rifle , even if i installed optics to use instead of the rifle s very basic sights considering the better choices available , and the ethics of wanting to kill cleanly any animal to be harvested , i could not justify using it for hunting but you are right , the gun was in other respects a sturdy and functional design sergei g simonov , its designer , had settled on a layout that was reliable and easy to care for to your question the sks and the ak line did not seem to be regarded as complementary within soviet armsdesign circles the historical sequence shows that in 1943 the soviet union developed the m1943 cartridge , which was roughly midway in size and power between the military rifle and pistol cartridges of the time \( this is the 762 39 millimeter ammunition this blog has referred to many times it is conceptual knockoff of the intermediate german cartridge , the 792 kurz the thinking behind mediumpowered ammunition and modern assault rifles first realized a massproduced form in germany , and the ussr , ever adept at intelligence , used captured german arms as the basis for copying the underlying ideas \) once the m1943 round was available within soviet armsdesign circles , the next step was to develop rifles to fire it the sks was the first design to be accepted but the red army was not fully satisfied with the sks , and no sooner had it arrived than the army invested the intellectual and material resources to replace it the issue was not accuracy , but worries over the sks s versatility and firepower the sks is a semiautomatic , not automatic , rifle the army wanted to develop a much different rifle that , via the shooter adjusting a switch , could fire either semiautomatically \( the rifle will fire one shot for each trigger pull \) or automatically \( the rifle will continue firing as long as the trigger is held back and ammunition is supplied \) by late 1945 , the armydirected contest for this new rifle was well underway the result , announced in early 1948 after the evaluators winnowed down the competing design teams prototypes , was the ak47 were the two weapons complementary \? within the soviet union and its warsaw pact vassals , the evidence suggests that they were not the kalashnikov became the generalissue arm , and the sks did not see nearly as wide distribution it had a more robust run in china , to which in the mid1950s the kremlin passed the technology for the m1943 cartridge and the sks and ak47 that said , the sks still has a place in the postsoviet world it is sometimes seen in battle to this day \( it turns up occasionally in taliban weapons caches , for instance \) and curiously , it is carried by russian soldiers on ceremonial duty i ve seen it with whitegloved honor guards at the kremlin and on red square , and it is often in the hands of the soldiers assigned to state functions attended by president dmitri a medvedev or prime minister vladimir v putin i would venture that this rifle , which i suppose i will always think of as a hundreddollar gun , will have a long public life in the same country that was never quite committed to it , and immediately ordered its replacement the decision that yielded the kalashnikov , the world s most abundant gun do you believe any other weapon will replace the seeming omnipresence of the ak47 \? it seems like the conditions that made the production of so many kalashnikovs possible may not happen again andrew s a dear andrew , i agree with you the peculiar circumstances of the kalashnikov s production all but ensure that no weapon will unseat it as the world s most abundant firearm its roots in planned economies , where the ak47 and its descendants were made in enormous quantities no matter whether anyone actually wanted them , or paid for them , resulted in the outsized stockpiles that have supplied wars since most objects are not manufactured this way normal market forces don t allow for that kind of industrial behavior when a factory has to pay its workers full salaries , and make good on its electric and tax bills , and buy the steel , it doesn t spend years filling crates with products that no customer has ordered since the eastern bloc disintegrated , the newer pattern is well established most markets are saturated with the older kalashnikovs , which still work just fine many of the arms plants that once churned out the rifles have few if any orders they have struggled to keep their assembly lines open at even low production levels , and some of the plants have been shuttered the kalashnikov achieved battlefield primacy through not just its technical characteristics but through the subsidies of the economic and political system that directed its manufacture that system is mostly gone it s hard to imagine any other weapon catching up to what it left behind i hope at least some lip service is paid to the difference in national ideas about firearms from the beginning , america has held marksmanship to be part of its national identity the kentucky rifle , actually a pennsylvania export , allowed us to shoot further and straighter our much vaunted eschewing of ordered ranks of soldiers producing volley fire in favor of hidden scattered triggerpullers was only imaginable by dint of superior weaponry bearing sights \( even though we eventually had to field our own neatly arrayed linear forces to become more than a nuisance on the battlefield \) american rifles were always designed as a tool of the individual marksman , to hypothetically put a bullet where it was needed with each squeeze of the trigger the springfield 06 , a knockoff of the mauser , is a great example of american thought process in weapon design as was its replacement the garand with rifles like those marines were taught to put their shots in the target centers to earn their beer money russians , on the other hand , didn t have that kind of national heritage what they had were lots and lots of unmechanically inclined peasants and continual urgent needs for manpower consequently , the ppsh , a crude short ranged automatic weapon , became the symbol of communist power following wwii until it was replaced by the hugely improved ak47 in neither case was the marksman expected to achieve one hit per trigger squeeze just look at the safeties coming off the safe position in an american m16 series the switch is on single shot in an ak series the shooter is set on automatic the ak is a great gun , but it ain t perfect then again , the russ has been known to say , better is the enemy of good enough observer57 a dear observer57 , you re right about the ppsh , about american notions of american marksmanship , and about the first position of the selector levers on the m16 vs the ak and yes , the gun does cover the american ideas of american marksmanship and the notion of eagleeyed , flatshooting , farreaching infantryman that informed the army and marine corps s choices in rifle development before and after world war ii , the period when hitler s germany and then stalin s soviet union developed the mediumpowered , shorter range assault rifles that became a new standard every rifle , is of course , a set of design compromises there is no such thing as a perfect rifle , and there never will be the ak , as you say , ain t perfect no matter its ample publicity i d quibble with one point it was not only in the soviet union , with its legions of conscripts , where trainers did not expect soldiers to achieve , as you wrote , one hit per trigger squeeze once submachine guns , lighterweight machine guns and a range of bulky automatic rifles became widely distributed , many militaries adopted the practice of using suppressive fire to fix an enemy in place and allow for other soldiers to maneuver against or around them the united states army was one of these militaries and as the tactic entered widespread use , the ideas behind \( and the habits of \) rifle fighting sharply changed , even if it took a while for the brass to realize it what do you think of the initiative by the us to arm afghan security forces with m16s \? rubberducky a rubberducky , are you a mind reader \? we could do entire articles about this , and actually have one in the works the short of it is that conversion of the afghan security forces from eastern bloc small arms to natostandard small arms is already under way for for the afghan national army kalashnikovs are being collected , and m16s are being issued , along with m249 squad automatic weapons , m240 machine guns and m203 grenade launchers there has been internal discussion in kabul and washington of replacing the afghan national police force s kalashnikovs with m16s , but as yet that decision has not been made there are merits and risks to either course , and money is factor as well at present , in this state of current flux , what is clear is this the smallarms distribution for afghan forces has been badly bungled in many different ways over the past decade , and one result is that there is a good bit of disharmony between weapons out there but at last there are people working thoughtfully on these issues , and maybe it will get better i don t have a position on whether the m16 or the kalashnikov would be a better choice for the afghan army and police that gets into a perennial argument both weapons have their pros and cons there would be one benefit to a full conversion to m16s if the american military did that , then the ammunition used by its afghan allies would not fit in the taliban s kalashnikovs , and maybe american troops on patrol would not be getting shot at as often by ammunition their government has purchased , and issued to the afghan forces , only to have it turn up later in taliban hands we ve covered a lot of this here in the past , and i ll write more about all of this later thank you for an excellent question i would question the use of outgunned yes it does seem to have been the volkswagen of small arms , but doesn t that imply that it s generally being used on both sides of most wars \? deadrodentyping a dear deadrodentyping , that reference was in a specific context the experience of american soldiers in vietnam in the early and mid1960s this was the judgment of the pentagon , which realized , as it sent troops into the deltas and jungles with m14s to face vietcong guerrillas and north vietnamese army regulars with automatic kalashnikovs , that its troops were being outgunned simulations in the united states confirmed this and this is why the early m16 was rushed from prototype phases \( as the ar15 \) into mass production and distribution , to disastrous early results when are you doing a book signing in detroit lakes minn or fargo nd jc a excuse me while we take a break for a moment and so i can engage in this important side conversation jc is my cousin , jack chivers , who wants me to visit i ll answer him here jack \? right now simon and schuster has nothing scheduled for detroit lakes or for fargo if you think there s a good venue for me to do a visit , send the information to alexis welby she s doing the bookings absent a visit , can i mail you a free signed copy \? mr chivers , are you acquainted with or did you meet or interview the late col david hackworth , usa \? peter hine a dear peter , i know colonel hackworth s work when i was a marine he was widely read , and i read him further after i left the corps but no , i never met him mr chivers , in your material that i ve read in the nyt , it seems that while the proliferation of ak weapons is huge , there seems to be hardly any variants using the smaller 545mm cartridge \( ak74 , etc \) is this ammunition harder to obtain \? why is it used less often and what are seen as the pros and cons of this ammunition \? ldp a you ask a good question let s provide a little background for readers who don t what an ak74 is , and how it s different from the ak47 and its knockoffs first , we have to account for the manifest confusion that can be caused by the digits 47 and 74 each indicates the year , 1947 and 1974 , that the weapons were designed some people read the acronym ak74 and think it s just a typo in fact the ak74 is a different sovietera rifle it s derivative of the ak47 that shoots a smaller , faster round it also has other modest design changes , including a distinctly different muzzle it first saw combat use in the soviet war in afghanistan , where it was carried by many soviet troops osama bin laden has an affinity for one of its variants , which appeared in the first video he made after the attacks in the united states on september 11 , 2001 so why is it not as abundant as the other kalashnikov variants \? the reasons would seem to be many first is the matter of scale it has been in production in few factories , and for fewer years , than the other ak47 and its other direct descendants second is the matter of ammunition the ammunition it fires is made in fewer munitions plants and is not as widely available as the ever abundant 762 39 round use in the original items that said , the weapon is out there i very occasionally ok , rarely would be more like it see them in afghanistan , where they seem to have a certain martial cachet , which osama bin laden had tried to tap but when i lived in russia i saw them constantly , because they are a standard arm of the russian ministry of defense away from russia and the former soviet republics , they remain an unusual sight and probably always will as for the ammunition , the arguments within russian security \( and insurgent \) circles about the 545millimeter round vs the 762 millimeter round are as heated as the arguments in the west over the merits and pitfalls of the ammunition for m16s vs several possible heavier choices my question is about the early failures of the m16 in vietnam , which you write about they surprised me then , and do yet the 1st cavalry was the first division to arrive in vietnam armed with the 16 , starting in august 1965 , to the best of my fading memory officers and men of the 3rd brigade of the 1st , including then lieutenant colonel hal moore \( portrayed by mel gibson in the movie \) attributed their survival and victory in the ia drang valley over the north vietnamese and vietcong very largely to the m16 i recall moore arriving at an khe after the fight at lz xray and , holding an m16 above his head saying , shouting really , this is what gave us victory , or words to that effect if his battalion had experienced weapons failure at the same rate as the marines in 67 , of whom you eloquently write , there might not have been anyone left to pen a book about that battle and yes , we foolish americans really did think we were winning after the fight at lz xray a very small battalion of ours had given a much larger north vietnamese force a very bloody repulse i don t recall the kill ratio for that part of the battle , but overall it was 5 to 1 in our favor during an action that involved three us battalions and at least six battalions on the other side many in the latter force were armed with the chinese version of the ak47 after leaving the freedomloving republic of south vietnam , as lbj so fondly termed it , i was amazed to read about m16s failing both gis and marines in battle i still am what happened to the 16 between 65 and 67 \? was the survival and win by the 1st of the 7th cavalry a fluke \? or did something go wrong in the production cycle \? also , looking over some of your past postings , my jaw dropped when i saw a photo of the receiver of a chinese type 1956 their version of the ak47 the arsenal stamp is the number 66 in a triangle back in the day , it seemed that half the north vietnamese army was armed with 56s from china s state arsenal 66 , so many were picked up in the field i am astonished to see a 56 still on active duty in afghanistan it has certainly weathered the years better than i have , or as you say , better than anything in my house from that period take my 1963 dress blues for example i say take them , because the damned things have shrunk just hanging in the closet until they can t be worn it s a great disappointment to me , because when you paid eighty or a hundred bucks for something in 1963 , you expected it to last anyway , thanks for all your hard work and fine , well researched and written articles i hope to see many more , so take care phil a a thank you so much for this thoughtful post on the subject of the battle in the ia drang valley , you raise many questions i looked at closely as i wrote the gun colonel moore s comments , which you recall him saying in an khe after the fighting , align with remarks attributed to him by gen william westmoreland in his own memoirs years later in those memoirs \( a soldier reports \) , gen westmoreland described colonel moore s declaration as an influence in his own decision to demand more m16s for vietnam but the record gets cloudy from there years later , when moore wrote his own book about the same battle , coauthored with joseph galloway \( we were soldiers once and young \) , their account included many examples of m16s jamming or breaking during the fighting , and the triumphal declarations about the m16s role in the battle were absent how to square these two different assessments from the same man \? could it have been that at some time after the battle , when thengen moore had time and the means to interview his troops at length , he learned a fuller story than what he knew immediately after the fighting , when he would have relied more on firsthand observation \? i wondered myself about this i do not know the answer , or pretend to ultimately , via mr galloway , i reached out to gen moore , who is now very old , and asked him this question in writing i never heard back from him i , like you , am left to puzzle over how that one battle in 1965 was so different , at least in its initial accounts , from an accumulation of experience that was documented in 1966 and 1967 and well into 1968 i don t know the answer , and i would still value very much gen moore s reply i am a former marine rifle team member , who started his shooting career with an m1 , graduated to a m14 and blissfully never had to shoot the m16 in a match as captain of the state civilian rifle team , i spent one year dealing with its idiosyncrasies before moving on to a bolt action i once spent an inordinate amount of time investigating how the m16 came to be adopted , intending to write a book about it , which never materialized i hope you covered the story of corporate greed , incredible ignorance in high places and utter indifference to the welfare of the grunt on the ground in your book i look forward to reading it , and have already ordered it i was in basic school class 4 64 , arrived in rvn in june 1965 , and have pursued a career in competitive shooting that ended only four years ago , with the onset of arthritis i hope you ll let me buy a drink next time i m in nyc tailgunner a dear tailgunner , you wrote i once spent an inordinate amount of time investigating how the m16 came to be adopted , intending to write a book about it , which never materialized i hope you covered the story of corporate greed , incredible ignorance in high places and utter indifference to the welfare of the grunt on the ground in your book it s as if you read my mind an entire chapter in the gun covers exactly these things , and this chapter has been adapted as an article in esquire that will be on newsstands within a few days after you read the gun or the esquire adaptation , be back in touch and let me know if it lines up with your own experience and research , and with your understandably high expectations you can come back here and repost your review , or you can reach me directly at chivers nytimescom  by the way , as for basic school classes , you have me beat i was in d company in 1988 24 years after you if anyone s buying drinks , tailgunner , it s me i know at least one national flag has an ak47 pictured are there any other examples of weapons being national symbols on par with the ak47 \? steve a dear steve , commenter 11 , andrew s , offered one possible answer , although the machete is a tool that is not necessarily a weapon here is an image of the angolan flag i ll leave it to you to decide what you think the machete means the guatemalan flag includes a pair of crossed rifles , with bayonets affixed , as well as a pair of crossed swords and many nations incorporate arms in important ways into national seals , currency or anthems but none of these that i know of have as strong an association with a particular product , or brand , if you will , as the kalashnikov in the flag of mozambique the kalashnikov has worked its ways into the symbols of many groups , from youth activists in russian to jihadists in iraq i m on the road right now , and away from some of my records otherwise i could provide you with several images of insurgent groups that prominently display the kalashnikov line in their flags or seals in some cases these groups claim to be the spokespeople of their land we could also talk through some of the flags often said to carry the image of a kalashnikov i would argue , for example , that the flag of hezbollah has a kalashnikovlike image , but not a kalashnikov image the rifle has features of an ak47 but also a feature from another wellknown arm , the heckler koch g3 similarly , the logo of the red army faction , which many commentators said bore the image of an ak47 , actually displays an mp5 submachine gun does this matter \? it s maybe not especially important , aside from the fact that it demonstrates that much of the conversation that surrounds the kalashnikov line , the things many people think they know , is wrong , or at least not quite right this is a phenomenon i encountered again and again during my years of research i remember seeing in movies in the 1980s people using tape to attach another ammunition clip to the one in use so when one was finished , they just had to flip it over and the next was ready was that something people actually did , or was it just in the movies \? also , can you comment on why ak s outgunned m16s and what lessons american weapons makers learned from that experience and how that is manifested in today s american miliary rifles \? kris a kris , the commenter som from mumbai is right many fighters do tape a pair of magazines together with the hope of speeding up the time required to replace an empty magazine with a full magazine those who carry weapons professionally endlessly argue over the merits of this decision some people believe that the seconds potentially saved in this way would matter in a pitched fight others , and i would venture to say most others , see an unwise tradeoff having two full magazines instead of one adds weight and bulk to the rifle , making it harder to handle and potentially less effective , not more \( a heavier rifle , or a rifle out of balance , can be much less accurate , especially beyond very short ranges \) those who oppose this practice also say that adding weight to the magazine can cause the magazine to seat less snugly in the magazine well , and increase the likelihood of a misfeed , and cause the rifle to jam kingmonkey , another commenter , has provided a third reason not to do this i agree with him when i served in the marine corps , the noncommissioned officers in our battalion policed this habit , and did not allow it \( this as with the m16s , not kalashnikovs \) i occasionally but only occasionally see troops in afghanistan and iraq who do it nonetheless , either with a metal bracket or with tape the habit is much more common among less disciplined forces and forces without a professional , career class of noncommissioned officers and officers below are two photos i made in 2004 of chechens with their juryrigged dual magazines the first , with the magazines joined the bright blue tape , was in a mosque outside of grozny the other was a bodyguard of alu alkhanov , who was then the leading candidate for the chechen presidency look closely at that rifle and you will see it was offsafe , the guard has his finger on the trigger and the rifle had had its stock removed the previous chechen president , akhmad haji kadyrov , had been assassinated a few weeks before these were tense times , and the guard , standing in the doorway near the candidate , as ready to fight at very close range he had basically converted his kalashnikov to a weapon that could be used as a submachine gun at war has documented this habit among afghan insurgents , too who remove stocks to make their weapons more concealable
cleveland a panel of medical experts from the national institute on aging and the alzheimer s association last week including the use of socalled biomarkers , tests like pet brain scans and analyses of spinal fluids to promote early detection of the disease although these recommendations are well intentioned , evidence suggests that it would be a mistake to adopt them at this time to understand why , it s important to recognize what these tests mean , in what context the information will be used and what experience has shown us first , about the diagnostic tests a pet scan detects clumps of a deformed protein called amyloid beta , commonly known as plaques the presence of these plaques has been a gold standard of alzheimer s pathology since 1906 , when dr alois alzheimer first identified them in a patient however , we now know that roughly onethird of all elderly adults have such plaques in their brains yet function normally and eleven clinical trials , recently made public by a group of drug companies , that were aimed at reducing these plaques in alzheimer s patients all failed to show cognitive improvement , even when the brains were cleared of plaques thus , the presence of plaques cannot predict with any accuracy or specificity that an individual is going to acquire the disease and researchers are increasingly looking beyond the amyloid hypothesis for an adequate explanation for alzheimer s another test being recommended by the panel is spinal fluid analysis which measures the relative levels of two proteins , tau and amyloid beta this method does seem quite promising , but its predictive potential remains uncertain there are also practical issues to be considered , not least of all the high cost of these procedures what s more , the spinal tap procedure is not easy to perform and is painful to undergo , and it is a long way from becoming a routine diagnostic tool dr janis petzel , a geriatric psychiatrist in maine , in nonacademic , rural or nonwestern settings i pray that cerebrospinal fluid findings will never be part of diagnostic criteria for alzheimer s disease , she wrote the diagnostic tests themselves can carry a risk of side effects general imaging scans can expose patients to radiation , for instance an invasive spinal tap could result in infection or damage to tissue but there is also the psychological risk of false positives and misdiagnoses that greatly distress patients , at least until further tests show they do not have the disease this danger of overdiagnosis is very real , as the history of treatment for prostate cancer shows found that in the two decades after the test was introduced , prostate cancer was detected in more than 1 million additional men , many of whom were likely overtreated last , the most dreadful thing about alzheimer s disease , next to the slow deterioration of cognition , is that we do not yet have a cure and none seems to be on the horizon so , even if the new recommendations rendered the diagnosis earlier and unassailable , there is no therapeutic avenue to use this information to effectively treat the patient many individuals would simply prefer to be spared the emotional trauma of a diagnosis if no treatment exists taken together , these reasons suggest that the panel s recommendations are likely to increase the emotional burden on individuals and the financial burden on society without providing proportional benefits the doctor s most basic tenet is that of primum non nocere first , do no harm until we have a more definite idea about what causes alzheimer s , earlydetection tests may do patients more harm than good
los angeles cast the bait , spinning into the shadow of chicago s taj gibson and giving him a clear path to the rim as gibson gathered the ball , artest pounced , slapping it from gibson s hands , off his chest and out of bounds artest flaunted his defensive versatility against the bulls last month he guarded gibson , a power forward , point guard derrick rose and small forward luol deng his teammate lamar odom has seen the maneuver that worked on gibson succeed over a lifetime not too many guys have defensive moves , and ron is one of those guys who has a patented defensive move , said odom , who played with artest when they were youngsters in new york that s almost like his bait let guys take a dribble by for someone who s so physical , that s a finesse defensive move for all of artest s eccentricities this season , including raffling his championship ring for charity , announcing his intentions to play in the nfl once his basketball career ends , debating donating his season s salary to charity and drawing kobe bryant s ire on offense , he seldom wavers from being a defensive stalwart , despite sometimes being the square in the lakers' triangle offense in an era in which rules favor scoring and some players dismiss their defensive responsibilities , artest takes pride in them despite a recent bump , the lakers , who play the nets in newark on sunday , remain a favorite to land in the nba finals for the fourth consecutive time artest will again be their , guarding the likes of kevin durant , paul pierce and lebron james i feel like i have a chance against anybody , even now , when i'm older , artest , 30 , said when i was younger , a lot of these guys would n't have no chance defensively , artest is like a mad scientist he gets results even if his formula is difficult to replicate artest , who is 6 feet 7 inches and 260 pounds , has ranked among the top isolation defenders each year during a threeseason analysis by , which catalogs every nba game last season , he ranked in the top 7 percent by limiting his opponents to 077 points per possession through thursday , he was allowing 079 points per possession and opponents were shooting 394 percent , a notch up from last season s 36 percent , according to synergy you can put ron on an island with a good offensive player , and he 'll hold his ground more often than not , said fran fraschilla , artest s coach at st john s only a handful of players are in that category but artest is an individual in his defensive methods when artest played in houston , he marveled at shane battier s studious methods but when battier tried to share his analytics , artest usually turned him away before games , artest stretches and shoots but does not perform defensive drills i guess i'm too overconfident in my defense , he said he never watches game film none , he said , his voice tinged with laughter and pride i 've seen every move already , artest added i 've seen every move in new york city i 've seen all the ins and outs and things like last year , tyreke evans hit me with , it was an inandout spin and i was like , ok , that probably wo n't happen again' artest s father , ron sr , is a former boxer who is built like a linebacker when defending , artest imagines he is in the ring i'm in and out with the ball , just like how a boxer would be in and out , artest said jab , jab , jab , cut off that and a bunch of other stuff going through my brain when i'm playing artest credits his father for his quick hands his catcher s mitt , lakers forward matt barnes said portland guard brandon roy trained himself to remember to watch for artest after he passed him roy also noticed artest s mindset artest used to take it personally when an opponent scored on him now , artest talks about solving the equation for the next time roy said some guys are like , all right , ' and you can see it on their face , this guy is killing me' he s never showed a sign that somebody s killing him every time , he s coming back he s got that same look he understands when to be physical , off the ball , he s always laying on you he s wrestling he knows how to wear you down artest breaks the game down into simple geometry a math major at st john s , he used to measure his shots on the court in practice he would shoot and try to make the ball start its descent exactly halfway to the basket artest said there are certain times where , if you 're dribbling the basketball with your right hand and in a certain way and your body is in a different area , i know there s only two or three moves you can do and i know i'm going to make you do the move i want you to do tim floyd , artest s first nba coach with the bulls , recalled that a veteran player told artest that there was no need to volunteer his body to guarding the best players , that he would never earn a large paycheck doing so luckily , he learned that was n't the case , floyd said he felt like he could make a great career by doing that a lot better than how others did that job neither fraschilla nor floyd will take credit for artest s game when he was young , artest recalled , he took joy in watching point guard play lockdown defense he said , that s where it started at fraschilla said that toughness and grit has always been with him it s exactly what got him into trouble coming into the league but you ca n't tunnel it he would n't be the same type of player last season s playoffs showcased artest s defensive diversity in the first round , he guarded oklahoma city s durant , who shot 35 percent and averaged 25 points , more than 5 points below his season average he s a tough guy to go up against , said durant , who had trouble performing his patented offensive move against artest durant is able to draw fouls by swinging the ball between him and the defender as he prepares to shoot most times , artest will move his hand before making contact , forcing durant into an awkward shot you 're only going to catch me with that so many times , artest said most likely if you do that , i'm going to hit the ball most likely if you do that , the ball s already gone he added sometimes , you can get me because i'm all on your body it s not a foul , but the ref may call it a foul but most times , you ca n't get me with that move in the , he defended boston s pierce before a couple of games , artest acknowledged , he was drained from overtraining in game 3 , artest scored 2 points in game 7 , he scored 20 artest said he could not care less about scoring nevertheless , he said he would taper his workouts as the playoffs neared my defense is going to be whew ! artest said if people did n't see me this year , my defense is like roy jones in his prime right now
one of the great tragedies of the developing world is the number of women who die in pregnancy and childbirth but what is that number \? several studies had put it at somewhat more than 500 , 000 a year , while a new and apparently more rigorous study suggests that it has dropped to less than 350 , 000 a year this is an issue that i ve written about a great deal over the years , and so i was delighted by the good news and also delighted that the times treated it as a major story indeed , the article about this breakthrough was the lead news story \( the article on the top right of the front page is the lead article , because it s thought that that is where people start reading \) i should quickly add that i have nothing to do with such news decisions we in the opinion world of the times are completely removed from news decisions but one of the reasons maternal mortality has never gotten much traction or donor interest is that it has never been treated as very newsworthy in recent years , there has been a bit of change in that , and my hope is that we in the news business will treat maternal health and global health issues generally as important news because of the numbers involved that will make a real difference in getting these problems addressed one caveat is that none of the numbers are reliable when women die in childbirth in poor countries , nobody keeps track , and so all these figures are very rough estimates a few years ago , honduras was considered an example of a country that had managed to cut its maternal mortality rate through hard work , and i and others cited it as a model then a new world health organization study came out in 2007 and suggested that maternal mortality had actually risen in honduras over the previous decade i got on the phone and called around , trying to make sense of this and what i learned was that no one really has any idea how many women die in childbirth in honduras and the same is even more true of nigeria still the new figures of just under 350 , 000 deaths per year are based on more data and are probably as good as any some activists were alarmed , fearing that if the report was publicized that would discourage donors and make people think that they didn t need to worry about maternal health i think that view is mistaken indeed , i think this report is good news for those who want to cut maternal deaths and here s why one of the mistakes humanitarians sometimes make , i believe , is to emphasize all the things that go wrong the result is that people are sometimes turned off , and that problems seem intractable if maternal mortality has remained constant for a quartercentury \( as we thought \) , then who wants to take up the cause \? my sense is that people want to be part of something hopeful , something that manifestly can be changed and made better and that s what the new study confirms there is hope in reducing deaths in childbirth , and more resources can make the toll drop even more we know what to do , we just need to do it better the basic reason so many women die in childbirth is simply that they don t matter in their societies they are the most voiceless , most marginalized people in their societies , and so resources aren t expended keeping them alive there s a strong correlation between societies where women are repressed and those with very high maternal mortality rates \( indeed , in afghanistan some years ago i came across the highest lifetime maternal mortality risk ever 50 percent , meaning a woman in one particular region had a 5050 chance of dying in childbirth at some point in her life \) today in niger , a woman has a 1in7 chance of dying in childbirth at some point in her life , partly because if her husband is off working hundreds of miles away , it s often considered inappropriate to take her to a hospital if she s in obstructed labor she s not supposed to leave the house without her husband s permission and so she dies it was always clear that we could do better on maternal mortality , and thank god that is now finally happening
bangkok dancing jubilantly in the streets to the beats of blaring pop and country music , antigovernment demonstrators on sunday defied calls by the government to disperse from bangkok s affluent commercial hub in a major escalation of three weeks of mass demonstrations there s not a jail big enough to fit us all , said nitipong , a protester who stood beside one of hundreds of pickup trucks blocking one of the country s busiest intersections on saturday , the protesters surrounded the national police headquarters , the four seasons , hyatt , intercontinental and other hotels and six major shopping malls , which are connected by an elevated skywalk and together have five times the floor space of the mall of america , the famed shopping center outside of minneapolis the provocative move to shut down the area infuriated many bangkok residents and elevated what was major annoyance for the thai government to a fullblown national crisis the protesters , known as the red shirts , are demanding that the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva call new elections but some of the protesters , who are largely from thailand s rural hinterland , also said they were trying to prove a point by blocking such an economically important part of bangkok 15 months ago , their archrivals , the generally more wellheeled protesters known as the yellow shirts , blockaded bangkok s two international airports for a week , stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers none of the yellow shirts have been convicted for shutting down the airport , including kasit piromya , the current foreign minister who took part and reportedly said the protest was a lot of fun after four years of political turmoil in thailand , including a military coup and three other changes of government , political movements are engaging in a kind of streetprotest brinkmanship , each staging their own variations of publicityseeking mass demonstration analysts say the demonstrations are a reflection of the failure of the parliamentary system to repair the fractures in thai society since the administration of thaksin shinawatra , the former prime minister removed in the 2006 military coup redshirted protesters on sunday said they were on the street because their voices had been squelched by the coup and two court decisions that removed prime ministers that represented their interests one former prime minister , the late samak sundaravej , an ally of mr thaksin , was removed from office two years ago because he received income from a cooking show , which judges ruled violated the constitution among the protesters sunday was samai suporn , a 50yearold rice farmer from northeastern thailand , who said she had come to bangkok for the protest because she remained upset at the coup we 're here for a long time , she said of the protest until they dissolve parliament she came with 10 other people in a pickup truck still caked with the red dirt of rural thailand and has never been inside the shopping malls that surrounded her protest leaders have portrayed the current political troubles in thailand as rich versus poor , but mrs samai , who clears the equivalent of only 300 a year from her small rice farm and fruit orchard , said she had nothing against the rich there are good and bad people among the rich and the poor , she said i'm not jealous of the rich she says she is upset at the government , especially because news reports on government television stations play down the strength of the redshirt movement although many people at the rally appeared to be from rural areas , there was also a sizable contingent of bangkok residents mr nitipong sells computer equipment and is a graduate of thammasat , a prestigious university in bangkok another woman , nan , is a chemist who has a master s degree from chulalongkorn , another prestigious university both declined to give their full names , underlining the fear by some protesters , despite their defiant words , that the government could follow through with its threat to arrest them mr abhisit , who is under pressure to end the protests , said sunday that he would proceed cautiously i want to tell those people who suggest that the government deal with the demonstrators decisively that , supposing we do , a riot could take place , and there would be losses mr abhisit vowed legal proceedings and prosecution for anyone who broke the law the government over the weekend said that anyone who did not leave the area would be subject to a year s imprisonment , but it did not detail how it would force the protesters to leave

that s it for tonight one incumbent , senator arlen specter , lost in a tough primary against representative joe sestak , who surged in the last few weeks the outcome in pennsylvania ended the fiveterm senate career of mr specter , who switched parties last year to avoid what he believed was a certain defeat as a republican senator blanche lincoln of arkansas faced an uphill battle against the popular lieutenant governor , bill halter neither reached the 50percentage threshold , so they ll got to a runoff on june 8 from shaila dewan at her brightly lit election night party at the holiday inn presidential , ms lincoln addressed the crowd and proposed a couple of ground rules for the threeweek runoff i want to call on bill halter to end all of his negative ads , and i will too , she said we also need to call on every one of these outside groups to take their negative ads down and go home we need to make this campaign about arkansas and the people of arkansas and who we are and what we believe in labor unions and other independent groups have spent millions of dollars on the races in arkansas and in kentucky , the republican primary went to rand paul , the tea party candidate , a victory that will certainly be mined for street party credentials across the country as republicans face intraparty strife neither democratic candidate , senator blanche lincoln or lt gov bill halter , reached the 50 percent threshold in the democratic primary in arkansas that means they ll face each other again in a runoff election on june 8 from shaila dewan we proved that 11 weeks of a campaign can top 11 years of incumbency , mr halter said to a packed crowd that included union workers and sierra club environmentalists today we put the political insiders and the special interest on the ropes , and in three weeks we re gong to knock them out though mr , halter appears to have been the candidate to benefit the most from the millions of dollars poured into the race by outside groups , ms lincoln far outraised him in traditional campaign fundraising today you proved that your votes and not their money are going to determine the future of arkansas , he said this is what democracy looks like , representative joe sestak says in his victory speech , touting his win over the establishment and over washington dc michael steele , the chairman of the republican national committee , didn t hold back in interpreting senator specter s loss in pennsylvania as a dire warning for democrats in november arlen specter s defeat tonight is yet another blow to president obama and his vaunted political operation like fellow democrats before him , arlen specter s loss should strike fear in the hearts of congressional democrats who choose to embrace the president s reckless liberal agenda despite the clear objections of their constituents because they thought the white house could bail them out now as he attempts to introduce himself to general election voters , joe sestak will have to bear the tremendous weight of having supported president obama s failed 862 billion stimulus and a massive government takeover of health care time after time , joe sestak has been a reliable vote for his democrat bosses in congress while his constituents at home are left without a voice kate phillips from carl hulse in a major bright spot for house democrats , the party retained the seat of the late representative john p murtha in southwestern pennsylvania , continuing a streak of wins in contested special elections and showing republicans that democrats will not easily give up control of the house though democrats dominate in the district , its voters are bluecollar conservatives and it is exactly the type of swing district carried by john mccain in 2008 that republicans must win if they are to reach their goal of taking control of the house in november tom davis , a former republican house member and top party campaign strategist , saw the win by democrat mark critz , a former aide to mr murtha , over republican tim burns as a serious blow to the republican claim to be within reach of the 40 seats needed to recapture the house if you can t win a seat that is trending republican in a year like this , then where is the wave \? asked mr davis , who said republicans will need to examine what went wrong it would be a huge upset not to win this seat democrats saw the win as a huge morale booster in the special election to replace longtime representative john p murtha of pennsylvania , mark critz , his longtime aide , appears to have won , according to early results mr critz defeated tim burns , a millionaire republican representative chris van hollen , the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee , said this was the only race in the country today where a democrat faced off against a republican and the results are clear mark critz focused on creating jobs for middle class families , while republicans practiced the politics of fear and distortion stay tuned a special election in hawaii will be held this saturday for the seat vacated by representative neil abercrombie from shaila dewan everyone is waiting on returns at preelectionnightparty cocktails on the back porch of sheila bronfman , longtime supporter of the clintons and little rock democratic activist , an assortment of political types reached a consensus senator blanche lincoln will squeak by , they predicted , without a runoff hours earlier , janine parry , a political scientist at the university of arkansas fayetteville , made a similar , cautious prediction she said that in the end , arkansas farmers would not want to give up the chairwoman of the agriculture committee , ms lincoln s powerful position , and that her recent proposal of a bill to curb derivative trading by wall street banks appealed to arkansans if arkansas is antianything , it s antibig institution , she said at the home of ms bronfman , a lincoln supporter , the soothsaying was equally timid no wagers were made things were pretty mellow at the bill halter watch party \( everyone in arkansas calls them watch parties , not victory parties , in what is perhaps a telling disdain for euphemism \) it was in the small arkansas room of the peabody hotel , overlooking the river stale chips , guacamole with no kick , chicken tenders a smattering of applause every time the television flashed the results , though at this early stage mr halter and senator blanche lincoln took turns taking the lead , while a third candidate , dc morrison , had a whopping 14 percent of the vote with three counties reporting from katharine q seelye mr specter just gave his concession speech it has been a great privilege to serve the people of pennsylvania , he said , and it s been a great privilege to be in the united states senate he looked emotionally drained and wrapped his speech up quickly after thanking several supporters by name i ll be working very , very hard for the people in the commonwealth in the coming months , he said , before leaving the stage he thanked president obama and gov ed rendell for their support the associated press has called the democratic senate race for representative joe sestak over senator arlen specter senator robert menendez , the chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee , issued this statement , even though establishment democrats hadn t supported mr sestak s challenge to the incumbent , senator arlen specter tonight pennsylvania democrats nominated joe sestak , a former naval officer who has proven he takes a back seat to nobody when it comes to shakingup washington and taking on the establishment joe , an energetic campaigner , has a compelling personal profile and a message of change that resonates with voters , especially in this political environment democrats enter the general election season with a number of advantages democrats enjoy a 14 percent party registration advantage , with 12 million more democrats than republicans four million new democrats registered in 2008 president obama carried pennsylvania by double digits governor rendell and senator casey remain wellliked with far less fanfare , republicans today nominated a former wall street executive who made his money trading derivatives while in congress , he not only racked up an extreme rightwing voting record , but he also championed freewheeling wall street practices after five years in the house of representatives , toomey led the wall street backed club for growth , advocating for corporate interests like the big banks , oil companies , and insurance companies while in congress , pat toomey racked up a voting record that would make rick santorum look moderate in fact , toomey has a 97 percent lifetime conservative rating from the american conservative union nine points higher than santorum s 88 percent for democrats in pennsylvania to be successful this november , we must be aggressive in framing the choice for voters democrat joe sestak is focused on creating jobs and the needs of the middle class , while pat toomey would do even more to protect the big banks , wall street , the oil companies and the insurance companies look no further than this week s debate over wall street reform for the difference between the two candidates joe sestak has already voted to hold the big banks accountable and pat toomey opposes common sense measures to reignin the big banks given that we cannot return to the failed economic policies of the past , the stakes for november could not be higher from katharine q seelye specter backers are very discouraged it doesn t look good for arlen , mr rendell said he blamed a low turnout in philadelphia while mr specter is ahead in philadelphia 21 , he said , the numbers do not appear to be strong enough to offset mr sestak s lead elsewhere the rain killed arlen , mr rendell said whatever chance he had went down with the rain the two were running even in the suburbs , but mr sestak was leading in pittsburgh and elsewhere from kate zernike rand paul made clear in his remarks that the celebration at the bowling green country club was a tea party party he declared himself a proud member of the movement , credited it for his victory , and dismissed speculation that he would have to abandon it to appeal to more moderate voters in the general election i have a message , a message from the tea party , a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words , he said we ve come to take our government back we ve come to take our government back from the special interests who think that the federal government is their own personal atm from the politicians who bring us oversized fake checks emblazoned with their signature as if it was their money to give washington is horribly broken , he said i think we stand on a precipice , we are encountering a day of reckoning and this movement , this tea party movement is a message to washington that we re unhappy and that we want things done differently the tea party movement is huge the mandate of our victory tonight is huge what you have done and what we are doing can transform america the tea party movement is about saving the country from a mountain of debt that is devouring our country and i think could lead to chaos , he said people say to me , what can one man do \? what can one senator do \? what i say to them is , it s more than just me , its you , it s a nationwide movement and what i say to washington is , watch out , here we come people are already saying now you need to weave and dodge , now you need to switch , now you need to give up your conservative message , you need to become a moderate , you need to give up the tea party , you need to distance yourself , he said , to which the crowd yelled no ! the tea party message is not a radical message , mr paul said it s not an extreme message what is extreme is a 2 trillion deficit that s what s extreme the tea party message , he said , calls for things that are widely popular among republicans , democrats and independents alike term limits , a constitutional amendment to balance the budget , requiring new legislation to identify which portion of the constitution authorizes it , and requiring members of congress to read every bill before voting on it who is opposed to them reading the bills \? he said is that an extreme idea to read the bills \? they tell me they want me to wait to buy a gun i tell them they need to wait to pass legislation people who focus only on the signs and the rallies of the tea party , mr paul suggested , miss its broad appeal and its impact people say other incumbents will lose tonight , other establishment figrures may lose tonight , but it wasn t the tea party that did it , he said what is going on , though , is that there is a movement among the country , that people don t like the arrogance , the arrogance of officialdom , the arrogance of power but , he warned , change would require compromise tough choices will have to occur , he said so many republicans have been elected and they say we ll cut your taxes but then we ll bring you home the pork it s coming to an end , because we can t manage this debt update mr paul said mr mcconnell had called him earlier in the evening to congratulate him and say that he would see him at the unity rally at republican party headquarters on saturday cnn s jessica yellin asked mr paul if the republican establishment should be worried tonight he laughed and nodded i mean it in a friendly way , when i say washington here we come , he said i don t mean it in a bellicose way from katharine q seelye in philadelphia half the precincts in pennsylvania have reported their results by now and the race could not be closer it is 5050 statewide in philadelphia , where 70 percent of precincts have reported , mr specter is ahead 6238 percent this is not as big of a lead as the specter camp had hoped results from the philadelphia suburbs are too slim to be meaningful , but in montgomery county , long a specter base of support , mr sestak is leading 5545 , but with just 17 percent of the vote in mr sestak is also leading in pittsburgh in kentucky , there was indeed another primary for the senate seat being vacated by senator jim bunning attorney general jack conway has defeated daniel mongiardo to become the democratic nominee , according to the latest call of the associated press so that sets up rand paul versus mr conway for the general election kate phillips from kate zernike in bowling green , ky ron paul was mobbed by supporters before he could depart the stage where his son had thanked supporters people asked him for autographs and told him that he was responsible for this victory , in the same way , one supporter said , that barry goldwater in the 1960s made ronald reagan s victory in 1980 possible reporters , too , wanted his take what message does this send to republicans \? they asked they ought to pay close attention to the grassroots , representative paul said when rand talks about the tea party movement it s the same as saying talking to the grassroots people , and get rid of the power people , the people who run the show , the poeple who think they re above everybody else , that s what the people are sick and tired of , that s the message should republicans be worried \? representative paul said that was not the word he would use i would think that they might gain an incentive to move in our direction toward freedom , toward limited government , toward the constitution just a note pat toomey , the former congressman and former head of club for growth , the antitax group , has of course won the republican nomination for senate in pennsylvania the democratic primary is still rolling in close results , but mr toomey will be a formidable opponent no matter which democrat pulls out the win tonight from shaila dewan in arkansas as the voting hours wended to a close , lt gov bill halter , refreshed after a 25hour campaign spree the night before , made an appearance at a precinct in hillcrest , a liberal enclave in little rock he seemed to be sandbagging his expectations for the results mr halter said that even if he did not win outright , putting senator blanche lincoln into a runoff would be a victory i think any reasonable political observer would say that when a twoterm incumbent senator and someone with 16 years of experience in washington is put into a runoff in her own party primary , that s a tough sign for the incumbent , he said then he reminded his audience that he had been running for only 11 weeks most folks when they run statewide , it takes them 11 months , he said some folks work two , three years to get together a statewide campaign just when mr halter was saying that ms lincoln s proposal to regulate derivative trading on wall street had come ten years too late , the senator strolled by with her husband and there she is ! he said ms lincoln replied , hey , bill , and , as if at a wedding reception , mentioned that she d just met her opponent s fatherinlaw mr halter asked , working hard \? ms lincoln agreed we re working hard mr halter said , all right good luck dr steve lincoln , ms lincoln s husband , interjected , yep thanks , and the couple moved on a news article on the rand paul win and what this means for the tea party activists from katharine q seelye in philadelphia the earliest returns from pennsylvania show nothing but they do indicate that it could be a long night here in the keystone state this will not be decided early , an official said polls closed at 8 o clock officials had initially thought that the light turnout would make the counting go fairly quickly , but that does not appear to be the case at this point , mr specter is leading in philadelphia by about 21 , officials said , but quickly cautioned not to read anything into that because so few precincts had reported their results similarly , in the lehigh valley , a swing area and home to mr toomey who will be the republican to beat in the fall mr sestak is slightly ahead mr specter is ahead by a tiny amount in the northeast part of the state , which includes scranton and wilkesbarre , but again , there is too little to go on at this point in his victory speech , rand paul said i have a message a message from the tea party a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words we have come to take our government back audit the fed ! one supporter yelled at paul headquarters from katharine q seelye in philadelphia mr sestak has set his primary night headquarters at the valley forge military academy and college in suburban philadelphia it may be best known to readers as the alma mater of the late jd salinger , who attended in the 1930s and who used it as a model for pencey prep , the school that holden caulfield runs away from in catcher in the rye the academy is located in mr sestak s congressional district , and it highlights his military background he was an admiral in the navy mr specter , by contrast , is gathering at a hotel in downtown philadelphia , a far more traditional venue mr specter lives in the city and it has long been his base of support the lion s share of votes in statewide elections usually comes from philadelphia , and that is especially the case in a democratic primary from kate zernike in bowling green , ky mr paul arrived at the country club to the booming sounds of the rush song he often quotes at rallies the canadian band , like mr paul and his father , is known for its libertarian view on the trail , he quoted a line from the song glittering prizes and endless compromises shatter the illusion of integrity saying equating the prizes and compromises to earmarks and backroom deals in washington his father , ron paul , walked with him onto the stage from kate zernike in bowling green , ky david adams , mr paul s campaign manager and the emcee of the first kentucky tea party in lexington in march 2009 , said today is a good day for the tea party , but it is not a great day the greatest days lie ahead we have a lot of work to do our budget is out of whack the debt is large and growing , and we have a lot of work to do the only thing we proved tonight is that we have the ability to do it richard viguerie , the guru of republican direct mail and now the chairman of conservativehqcom issued a very strong statement following mr paul s victory in kentucky if we had a parliamentary system of government , mcconnell would be expected to resign the elections results are a massive repudiation of mcconnell and the republican congressional leadership , which aggressively supported grayson coming on the heels of senator robert bennett s defeat in utah and the republican senatorial committee s previous support for charlie crist in florida , it is clear that many washington , dc gop leaders are enormously out of touch with the base of the republican party , grassroots conservatives the new conservatives who are being elected this year are different from the establishment types who went along with the big government policies of george w bush , tom delay , bill frist , and others the 2010 elections will be a tsunami of biblical proportions the voters are angry and frightened at the mess that politicians , as well as the leaders of most of america s major institutions , have made of our country recent election defeats of establishment republicans will cause congressional republicans to become more outspoken in their opposition to president obama s nominees and legislative agenda few , if any , republicans will risk being seen as working with nancy pelosi , harry reid , and other democrats kate phillips from katharine q seelye in philadelphia gov edward g rendell jr , of pennsylvania , who is one of senator arlen specter s strongest supporters , says that if mr specter loses tonight , the loss should not be interpreted as part of a national trend rather , he said , the race is a referendum on mr specter , who switched to the democratic party last year after almost three decades as a republican none of these results should be taken as meaning anything , the governor said in a chatty interview in his office here in center city late this afternoon as he mulled the ins and outs of a race that has grabbed national attention if it s about anything , it s about the difficulties of partyswitching he noted that mr specter and representative joe sestak , who is putting up a ferocious challenge , have voted the same way on almost every bill that has come before them in the last year for the stimulus package , for health care in fairness to arlen , mr rendell added , if the economy was ok and there was no antiincumbent wave , this wouldn t have been a close election people do know that arlen has done a lot for the state , even people who may not be voting for him as the polls close , mr rendell was not confident that his horse would win if mr specter pulls out a victory , he said , it would be in part because of the democratic state party organization and the organizations in philadelphia and pittsburgh in southeast pennsylvania , for example , he said , party workers reported during the day that voter turnout was exceptionally light so they got richard trumka , the former head of the coal miners union and a native of that area , to make some automated calls to urge people to go to the polls later reports from the region said turnout was inching up we ve got cars to take people to the polls , occasional babysitters and we have something as silly as ponchos , mr rendell said by that he means that when workers knock on doors and someone says they don t want to go out and vote in the rain , that person is given a poncho we say , ma am , come on out and vote and we ll give you this specter poncho and you can keep it ! he said there are about 6 , 000 specter ponchos being handed out in philadelphia but the low turnout has him down the turnout is terrible , he said he estimated that perhaps 25 percent of democrats in philadelphia would vote and perhaps 30 percent in the state , making that fairly low , even by primary standards that doesn t augur well for arlen , he said the most enthusiastic activists support mr sestak , according to the polls so a broader crosssection of voters could dilute those activist votes the wider the base , the better arlen does , he said the activists have never forgiven him for voting with george bush governor rendell credits the sestak campaign with a searing television commercial that showed former president bush endorsing mr specter that was a devastating ad , mr rendell said , giving kudos to the campaign group , the philadelphia political media firm headed by neil oxman it was answered , eventually , by a commercial from the specter campaign featuring president obama heaping praise on mr specter if the bush commercial was serve , and it was a great serve , the obama commercial was a good return , he said the sestak campaign defied the conventional wisdom that says mr sestak should have defined himself early to voters because he was relatively unknown instead , mr sestak focused chiefly on mr specter and saying that he switched parties to save one job his own it s only recently that the specter campaign , through surrogates like myself and mayor nutter , have fought back on the issue of arlen being a republican , mr rendell said when mr specter was a republican , he said , helped both republicans and democrats and his vote for the economic stimulus package actually created thousands of jobs , mr rendell said i would have made more of his courageous vote on the stimulus , mr rendell said at the same time , he thinks mr sestak made a mistake by refusing to say that he would endorse mr specter if mr sestak lost that matters to rank and file democrats , mr rendell said because even if they don t like either candidate , they want the party to hold on to the seat in november , he said , when the democratic nominee will face representative pat toomey if sestak isn t going to endorse specter , then that shows he doesn t care about holding the seat , he said from kate zernike in bowling green , ky trey grayson just called mr paul s campaign manager , david adams , to congratulate him on a race well run he said he ll say nice things about rand tonight , and he ll see us at the unity rally saturday , mr adams said , saying he sounded very sincere one of the mostwatched contests in the keystone state is the democratic primary between senator arlen specter , who switched parties and is seeking a sixth term , and representative joe sestak , who in recent weeks really moved into competitive territory tim kaine , the chairman of the democratic national committee , sees a possible window for his party in the gop primary win for rand paul in kentucky mr kaine released this statement , stinging senator mitch mcconnell , the minority leader from the state who had endorsed trey grayson , mr paul s republican opponent today , kentucky republicans selected rand paul as their senate nominee , handing senate minority leader mitch mcconnell a stunning loss in a show of weakness for the minority leader , and in a race that symbolized the fight over the heart and soul of the republican party , rand paul overcame mcconnell s handpicked candidate by a large margin unfortunately for republicans , ordinary americans are unlikely to be receptive to extreme candidates like rand paul in the general election this november rand paul s positions fail to resonate beyond the farright republican segment of the electorate that supported him tonight middleclass kentucky voters want to elect a senator with clear ideas about how to create jobs and opportunities for kentucky families but rand paul is more interested in talking about abolishing the department of education and disbanding the federal reserve than about supporting economic recovery as a result , democrats are now in a better position to win kentucky s open senate seat disenfranchised republicans and independentminded voters as well as longtime democrats will have a choice on the democratic side of a candidate who reflects the values and priorities of kentucky voters instead of one in rand paul whose ideas are outside of the political mainstream and which would do nothing to put kentuckians to work , help them send their kids to college or make health care more affordable  kate phillips the associated press is calling the republican senate primary in kentucky for rand paul , the tea party candidate who ran a fullthrottled campaign against trey grayson , the secretary of state cnn calls it that way , too from bowling green , kate zernike reports as the televisions announced that dr paul won , the crowd of supporters gathered around the patio fireplace at his victory party at the bowling green country club erupted into cheers the paul campaign has painted mr grayson as the very model of the country club republican referring to him in news releases by his full name , charles merwin grayson iii and mr grayson has been the more establishment candidate he was urged into the race by senator mitch mcconnell , the republican minority leader and the state s senior senator and his election strategy relied largely on traveling the state to meet with influential local leaders judges , hospital executives , bank presidents dr paul , meanwhile , favored tea party events outside places like ol harvey s eats in lawrenceburg but for its victory party , the paul campaign chose country club in bowling green , about two miles from dr paul s home with its lush grounds and a roaring fire in every room , it is a far cry from most tea party rallies the race between dr paul and mr grayson has been something of a proxy fight between the state s two sitting senators , mr mcconnell and jim bunning , both republicans mr mcconnell helped nudge mr bunning out of running for reelection , but not before ensuring that mr grayson , who has worked his way up through local politics since college , would run that was apparently before anyone sensed the rise of dr paul , which was fueled largely by tea party support and money flowing in through the online network from his father s 2008 presidential bid both senators withheld their official endorsements until the last weeks of the campaign with mr bunning coming out first , for dr paul , and mr mcconnell for mr grayson today , several of mr bunning s staff members were here working for dr paul mike reynard , his communications director , who had been holding signs and calling voters in northern kentucky , said that mr bunning had encouraged his staff to take vacation to come work for dr paul mr mcconnell , however , has been saying nice things about dr paul in the last couple of days and regardless of who wins , he has invited republicans to a unity event at state party headquarters this saturday , which should reveal whether or not the two sides can work together after a bitter campaign results are beginning to trickle in for the senate primary on the republican side between trey grayson and rand paul primary elections in three states today could offer some insights on the health of both political parties , a read on the tea party movement , the future of two wellknown incumbent senators and what might happen this november polls in arkansas , pennsylvania and kentucky are beginning to close \( but for those of you asking , there are no exit polls , so be wary of people trying to make early predictions from turnout patterns \) before the real numbers start rolling in , here are a few things that we are going to be looking at 1 in kentucky , can rand paul , the eye surgeon and son of representative ron paul , win the republican senate primary , and thus demonstrate just how much actual electoral power the tea party has \? mr paul is running explicitly as a tea party candidate and against trey grayson , the kentucky secretary of state it is hard to find a better example of the grassroots versus the republican establishment mr grayson has the support of senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the senate minority leader two democrats are fighting for the nomination there jack conway , the attorney general , and daniel mongiardo , the lieutenant governor these things are often hard to game out , but democrats and republicans argue that democrats would have a better chance should mr paul win the nomination , because he would probably have a tougher time appealing to moderate voters kate zernike sent in this take from bowling green , kentucky polls are still open for another 15 minutes in western kentucky , which is on central time , but with results coming in from just two counties in the eastern part of the state , rand paul s campaign is feeling confident it s not going to be close , said david adams , dr paul s hyperkinetic campaign manager , who was the emcee of the first kentucky tea party meeting last year it s going to go fast earlier today , ms zernike talked to voters at the polls 2 in pennsylvania , senator arlen specter , the republicanturned democrat , has found himself in a tough fight to win the democratic nomination to return to the senate against representative joe sestak mr specter has found it daunting to close the sale with democratic primary voters , who tend to be the more committed partisans and who remember all those years when mr specter was a republican , albeit a moderate one \( the incumbent senator wasn t helped by mr sestak s tv advertisement showing mr specter and former president george w bush campaigning together \) mr specter ended this campaign presenting himself as a powerful figure in the senate able to deliver for his state by doing that , he is running against one of the dominant forces in this primary day , which is antiincumbent fever \( an earlier post by katharine q seelye details the possible effects of rainy weather on the turnout in the state \) 3 \) in arkansas , senator blanche lincoln , a democrat , is facing a challenge on the left from bill halter , the lieutenant governor win or lose , ms lincoln is one of the top targets for republicans this fall the winner there needs to get 50 percent to avoid a runoff , so one thing to watch for , should no one win , is how far below 50 percent does ms lincoln place that may indicate how big of a hurdle she may have , if she wins a runoff in june , by november shaila dewan s earlier dispatch from arkansas noted the high number of early absentee voters 4 \) finally , people in washington love to look at early congressional elections as a test of what might happen in the november midterms , an exercise that often proves to be little more than a parlor room exercise still , in pennsylvania , the special election race to succeed the late representative john p murtha between mark critz , a democrat and longtime aide to mr murtha , and tim burns , the republican could offer a test of just how strong the political organizations are for both parties , and how much republican voters are engaged in congressional races

for the cincinnati reds , the last decade began with so much promise they were coming off a 96win season and had just added baseball s premier star , ken griffey jr , with a new ballpark starting to rise yet after a winning season in 2000 , the reds endured nine losing seasons in a row as a new decade dawns , that might be about to change walt jocketty , who helped build championship teams in oakland and st louis , has been the reds general manager for nearly two years , and his team may be ready to make a move my philosophy is you ve got to win with pitching , jocketty said last month in goodyear , ariz you win championships with pitching that s what s going to give us a chance to be competitive for a long time in johnny cueto , homer bailey , aroldis chapman , mike leake and travis wood , the reds are brimming with young rotation depth to go with the veterans bronson arroyo and aaron harang jocketty also added a new pitching coach in the wellrespected bryan price , who has also worked for seattle and arizona it may be asking too much for the reds to capture the national league central , a division the st louis cardinals have won six times in the last decade but with experienced everyday players like scott rolen , orlando cabrera , brandon phillips and ramon hernandez , cincinnati has a winnow atmosphere even if some skepticism remains we re definitely making a push , arroyo said if we re 12 games back by the allstar break this year , i definitely think the story will change but picking up orlando , getting hernandez back behind the plate , it definitely gives us a good opportunity to try to win the division the cardinals stand in their way after going 9171 last season to take the division by seven and a half games the new hitting coach mark mcgwire guides a fearsome middle of the order that includes albert pujols , matt holliday and ryan ludwick , while the gold glove catcher yadier molina steadies a rotation that features two starters chris carpenter and adam wainwright who had at least 17 victories with an earned run average under 300 the chicago cubs shed milton bradley after one exasperating season , replacing him in left field with a different m b from the texas rangers marlon byrd but the cubs are heavily righthanded with little team speed , and aramis ramirez , alfonso soriano and geovany soto must recover from injuries and underperformance to restore an offense that was the majors best in 2008 the pitchingpoor milwaukee brewers hung around for a while last season they were two games back on july 22 but never mounted a surge and finished 8082 they signed two veteran lefthanded starters randy wolf and doug davis and hired the innovative rick peterson to be their pitching coach with a staff that posted a 483 era last season , peterson will be challenged the houston astros \( 454 \) and the pittsburgh pirates \( 459 \) were not much better on the mound the astros have three reliable veterans in lance berkman , carlos lee and roy oswalt , and three emerging talents in michael bourn , hunter pence and wandy rodriguez but the rest of brad mills s roster is quite thin , and houston should battle the rebuilding pirates to avoid the division basement in the east , the philadelphia phillies will try to become the first team to win three consecutive nl pennants since the cardinals of 1942 to 1944 they need danys baez and jose contreras to stabilize a volatile bullpen whose closer , brad lidge , had elbow and knee operations after the world series the phillies will also hope for continued good luck in keeping their lineup intact according to research by bill james , the phillies eight openingday regulars played 1 , 145 games last season the most for any nl team in the last eight seasons the phillies main challenger will be the atlanta braves , who have a new wave of highimpact talent in manager bobby cox s farewell season the slugging jason heyward , 20 , was the offensive phenom of spring training , earning the rightfield job starter tommy hanson , 23 , is a star in the making , and another righthander , jair jurrjens , 24 , gets better every season three older righthanders derek lowe , tim hudson and kenshin kawakami will again make pitching the braves hallmark the mets envy such rotation depth as they count on the threesome of john maine , mike pelfrey and oliver perez , who staggered through a combined 60 starts last season by going 2022 with a 524 era all are healthy now , although none of them were particularly impressive in spring training a fast start for the team is crucial , or talk will turn to the job status of general manager omar minaya and manager jerry manuel by now , the phillies , the braves and the mets know better than to underestimate the florida marlins , who consistently do more with a smaller budget than any other team they have holes in their rotation , but they also have a legitimate ace in josh johnson , the league batting champion in hanley ramirez , the league rookie of the year in chris coghlan and the proven run producers jorge cantu and dan uggla there is less talent on the washington nationals , but there is a buzz about them because of the top pitching prospect stephen strasburg , who will start his professional career at class aa early on , strasburg will spend as much time crisscrossing pennsylvania as a candidate for state office for now , his first five starts will be spread among the cities of altoona , reading and harrisburg , where the nationals affiliate plays in the west , the colorado rockies seem to be back on course after a sluggish 2008 and a poor start in 2009 that led to the firing of manager clint hurdle his replacement , jim tracy , tapped the vast talent pool in the organization to capture the nl wild card before bowing to the phillies in four tight games few teams do as many things as well as the rockies , who will get a major boost if their former ace , jeff francis , returns to form after shoulder surgery the madeforhollywood divorce drama swirling around the los angeles dodgers owner , frank mccourt , will have minimal impact on a joe torre clubhouse after successive appearances in the championship series , the dodgers bigger concern is replacing wolf in the rotation the 22yearold lefthander clayton kershaw looks like an ace , at least , and the young offensive core of matt kemp , andre ethier and james loney is always dangerous in order of least to most reliable , the diamondbacks have three potential no 1 starters brandon webb , edwin jackson and dan haren webb , the 2006 nl cy young award winner , has had a bumpy comeback from shoulder surgery jackson was an allstar for detroit last season but slumped in the second half last season haren recorded 223 strikeouts the precise number that the arizona slugger mark reynolds had as a hitter , breaking the major league singleseason record he set in 2008 the giants rotation includes the twotime cy young winner tim lincecum , who signed a twoyear , 23 million contract extension in february , and the hardthrowing matt cain , who signed for three years and 2725 million in march it is a strong foundation for the giants , who hope that the lefthander jonathan sanchez , who has more strikeouts than innings in his fouryear career , can cut his walks and harness his talent sanchez fired a nohitter last season against the san diego padres , who are largely anonymous beyond first baseman adrian gonzalez , starter jon garland , closer heath bell and second baseman david eckstein the padres do have one

warwick , ri they 've been telling me since age 3 that i would die , tom cosgrove said quietly then age 6 , age 8 , age 10 now 20 , he is considered the longestliving person born with in his state , but every year has brought struggle as a toddler at a shelter for children infected with hiv from birth , he watched others die then , aids killed his mother and newborn brother at 8 , his body rejected medication and he became temporarily unable to walk he raged with anger , once even striking a teacher with a chair classmates , paranoid about his disease , refused to shake his hand or sit at his lunch table friends' parents forbade them to visit , and he could not join basketball teams or karate classes even now , medications impair his shortterm memory , making school , and job prospects , difficult we call them his stupid drugs , said barbara cosgrove , who adopted tom at 3 but , as i say to tom , you 're either stupid or you 're dead' at a time when hiv in the united states has become a manageable disease for many , tom cosgrove and others like him are proof of the epidemic s troubling , lingering legacy they are the survivors , born beginning in the 1990s to the first big wave of people with aids , babies practically destined to die improvements in drugs , along with some luck , allowed some 10 , 000 of them to live and these days only about 200 children a year are born with hiv , thanks to vigilant drug treatment of infected pregnant women but life for those first hiv babies now entering and adulthood has been a battle , and their experience is considered so significant not only in this country but also for the millions of hivpositive babies worldwide that federal health agencies have begun an extensive to follow these young people as they grow up some are weakened by years of yoyoing symptoms that early drugs failed to treat some have developmental delays or other problems related to having hiv at birth and their medications often have harsher side effects than those taken by people infected more recently as teenagers or adults because complications from their illness , or previous drugs they took and became resistant to , have made their disease more stubborn to treat emotionally , they grapple with hostility toward parents who infected them , grief that those parents suffered and usually died , and anxiety about trusting others with a secret that still provokes hazing and fear and a serious problem is emerging some are rebelling or asserting independence by skipping or stopping medication , which can make hiv spiral out of control and become impervious to previously effective therapies it ai n't over yet , dr ellen cooper , medical director of pediatric and adolescent hiv at boston medical center , said about keeping these young people alive and healthy although she has not lost a patient in five years , she said , i'm expecting a second wave of these young people dying because they 're not adherent to medication , or because of complications from treatment dr , chief of pediatric , adolescent and maternal aids at the , said that despite hiv babies' increased survival , their mortality is still thirtyfold higher than similarly aged children , and there is a lot of research that s needed , and interventions to improve their lives seven agencies of the are following 451 hiv babies ages 7 to 16 , monitoring their hearts , , bones , brains , hearing , sexual development , school performance , language ability , behavior and  preliminary findings show many of their current lifesaving drugs cause high cholesterol , raising fears of serious heart problems , said dr russell van dyke , the study s coprincipal investigator their bone density appears poor and many have mental health and behavioral problems , although it is unclear to what degree those problems are related to the disease or to the children s oftendifficult family circumstances there is a lot of concern , dr van dyke said , about how the kids adapt to living and what sort of challenges they have the lessons are going to be applicable to the rest of the world davi morales is the kind of young person doctors worry about he has hivrelated cognitive disabilities , and spent months homeless after uncles who raised him in a providence , ri , housing project returned to puerto rico davi , 20 , lost disability assistance because the government now considers most hivinfected people able to work , said scott mitchel , a counselor with , who got him into an apartment that his agency owns but davi has trouble staying employed , following rules , working with managers i do n't think right now he can go out there and support himself , mr mitchel said for one thing , his medication , five pills twice daily , causes severe and  nowadays , people contracting hiv through sex or drugs may take one easily tolerated pill , but the hivbaby generation often needs complex multipill doses with irritating side effects , making pillskipping more likely in desperation , doctors sometimes allow them to stop medication altogether rather than take their last rescue regimen poorly , dr cooper said davi sometimes skips several days , and when i feel down , like i just want to give up , i do n't want to take my medicine at all , he said if i did n't have that kid , i probably never would take them that kid is the son born three years ago after davi , who was 16 , told his girlfriend at the time , who was 14 , i want to have a kid and she was cool with it , he said i did n't really know what i was really doing she took medication during , and their son is uninfected her family , fearful of davi s disease , blocked access to the boy for a while , and the couple broke up he is facing assault charges for striking her during an argument , but now sees his son regularly he said he wants to stay alive , but maybe my lifespan is not as long as a normal lifespan i was born this way and that s what it is medication is not the problem for elizabeth eighteen , white , from a wealthy massachusetts suburb , she has been ostracized and tormented , hiv slut' being yelled across the hallway , anything you can think of , she said elizabeth did not know she had hiv until the age of 14 , when her parents and physician appeared at her therapist s appointment and told her i could n't speak or really breathe , said elizabeth , whose mother was infected through a blood transfusion before she was born elizabeth , who asked that her last name be withheld , said her mother wants me to be completely closed about it , and even elizabeth s little sister , who is uninfected , does not know keeping it inside feels like holding your breath underwater for too long but close friends she confided in betrayed her her best friend gossiped about it , and a boyfriend she broke up with told everyone to get back at me , she said schoolwork suffered as she constantly feared hazing and focused on having to deal with this at 16 , she told a new boyfriend , who promised that he 'd never judge me upon it , that he 'd never break up with me , that he 'd never tell anyone , she said the next day he broke up with me because of it they reunited , but his parents scorned her and he sometimes hid their relationship from friends , said elizabeth , who recently stopped seeing him she said people in her welleducated community , who should know that hiv can be well controlled with medication and protected against with , have been surprisingly intolerant there s no need to think i'm dirty , she said i 've basically had my trust for people completely taken away things get harder as hiv babies grow up and leave the very nurturing network of pediatric aids clinics and programs , said rena greifinger , who formed the to help such young people at 18 , all that support melts away , plus some of them have been completely rejected by their families , the leper child at a weeklong retreat at babson college in wellesley , mass , one love provided music therapy , roleplaying about disclosing hiv status , and explicit discussions about sex and having children when i was pregnant , i was crying all the time , worried she would be positive , said imani walters , 19 , who contracted hiv as a teenager her daughter turned out healthy then you get scared you might not see them grow up the young people were told that having infected children was unlikely with medication through pregnancy , avoiding and giving the babies medication for six weeks we wanted to give them so much information that we get that buyin to stay on their meds , and they learn how to live with hiv , said bill kubicek , executive director of , which sponsors one love and was cofounded by paul newman elizabeth met other hiv babies for the first time at the conference , and here i trust everyone , she said the gathering was eyeopening for sandy perez , 18 , from canaan , nh , too her mother , infected through drug use , died when sandy was 7 some foster families mistreated her , she said at one home , underfed , she slept in the laundry room , locked in , and would climb out the window and reenter the house through the garage to grab food although she now has a loving family and takes medication regularly , she has experienced serious symptoms sunken cheeks , gaunt face , bony arms medication has caused , and liver and kidney problems sandy rarely disclosed her hiv , not even to boyfriends , although she always used condoms but she said the conference inspired me to feel comfortable with myself and with having this hiv , so i can now share it with people that i feel i trust like her boyfriend of two years , with whom she had not had intercourse unable to reach him by phone from the conference , she texted him i have hiv he texted back are you serious \? she replied yes sandy felt relieved if he did not know and became infected , then there would be a part of me that felt responsible and guilty and just icky inside , she said soon after , the relationship ended , on good terms , she said he kind of did n't really know how to handle it , she said but he calmed down and we eventually talked and he was happy i had told him before we did anything when the cosgroves adopted tom , he was unruly and angry , and at 5 was further traumatized by seeing his mother turning different colors , losing her hair , dying of aids , he said he pasted her obituary on his first communion banner , and had , night sweats , he said , very mad at her because i thought she purposefully gave me this disease since people were petrified to take any of these children , ms cosgrove said , she adopted four other throwaway babies , saying she was abused as a child and kind of a throwaway baby myself all four , who arrived untested for hiv , turned out negative i really felt alone , tom said , and at 9 , after an hivcamp friend died , he begged them to adopt someone like him they adopted tyree , who had two hiv strains , one from each parent , and developmental delays for years , he took medication through a stomach tube because he would vomit it otherwise now 11 , he often needs leg braces , and his viral load the amount of virus in the blood is too high tyree s adoption did not improve everything for tom , and tom was very out of control for years , he said to tame his behavior , ms cosgrove said , she had to push him down and say , you are not going to talk like that , you are not going to act like that' one day i dragged him across the carpet , and his teacher called and i told her this is what i did and why by 12 , tom had calmed down , but he chafed at people s reactions ms cosgrove informed his school about his hiv and held a meeting for parents , but while school officials were supportive , some parents and classmates shunned him tyree attends another school , whose principal advised against disclosure because parents would react badly and a soccer coach ms cosgrove told said , oh , we 're not taking kids like that tyree said he feels lonely because none of my friends come over he already knows how to protect others , saying , do n't have sex with me tom , now mature and thoughtful , finds things more complicated with his infection well suppressed with medication , he has started job corps , a federal jobtraining program , but his medications' side effects affecting his memory concern him , and he said that girlfriends have not lasted long because people have a lot of worries about going out with someone with this disease still , since his adoptive family can accept me for who i am , he said , i look at it as if there s other people out there who can probably do the same
the 19hour flight to new york from johannesburg last week provided ample time for reflection for thoughts about a month spent in south africa , the world cup and all its stellar performances with so much to think about , it was easy to lose track of the burning issues of the sports world in the united states until the plane touched down not even five minutes after i got off the plane at kennedy airport , it was hard to miss the television monitors that were telling the story of the hour , the king without a championship throne king james was home in cleveland , in the middle of interviewing no fewer than six teams , all vying begging for him to play for them a parade of suitors owners , executives and coaches made their way to james , pitching their offers and the , and the , and finally the and james s hometown  they were like wise men , bringing gifts and making promises james will make any one of those teams a fortune , but will any make him a champion \? all those team representatives must know by now as james does that nothing is guaranteed , nothing is promised in sports no amount of money , or set of players , will guarantee a title winning a title is hard , winning two is extremely difficult , three heroic winning four or more is close to miraculous which is why the more i see of lebron james , the more i like  this has nothing to do with life outside basketball , just life on the court life on the scoreboard right now , the scoreboard reads kobe bryant 5 championships , lebron james 0 last month in johannesburg , bryant was one of the invited guests at the first day of african he relaxed in an informal viewing area and watched a world cup match he talked briefly about his first trip to africa he mentioned the safari he had gone on a day earlier he excitedly described how the truck he was in had come upon a clan of hyenas that had identified its prey what stood out for bryant was how the hyenas were so focused on the task at hand that they did n't even glance at the truck of spectators that s what impressed bryant the pack was locked in , singularly focused on that moment , on that prey it was as if the truck did not exist in that instant , i realized the difference , at this particular time , between bryant and james bryant is focused on championships now no 6 and his legacy in being regarded as the greatest ever james , who is expected to make an announcement about his basketball future this week , is multifocused he wants to be a billionaire , wants to be an icon like muhammad ali , and wants to win multiple championships when james entered the nba as an 18yearold phenom , the talk was about the young lebron and how much better he would become as a player the sky was the limit now the talk has shifted to which team he will play for and what they can do to benefit each other could king james put the nets on the map \? could he resurrect the knicks \? could he be the bulls' new jordan \? or will he stay home and bring a title to cleveland \? will he go to the clippers and win a title under bryant s nose \? could he team with dwyane wade in miami \? most of us conclude that james will get his ring one day but who knows most fans would have expected him to have won a ring by now but nothing is promised and nothing is guaranteed james has led cleveland to the playoffs in each of the past five years , including their first visit to the finals in 2007 despite having the league s best regularseason record in each of the past two seasons , the cavaliers did not make the finals either time there is a school of thought that says judging great players by championships is unfair in fact , it s infinitely fair in most of our working lives , we are measured to a significant extent by a subjective set of criteria by whoever is in charge at a given time for an athlete , those criteria are quite clear cut win a championship bryant has won five nba championships , james none in the arena of public perception , james , with all his skills and physical gifts , has lost ground to bryant with the game on the line , whom do you want to take the last shot kobe or lebron \? hands down , it s bryant his great challenge , and one he may not even realize yet , is that he has to find a way to close the widening gap between himself and bryant in that respect , king james has a steep mountain to climb , wherever he chooses to play in competitive sports , championships matter basketball fans still talk about bill russell , the legend who won 11 championships as a player and although we admire ali for what he stood for , those stands probably would have mattered less had he not won championships for the great players , championships define a career and a legacy , and it takes more than a notion to win them like those hyenas bryant described , blocking out everything but the goal of seizing their prey for now , king james has far too many suitors vying for his attention if he is not careful , the prey , that championship , could just slip away
the drugs tripped up dodgers outfielder a year ago and just last month ensnared a young pitcher named edinson volquez then , last friday , the same drugs derailed another athlete when the nfl suspended houston texans linebacker brian cushing none of the three players were suspended because they were using a steroid to bolster their muscles instead , they were suspended because they had used drugs that helped jumpstart their bodies' production of testosterone and restore their virility only a handful of players in the nfl and major league baseball typically test positive each year , so the common link to these drugs is now capturing the attention of officials in both sports as well as antidoping experts is this a trend \? why this type of drugs \? is this the latest development in the catandmouse game of drug testing \? , baseball officials discovered that a doctor in florida had written the slugger a prescription for the drug hcg the explanation offered by one of ramirez s associates was that he took the substance because he was trying to have a child volquez offered a similar explanation when he was suspended cushing , who won the defensive rookie of the year award last season , tested positive for hcg last september , according to a lawyer who was told of the results but did not want his name used because he did not want to be identified discussing confidential drug matters cushing appealed the finding , eventually lost and will now sit out the first four games of the 2010 season he did not say what led to his positive test larry bowers , the lead scientist at the united states antidoping agency , said hcg and clomiphene were typically used by bodybuilders whose bodies stopped producing testosterone during long periods of steroid use the drugs restart the testosterone process it s a street way for gym rats to raise their testosterone levels , bowers said their ability to function is restarted he added that bodybuilders who wanted to have children were able to get the drugs prescribed to them by endocrinologists doctors treating men who have not used steroids and are having infertility problems may prescribe hcg in combination with other drugs , depending on the cause of the infertility , bowers added but while the three players are linked by these drugs , the way in which their leagues proceeded with their suspensions was sharply different , with the nfl taking significantly longer than baseball to enact a punishment ramirez and volquez both provided urine samples during spring training \( ramirez in 2009 , volquez in 2010 \) and were suspended two months later the nfl , however , did not suspend cushing until eight months after he provided his test , allowing him to play the entire 2009 season , lead the texans to the best season in the franchise s history and win the defensive rookie award on monday , the associated press said that it on the award in light of cushing s suspension meanwhile , on tuesday , the head of the nfl players association that appeared to raise questions as to why cushing was allowed to play last season sport is at its best when fans can witness great achievements under the rules of fair play , said demaurice smith , the head of the union players who break those rules cheat the game , cheat the fans and cheat themselves the players want a clean game as well as a clean process for enforcing those rules it is highly unusual for any players union to take a position unsympathetic to one of its members however , the nfl union has received calls from a number of players who were unhappy that cushing was allowed to keep playing one nfl official , asked to explain why the process took so long in cushing s case , said the time lag was not unusual these cases take varying lengths of time , some longer than others , said the official , who did not want his name used because of the nfl s confidentiality agreement with the union one concern about the three positives is that they occurred in the early parts of the football and baseball seasons and could be a sign that both sports are not catching players who are using steroids in the offseason , when performanceenhancers are believed to benefit an athlete most both leagues test out of season , but not extensively and because these drugs are used to restart the bodies' production of testosterone after the use of steroids , the sports might be catching the players only at the tail end of their steroid use , when they have already benefited
washington in speeding the replacement of the national security adviser , gen , with his deputy , a foreign policy aide with deep political experience , has given civilian and political advisers a bigger voice in the hard choices of the coming months , including how quickly to withdraw american troops from afghanistan on friday , mr obama announced the appointment of , the principal deputy national security adviser , who is a democratic party stalwart who has advised two previous democratic administrations the longrumored departure of general jones , a retired marine commandant who never struck a close bond with his boss , does not necessarily signal a big swing in administration policy , partly because mr donilon has been running the show for months but it does portend a bigger voice for mr obama s political and civilian advisers while mr donilon is steeped in national security , his political skills and connections to capitol hill are well known enough that he was rumored just weeks ago to be a candidate to succeed rahm emanuel as white house chief of staff general jones s exit had been expected at the end of the year , but it came earlier , administration officials said , after the white house became annoyed by the appearance of quotations attributed to general jones in bob woodward s book obama s wars mr donilon s reminders inside the white house that the american public has limited patience with the afghan war , and that america s goals should match its capabilities , are likely to loom large in the two strategy reviews ahead , one in december and another next summer , when troops are to begin leaving the country in running the foreign policy debates at the white house , mr donilon has at times been a controversial figure , especially inside the pentagon , where he angered many officers and senior officials during the tense review of afghanistan and pakistan policy in the fall of 2009 that debate pitted the nation s top military officers , along with secretary of defense robert m gates and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who sought a heavy troop presence for a prolonged period , against a range of the president s political advisers , including vice president joseph r biden jr and mr emanuel mr donilon , according to officials who witnessed the exchanges , repeatedly challenged the military to justify the need for large numbers of troops over a period of a decade or more , finally cautioning the president that a policy of what he termed endless war was not wise or politically sustainable according to mr woodward s book , tempers flared and the debate became so personal that mr gates warned that choosing mr donilon as the next national security adviser would be a disaster in a telephone interview on friday , mr gates acknowledged tensions , but said he believed that mr donilon had run a good process at the white house and that the choice of someone with a foot in both politics and foreign policy was a return to the norm after having a former general in the job there were some issues and concerns that grew out of the afpak review , mr gates said , declining to be specific tom called me when it was over , and asked if we could meet privately we did , we cleared the air , and things ever since have been fine during the afghanistan review , mr donilon had similarly testy relations with adm mike mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , who issued a statement friday saying that he wished mr donilon well and looked forward to working with him inside the white house , mr donilon , who is 55 , has spoken often of the need to conduct a rebalancing of american foreign policy , devoting renewed attention to great power relationships and america s longterm position in asia mr donilon s role as deputy national security adviser will be filled , according to a white house official , by another foreign policy aide with deep connections to capital hill and a close relationship with the president , whom he advised when mr obama was a senator denis r mcdonough , now the s chief of staff while general jones has been the official head of the president s white house foreign policy team , in practical terms that role has been filled in many ways for the past two years by mr donilon and mr mcdonough general jones spent a lot of time wrangling with allies and adversaries alike on mr obama s behalf on the international stage , but wielded less influence within the white house , where mr donilon and mr mcdonough spoke more regularly with mr obama and served as the goto aides for staff members trying to gauge where the president stood general jones brought military experience to the white house team , but the president never let him into his inner circle , said david rothkopf , the author of running the world the inside story of the national security council and the architects of american power aloof himself , he served an aloof president , so there was zero chemistry or connection , mr rothkopf added that lack of chemistry was evident during mr obama s rose garden announcement of the change on friday while the president praised general jones s patriotism , there was none of the warmth or humor that the president demonstrated , for instance , when he announced the departure of mr emanuel as chief of staff last week hastening general jones s departure , two administration officials said , were the quotes attributed to the general in mr woodward s book , in which he complained about being shut out of white house political debates by mr obama s political advisers they were very quotable lines , a senior white house official said friday mr donilon s long hours , starting with the morning presidential briefings and then presiding over more than 300 deputies meetings in the white house situation room on issues like the iranian nuclear program and mideast peace negotiations are legendary but it is his use of his political compass that will be watched most carefully , by allies and adversaries alike who remember him as an energetic young aide to jimmy carter who , in his mid20s , was picked to manage the floor at the 1980 democratic convention mr donilon s political experience may help , said robert b zoellick , the president of the world bank , who served with mr donilon in several bipartisan foreign policy groups and remains a friend mr zoellick , a former deputy secretary of state under president george w bush , said , whether it s afghanistan or iraq , or dealing with china , it helps to have someone with a working relationship to the domestic politics scene
boston it s decision day in massachusetts , where a special election is taking place to fill the seat of the late senator edward m kennedy neither democrats nor republicans would have predicted the contest between martha m coakley and scott p brown would have turned into such a remarkable race we re here in boston , where occasional snowfall may greet voters on tuesday at the polls the election is being carefully watched across the state and , perhaps , just as closely in washington , where the outcome could alter a democratic supermajority in the senate the campaign , quite simply , is too close to call so as we waited for the day to unfold , we sat down for a conversation politics from a to z , the first of many backandforth exchanges we ll have as we travel across the country this year  an jeff , here s one of the big frustrations of the day there are no exit polls now i know that most people think we like exit polls , just to get the cool , insider read on what s happening and to impress our friends ok , that is definitely one reason why we like them but that s not the real value exit polls for this race would have provided us with all kinds of data about why what happens on tuesday actually happened , as well as offering information to help analyze the coming midterm elections for example , did independent voters swing to scott brown , the republican , as preelection polls suggested \? did obama voters stay at home \? have republicans been galvanized by the health care bill \? all that would be bad news for president obama and some very worried democrats contemplating the outcome of the fall midterm elections jz i couldn t agree more there are no exit polls , of course , because no one anticipated this special election would turn into a real race from the television networks that pay for the exit polls to democratic leaders in washington who will suffer if martha coakley loses so without them , we will be left to rely on anecdotal information are there big lines at polling places \? are black voters turning out to vote in traditionally democratic precincts \? are women voters walking away with coakley stickers on their lapels \? this is the most critical segment of the electorate for her what happens if she doesn t win them over \? an i don t see how she can without independent women voters but the other thing to watch is whether organizing for america the outgrowth of the obama presidential campaign s getoutthevote effort can , combined with the massachusetts democratic organization , turn out base democratic voters that s one inherent advantage that she has over mr brown the word on the street here is if ms coakley can keep it close and polls this morning are all over the place , though none have her in the lead a good getoutthevote operation could bring her across the finish line what i can t get over is why on earth are you and i in massachusetts for a special election where a democrat is struggling to hold onto the seat edward m kennedy had for 46 years ! ! \? ! \? ! \? jz no kidding usually when we re in boston for a political story , we re just sneaking across the border from new hampshire for a good dinner but that s another matter i ll tell you one thing if ms coakley loses tonight , democratic unity and the nodrama ethos employed by mr obama will face one of its biggest tests yet and the administration s health care agenda is threatened i predict the fingerpointing will begin even before the concession speech is delivered the white house \? the democratic senatorial campaign committee \? the democratic national committee \? an the answer to your questions yes and by the way , the fingerpointing has already begun win or lose , democrats aren t about to wait to see the outcome before parceling blame \( and let s be clear here she could most certainly win \) in all seriousness , democrats have reason to be upset , even if she prevails in a close race president obama should never have had to trek here on a sunday while he was managing the crises in haiti and the closing negotiations on the health care bill agree with the health care bill or not , could you blame the president for being really upset that this signature initiative of his administration could get tripped up because of some basic political miscalculations by people who should know how to play this game \? none of this , by the way , is to take away from the political skill of mr brown if he does win , what meaning does the victory hold a month from now , much less 11 months from now , in an era when news cycles seem to be measured in minutes , not days \? jz this is the opening volley of a suretobefascinating midterm election season the results from tuesday night will be analyzed yes , overanalyzed and it would be premature to suggest that a republican victory will automatically be a sign of good fortunes for the party in the rest of the year a lot can and will happen between now and the rest of the primary and general election battles for house , senate and governor s races but you can be sure that if mr brown wins , it will be a punch in the stomach for democrats , who are already freaked out by what they fear could be a dismal political year but before we get ahead of ourselves , it will be interesting to see if mr brown can capitalize on the sentiment of an angry electorate and turn the enthusiasm created by his guynextdoor , idriveapickuptruck campaign , into real votes we ll find out after 8 pm when the polls close by the way , do you know what the massachusetts recount rules are \? just asking adam nagourney , the chief political correspondent for the new york times , and jeff zeleny , a white house correspondent , are on assignment in boston
johannesburg for most south africans , soccer looks like the images in clint strydom s highcontrast black and white photographs barefoot preteen boys sporting broad smiles kicking a ragged ball through sand and dirt in kwazulu natal i wanted to do the rural side of soccer , strydom said most of these boys are never going to see the stadiums inside the stadiums at the world cup , millionaire professionals with lucrative endorsements showcase their artistry on manicured fields , but , and many of his fellow artists , chose to showcase the game in a decidedly different light the passion is there , the love of the game is there , strydom said whether it is the world cup or not the tournament has drawn the world s attention here and the organizers of 2010 fine art , an international art exhibit , are hoping it will raise the profile of south african artists and generate interest from abroad in contemporary african art there has always been a natural synergy between sport and art and culture , craig mark , the exhibit s managing director , said if you go back and look at bushman art , early cave painting , you see sport being illustrated within those paintings in africa , football plays a very important role in terms of our daily experience while strydom captured scenes of rural african soccer , the american painter set the sport in a surrealistic asphalt jungle you have a lot of these artists having never come to africa but interpreting what they feel africa is all about within their works , mark said some of the works are very abstract in nature there s definitely a soccer theme that carries throughout in some of the works , animals play quite a strong role artists from the continent as well as five from each of the 32 countries competing in the world cup were commissioned to produce original works celebrating the game in africa the result is an that includes works from some of europe s most celebrated contemporary artists , like sir peter phillips and ed gray from britain , and unknown artists from north korea whose photorealistic paintings honor the soccer player as proletarian hero the auctions for the african collection , which opened july 4 , and the international collection , which opened the next day , will be conducted online by through july 29 bidders can view the works at the gallery at melrose arch in johannesburg or online tim howard , the united states goalkeeper , and some teammates bought signed prints of strydom s photographs , and other works were presented to sepp blatter , the president of fifa there are several south african artists involved and they each have their own very unique styles , mark said each has been selected for that very reason we feel that their works have the power to become iconic images of this world cup in addition to strydom , the south african artist esther mahlangu contributed her paintings in the style of the ndebele wall paintings , colorful geometric designs traditionally used to decorate houses of the ndebele people from the southern transvaal region in northwest south africa her work is internationally recognized and was used as part of in 1991 with such simple geographic shapes , she s actually managed to portray the game , mark said , created a series of bronze statues for the exhibit , including several largeformat versions that stand more than nine feet tall and are on display in nelson mandela square , in sandton , and other public spaces around johannesburg the exhibit opened in the spring and runs through july the 160 international artists , chosen by a team of curators recruited by an art publisher in south africa , were asked to provide original works that drew inspiration from soccer and africa s first world cup the exhibition is licensed by fifa , which cost its organizers a sizable , undisclosed fee in the past , soccer s world governing body has commissioned official tournament posters , but this is the first time fifa has licensed original works of art robert spaul , the exhibit s general manager , said that the official imprimatur of tournament organizers helped with marketing if we did n't have the license from fifa , we would n't have been able to recruit the top name artists from around the world , spaul said it was challenge enough to identify artists in some countries , like north korea the curators worked through an art publisher in

here s andrew exum , on the shape of the afghanistan debate  those who fret about american imperial overreach will argue a limited , longterm military presence in afghanistan amounts to garrisoning central asia but despite all the anger and emotion in current debates over us and allied afghanistan strategy , few are arguing for a complete and rapid withdrawal michael cohen , one of the current strategy s critics , linked to several alternate strategies for afghanistan on his blog the other day , and none argue for a complete withdrawal the real debate , in other words , revolves around how quickly we can transition to a lighter footprint on the one side you have people who argue that something looking like a comprehensive , resourceintensive counterinsurgency strategy gives you the best chance to build up key afghan institutions in the next 12 months to allow you to begin the transition to a lighter footprint counterterrorism and security force assistance mission on the other hand , you have those who feel the president should have adopted that kind of lighter footprint last spring and that we are needlessly wasting us resources on the current strategy despite all the hot air you wil read on blogs like this one \( or hear coming out of the mouth of the chairman of the gop \) , the real debate about afghanistan revolves around the best way to spend the next 12 months paving the way for a longterm , limited presence those who really think a complete withdrawal from afghanistan is on the table are dreaming as someone who worries a fair amount about imperial overreach , my view is that when we transition to a lighter footprint , we should be transitioning to the absolute lightest footprint possible my hope perhaps a vain hope is that military gains today can translate into a smaller american presence tomorrow , and perhaps even to real withdrawal down the road my great fear is that we ll fall back to a longterm , limited presence that isn t really all that limited , and that incurs many of the same costs as our current efforts , while spreading them out over a longer time horizon this means that when the inevitable drawdown begins , you ll probably find me on the side of a more sweeping pullout but at the moment , i m holding out hope for a better outcome than the kind of 20year stalemate that i suspect will follow from a sudden shift to counterterrorismplus
when you hear the tales of eighth graders' parents going though the city s high school admissions process , it is easy to think the endeavor is more dizzying than applying to college there are hours of open house visits , essays and interviews and if your child is a wouldbe performer , perhaps dozens of auditions but none of that seems to generate as much anxiety and passion as the specialized high school admissions test among many eighth graders , it is simply the test so when the results were released last week , it was interesting to note the demographic breakdown of who made the cut and who did not the number of black and latino students admitted to stuyvesant , bronx science and brooklyn tech , considered the top three specialized schools , has stagnated for years this year , the results showed that blacks made up just 7 percent of the more than 5 , 200 students admitted to specialized schools , but it was impossible to tell by those numbers alone whether the low number stemmed from recruitment or test results perhaps there were simply fewer black students taking the test but education department numbers show that black students made up 23 percent of the more than 27 , 000 students who took the test last fall that s second only to asian students , who accounted for 26 percent hispanics made up 20 percent , while white students were the smallest demographic , making up just 15 percent of test takers the ethnicity for another 16 percent of students is unknown , either because they are enrolled in private school , they have not signed the ethnic identification form given by city schools or because they are multiracial over all , the school system is 40 percent hispanic , 31 percent black , 15 percent white and 14 percent asian asians are not only taking the test in disproportionate numbers , but passing it more frequently as well five percent of black students who took the test were offered admission to one of the eight schools that use the exam by comparison , 34 percent of asian students who took the test were admitted , and 30 percent of white students did so hispanic students had an acceptance rate of nearly 7 percent , according to the department s statistics asians are the only group with a notable change in admissions in the last few years , according to education officials more than 2 , 400 asian students were offered a spot in specialized high schools this year , up from 1 , 945 in 2006 joel i klein , the schools chancellor , has made closing the racial achievement gap one of his paramount goals , and the numbers have put him in a bind he has offered free test prep courses , which are open to everyone but were created with the intent to help blacks and hispanics but they are not the only students receiving extra help for the test getting into one of the schools has become such a prize that a private testpreparation industry is flourishing , particularly in the asian neighborhoods of queens there s long been an achievement gap , mr klein said on tuesday i would like to have more of every group i think we have done outreach we have increased the number of test takers , he said and the admissions rates , he said , are not so much a function of the quality of schooling the story is the number of asian students who are coming to the city , taking this test and passing it at a very high rate , he continued i think it reflects a real commitment and a real ethic in terms of preparing
washington at a time of heavy international pressure on , the state department said on thursday that the human rights situation there had degenerated since the disputed presidential election last year in a toughly worded analysis , the department cited killings of election protesters and acts of politically motivated torture , beatings and rape an already poor human rights situation rapidly deteriorated after the june elections , said michael posner , assistant secretary for democracy , human rights , and labor , as the department released its overview of human rights around the world in 2009 at least 45 people were killed in clashes , he said the voluminous report , an annual assessment called for by law , also broadly criticized practices in mr posner called them poor and worsening the report cites increased repression of ethnic and religious minorities , increased detention and harassment of activists and publicinterest lawyers , and continuing repression in tibet it also criticizes the chinese government s control of the internet in that country , though the report did not include the complaints early this year by google executives about a series of major cyberattacks originating in china beijing has vigorously denied having any role in those attacks mr posner said that in places like china and iran , connective technologies had proved to be doubleedged while they allow a ferment of sometimes spontaneous organizational activities by dissidents and government critics , they also give governments greater energy in curtailing freedom of expression in iran , an opposition web site reported on thursday that a prominent political activist who was arrested on june 12 , the day of iran s disputed presidential election , has been released from prison mostafa tajzadeh , a former deputy interior minister , was released on wednesday in what was called a leave from prison , the web site , jaras , reported mr tajzadeh received a hero s welcome , and pictures of two leading opposition figures , mirhussein moussavi and the former president , mohammed khatami , visiting him at his home hundreds of opposition activists have been arrested since the presidential election , and most of them remain incarcerated human rights groups have said that none are released unconditionally and that most have posted hefty sums for bail and are summoned regularly to appear in court the committee to protect journalists , a new york based group , that at least 52 journalists remain in prison on thursday a lawyer for saeed leylaz , a prominent journalist and economist , said that his client s sentence had been reduced from nine years to six , a term that human rights groups said remained indefensible the sentence for bahman amuwee , another journalist , was reduced from seven years to five , the rights group said the criticism in the state department report was not limited to authoritarian or developing countries the state department expressed its growing concern over discrimination against muslims in europe , noting in particular a swiss ban on the construction of minarets secretary of state hillary clinton , in releasing the report , insisted that the united states holds itself to the same standards it uses to assess other countries there was , in any case , criticism for some countries closely allied to the united states even as the obama administration works to bolster the afghan government for an eventual american departure , the report described the existing rights situation there as poor it listed problems like extrajudicial killings , torture , poor prison conditions , restrictions on freedom of expression and discrimination against women the election there last year was marred by serious allegations of widespread fraud , the report noted as for iraq , the report noted an overarching reality that violence had significantly decreased last year still , it listed numerous rights offenses , including arbitrary killings , disappearances , torture , poor prison conditions , arbitrary arrests and inadequate protection for refugees mr posner also signaled some trends of global concern one was the increasing efforts by some governments to curtail local advocacy no less than 25 governments in the last couple of years have imposed new restrictions on nongovernmental human rights and other organizations , the report said another was governments' misuse of nationalsecurity or emergency legislation to broadly curtail civil liberties he said egypt , russia and sri lanka had all been guilty of this
i can t believe i m actually here could it really be that my little girl is about to begin the process \? these were only a couple of the reactive \( or some would say slightly over reactive \) thoughts racing through my head when i entered my daughter s high school auditorium recently to attend the first college meeting the one when the school s team of guidance counselors unveils the college admissions process for high school juniors and their parents the crowd numbered in the hundreds , and the auditorium buzzed with excitement as both kids and parents looked around for an optimal seat and perhaps a friendly face or two the school principal welcomed us all and introduced the guidance counselors , one of whom explained that while this meeting is typically held in january , they were offering it earlier this year in response to the many eager parents requests to get things going already \( read you parents are even more neurotic than last year s \) each family was given a college guide , a red and white booklet published by the counseling office , explaining the entire process in 42 pages it included a timeline , a checklist , and even the school s philosophy \( the college admissions process should be an exciting time when students have the opportunity to take a close look at themselves , examine strengths and weaknesses , goals , interests and needs \) with the help of a power point presentation , we were enlightened about a variety of recent trends in the school s college admissions \( 32 percent of the class of 2009 went to public universities , while 68 percent opted for private 43 percent went to a school in new york state and 1 percent in canada \) and information , such as what is supposed to accompany each college application \( test scores , high school record , essay , etc \) we the parents were told to let our children take their own initiative to ask them how we can be of help , rather than instructing them what to do to not make the college admissions process the primary topic at home to be open and honest about what we think is best , but to be a good listener , keeping in mind that it is our child who is going to college , not us and finally , that our success as a parent will not be measured by which school he or she attends they the students were asked to be open to their parents suggestions , and to remember that they do not have to tell their friends everything there was no doubt that the large majority of advice was directed at the adults in the room though i was sitting next to my own high school junior who seemed at that moment to need me simply for a piece of gum or some lip gloss she was happily commiserating with her friend , molly , who sat next to her on the other side i didn t mind though i actually enjoyed hearing them laugh together , thinking how lucky they are to have so many exciting things to look forward to but then it all started to feel surreal the idea of a kid leaving home , the colossal expense , my daughter now taller than i , my age after the meeting , nicole and i headed home , arguing as usual over which radio station to put on i deferred to her choice , also as usual , and then my mind wandered back to the meeting not to the statistics or requirements , but to us she and i , and how our relationship might grow , and change , over the next 12 months although she has a very interested and supportive father , nicole seems to have appointed me the parent with whom she confers about most things collegerelated i am reveling in the role , and love our occasional walks in the woods or rides in the car when we philosophize and chat about her future , what she hopes for , likes , and doesn t but there are also times when she is stressed about school , or life , or just in a bad mood , and wants nothing to do with me and that s where those guidance counselors have the right idea reminding us that throughout the next year \( and beyond perhaps \) , we parents need to both inquire and listen every chance we get so i am , hereby , taking an oath \( nicole are you reading \? \) i will do my best to be conscious of your space when you need it , and listen closely to ask what may be helpful for you , and give you the freedom to explore and express yourself any way you wish \( with the exception of sibling abuse \) in times of anxiety and frustration i will hold your hand if you want , and offer you my shoulder to cry on and lastly , please note that despite the ups and downs of this lengthy college application process , none of my promises permit you to shirk your tableclearing and dishwasherloading responsibilities to offer your thoughts on what ms gerszberg has written , please use the to read more by her ,

when the white house released its new budget last week , including more spending to create desperately needed jobs , republican leaders in congress denounced president obama for driving up the deficit and demanded that the democrats halt their reckless ways the deficit numbers a projected 13 trillion in fiscal 2011 alone are breathtaking what is even more breathtaking is the republicans' cynical refusal to acknowledge that the country would never have gotten into so deep a hole if president george w bush and the republicanled congress had not spent years slashing taxes mainly on the wealthy and spending with far too little restraint unfortunately , the problem does not stop there the republican amnesia and posturing are playing well on the hustings , where americans are deeply anxious about the economy and fearful of losing their jobs and homes far too many democratic lawmakers are losing their nerve americans should be anxious , for reasons including the huge deficit but the cold economic truth is this at a time of high unemployment and fragile growth , the last thing the government should do is to slash spending that will only drive the economy into deeper trouble none of this means that the politicians from either party are off the hook they will soon need to make hard decisions about how to reduce the deficit but more posturing and sniping is not going to make the economy better or solve the deficit problem president obama has called on the republicans to join a bipartisan commission to help make those tough decisions , but they have been resistant to the proposal  we fear the demagoguing is not going to stop , especially with congressional elections this november as the budget debate plays out , here are some basic facts about the deficit that americans need to consider when president bush took office in 2001 , the federal budget had been in the black for three years , and continued surpluses were projected for a decade to come by the time mr bush left office in early 2009 , the government had run big deficits for seven straight years , and the economy was on the brink of another great depression on jan 7 , 2009 two weeks before mr obama was inaugurated the congressional budget office issued new budget estimates showing a fiscal year 2009 deficit of well over 1 trillion about half of today s huge deficits can be chalked up to bushera profligacy mainly cutting taxes deeply while borrowing to wage two wars and to enact the medicare prescription drug benefit all of which republicans supported , virtually in lockstep the other half of recent deficits is due to the recession and the financial crisis to avoid a meltdown , the government under president bush and president obama rightly decided it had no choice but to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out banks and car companies and to stimulate the economy that prevented a very bad situation from becoming much worse , but as the recession dragged on , hundreds of billions in tax revenues have also dried up as for why the financial system and the economy imploded , president bush and congress deserve much of the blame for their devotion to debtdriven growth and blind deregulatory zeal although on deregulation , president clinton and his team \( some of whom are back in the white house \) were also complicit were it not for those multiple calamities , budget deficits today would be negligible that does not mean we would be off the hook an aging population and relentlessly rising health care costs will hit the country with even deeper deficits as the baby boomers retire politicians need to pass health care reform now and start thinking seriously about social security and tax reform so what are the immediate fiscal lessons here \? the first lesson is that spending without taxing is a recipe for huge deficits , and that running big deficits when the economy is expanding only sets the country up for bigger deficits when the economy contracts the second lesson is that once a deep recession takes hold , slashing government spending is not going to solve the problem it will only make it worse here is an unpopular but undeniable fact of life when private sector demand is weak , the federal government must serve as the spender of last resort otherwise , collapsing demand sets in motion a negative , selfreinforcing spiral in which lack of demand for goods , services and new employees leads to ever deepening economic weakness that is why when the banks and the economy began to crumble in 2008 , president bush responded with a 700 billion bank bailout and a 168 billion stimulus package when mr obama took office , the banks were still shaky and the economy was still plunging as measured by reallife indicators like jobs , consumer spending , credit availability , home equity , retirement savings and business confidence the new administration made the sound decision to continue the bailout and pushed a 787 billion stimulus through congress , with very little republican help the stimulus package slowed job losses and helped spur activity in the third quarter of 2009 , the economy grew at an annual rate of 22 percent , and the initial fourthquarter reading was 57 percent , a rebound few thought possible a year ago still , without a jobs revival to boost consumer spending and tax revenues and with the states facing immense budget shortfalls the economy is unlikely to do anything other than limp along , at best , once the effects of the stimulus fade this year in his recent budget , mr obama proposed to spend 266 billion on tax credits for hiring and new jobcreation investments , and on other shortterm stimulus including extended unemployment compensation that would improve on the housepassed 154 billion jobs bill but in the senate , republicans are balking at the prospect of a big bill , saying they need to hold down the deficit they have spooked the democrats , who are now trying to negotiate what appears to be a far too modest bill in hopes of winning republican support what they should be saying and what the white house should be saying a lot louder is that a prolonged downturn or a renewed recession would do far more damage to the budget than upfront deficit spending in fact , a clear lesson from the depression of the 1930s is that reducing deficits at a time of economic fragility undercuts recovery the problem must be addressed persistently high deficits are harmful to the economy and the country s longrun security if the government must keep borrowing to make up the difference , it could drive up interest rates and force private companies to compete with the government for investors that , in turn , would reduce economic growth and , by extension , the potential earnings and standard of living of everyone the process is generally gradual but it could be wrenching if creditors lose confidence that the government will ever put its fiscal house in order and suddenly decide to put their money elsewhere that could lead to a fiscal crisis , with sharp spikes in interest rates and a rapidly depreciating currency there is no question that , over the next several decades , deficits and debt in the united states are headed for dangerously high levels but today s deficit fearmongers invariably fail to note that the impact of stimulus spending on the longterm fiscal problem is small , because the spending is temporary the real problem , which also goes unmentioned , is that dangerous deficits will accumulate over time if continuing trends and policies especially in health care persist unchanged mr obama s budget makes a down payment on deficit reduction by freezing some nonsecurity discretionary spending for three years , and by letting the bush tax cuts for the richest americans expire at the end of this year to truly tame deficits will require serious health care reform , the sooner the better other aspects of the longterm fiscal problem raising taxes and retooling social security must take place in earnest as the economy recovers contrary to popular belief , there are many wellthoughtout ideas for such reforms where technical questions are difficult , particularly on health care costs , reformers have advocated demonstration projects that can be tested over time where the real difficulty lies is summoning the political will to do what must be done , even though it will be unpopular if these problems are not addressed , here is what we face under current policies , federal debt in the united states the sum total of annual deficits would grow from 53 percent of the size of the economy in 2009 to more than 300 percent by 2050 , driven mainly by rapidly rising health care costs and , in part , by the aging of the population combined , those two factors exert enormous pressure on the government s biggest spending programs , medicare and medicaid , and , to a lesser extent , social security unless health care costs are controlled , there is no way to solve the country s longterm deficit and debt problems but that will not be enough broad tax reform is also essential to ensure that revenues keep pace with expenditures from 1978 to 2008 , revenues averaged about 184 percent of the economy but without policy changes , expenditures for everything other than interest on the national debt will increase from 192 percent of the size of the economy in 2008 to 245 percent in 2050 on the need for more taxes , mr obama has been less than candid , pledging never to raise taxes on anyone making less than 250 , 000 republican lawmakers have been worse , calling for tax cuts at most every opportunity and never acknowledging that a shortfall in revenue is one of the important causes of the deficit the deficit commission that mr obama intends to establish could be helpful in breaking this logjam , by calling for necessary changes that politicians would be loath to broach without political cover we hope that health care reform will move ahead before that if it does , the commission will still have to press for new taxes that both raise revenue and broaden the tax base , including a value added tax and then there is social security what is needed is a combination of benefit cuts and tax increases that preserve the program s essential nature a contract under which the young support the old via taxes and the rich help the poor via a benefits formula that favors low income beneficiaries one sound approach would be to link benefit levels to life expectancy , so that as people live longer , future benefits would be modestly reduced while payroll taxes that support social security would be modestly increased  there is no way to get deficits under control until our political leaders are willing to acknowledge difficult truths and make even more difficult political choices we have heard and seen too little of that from the democrats lately , and none at all from the republicans that is truly a recipe for disaster
bob hurley , the st anthony high school coach and , has been a model of stability in his 38 years at the small jersey city school by his standards of stillness , the coaching changes among colleges in the new york city area have been dizzying holy moly ! he said i 've never seen anything like this since the first week of march , 8 of the area s 13 division i men s basketball coaching positions have been open at some point there have been resignations , r sum s sent out via email messages and interviews with thirdparty representatives as the dominoes have fallen , more shifts have resulted the first thing these coaches need to know is to keep their leases nearby , said the retired st john s coach lou carnesecca , a new york city native who won 526 games in 24 seasons at the university it s absolutely crazy a lot has changed since carnesecca s teams were a national power in the 1980s and early '90s none of the metropolitan area s 13 division i teams has earned an invitation to the ncaa tournament since 2006 , when iona got in and promptly lost to louisiana state survive and advance used to be a term we used for the tournament now it s for the job market every spring , said tom pecora , who left his job as the coach at hofstra to take the same job at fordham three area teams even made it into the national invitation tournament this season stony brook , seton hall and st john s and even that was not enough to save the job of seton hall coach bobby gonzalez gonzalez was fired after four seasons because of the seton hall administration s and that of his players on friday , gonzalez sued the university , claiming he was fired without cause down the new jersey turnpike at rutgers , fred hill is under internal investigation for at a recent baseball game on campus i tell my guys every day after practice that they are representing the university and that what they do has consequences , said fairleigh dickinson coach greg vetrone , who was elevated from interim coach after the season ended more administrators are watching than ever before whether it was pecora , an amiable recruiter , leaving hofstra to rebuild fordham or kevin willard , a 34yearold rick pitino prot g , continuing his climb up the ranks to seton hall and the big east , each move has been unique i 've been sending and receiving text and email messages saying , did you see this \?

for a while last week , general motors was telling employees at its chevrolet headquarters to stop using the word chevy , explaining it was important for brand consistency after a report in the times provoked a widespread huh \? , chevrolet said it was talking about expanding foreign markets and was not discouraging customers or fans from using chevy but the original effort , and the response , left us thinking about the emotional tie of automobile names and their evanescence as branding or rebranding attempts go , this one strikes us as arguing with success chevrolet does sound more formal , if not necessarily more upscale , than chevy , much as cadillac , another gm brand , sounds more formal than caddy but car owners do not have formal relationships with their vehicles they have intimate ones , requiring nicknames chevrolet s memo also reminds us of the long line of once household automobile names shoved aside by time there is something almost evolutionary about the history of the industry an explosion of life forms in the early 20th century , most of them unsuccessful , dwindling into the few major lines that still survive who remembers the brewster knight or the dagmar or the menominee \? what about the marmon or the stoutscarab \? the names of vanished autos reads like a graveyard of inventors , though it also reads like a list of the emotions one might be supposed to feel on the open highway and then , of course , there are the strange cases like the studebaker rockne , named after knute none of these are more than a memory , not even such memorable names as the pungsfinch our feeling is that foreigners will learn to love chevy the way americans have ever since the company was founded in 1911
the united states open semifinals have been a new york stop sign for until now , a signal he has been too weary or too harried to ignore he is back in the same spot for the third straight year at flushing meadows , but it is difficult to imagine him stopping there this time after watching him blunt the power and wellfounded enthusiasm of his spanish compatriot fernando verdasco in the quarterfinals at arthur ashe stadium on thursday night the last time verdasco faced nadal on a hard court was also in a grand slam event , and verdasco made his fellow lefthander work for five sets and more than five hours before nadal prevailed in a classic semifinal at the 2009 australian open on thursday , on another summer night in a different hemisphere , the eighthseeded verdasco produced some of the same flourishes huge forehands that had the crowd gasping with surprise , athletic lunges to the corners and wicked serves wide to nadal s forehand in the ad court but this quarterfinal was an entertaining sprint instead of an engrossing marathon as nadal in blustery , deeply challenging conditions produced perhaps the finest and most suffocating performance of all his matches true , nadal lost his serve for the first time in the tournament and he did so early , but he soon broke back against verdasco and then did not allow him another break point nadal went on to win , 75 , 63 , 64 , in a tidy 2 hours 22 minutes it s a very nice feeling to be in the semifinal for the third time in a row in one of the most important tournaments in the world , for me right now probably the most important , the topseeded nadal said on the court with the wind still whipping through his dark hair , once flamboyantly long but now nononsense short the us open remains the only major individual title that nadal lacks he has won the five times , wimbledon twice and the australian open once he also won the singles gold medal at the 2008 summer olympics in beijing but he is a clear favorite to reach the final here , even if his surprise semifinal opponent , the 12thseeded mikhail youzhny , has caused him trouble here in the past saturday s other semifinal will match no 2 roger federer , a fivetime champion here , against no 3 novak djokovic youzhny , a smoothmoving russian veteran with an elegant onehanded backhand , defeated stanislas wawrinka of switzerland , 36 , 76 \( 7 \) , 36 , 63 , 63 , in thursday s first quarterfinal , a victory that required four hours to complete and an abundance of patience , hard running and deep thinking from both players but nadal , like his archrival federer , has not lost a set at the open this year , and although youzhny upset nadal here in four sets in the 2006 quarterfinals , nadal has won seven of their 11 matches and has clearly proven himself a hardcourt champion since by winning in both australia and beijing conditions in ashe stadium are considered quicker than in australia , with a lower bounce but nadal said he feels fresh and has none of the energy issues that he believed affected his chances in his 2008 semifinal loss here to andy murray or any of the injury problems that contributed to his 2009 semifinal loss to juan mart n del potro but nadal chose not to contest verdasco s postmatch assessment that federer was still the man to beat for sure roger is the favorite of the tournament , especially because he won five times and six finals in a row , nadal said youzhny reached the semifinals here in 2006 before losing to andy roddick he is back there again and soon to be back in the top 10 none of that appeared likely late on thursday afternoon when wawrinka confidently ripped a huge ace into the corner to win the third set and take a twosetstoone lead the 25thseeded wawrinka was still riding the wave after upsetting murray and outlasting sam querrey in five sets on his way to the quarterfinals he was carving backhands with panache and reading the flow of play with prescience despite the tricky winds that have become the rule at this blustery open meanwhile , wawrinka s new coach , peter lundgren , who once tutored roger federer , was grinning in the players' box , leaping to his feet and barking out encouragement with federer already into the semifinals , it appeared that switzerland was about to account for half of the open s final four but youzhny quashed those plans , proving fresher and more accurate down the stretch with wawrinka destroying one of his rackets in frustration deep in the fifth set youzhny has escaped from more difficult situations in the past , starting at the beginning in 2002 , in the davis cup final against france in paris , his captain , shamil tarpischev , called on him to replace the struggling yevgeni kafelnikov in the fifth and final match just 20 then , youzhny rallied from a twoset deficit to defeat paulhenri mathieu and secure the cup for russia for the first time there was quite a celebration in paris and back in moscow , but youzhny s emotions were mixed , because his father , mikhail , had died suddenly just a few months earlier eight years later , youzhny is a father himself , but he still commemorates victories with a salute to all four sides of a stadium with his tennis racket resting on his head it is hardly as straightforward a gesture as andre agassi s blown kisses and bows , but it still means plenty to youzhny , whose father was in the military it s my way of dedicating my victories to my father , he said now , after four hours in the wind against wawrinka , another victory would allow youzhny to end any further chatter about a first federernadal final at the us open i'm ready to be bad person , youzhny said with a grin i love to be bad person in this case
house democrats voted wednesday to keep house speaker nancy pelosi of california as their leader , despite a challenge from representative heath shuler of north carolina , a blue dog democrat after yesterday s article in which i pointed out that , indeed , there was evidence that health care bill and the federal bailout package had hurt democrats in this month s elections a conclusion that a lot of our readers considered to be selfevident i m a bit reluctant to belabor another obvious point but this just in ms pelosi is not very popular with the american public quinnipiac university had a poll out this morning that showed ms pelosi s favorability rating at 25 percent and her unfavorable rating at 55 percent this rating is quite a bit worse on balance than that for her republican counterpart in the house , the soontobe speaker john boehner , whom 20 percent of respondents viewed favorably against 19 percent unfavorably favorability ratings can sometimes differ quite a bit from polling firm to polling firm but ms pelosi s poor numbers in the quinnipiac poll were no anomaly a cnn poll last week put her scores at 33 percent favorable against 52 percent unfavorable , and found that about half of democrats would rather she be replaced a poll for abc news and the washington post conducted just before the election had ms pelosi s numbers at 29 percent favorable and 58 percent unfavorable in fact , ms pelosi is among the least popular politicians in america today perhaps the single least popular one that maintains an active political role i took an average of favorability scores for ms pelosi , mr boehner , harry reid , mitch mcconnell , and about a dozen other prominent politicians , including several republican candidates for president and some past presidential and vice presidential nominees the average consists of the most recent survey by each polling firm as listed at pollingreportcom and accounts for surveys going back to labor day , except in cases when fewer than three polling firms have released data on the politician since then , in which case i used all ratings since the start of 2010 the average score for ms pelosi was 30 percent favorable and 55 percent unfavorable , giving her a net favorability rating of negative25 this was the worst score of any politician in the study by some margin others with substantially net negative scores included dick cheney \( 17 \) , harry reid \( 16 \) , sarah palin \( 14 \) , newt gingrich \( 10 \) and george w bush \( 9 his numbers have improved some \) , but ms pelosi s scores were somewhat worse over all mr boehner is not yet terribly well known to the american public , but so far he has an average favorability rating of 26 percent and an unfavorability rating also of 26 percent by contrast , ms pelosi s scores when she became majority leader in 2007 were on the order of 30 percent favorable and 25 percent unfavorable if we expanded to the playing field to include some politicians who no longer play a prominent national role , we might find some with comparably bad ratings to ms pelosi john edwards , after admitting to an affair , had an average rating of negative28 in two polls conducted in late 2009 , although nobody has bothered to survey him this year tom delay s scores averaged about a negative25 at the time he left office in 2006 , although he was less wellknown at that time than ms pelosi is now a party leader s principal goal isn t necessarily to be popular , and ms pelosi was exceptionally successful at advancing legislation through the house in 2009 and 2010 , whipping votes to pass a stimulus package , an energy bill , and a health care bill \( twice ! \) , among many other pieces of the democratic agenda still , the role of the party leader changes when a party goes from being in the majority to the minority and it noteworthy that , of the several reasons that jonathan allen and john f harris at politico cite for why ms pelosi is likely to retain her top position in spite of her poor public image , almost none have to do with any tactical or strategic advantage the democrats might gain from selecting her instead , they have to do with institutional politics
from today s times washington daybook
playwrights justly lament the incredible shrinking of the american theater as the costs of producing have risen over the last few decades , the plays being regularly produced have been getting smaller and smaller a cast of five actors now seems deluxe at an off broadway theater , and stories are rife of literary managers and dramaturges gently suggesting to playwrights that their work might be more marketable if they could airbrush out a few more characters but the truism that less is more is as viable an argument in theater as it is in other aesthetic realms strictly speaking , all that is required to create a potent dramatic event is two characters put a pair onstage , and you automatically have a relationship , and from the complicated ways in which two people relate to each other can grow myriad dramatic developments the people up there will connect or they will conflict , and the result will be any of a number of compelling possibilities betrayal , conciliation , destruction , erotic attraction in the theater season just concluding , just about all of those potentialities were explored in a virtual minifestival of twoperson plays the bigstar bang of the fall season on broadway was a steady rain , in which no supporting players were skulking around the stage to get in the way of the audience worshiping the two manly movie stars hugh jackman and daniel craig another twoman play , john logan s red , featuring alfred molina as the painter mark rothko and eddie redmayne as his assistant , is a top contender for the best play tony award women were not left out of the picture entirely , i'm happy to report linda lavin and sarah paulson enact an artistacolyte relationship akin to the one depicted in mr logan s play in the engaging broadway revival of donald margulies s collected stories nor was the gendersplit tandem omitted david mamet s oleanna made a brief appearance on broadway in the fall , and one of the highlights of the spring season off broadway was david ives s savory comedydrama venus in fur , in which newcomer nina arianda made a spectacular debut as an actress asserting control over a playwright in the course of an erotically tinged audition twohanders , as twoperson plays are nicknamed in the trade , have a respectable history and a particular appeal and not just for acting classes the form could be said to date back to the greeks perhaps exhausted by all the oneman tragedies he had been enduring , aeschylus decided it was time for some innovation and added a second actor to the mix in 471 bc \( there was also the chorus of course \) for much of the rest of theater history , more was considered more , and the shakespearean model of amply filled stages held sway but minimalism was a hallmark of modernist theater of the mid20th century , which pared away much that was deemed inessential to depict the human experience to its essence samuel beckett s waiting for godot is fundamentally a twoman play , with a few guest stars another of his masterworks , happy days , contains just two characters \( really one and a half \) ionesco wrote brilliant absurdist pas de deux in the lesson and the chairs \( each has a walkon for a third character \) harold pinter and jean genet also experimented with the form , and edward albee s career ignited with the zoo story , about a fraught encounter between two men on a park bench so it s not just about economics , even today , but about the particular allure of seeing drama that s taut and tight , cut to the bone on some level many \( if not most \) twohanders are fundamentally about the problem of intimacy , the primal human need to connect with another , and the sorrows and satisfactions arising from this drive apparently hardwired into the psyche their potency arises from our recognition of this universal urge , conscious or not it may sound whimsical to suggest it , but all twohanders are in some sense love stories , dramatic analogues for the desire most feel to commune with just a single other soul you 'd never confuse the zoo story with a standard romance of course but the urgent need felt by the play s angry , loquacious jerry to impose his experience on another to have his existence ratified by the mildmannered peter drives his increasingly unhinged accosting of a total stranger it s a desperate attempt to escape alienation the twohanders seen this season are dramas that explore various levels of intimacy between their characters , even as some of them also expose the dramaturgical challenges of the form a steady rain told the love story of two chicago cops who 'd grown up together but find questions of ethics and loyalties tearing them apart they were not actual lovers , of course , but the play turned on the decision of the irishamerican cop played by mr craig to betray his lifelong buddy , the italianamerican played by mr jackman the problem with that play , by keith huff , was that , structurally speaking , it was n't really a twocharacter play at all , but a pair of monologues spliced together the cops rarely interacted in the course of the play , which meant that the essential appeal of the form watching conflict or connection was sacrificed almost entirely a solo show is by nature about telling us about something that has happened \( and there was a lot of telling in a steady rain \) , but most of us prefer theater that shows
it was on a sunday morning , june 13 , 1971 , that few readers may have been more excited than a circle of aspiring undergraduate journalists who 'd worked at the harvard crimson though the identity of the times s source would n't , we knew the whistleblower had to be daniel ellsberg , an intense research fellow at mit and former robert mcnamara acolyte who 'd become an antiwar activist around boston we recognized the papers' contents , as reported in the times , because we 'd heard the war stories from the loquacious ellsberg himself but if we were titillated that sunday , it was n't immediately clear that this internal government history of the war had mass appeal in the white house rose garden on saturday received equal play with the pentagon papers on the times s front page on face the nation the guest was the secretary of defense , melvin laird , yet the subject of the papers did n't even come up that false calm vanished overnight once richard nixon , erupting in characteristic rage and paranoia , directed his attorney general , john mitchell , the highstakes legal drama riveted the nation for two weeks , culminating in a landmark 6to3 supreme court decision in favor of the times and the first amendment ellsberg and the times were canonized i sold my first magazine article , an ellsberg profile , to esquire , and , for better or worse , cast my lot with journalism that my various phone conversations with ellsberg prompted hamfisted fbi agents to visit me and my parents only added to the allure i mention my personal history to try to inject a little reality into the garbling of vietnamera history that has accompanied the last week the left and right reached a rare consensus the war logs are no pentagon papers they are historic documents describing events largely predating the current administration they contain no news they will not change the course of the war about the only prominent figures who found serious parallels between then and now and , julian assange they are hardly disinterested observers , but they 're on the mark in large part because the impact of the pentagon papers on the vietnam war \( as opposed to their impact on the press \) was far less momentous than last week s chatter would suggest no , the logs wo n't change the course of our very long war in afghanistan , but neither did the pentagon papers alter the course of vietnam what ellsberg s leak did do was ratify the downward trendline of the war s narrative the wikileaks legacy may echo that we may look back at the war logs as a herald of the end of america s engagement in afghanistan just as the pentagon papers are now a milestone in our slomo exit from vietnam what was often forgotten last week is that the pentagon papers had no gamechanging news about that war either and also described events predating the thencurrent president by june 1971 , the tet offensive and walter cronkite s famous onair editorial were more than three years in the past the that inspired the best and the brightest had already appeared in harper s lt william calley had been found guilty in the my lai massacre exposed by seymour hersh in 1969 just weeks before the pentagon papers surfaced , by asking a senate committee , how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake \? most americans had long been by the time the pentagon papers surfaced , of how vietnam was handled by nixon , who had arrived in office promising to end the war the papers' punch was in the many inside details they added to the war s chronicle over four previous administrations and , especially , in their shocking and irrefutable evidence that nixon s immediate predecessor , lyndon johnson , had systematically lied to the country about his intentions and the war s progress though nixon was another liar , none of this incriminated him his anger about the leak would nonetheless drive him to create a clandestine plumbers unit whose criminality \( including a breakin at the office of ellsberg s psychiatrist \) would lead to watergate had nixon not so violently overreacted that june egged on by henry kissinger and fueled by his loathing of the times and the antiwar movement the story might have ebbed yes , the pentagon papers were labeled top secret but , as richard reeves writes in his book , some 700 , 000 people in and out of government had clearance to read top secret documents compelling as the papers were , they were hardly nuclear code the public s reaction to the afghanistan war logs has largely been a shrug and not just because they shared their with about chelsea clinton s wedding president obama is , to put it mildly , no nixon , and his nodrama reaction to the leaks robbed their publication of the constitutional cliffhanger of their historical antecedent another factor in the logs' shortfall as public spectacle is the fractionalization of the news media , to the point where even a stunt packaged as news can trump journalistic enterprise \( witness how the bogus shirley sherrod video upstaged of the american intelligence bureaucracy two weeks ago \) the logs also suffer stylistically they 're often impenetrable dispatches from the ground , in contrast to the pentagon papers' anonymously and lucidly teamwritten epic of policymaking on high yet the national yawn that largely greeted the war logs is most of all an indicator of the country s verdict on the afghan war itself , now that it s nine years on and has reached its highest monthly casualty rate for american troops many americans at home have lost faith and checked out the war places way down the list of pressing issues in every poll nearly twothirds of those think it s going badly finds support of obama s handling of afghanistan at a low \( 45 percent \) , with only 43 percent deeming the war worth fighting perhaps more telling than either these polls or the defection of liberal house democrats from are the signs of wobbling conservative support the gungho neocon axis was predictably belligerent in denouncing wikileaks but the gop chairman michael steele s recent gaffe his sinceretracted that a land war in afghanistan is doomed is no anomaly in a fractured party where the antiwar ron paul may have as much currency as the kneejerk hawk john mccain on the night of the logs' release , fox news even refrained from its patented shtick of shouting treason ! at the mainstream media instead , the goto timesbasher on the o 'reilly factor telling laura ingraham , a guest host , that the war has not been going well and is a dubious exercise in nationbuilding obama was right that the leaked documents do n't reveal any issues that have n't already informed our public debate in afghanistan , but that does n't mean the debate was resolved in favor of his policy americans know that our counterinsurgency partner , hamid karzai , is untrustworthy they know that the terrorists out to attack us are more likely to be found in pakistan , yemen and somalia than afghanistan and they are starting to focus on the morbid reality , highlighted in the logs , of the de facto moneylaundering scheme that siphons american taxpayers' money through the pakistan government to the taliban , who then disperse it to kill americans most americans knew or guessed the crux of the pentagon papers , too a full year earlier the 1964 gulf of tonkin resolution no one needed a top secret smoking gun by 1971 to know that lbj had lied about the tonkin incident the papers did n't change administration war policy because we were already pulling out of vietnam , however truculently and lethally \( the christmas 1972 bombing campaign , most notoriously \) in 1971 , was some 213 , 000 , down from a peak of 537 , 000 in 1968 by 1973  unlike nixon , obama is still adding troops to his unpopular war but history is not on his side either in afghanistan or at home the found that 58 percent of the country favors his announced timeline , with its promise to start withdrawing troops in mid2011 it s hard to imagine what could change that equation now certainly not pakistan as the president conducts his scheduled reappraisal of his war policy this december , a reexamination of 1971 might lead him to question his own certitude of what he is fond of calling the long view the times won a pulitzer prize for its 1971 pentagon papers coup but another of the pulitzers that year went to the columnist jack anderson , who also earned nixon s ire by mining other leaks to expose the white house s tilt to pakistan in the indopakistani war the one thing no one imagined back then was that four decades later it would be south asia , not southeast asia , that would still be beckoning america into a quagmire
trenton , nj since moving to this city from her native guatemala a decade ago , herlinda , an illegal immigrant , has supported her family with restaurant work , but has had no way of proving that she lives here without governmentissued photo identification , like a driver s license or a passport , she said , she could not get treatment at most medical clinics , borrow a book from the library , pick up a package from a mail center or cash a check but this month she discovered a solution a community identification card issued by a coalition of civic groups and endorsed by trenton and mercer county officials when you do n't have a proper id , they can humiliate you , said herlinda , 43 , as she waited in the offices of a church where the cards were being issued i feel i belong in trenton as a new law in arizona makes the failure to carry immigration documents a crime and spurs similar proposals in other states , trenton is one of a small but growing number of municipalities that have moved in the opposite direction making sure that illegal immigrants have documents to make their lives easier at least six city governments , including san francisco and new haven , now endorse or issue photo identification cards to residents the latest is princeton , nj , where advocates for immigrants , with the consent of both the borough and the township , will begin issuing cards on may 22 other new jersey communities have also expressed interest oakland , calif , has approved a program but has not yet started issuing cards in one sense , these liberal cities and arizona s conservative lawmakers are working toward the same thing , said maria juega , treasurer of the latin american legal defense and education fund , an advocacy group that spearheaded the id programs in trenton and princeton both camps , she said , are trying to fill the void created by congress s failure to fix a flawed immigration system these are reactions , ms juega said we 've had these gaping holes that everybody s been talking about for two decades and done nothing about everybody s scrambling calls for a nationally mandated identification card have been made for decades , particularly after 9 11 , but they received a push late last month when a group of democratic senators unveiled a blueprint for comprehensive immigration reform the plan includes a proposal to require all workers , including citizens , to show potential employers a card with biometric data , like fingerprints a measure meant to prevent illegal immigrants from working the local identity cards do not grant legal residency or the right to work they are intended to fold illegal immigrants into the fabric of the community by giving them entree to services and places that require some sort of recognized identification in trenton , immigrants can use their cards to access libraries , medical centers and doctors' offices seek help from charitable organizations and private social service agencies and use the city s public recreation centers and pools in addition , law enforcement officials say , the cards give illegal immigrants who fear detection and deportation more confidence about reporting crimes , and allow officials to help immigrants who are crime victims i believe that people who are here in america must be safe and must be healthy , said eve sanchez silver , the community and latino liaison for asbury park , nj , where a cityendorsed identity card program for illegal immigrants began in 2008 if they 're not safe , we 're not going to be safe if they 're not going to be healthy , we 're not going to be healthy while the programs in trenton , princeton and asbury park are endorsed by local law enforcement officials but administered by community organizations , new haven and san francisco themselves issue identity cards the cards allow access to even more services , including opening bank accounts this allows immigrants to deposit their pay checks , rather than carrying large amounts of cash that make them prey for thieves to keep the cards from becoming scarlet letters that mark illegal immigrants , they are offered to all residents , though they are mainly used by immigrants and the homeless a few states , including new mexico and washington , allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver s licenses , but the number has fallen as more states require proof of lawful presence in the country ira mehlman , spokesman for the federation for american immigration reform , which opposes illegal immigrants and proposals to give them legal status , described the local id card programs as attempts by the leadership of those communities to thwart enforcement of us immigration laws he added , it encourages people to stay in those communities , when in fact the policies ought to be discouraging those people but ms juega said she and her fellow advocates in trenton were motivated by a desire to allow this population that is increasingly marginalized to have some semblance of a normal life about 23 percent of trenton s 83 , 000 residents are immigrants , mostly latinos , according to the 2008 american community survey many do not have legal immigration documents , advocates say
washington revelations that rich iott , a republican congressional candidate from ohio , once whiled away time have not been fortunate for his candidacy he has been abandoned by a prominent member of his party , castigated by critics and may well be doomed as a politician let the political scholars debate whether this is the most contentious , partisan midterm election in modern memory , as some insist but there is widespread agreement that it is certainly among the strangest across the scores of house races across the country , there have been small settos , like whether kristi noem , the republican candidate for south dakota s house seat , has too many traffic citations then there are races with larger reverberations , like the contentious senate race in nevada the battle between senator harry reid , the democratic majority leader , whose constituents appear sour or at least unenthused about him , and an opponent who suggested that islamic law may take over a michigan city , is ripping apart the political fabric of the state political polarization , primary upsets and the have combined to make this a most unusual year the craziness has always been there in the ranks of american politics , said bruce cain , a professor of political science at the , berkeley until the 1960s , party bosses and elites filtered out the loonies in favor of the loyal foot soldiers , party hacks , relatives and the occasional talented person but , he said , with the demise of hometown papers and the rise of the internet , cable and talk radio , the new filters are way more porous while some tea party candidates have provided unintentional entertainment odd remarks and hobbies , financial problems , reclusiveness democrats have by no means come up empty for instance , if you are the democratic candidate for a senate seat and your state party declines to list your name on its web site , this is inauspicious um , well , when he got indicted our chairman decided to take him off our web site , said keiana page , a spokeswoman for the south carolina , referring to alvin greene , the unemployed candidate who now faces senator jim demint , a republican running for reelection on one count of disseminating , procuring or promoting obscenity and is accused of showing pornographic material to a female college student before we can throw our support greene s way , ms page said , we are asking him to get his legal issues resolved mr greene , in a telephone interview , was undaunted i 've been going out around the state letting people know that demint started the recession , he said , though he could not recall any counties he has visited \( what does it matter \? what matters is demint started the recession \) let none forget bob etheridge , the democratic congressman from north carolina who smacked at a camera being wielded by a student inquiring about his campaign positions in the metaweird category is the race to fill president obama s former senate seat currently held by roland w burris , who was appointed to the seat by gov rod r blagojevich of illinois after the governor s arrest that race is being fought between alexi giannoulias , a 34yearold democrat , whose family bank is accused of making loans to convicted felons , and mark steven kirk , a republican , who has admitted to embellishing his military accomplishments follow \? let s move on to political advertisements the one featuring the senate candidate assuring voters she is not a witch \( christine o 'donnell , from delaware \) was more momentous than the one with a candidate for minnesota governor citing his exwife s restraining order against him as a selling point but this is only because an independence party candidate in minnesota , rob hahn , flamed out in the primary in nevada , the senate race has become almost a metaphor for the embattled state many prominent republicans have declined to endorse the tea party candidate , sharron angle , causing some to attack one another publicly and ignoring the party s tradition of unity come campaign time the ugly ad wars and the frequent unorthodox remarks of ms angle , like her recent suggestion that dearborn , mich , and frankford , tex , are under threat of sharia law , have brought an unwelcome focus to nevada , which has spent years trying to become an important swing state some political experts argue that it is partisanship that explains this year s nutty flavor in the mid1990s , i foolishly thought political polarization could not be worse than it was , said william galston , a policy adviser in the clinton administration and elections expert for the brookings institution the center has disappeared

president obama is going to name alan k simpson , a former republican senator from wyoming , and erskine bowles , former chief of staff in the clinton white house , as the cochairmen of a bipartisan commission to recommend how to reduce high deficits that are building the national debt to perilous levels , according to a senior administration official mr obama is expected to announce his choices on thursday , these people say in an interview earlier on tuesday , mr simpson declined to address whether he had been approached about the job , but his frustration with the partisan impasse over fiscal policies was plain asked if he would serve on the commission if asked , mr simpson , reached in cody , wyo , said , i ll just say i m very frustrated and i can t believe what s happening to our country there isn t a single sitting member of congress , not one , that doesn t know exactly where we re headed , mr simpson continued and to use the politics of fear and division and hate on each other we are at a point right now where it doesn t make a damn whether you re a democrat or a republican if you ve forgotten you re an american democratic officials said mr simpson would be critical to helping give the presidential commission credibility and to undercut congressional republicans complaints that it would be a partisan democratic panel , designed to force tax increases mr simpson , who served in the senate from 1979 to 1997 and rose to be the secondranking republican leader , was widely known as an outspoken senator who could be cantankerous or funny , and did not shirk from partisanship with characteristic folksiness , mr simpson in the interview dismissed claims from republicans that reining in deficits would be easy or accomplished with spending cuts alone but they don t cut spending , he said , citing the administration of president george w bush when republicans also controlled congress don t forget the republicans never vetoed a single bill in six and a half years how is that for cutting spending \? to say that all we have to do is take care of waste , fraud and abuse , and foreign aid is a like a sparrow s belch in the midst of typhoon , he said that is nothing , less than 1 percent of the budget mr bowles , as a moderate democratic businessman from north carolina , was a voice for centrist policies in his years as an adviser to mr clinton he ran unsuccessfully for the senate afterward and now is president of the university of north carolina system the commission that mr obama plans would have 18 members , 10 democrats and 8 republicans the president would name one other republican and three additional democrats , none of whom would be administration officials or lawmakers for the remaining 12 members , the leaders of both parties in the house and senate each would choose three lawmakers the commission would try to recommend by december after the midterm elections how to balance the budget by the fiscal year 2015 , not counting interest payments on the debt those are projected to be nearly 3 percent of the gross domestic product that year , a size that most economists say is the maximum acceptable also , mr obama wants a commission to propose longer term changes in revenues and the entitlement programs to rein in a debt projected to be 77 percent of the economy s output by 2020 a supermajority of 14 of the 18 members would have to concur to reach a deal

greenburgh , ny in another dimension , might have attended a news conference on monday to officially introduce the newest member of the  but that dream was demolished when james instead  so walsh moved on he , and on monday he introduced four other players he acquired late last week the freeagent point guard raymond felton , formerly a charlotte bobcat , and anthony randolph , ronny turiaf and kelenna azubuike , all obtained in a signandtrade deal with golden state for david lee missing was timofey mozgov , if nothing else , the 7foot1 mozgov is bigger than the nets' new , and very tall , russian owner , mikhail d prokhorov i'm really happy , walsh , the team s president , said at the news conference , even if he was exaggerating a bit i wanted to after we got amar'e and that part of free agency ended i wanted to make sure that we could build a team that made sense i think between the trade opportunity we had with golden state , raymond felton and timofey mozgov , we 're approaching that right now the 6foot1 felton is a serviceable point guard and a capable defender the 610 randolph , who turns 21 on thursday , brings plenty of promise , and the 610 turiaf and 65 azubuike provide some needed depth you 've got to be able to play big and small , walsh said you have to have both entities , and we have that opportunity with this team it is an upgrade , but not the largescale upgrade walsh or knicks fans were hoping might occur then again , who knew that james , dwyane wade and chris bosh would all opt for miami in a move some speculate might have been hatched years ago it s something new to me , but it s probably something born of the ages , walsh said of the notion that the three players decided some time ago to play together these guys play against each other in aau they pick their aau teams , so why not pick their pro teams \? for now , a starting five comprising felton , stoudemire , danilo gallinari , wilson chandler and either randolph , turiaf or mozgov is certainly not the nba s best , but it is not the nba s worst , either qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 20034 seems like an obtainable goal felton already aided one franchise turnaround while helping the bobcats to the playoffs last season after a number of dismal years there a similar challenge presents itself in new york it s the same thing i want to do here , he said walsh said he inquired about felton s availability last season only to be rebuffed by bobcats coach larry brown i ca n't trade his heart , was brown s response , walsh said walsh estimated that the knicks were still 2 million to 3 million below next season s salary cap of 5804 million they are mostly done revamping their roster , said walsh , who also cautioned reporters about overemphasizing future free agents , most notably denver s carmelo anthony , who is only signed through the coming season when you finish this , do n't go out and say a name and then for two years or one year , we 're all focused on that one name , walsh said the guys i'm bringing in here now are meant to come here and stay here in other words , they 're the kinds of players that you want even if you did have the cap flexibility to go out and get another player , so it is n't like everyone should be looking over their shoulders i think the days of just basically making deals for cap space , for the most part , are over there is some curiosity over mozgov , whom the knicks acquired stealthily turiaf said he played against him in last year s european championship after that game i played well but after that game i was kind of tired playing against a big dude like that , turiaf said he was chasing me , too , he added with a smile i'm a little gazelle i'm a little antelope when i want to be randolph , the 14th overall pick in the 2008 draft , may harbor the most potential of any player the knicks acquired in the last week age , youth , playing time , all the above , i think , walsh responded when asked what limited randolph in golden state in turn , randolph voiced his own appreciation for the chance to play in new york the sky s the limit , he said actually , the sky may not be the limit but for the first time in a while for the knicks , the ceiling may be somewhat raised rebounds none of the three players the knicks acquired from golden state was born in the united states ronny turiaf is from fort de france , martinique anthony randolph from worzbach , germany and kelenna azubuike from london the nets agreed to terms with jordan farmar , the former lakers backup point guard , on a threeyear contract he will be paired with the incumbent point guard , devin harris the nets also acquired anthony morrow from golden state in a signandtrade deal

newport , wales the ryder cup began producing winners and losers on saturday , and with the backlog of matches from friday s raininterrupted session , there was a surplus of both at celtic manor resort the americans built a 64 advantage after winning the opening fourball session and the expanded foursome session that followed it was an early , if far from definitive , coup for the united states captain , corey pavin his wildcard picks , including stewart cink and , enjoyed consistent success and his surprise decision to put the ryder cup rookies bubba watson and jeff overton together produced an early upset victory in the fourballs over the much more experienced and decorated european pair of padraig harrington and luke donald but there was a big momentum shift before nightfall when the european team started the third session with a roar , taking the lead in all six matches none were completed when play was suspended i 'd say it was n't a bad thing that it got dark , pavin said woods and his partner steve stricker , who had won twice together earlier in the day , were in the deepest trouble four holes down after nine holes in their foursome match against donald and lee westwood , one of the european team s pivotal figures soon to be the world s secondranked player behind woods , westwood did not play competitive golf for nearly two months before this cup in order to rehabilitate a lingering calf injury though he put the time to productive use , swearing off alcohol and losing more than 15 pounds while working out in the gym , the cup s expanded schedule was still a demanding proposition , particularly in the soggy conditions that made a walk feel more like a slog i feel like i 've played seven tournaments today , said westwood , who is wearing an ankle brace during play here the biggest early disappointment for the united states was the performance of phil mickelson and dustin johnson , who were beaten convincingly in the fourballs and the foursomes , otherwise known as alternate shot but the other 10 american players all contributed to the point total , with woods and stricker doing the most mathematical damage woods and stricker were 40 as a team in last year s presidents cup competition , when the united states defeated a selection of international golfers from outside europe on saturday , with stricker proving the more reliable force , they finished a twohole victory over ian poulter and ross fisher in fourball , then were even more convincing in a 4and3 victory in foursomes over 46yearold miguel ngel jim nez of spain and his inexperienced swedish partner , peter hanson the suspended matches are scheduled to resume at 7 45 am local time , and ryder cup organizers will attempt to complete this competition as scheduled with the singles on sunday afternoon heavy rain is forecast for early sunday , however , with lighter rain to follow the americans ended up with an early lead , 2 to 1 , when the opening session finally ended at 10 45 am saturday watson and overton became the first american ryder cup rookies to win an opening session match since andy bean and lee elder did so in 1979 their 3and2 victory was brimming with back slaps and infectious enthusiasm , but donald , the best of the europeans in defeat , responded in the afternoon with a terrific tee shot on the par3 17th that allowed him and poulter to finish a 2up victory over watson and overton the europeans also got a victory in the afternoon from harrington and fisher , who defeated mickelson and johnson , 3and2 the final match of the foursome session appeared to be swinging in the european direction , when the allnorthern ireland pair of graeme mcdowell and rory mcilroy took a onehole lead over cink and matt kuchar with three holes to play but cink , the thoughtful 2009 british open champion , proceeded to stamp his talent on this match , making a fine approach shot at no 16 that kuchar putted in for birdie from about six feet to even the score on the 17th , with the europeans much closer to the hole after their tee shots , cink made a 25foot birdie putt that rattled mcilroy enough that he missed his own birdie putt from about five feet in ryder cups , those are like poison darts , cink said of his long putt on 17 cink and kuchar were in front and stayed there after mcilroy mishit an approach shot at the 18th that finished in a bunker and left him yanking his cap over his eyes cink and kuchar also played mcilroy and mcdowell , this year s champion , in the opening fourball session and ended up halving that match in all , it was a fine start for kuchar and the other american rookies , including 21yearold rickie fowler , who sat out the opening session but then helped jim furyk rally to halve their foursomes match with westwood and martin kaymer , the athletic german who won the pga championship in august the intergenerational american pair had misadventures they lost the fourth hole when fowler played the wrong ball he made the mistake after furyk s drive had landed in the mud that entitled the americans to relief , but instead of dropping furyk s ball , he pulled one from his pocket and incorrectly put it into play when you play alternate shot , it s just funny things can happen , pavin said b
putting together the fall for dance festival s five programs ca n't be easy there has to be a mix of dance styles , of wellknown and unknown names , of length and pace , difficulty and ease sometimes it just does n't work out very well on saturday at city center , the third program seemed ingratiatingly audienceappealing and thin in comparison with some of the vibrant juxtapositions of work that fall for dance has presented in the past first on was shuyi \( dancers \) company this taiwanese troupe won sadler s wells 2009 global dance contest , beating out 170 other at its start , the winning work , 1875 ravel and bolero , looks promising a group of dancers stands on a carpet of bright green leaves in a diagonal band of light , facing upstage in silence they turn and form two lines , a fan gently blowing their hair and an occasional leaf as the opening chords of carmina burana sound , they suddenly fall to their knees , screaming wildly until the sound becomes laughter the leaves , the repetitive falling screaming laughing they do it over and over again are initially arresting and vaguely reminiscent of pina bausch s naturalworld stagescapes and compressed dramas of human oddity the affinities persist as the group subsequently tries to attract the attention of a dreamy , vacanteyed woman by screaming close to her , posing momentarily as if for a photograph and throwing handfuls of the green stuff around but shuyi chou , one of the founders of the promising allmale company horse , seen , does n't convincingly evoke a coherent theatrical universe from these activities they feel arbitrary and aesthetic , with no particular connection sincere or ironic to ravel s bolero , which starts up a few minutes into the piece worse , the choreography is thin there is a lot of running around , a lot of falling , a lot of swirling and very occasional moments of dance interest \( notably a kneeknocking female solo \) , and none of it is sustained long enough to make much of an impression we do n't have to know exactly why they are running , screaming , falling and kicking leaves but we do have to feel that the choreographer knows why , and mr shuyi does n't convince us of that next came two san francisco ballet members , yuan yuan tan and damian smith , in a pas de deux from yuri possokhov s diving into the lilacs mr possokhov , the company s resident choreographer , seems unclear here whether he wants to be traditional or contemporary the work is filled with yearning and swooning , and attractively struck arabesques , then occasionally a derriere stuck in the air and a leg swung around the ears ms tan is gorgeous , but seems a little too aware of her gorgeousness , and mr smith mostly does honorable partnering duty the best piece of the evening was emanuel gat s my favorite things , a solo danced by roy assaf to the john coltrane interpretation of the rodgers and hammerstein song hands circling face and head , arms looping in and out from the waist , legs suddenly buckling into lunges at first the solo seems slight , even inconsequential , but mr gat who also created the design of four subtly shaded bands of light that allow mr assaf intermittently to halfdisappear builds these images into something more resonant perhaps moments from daily life , perhaps a soldier inching forward across a barren desert soldiers are present too in paul taylor s 1991 company b , which sets its perky dances to andrews sisters songs against shadowy evocations of war and death on saturday michael trusnovec was suddenly compelling in oh johnny , but the rest of the work skated lightly along the surface of the songs it was crowdpleasing , and the crowd was pleased it would have been nice to feel stirred too

president obama hosted a luncheon on thursday for newly elected governors across the street from the white house at blair house , where he promised to work closely with them to fix the economy and improve education over the next two years but while ohio s incoming republican governor , john kasich , was among the nearly two dozen state chief executives at the lunch , the democrat he beat in november , gov ted strickland , was not left out in the cold in fact , he got a personal visit with the president hours earlier in the oval office , the only governor singled out for such special attention mr strickland has been an energetic ally for mr obama in an important battleground state and the president campaigned for him repeatedly this fall , albeit in vain an oval office visit may not be much of a consolation prize , but it was a public way for the president to show his appreciation and respect for a political friend who helped him out so much at the blair house lunch , mr obama and vice president joseph r biden jr vowed to put aside partisanship and work with the governors through the many issues now confronting them many in the audience were , like mr kasich , republicans who unseated democrats by running against mr obama and his initiatives , and some have vowed to resist his expansion of federal programs like the new health care law we have just had a very vigorously contested election , but the election is over , mr obama told them and now i think it s time for all of us to make sure that we re working together i am a very proud democrat , as some of you in the room are although not as many as i had expected some of you are very proud republicans but we re all prouder to be americans mr obama encouraged them to make their states laboratories for democracy but said there still must be basic national standards that everyone will have to meet he encouraged them to tell him what works and what does not contrary to the mythology , believe it or not , it turns out that i would love to eliminate programs that don t work , he said and you guys are the ones oftentimes who are implementing them four new governors later told white house reporters that they welcomed his promises of cooperation and acknowledged that they do not expect much financial help from washington in meeting their own budget problems none of the 50 governors are living under the illusion that there s going to be hundreds of millions more dollars coming our way , said governorelect peter shumlin , democrat of vermont but despite the heated rhetoric during the campaign , the governors said none of them challenged mr obama directly during the closeddoor portion of the meeting governorelect dan malloy , democrat of connecticut , who criticized the white house after his election last month for doing a particularly weak job telling its side of the story , told reporters thursday that the blair house session was cordial i don t think anyone engaged the president , he said none of us are members of the press
david herndon is a 24yearold righthanded reliever for the who , before the seventh inning tuesday night , had 19 career appearances he had never faced anyone on the and yet we know herndon probably better than he does , the hitting coach kevin long said francisco cervelli from herndon into left field for a tworun single , continuing an individual and teamwide trend the yankees are , far and away , the most productive team in baseball this season with the bases loaded , and no one in their starstudded lineup has enjoyed more success in that situation than cervelli asked for an explanation , cervelli offered just one word preparation , he said before each series , the yankees are given a detailed breakdown of every member of the opposing pitching staff whatever a pitcher s goto pitch is with runners in scoring position , a hitter knows it every day during batting practice , long calls out situations man on second with one out , first and third with two outs to force hitters into the right mindset the bases are loaded for the final four pitches when long took over as hitting coach in 2007 , he had his hitters practice squeezing during batting practice he phased that out because , as he noted , the yankees never squeeze instead , he simulated basesloaded situations you find ways to become better , long said to take 4 of your 30 swings with the bases loaded is relevant cervelli , who was 6 for 8 with 15 runs batted in with the bases loaded , said the drill helped his approach in looking for a pitch he can drive alex rodriguez had 16 rbi , the most in baseball , and he had also hit two grand slams cervelli has none the yankees , because of their versatile and talented lineup , may be more likely than other teams to load the bases and , thus , have more chances to perform it does not hurt that their 366 overall onbase percentage was the best in baseball as a team , the 429 \( 36 for 84 \) with 6 grand slams and 99 rbi , all tops in the majors nobody tries to be a hero , cervelli said we all know what we can do , but if we do n't do it , we know the next guy will through its first 30 games , yankee stadium is still a launching pad just not as much as it was in its inaugural season according to the elias sports bureau , the stadium has yielded 79 homers \( 43 by the yankees \) compared with 110 \( 61 by the yankees \) at the same stage last season , a 28 percent decrease on average , 263 homers have been hit per game at yankee stadium , the thirdhighest rate this season , behind chase field in arizona \( 294 \) and miller park in milwaukee \( 270 \) there were 237 homers hit last season at yankee stadium , breaking the previous team record of 215 in 2005 the one thing that sticks out in my mind is it carried well the first six weeks , manager said , referring to 2009 , and i did n't necessarily see that the first six weeks of this season as for reasons behind the decrease , it is possible that the demolition of the old yankee stadium changed the wind currents girardi also cited the weather and the style of pitchers the yankees have faced as possible factors alex rodriguez returned to his customary cleanup spot in the yankees' lineup wednesday , but as the designated hitter , not the third baseman until he regains full mobility in his hip flexor , rodriguez will continue to dh , joe girardi said we watched him take ground balls yesterday and i just did n't think he had the lateral movement that we wanted to see quite yet , girardi said kevin russo started at third base rodriguez engaged in baseballrelated activities tuesday for the first time in five days , and the yankees came away satisfied enough with his hitting to insert him back in the lineup getting loose has been a problem for rodriguez , who in the downtime between atbats will ride an exercise bike and have someone stretch him girardi acknowledged that rodriguez s diminished mobility could be an issue on the basepaths usually , from my experience , if you take five days off as a player and you go out there , that does n't necessarily mean that you feel fresh , girardi said sometimes you feel sluggish , actually , because your body s so used to moving every day when you do n't move every day , you feel kind of strange cito culver reinforced his desire to begin his professional career quickly by passing on his scholarship to the university of maryland culver , the yankees' firstround draft pick , told the rochester democrat and chronicle that he was flying wednesday to the yankees' complex in tampa , fla agreeing to a contract would be the next logical step , but culver cannot officially sign it until after he graduates from high school on sunday
de la salle and foreman high schools battled for the 4a state basketball sectional semifinals march 10 in a packed maywood gym , but in many ways , the most interesting action was unfolding in the north bleachers there , two rows up from the floor , daniel poneman held court in his usual fashion every few moments , mr poneman stood up to greet someone he knew , and by the end of the evening , it seemed as if he had exchanged handshakes and hugs with half of those in attendance the gym was one giant flowchart before him even as mr poneman tracked the action , a recruiter from purdue , a local basketball legend , and a former foreman coach who has since moved to niles north high school all passed very noticed before mr poneman s welltrained eyes i really would n't call him a scout , said nate pomeday , an assistant coach at oregon state i would call him more of a professional networker mr poneman , 18 , and now , not quite a year after graduation from evanston township high school , puts none of this to waste for four years now , he has used his preternatural ability to collect information and rub elbows to create a web site and network relied upon by college coaches as an essential tool for recruiting illinois players and now , not quite a year after his high school graduation , he is weeks away from inaugurating a national web site focused on appraising high school athletes , primarily for the benefit of college coaches mr poneman works nearly without pause skipping sleep two nights a week , he said , and living in a spartan bachelor pad in lincoln park yet none of it , so far , has made him much money his web site takes in some advertising from google but is barely profitable even a showcase tournament he plans to host late this month will net only about 8 , 000 my only expense is living , mr poneman said i do n't buy any luxuries , and i sacrifice everything else still , mr poneman is building something he hopes will be more valuable over time a network of people that , in mr poneman s view , have economic value over time my goal is not to make as much money as possible now but to build as much capital as possible , he said eventually , i will be able to transfer that capital for now , that capital takes the form of his facebook page , where he has 4 , 300 friends , and his uploads to youtube , where his player interviews and scouting videos have drawn 500 , 000 page views in just seven months mr poneman has 2 , 000 contacts stuffed into his cellphone directory he hopes to begin cashing in on the networking efforts in three weeks , when he inaugurates the new web site , tentatively titled though he keeps his revenue model and most other details private , mr poneman said he had enlisted seven writers from around the country to contribute and was gearing the site to have a national focus like and  the strategy all happened itself , he said i did n't come up with it only after it was in motion could i see what it was that i was doing when mr poneman set off on this path four years ago , he was a novelty a white , suburban , jewish kid with braces making his mark in the chicago prep basketball scene videos of postgame player interviews on the web site he created , , won a strong following of a few thousand daily readers , among them players and coaches in chicago , and college recruiters around the country he has built from there along the way , he has not lost sight of what originally attracted him to his work his ability to provide exposure and opportunity for lesserknown players in illinois and , eventually , perhaps other states all the same stuff gets written over and over , said mr poneman , who is from evanston , so the same kids get overexposed but there are so many kids who need the help because fans do n't want to read them the challenge now , he said , is to prove he made the right decision when he decided to forgo college i would not skip college just so i could become a basketball scout and make money , he said i would only make that choice if there was a larger impact i could make at the heart of his efforts , mr poneman said , is a desire to help as many local athletes as he can to parlay their talents into college scholarships his march 28 tournament is designed to showcase lesserknown players to coaches from mid and lowerlevel college programs he expects more than 100 athletes to participate at the oneday event in deerfield his whole outlook , his vision , is different than a lot of everybody else s , said sundance wicks , an assistant coach at northern illinois university he is not just about the kids who are going big time he is going to help a kid who might not have a chance or a look , and he is giving to them an outlet , a chance to be seen
chase stuart contributes to and to  three months ago , the sports media had three things to say about the jaguars 1 \) can you believe jacksonville drafted tyson alualu instead of tim tebow \? 2 \) when is this team moving to los angeles \? 3 \) how is jack del rio still the coach \? jacksonville might have been the blandest team in the league , with possibly the most apathetic fan base but with an 85 record in middecember , none of the above matters with a win on sunday against the colts , jacksonville would wrap up its first division title since tom coughlin s squad won its third straight afc central crown in 1999 with the jaguars all but ignored in the national media , you might be wondering how the jags are winning games this year there s only one answer to that unconventionally jacksonville s pass defense is miserable , fluctuating weekly with the texans for last place in net yards per attempt allowed and adjusted net yards per attempted allowed the jaguars are tied with the broncos and the vikings for the honor of worst turnover margin , unthinkable for an offense that leads the league in rushing attempts and jacksonville has been outscored by 36 points , after being blown out by three touchdowns or more in four games this season if the jaguars win one more game , they ll become just the fourth team since 1940 to have a winning record despite four losses of 21 points or more despite a terrible pass defense , its struggles to hold on to the ball or to take it away from its opponents , and the decision to seemingly skip every third game , jacksonville can clinch the division with two weeks to play how \? the obvious person to look to is maurice jonesdrew , the running back who ranks second in the league in both rushing yards and yards from scrimmage but arian foster leads the league in those two categories , and the texans pass defense is just as bad , so there s more to the story david garrard is having a solid but unspectacular season his best attribute this season has been the ability to limit all his bad plays to games the jaguars are going to lose anyway in losses to the giants , eagles and chargers , garrard has thrown six interceptions with one touchdown while averaging just 50 yards per attempt he was injured early in the jaguars flop against the titans and didn t play when the team allowed 42 points to the chiefs meanwhile , in seven of jacksonville s victories , garrard has thrown for 17 touchdowns with just two interceptions while averaging 90 yards per attempt for the most part , jacksonville has had the benefit of good fortune and good timing in week 1 , brandon lloyd s second foot grazed the end zone sideline , negating a potential gametying touchdown late in the fourth quarter three weeks later , the jaguars defeated the colts thanks to josh scobee s 59yard field goal as time expired in week 10 , it was glover quin and mike thomas teaming up to convert a desperation pass to beat the texans the next week they turned the ball over six times , but maurice jonesdrew picked the right time to rev up his espy campaign with just over two minutes left , jonesdrew took a screen pass 75 yards to the cleveland 1yard line , weaving across the field and breaking four tackles in one of the highlights of the year their overall numbers are underwhelming but so far , the jaguars have been able to consolidate the bad plays to a few games , while making their biggest plays when it counts most both jonesdrew and rashad jennings rushed for over 100 yards against the raiders on sunday , but the team still needed deji karim s 65yard kickoff return in the final minutes to put away the raiders the unquestioned strength of the team is red hot the jags have topped the 200yard rushing mark in each of the last three weeks awaiting them on sunday the 29thranked rushing defense in indianapolis if jacksonville makes the playoffs , what can we expect \? since 1990 , only three teams have made the playoffs despite being outscored by 25 points or more the 2004 rams , playing in one of the league s alltime terrible divisions , went 88 and earned a wild card berth the rams swept the seahawks in the regular season and then defeated them in the first round of the playoffs , before getting steamrolled by mike vick and the falcons in the second round the 1998 arizona cardinals perhaps the worst playoff team ever played the easiest schedule in the league and were outscored by 53 points but then the cards managed to go into dallas , where they had lost by 28 points in week 1 , and upset the cowboys in the first round of the playoffs they lost , 4121 , to the vikings the next week the 94 bears were outscored by 36 points but went into minnesota and won in the first round of the playoffs they were obliterated by the 49ers the following week , 4415 like those three teams , the jaguars have been inconsistently good , and are prone to surprise wins and blowout losses in the regular season there s nothing to say that that trend won t continue in the playoffs going up \? going down the jets and patriots couldn t be heading in more opposite directions since their clash on monday night football if you thought new england was on a recordbreaking pace , you were right on thanksgiving day , maurice morris rushed for a thirdquarter touchdown to give detroit a 2417 lead since then , the patriots have been invincible deion branch and tom brady responded with a 79yard touchdown in the fourth quarter , the patriots outscored the lions , 210 then new england beat the jets , 453 at halftime against the bears this weekend , the pats were up , 330 that s a sevenquarter run in which new england outscored its opponents , 993 from 1960 to 2009 , only nine teams have outscored opponents by at least 80 points over a sevenquarter stretch , and none by as large a margin as the 2010 pats the jets are coming off two incredibly deflating losses they followed up the disaster in foxborough with one of the leastinspiring offensive performances of the last 30 years the defense held miami to 10 points all scored off turnovers and only six first downs , while giving the offense 15 possessions to win the game but the jets offense was miserable , and new york became just the second team since 1978 to lose a game when allowing so few first downs and points the first \? the ryan leaf led san diego chargers , in 1998 against the raiders leaf is not the quarterback from his draft the jets brass wants mark sanchez to emulate in four losses , the jets have scored a total of 18 points since 1950 , few teams have scored fewer points per game in their losses the jets travel to pittsburgh this week , home of the league s top run defense it seems inconceivable , but the jets could lower their average after this week
daytona beach , fla the crowd around swelled as she walked toward her trailer saturday night after finishing sixth in her stock car debut behind bobby gerhart , a sixtime winner here although five racers beat patrick to the finish line at the lucas oil slick mist 200 , an arca series event in stock car racing s minor leagues at daytona international speedway , none won more respect patrick , the first woman to win an indycar race , kept her cool in a crashmarred race , maneuvering her chevrolet around dustups as if she had been driving stock cars for several years rather than several weeks one of six women to start the race , she was the first of the three who finished alli owens , who won the outside pole last year , was third late in the race but hit an oil slick , spun out and slipped to 23rd on the 54th lap of the 80lap race , patrick was involved in a mishap that precipitated the day s fifth yellow flag running on the inside , she was pinched off the track by nelson piquet while coming off a turn patrick s car spun and crossed the startfinish line heading in the wrong direction but she managed to stay clear of the other drivers and straighten her car out she worked her way up from 29th to eighth and then , in the final laps , pulled outside and passed two cars i felt pretty good , patrick said , adding , and then at the end i was running eighth and i thought , what the heck \? ' so i pulled out of the line and ran high patrick was praised for the way she handled the conditions in general , and specifically the collision with piquet s toyota on the telecast , darrell waltrip , the 1989 daytona 500 winner , said , i do n't think anybody can say she ca n't drive a stock car patrick did nothing on the track to dispel the notion that she will enter next saturday s nationwide series race at daytona , a decision she will reveal monday she said earlier in the week that her decision would not be based on her final placing it s going to be more off the feeling that i have , and how little mistakes i make and how comfortable i was with the different situations , said patrick , who has agreed to race part time for jr motorsports in the nationwide series , nascar s secondtier circuit starting in the sixth row alongside frank kimmel , a ninetime arca champion , patrick ran as high as fifth before her spinout she handled a loose car and passed others on the outside like a seasoned pro it was only two months ago that she began a crash course on driving a stock car , starting with basic terminology , from her crew chief , tony eury jr i learned a lot and i had so much fun in a racecar today , patrick said so i ca n't wait to do it again the arca race was part of a speedway tripleheader that started with pole qualifying for the daytona 500 and concluded with the budweiser shootout , a sprint cup exhibition race the hendrick motorsports teammates mark martin and earned spots on the front row for next weekend s race at 51 , martin became the oldest polesitter in daytona 500 history , with a lap of 191188 miles per hour during the morning qualifying it was the first time in 26 tries that martin has won the pole for nascar s seasonopening race , but he had no illusions about his place on the day s marquee i'm still under the radar compared to danica , he said , adding , that s cool a few hours before the race , patrick appeared at a news conference for hot wheels , one of her sponsors , which will unveil a toy car later in the year that patrick designed the danicar after the race , gerhart watched a sea of people pass his trailer and said , i would have thought they were coming to me , but it did n't work out that way he was smiling as he spoke i'm glad she was here , really , he said
while the bagger blogs away in los angeles , the baguette has been working the phones in new york here are how some of today s best actresses , all firsttime nominees , reacted when they heard the oscar news carey mulligan , best actress nominee for an education , which also earned nods for best picture and best adapted screenplay for nick hornby , watched the announcements by herself at home in la when she heard her name , i didn t react , she said it was too much of a shock , i think it was when i starting seeing the other nominations , like the best picture nomination and nick s for screenplay , that i started sort of screaming she added that the film s success was completely unexpected it was not a film that we ever thought would be seen by this many people it was a difficult film to finance and it took a really long time we had no expectations it would get a distributor it was a six and a half week shoot , very low budget and we were on the run , and it wasn t a film that we thought would get any of this kind of attention not because of lack of quality , just because it was tiny  sandra bullock , best actress nominee for the blind side , which was a surprise inclusion for best picture , said she wouldn t deviate from her day of mundane chores dogwalking , gymgoing to celebrate i like the way it came to me , unexpected , she said i always thought that people planned this that it was very strategically thought out when i choose this project it s an oscar performance and i hear that a lot you know , this is going to get them an oscar and it s a very important piece of work but nobody said anything like that when i was saying no to the blind side ms bullock said she was initially reluctant to take the part , based on a reallife southern matriarch who takes in a homeless black teenager i said , if i m allowed the time to prepare and make this real , make her grounded , where she s not chewing up the scenery on film , i ll try this , ms bullock said and the first week of shooting was the worst week i ve ever had it didn t click none of the preparation clicked and week 2 it did , but i regretted having taken the film and then week 2 , i guess , three months of all the stuff finally clicked it s like building a car and then you drive it and there s gonna be things that don t work i really regretted the moment of having said yes , because i thought i was going to be responsible for destroying this man s twoyear journey to tell this story though ms bullock has won other awards this season , she acknowledged that the oscars were the big prize the oscars are , we feel the pressure from the outside in and it s from the buzz and the hype and all those things that come with it , she said you really have to take yourself out of it because you ve already done your job everything else is beyond your control , and i just want to enjoy the moment and not let anything get too big i m not going to start developing some obscure accent she added i m ready to experience the backlash , which you know is coming any second now  mo nique , best supporting actress nominee and presumptive winner for precious based on the novel push by sapphire , said she thought of hattie mcdaniel , the first africanamerican to win an oscar \( for gone with the wind \) it s like wow ! mo nique said i m really appreciative to be in that category with that woman it s phenomenal she was amazing for what she did to the entertainment industry she brought people together through love mo nique said she gets hugs from strangers wherever she goes in airports and stores the bagger saw her get one backstage at the golden globes she called this reception a blessing then the intrepid baguette asked her if she was going to get any swag from the nomination i really believe at this point i ll be able to give my kids some stuff they love , she said , laughing spongebob , here we come
everyone has a theory about the financial crisis these theories range from the absurd to the plausible from claims that liberal democrats somehow forced banks to lend to the undeserving poor \( even though republicans controlled congress \) to the belief that exotic financial instruments fostered confusion and fraud but what do we really know \? well , in a way the sheer scale of the crisis the way it affected much , though not all , of the world is helpful , for research if nothing else we can look at countries that avoided the worst , like canada , and ask what they did right such as limiting leverage , protecting consumers and , above all , avoiding getting caught up in an ideology that denies any need for regulation we can also look at countries whose financial institutions and policies seemed very different from those in the united states , yet which cracked up just as badly , and try to discern common causes so let s talk about ireland as a by the irish economists gregory connor , thomas flavin and brian o'kelly points out , almost all the apparent causal factors of the us crisis are missing in the irish case , and vice versa yet the shape of ireland s crisis was very similar a huge real estate bubble prices rose more in dublin than in los angeles or miami followed by a severe banking bust that was contained only via an expensive bailout ireland had none of the american right s favorite villains there was no community reinvestment act , no fannie mae or freddie mac more surprising , perhaps , was the unimportance of exotic finance ireland s bust was n't a tale of collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps it was an oldfashioned , plainvanilla case of excess , in which banks made big loans to questionable borrowers , and taxpayers ended up holding the bag so what did we have in common \? the authors of the new study suggest four deep' causal factors first , there was irrational exuberance in both countries buyers and lenders convinced themselves that real estate prices , although skyhigh by historical standards , would continue to rise second , there was a huge inflow of cheap money in america s case , much of the cheap money came from china in ireland s case , it came mainly from the rest of the euro zone , where germany became a gigantic capital exporter third , key players had an incentive to take big risks , because it was heads they win , tails someone else loses in ireland this moral hazard was largely personal roguebank heads retired with their large fortunes intact there was a lot of this in the united states , too as harvard s lucian bebchuk and others have pointed out , top executives at failed us financial companies received billions in performance related pay before their firms went bellyup but the most striking similarity between ireland and america was regulatory imprudence the people charged with keeping banks safe did n't do their jobs in ireland , regulators looked the other way in part because the country was trying to attract foreign business , in part because of cronyism bankers and property developers had close ties to the ruling party there was a lot of that here too , but the bigger issue was ideology actually , the authors of the irish paper get this wrong , stressing the way us politicians celebrated the ideal of homeownership yes , they made speeches along those lines , but this did n't have much effect on lenders' incentives what really mattered was freemarket fundamentalism this is what led ronald reagan to declare that deregulation would solve the problems of thrift institutions the actual result was huge losses , followed by a gigantic taxpayer bailout and alan greenspan to insist that the proliferation of derivatives had actually strengthened the financial system it was largely thanks to this ideology that regulators ignored the mounting risks so what can we learn from the way ireland had a ustype financial crisis with very different institutions \? mainly , that we have to focus as much on the regulators as on the regulations by all means , let s limit both leverage and the use of securitization which were part of what canada did right but such measures wo n't matter unless they 're enforced by people who see it as their duty to say no to powerful bankers that s why we need an independent agency protecting financial consumers again , something canada did right rather than leaving the job to agencies that have other priorities and beyond that , we need a sea change in attitudes , a recognition that letting bankers do what they want is a recipe for disaster if that does n't happen , we will have failed to learn from recent history and we 'll be doomed to repeat it
fresh off a disastrous weekend in florida , the mets arrived in atlanta on monday to find they had been joined by none other than jeff wilpon , the team s chief operating officer , who proceeded to tell reporters that i didn t come here to fire anyone wilpon does not normally travel with the team , so his presence underlined the growing concern that the season is starting to slip away from the mets , who are 1820 he did not talk to reporters until he first spent much of the afternoon in manager jerry manuel s office meeting with manuel , general manager omar minaya and the team s assistant general manager , john ricco shortly before 4 pm , manuel poked his head out of the office , saw the assembled reporters standing nearby and , with a hearty laugh , said i ve got a uniform on , don t i \? it was manuel s characteristic way of dealing with the renewed speculation that he will be the first casualty if the mets slump continues wilpon , however , tried to dampen that speculation when he spoke to reporters shortly before 6 pm as his team prepared to play the braves in the first game of twogame series he said he had flown to atlanta because he wanted to hear first hand the ideas that team officials had on how to straighten things out what am i going to do , hide \? he asked rhetorically he denied that he was trying to create a crisis scenario around the club , saying if the team had been playing at home , reporters would not have even known he was meeting with team officials but by showing up , wilpon was able to convey the notion that he was taking a handson approach to the team s continuing problems last season , as things deteriorated sharply amid an onslaught of injuries and inept play , wilpon was criticized for rarely stepping forward to address the team s situation the monday meeting in which wilpon participated did result in several notable pitching decisions the righthander ra dickey , a 35yearold veteran who famously lacks an ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and who reinvented himself as a knuckleballer several years ago , is being called up from the mets class aaa buffalo team to start wednesday s game against the washington nationals dickey is taking the place of oliver perez , who has been exiled to the bullpen in the wake of his ineffectiveness meanwhile , hisanori takahashi , the japanese lefthander who has pitched effectively out of the bullpen for the mets , will start friday s game against the yankees at citi field takahashi will take the place of jon niese , who injured his right leg while pitching on sunday , the same leg that required surgery last season after he tore a hamstring niese s status remained unclear as monday night s game approached it s possible he will miss only one turn , but it s also possible that he will be placed on the disabled list but pitching is not the mets only problem jose reyes isn t hitting much and has had trouble doing something as simple as bunting a runner over , david wright continues to strike out at an alarming rate and the team , in the absence of carlos beltran , continues to lack a middleoftheorder lefthanded bat for the moment , that job has fallen to chris carter , who until recently was in the minor leagues
the lawsuits filed by the trustee seeking money for bernard l madoff s fraud victims may be a blow for the defendants but they are catnip for an obscure breed of wall street traders speculating on the outcome of the enormous madoff bankruptcy case in recent months , hedge funds and other investment firms have been quietly contacting madoff victims whose loss claims have been approved by the trustee , irving h picard these funds specialists in beatendown assets known as distressed securities are offering to buy those claims immediately for cash , but at a sharp discount from their face value with the latest round of bigticket lawsuits , however , that quiet market has started to sizzle virtually every sophisticated distressed investor is looking at the madoff situation , said thomas t janover , a lawyer at kramer levin naftalis frankel who has represented clients who are considering buying claims the uncertainty of the payout from the bankruptcy process creates an opportunity and potentially big returns the chances that the trustee will be able to collect more than the 2 billion he has gathered to date have increased in recent days with the filing of lawsuits against deeppocketed banks like jpmorgan chase , ubs and hsbc , among others but bankruptcy lawyers expect those legal fights will take years to resolve , with no guarantee of that any of the billions being sought will be recovered bankruptcy claims have traded on wall street for generations , and active markets have developed around other financial calamities like enron and lehman brothers the explosion in hedge funds and their pursuit of unusual investment strategies has expanded that traditional market in recent years for small investors who were caught in the madoff fraud and cannot afford to wait years for a recovery , the speculative buyers offer them cash now even larger investors may decide that it is prudent to take less cash upfront rather than hope for a bigger payoff in the future the distressed investors , however , are betting that the bankruptcy claims will be settled for more than what they appear to be worth now and they are hoping that madoff investors will allow them to take that bet one madoff investor , who declined to be identified to protect his privacy , reported receiving letters from no fewer than six companies in the last two months he provided copies of those letters , which offered to pay 20 to 345 cents for every dollar in claims the firms making those bids included contrarian capital management , a large greenwich , conn , hedge fund fulcrum credit partners of austin , tex and the hain capital group of rutherford , nj another madoff investor , burt ross of englewood , nj , said that 30 cents on the dollar was the highest offer he had received in recent months people need to understand that people who are offering 30 cents are savvy professionals who fully expect to get 50 to 60 cents when the claims are finally paid , mr ross said they 're not offering 30 cents because they expect to get 35 and it is not just individual madoff investors who are willing to cut deals with the speculators a large hedge fund recently paid about 30 cents on the dollar to buy a claim of roughly 50 million from a family that had invested with mr madoff , according to a person with knowledge of the trade who was not authorized to speak about it several prominent hedge funds have become involved in the madoff claims trading process , including the fortress investment group , perry capital , silver point capital , the baupost group and farallon capital management it is unclear whether any of these funds have bought claims , but all are actively exploring the market other prominent distressed investors have decided not to participate in the market for madoff claims , no matter how compelling the potential returns david m barse , president and chief executive of third avenue management , an active investor in distressed bankruptcy claims , said in recent months his analysts had advanced the idea of buying madoff claims when the investment idea was discussed in october , claims were trading at about 25 cents on the dollar , and an analysis showed potential recoveries in the range of 40 to 80 cents but after discussing the idea with his senior management , mr barse said he had decided that even though the trade sounded promising , third avenue would not participate the fraud is just so despicable that we felt that , from a moral perspective , it just did n't make sense for us , mr barse said there are plenty of other ways to make money in this business jpmorgan , which actively trades bankruptcy claims , has also shied away from being involved the bank , which served as mr madoff s primary banker for many years , was among the several large global banks sued by the trustee jpmorgan has denied the trustee s claims that it ignored clear signs that mr madoff had been operating a fraud mr picard , the trustee , has estimated that the total cash losses in the fraud are roughly 20 billion so far , he has collected about 2 billion in cash and approved claims totaling more than 59 billion , representing cash losses by investors who took less out of their madoff accounts than they put in many of those investors have already received up to 500 , 000 from the securities investor protection corporation , an industryfinanced compensation fund none of the 2 billion in cash has been distributed to eligible investors yet mr picard has said that he expected several large settlements to be announced soon , which would allow him to make a partial distribution to investors early next year some investors say they are not inclined to trade their claims because they believe they will recover more through the court process mr ross , one investor , says he has not been tempted to sell his approved claim because he noticed that mr picard has already been successful in settling several cases for substantial amounts of money two were settled just last week , for a total of more than 1 billion , he added every time i read that there s been a settlement , there is more hope , he said and hope is a good thing to have we need it this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos about 2 billion has been collected so far to pay claims relating to bernard l madoff ,

responding to jim manzi \( and myself \) on the subject of europe s falling share of global gdp , jon chait points out that the gap between america s economic performance and europe s over the last 30 years narrows dramatically if you look at gdp per capita , rather than just at overall economic growth in other words , much of the widening gap between the us and european shares of global gdp can be chalked up to america s population growth since the 1970s , rather than increasing per person wealth in response , manzi makes the sensible point that his essay \( like my column , which quoted from it \) was focusing on america s position on the global stage as well as our domestic situation , and when it comes to global politics the sheer size of your economy and not just your per capita wealth matters a great deal on a per capita basis , after all , the richest countries in the world include singapore , qatar and brunei , which nobody would confuse with great powers capable of playing a significant role in promoting stability , liberty and growth or exerting significant cultural influence , for that matter on the world stage \( taiwan s impressive per person gdp , manzi points out , does not prevent it from being swallowed by mainland china that job is the left to the us navy \) obviously , western europe is considerably more powerful and secure than singapore and taiwan but just as obviously , europe , too , is a beneficiary of the pax americana , and the outsize military spending that our overall economic size makes possible and a world in which america s economy had grown at european rates since the 1970s would be a very different place less congenial to our own interests , and probably less stable and prosperous overall even if our per capita gdp had continued to rise smartly across that period what s more , saying oh , the economic divergence is all just population growth doesn t let europe s social democracies off the hook obviously enthusiasts for zero population growth would contest this point , but i think that a rich economy s ability to add people through both immigration and above replacementlevel fertility rates while maintaining a high standard of living is itself an important indicator of success across a given period population growth matters in the short term because it means that you have more people \( immigrant and nativeborn alike \) enjoying the fruits of living in a wealthy society and it matters in the long term because a reasonable demographic balance helps keeps economies vigorous and welfare states sustainable does social democracy depress population growth \? quite probably , yes there s a substantial body of evidence suggesting that aspects of the european economic order from the scope of the continent s old age pensions \( see here , here and here , among other places \) to the shape of its labor markets \( see chapter 7 in this report , for instance \) have played a significant role in depressing the continent s fertility likewise , america s more inclusive labor market helps explain why we ve had much more success than most european nations assimilating newcomers across the last few decades \( although there are obviously other factors at work as well \) none of this is to claim that the social democratic model has been a failure to the contrary , it s largely been a success story to date \( and none of this is to deny the enormous policy variations within the european union , either sweden s welfare state is not the same as spain s , and so forth \) but america s more free market model has been a success story as well , one that s accommodated a much , much fastergrowing population and subsidized a system of global security that nearly every nation in the world has benefited from these are not inconsiderable achievements , and as we contemplate further expansions of government power in this country , they shouldn t be blithely discounted update see also reihan on this subject

steven shapin has a wonderful essay in the london review of books looking at the remarkable outpouring that accompanied charles darwin s bicentennial last year the exhibitions and live readings and oneman musicals , the books and essays and scientific pilgrimages , the postage stamps and facebook groups and darwin is my homeboy tshirts he writes even conceding the more expansive claims for darwin s genius and influence , we re still some way from understanding what the festivities have been about there are other claimants for the prize of towering scientific genius , and for making the modern world , but none of them has been the occasion for global festivities on anything like this scale the 400th anniversary of galileo s birth was 1964 , and descartes s 1996 newton s principia turned 300 in 1987 einstein s wunderjahr papers in annalen der physik , changing the way physicists think about space , time and matter , had their centenary in 2005 all were duly marked , mainly by historians , philosophers and physicists , but there was nothing remotely approaching darwin 200 even if we had an unambiguous metric for ranking scientific genius and modernitymaking one by which galileo , descartes , newton and einstein were chopped liver compared to darwin neither genius nor influence would be a sufficient explanation for the events of 2009 shapin s own explanations for all this darwiniana include the new atheism s recent crusade against rampant religiosity , the desire to recruit the great naturalist as a patron saint for the antiglobal warming cause , intraacademic battles over evolutionary theory , and \( most importantly , perhaps \) darwin s status as the rare great scientist who was also personally admirable , even by the exacting standards of modern political correctness darwin year has made it clear , he writes , how closely our culture still links the man and the matter , and what virtues we admire in those who tell us nature s truths but shapin s essay is more than just an attempt to explain last year s darwinmania it s a cleareyed and wideranging tour of what darwinism means today at once an unchallenged scientific paradigm and a wildly contentious theory of everything a church militant warring against creationists and fundamentalists and a debating society of squabbling professors a touchstone for the literary intelligentsia and a source of secularist kitsch  in other words , you should go read the whole thing
joe girardi is none too pleased with the orioles righthander jeremy guthrie , and it is not the first time guthrie hit derek jeter with the first pitch of the game in the yankees 113 victory at camden yards on saturday , continuing his puzzling habit of hitting yankees at what girardi considers an alarming rate in 15 career games against the yankees , guthrie has hit 10 batters by comparison , he has hit one batter in 15 games against the tampa bay rays one batter in 15 games against the boston red sox and three batters in 14 games against the toronto blue jays those numbers do not include spring training guthrie also hit mark teixeira and francisco cervelli this spring , which drew girardi s ire he was also upset when guthrie hit jorge posada earlier this season too many , just too many , girardi said after saturday s game i don t really understand it , and i know he likes to pitch inside , but it s too many girardi said he did not know if guthrie hit jeter on purpose jeter , for his part , said he did not think there was anything suspicious about the pitch , which hit his elbow \( though he jokingly asked reporters if they were satisfied that he actually had gotten hit and wasn t faking it \) he s what you call effectively wild , you know what i mean \? jeter said so , no , i don t read into it at all it should be noted that guthrie is second in the major leagues in hit batsmen this season with 14 first is the yankees own a j burnett , with 16 including two orioles he hit on friday night told of girardi s comments on saturday , guthrie reiterated what he has said previously about his propensity to hit players on the yankees he likes to throw inside , and he sometimes does not have very good command i watch and appreciate the aggressive nature that a j takes in throwing to both sides of the plate and i think i m a similar pitcher , guthrie said , according to the baltimore sun one of the occupational hazards when you do that is you are occasionally going to hit some guys , but you can t let that affect what you do hitting guys intentionally is something totally different , but pitching inside has to be part of what i do to be effective
eli lilly halted two latestage clinical trials of an experimental alzheimer s treatment on tuesday , representing a setback to one leading theory on treating the degenerative disease and a new blow to lilly s business prospects the company said patients who had taken the drug , intended to reduce plaque in the brain , actually showed worse cognitive functioning and less ability to perform daily living tasks than patients who had taken a placebo a completely unexpected result , dr eric r siemers , medical director for the alzheimer s team at lilly , said in an interview the patients also had a higher risk of skin cancer the trials involving the drug , semagacestat , began in 2008 the price of shares in the company , which is based in indianapolis , has fallen 5 percent in the last week , as lilly has had problems involving some of its most popular drugs lilly officials said that they would still follow the more than 2 , 600 alzheimer s patients in 31 countries who were enrolled in the trials for six more months the company is conducting a separate test of a biologic therapy aimed at alzheimer s dr ronald c petersen , director of the alzheimer s disease research center at the mayo clinic in rochester , minn , and a member of the executive committee of the alzheimer s association , said the drug failure highlighted the need to try to attack multiple targets related to dementia , not just plaque on the brain he compared the approach to developing several drugs for hypertension when one like this fails , it s discouraging to the field , but it s not the end of the day , dr petersen , who was not involved with the trials , said in an interview we have other targets out there and other ways to attack the same target still , lilly s announcement quashed one hope , and an effective prevention or cure , if possible , remains years away while hundreds of drugs are under study , lilly s effort was one of only five to reach latestage clinical trials , said dr paul s aisen , director of the federally financed alzheimer s disease cooperative study and a professor of neuroscience at the university of california , san diego it is a significant disappointment , he said , but there s still a lot to be optimistic about dr aisen , who also consults widely for the drug industry , said he was excited about brain scans and spinal fluid tests that may help to identify people most at risk of alzheimer s before they show any symptoms the time a treatment may be most effective lilly shares fell 23 percent to 3475 on tuesday , the latest of several blows to the company lilly said it would charge 3 cents to 4 cents a share against thirdquarter earnings for the alzheimer s test failure but reaffirmed earlier guidance for 2010 profits we are clearly disappointed by the results we are announcing today , john c lechleiter , lilly s chairman , said in a statement however , lilly s innovation strategy , based on advancing a pipeline of nearly 70 molecules currently in clinical development , does not rest on the success or failure of any single compound lilly s failure in the final phase of an alzheimer s trial follows misses by myriad genetics and by the team of pfizer and medivation another closely watched drug being developed by pfizer , johnson johnson and elan has had mixed results in a middlestage clinical trial several prescription drugs are approved to treat symptoms of alzheimer s , but none stop its progression lilly s drug was intended to reduce production of socalled amyloid beta plaques in the brain by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme called gamma secretase dr siemers of lilly said the failed trials might indicate that too much reduction in amyloid beta unexpectedly harms cognitive functions , or it may be that the problems arose from the drug s effect on some 20 other proteins it s certainly a setback , but no one s developed a treatment to slow the rate of progression of the disease , dr siemers said this was i think a very good shot on goal , but not lilly s only potential treatment lilly is also testing an intravenous monoclonal antibody that reduces amyloid beta , the plaque , by a different and more focused mechanism in latestage clinical trials they 're actually going quite well , dr siemers said of those trials alzheimer s affects an estimated 53 million americans dr steven t dekosky , an alzheimer s researcher and dean of the university of virginia s school of medicine , said lilly s failure may show that plaque reduction does not help patients with fullblown symptoms but it could still help to prevent the disease it s too soon to say , said dr dekosky , who has consulted for lilly and other companies having the drug fail does n't say the hypothesis is wrong that amyloid causes the disease some researchers are less certain about the role that plaque may play in the onset of the disease ending the trial was not the only disappointing news lilly received on tuesday the food and drug administration released a critical staff review of the company s application to market its blockbuster antidepressant cymbalta for the treatment of chronic pain the review , to be considered by an fda advisory committee on thursday , questioned lilly s statistical methods and the risks of liver toxicity cymbalta , lilly s secondbestselling drug behind zyprexa , is approved for major depression , anxiety , diabetic pain and fibromyalgia , but lilly is seeking a vast new market in chronic pain seamus fernandez , a leerink swann analyst , said in an investor note that the fda staff report still showed a likelihood of expanding the cymbalta label to include chronic pain as for the alzheimer s setback , he said by email , it was a big upside opportunity very high risk , high reward this was basically lilly swinging for the fences last thursday , the company lost a court ruling on patent protection for its attentiondeficit drug strattera last month , it lost an appellate court decision on a patent for the cancer drug gemzar and in the last year , sales have been disappointing for the blood thinner effient , lilly s first new product in five years mark taylor , a spokesman , said lilly was still optimistic about effient but another competitor looms in the 6 billion anticoagulant market brilinta from astrazeneca is expected to be approved by the fda by sept 16 lilly is already facing the biggest patent cliff in the industry five of its six leading products face generic competition in the next four years barbara ryan , a stock analyst with deutsche bank , said lilly s earnings will decline 35 percent by 2014 unless it makes one of the larger acquisitions it has historically resisted each individual issue is not necessarily all that significant , but collectively lilly faces a

neil paine is an analyst at , an online encyclopedia of players , teams and box scores with chris bosh and dwyane wade joining forces in miami , the heat has one of the most impressive onetwo punches in the nba , regardless of whether lebron james decides to join them wade and bosh were their teams undisputed goto guys last season , but as teammates neither will have to carry so much of the offensive burden , which in turn will make each star more dangerous that s the theory at least the trouble is , history tells us that combinations like this featuring two players who had each been goto guys the year before rarely result in a championship last season , wade took 33 percent of miami s shots when he was on the floor , the secondhighest rate of any nba player \( carmelo anthony took 34 percent of denver s shots when in the game \) bosh was slightly more egalitarian , taking 27 percent of the raptors shots , but he still ranked 14th in the league among players with 2 , 000 minutes if wade and bosh maintained their share of the offense from last season , they would combine for 60 percent of the heat s shots , a huge number how huge \? since 1953 , only seven new pairs of teammates had a higher combined rate the year before they got together than the wadebosh duo will have next season of those seven , five made the playoffs , but only one made the conference finals , and none won a title furthermore , if you look at the top 30 new player pairs since 1953 , 22 made the playoffs but only three won an nba championship ray allen and kevin garnett of the 2008 celtics , kobe bryant and ron artest of the 2010 lakers , and julius erving and moses malone of the 1983 76ers the key to their success , in each case , was having a player willing to sacrifice his oncedominant role , as allen , artest and malone all did this means that while having a big two won t be a bad thing for the heat \( 18 of the top 30 teams improved their regularseason record with their new players \) , it s hardly a guarantee of playoff success then again , miami does have a good track record in this type of situation the third most recent team to win a title with a new big two \? the 2006 heat , which paired wade with the new acquisition antoine walker
an reports on an increase in teachers caught tampering with their students standardized tests and scores because those scores now often determine which teachers get bonuses and tenure , some say the higher the stakes are , the more teachers will cheat do you agree \? do you think this shows that changes in education , including the testing required under no child left behind , are putting too much pressure on your teachers \? or do you think there are just a few bad apples who cheat , and that public school teachers are no more pressured than they ever were \? do you think it s fair to judge teacher performance on student scores in general \? in under pressure , teachers tamper with test scores , trip gabriel writes of all the forms of academic cheating , none may be as startling as when educators tamper with children s standardized tests but investigations in georgia , indiana , massachusetts , nevada , virginia and elsewhere this year have pointed to cheating by educators experts say the phenomenon is increasing as the stakes over standardized testing ratchet higher including , most recently , taking student progress on tests into consideration in teachers performance reviews colorado passed a sweeping law last month making teachers tenure dependent on test results , and nearly a dozen other states have introduced plans to evaluate teachers partly on scores many school districts already link teachers bonuses to student improvement on state assessments houston decided this year to use the data to identify experienced teachers for dismissal , and new york city will use it to make tenure decisions on novice teachers the federal no child left behind law is a further source of pressure like a high jump bar set intentionally low in the beginning , the law which mandates that public schools bring all students up to grade level in reading and math by 2014 was easy to satisfy early on but the bar is notched higher annually , and the penalties for schools that fail to get over it also rise teachers and administrators can lose jobs and see their school taken over students tell us what you think about this story and the opinions expressed in it are your teachers under too much pressure \? do you think that most of the pressure comes from highstakes testing \? how fair do you think it is to judge teachers based on their students standardized test scores in general \? students 13 and older are invited to comment below please use only your first name for privacy policy reasons , we will not publish student comments that include a last name teachers here are ten ways to teach with this feature
toronto the heat index was 106 degrees at kauffman stadium on aug 12 , so the received a reprieve no outside batting practice hitting in the indoor batting cages was also optional optional for everyone but  early that afternoon , granderson took 120 swings then he took 120 more about an hour before the yankees' game that night against the kansas city royals watching was kevin long , the yankees' hitting coach granderson , , had approached long for help long began a hitting tutorial that was the most ambitious and rigorous inseason work he had done with a player in his four seasons with the team it can take weeks to rebuild a swing they had three days those three days have revived granderson s season since incorporating long s suggestions , granderson , a lefthanded hitter , is making harder and more consistent contact to all fields his manager , joe girardi , has lauded his progress , and granderson received loud cheers before games during the recent homestand everything feels like the work is translating over to the game , and that s where you want it to be , he said in a recent interview i 've felt like i 've been able to see the ball , recognize the ball and attack it whether i miss it or not , every time i 've swung , i 've had a very good chance of being successful over , granderson is batting 282 \( 11 for 39 \) with three home runs , a stretch that raised his season batting average to 244 and came at a crucial time for him and the team as he tries to help the yankees fend off the tampa bay rays for the american league east title , granderson , by producing over the next weeks , may have a say in whether he returns next year or is shopped to make room for a star freeagent outfielder like carl crawford or jayson werth of course , granderson does not look at his future in those terms at his lowest points , he has stayed unfailingly upbeat , believing that better luck would come the next day like cal ripken jr , another player who continually tinkered with his swing , granderson has been making adjustments throughout the season , though none of them had stuck frustrated by that , he went to long before the yankees' game in texas on aug 10 long had plenty of suggestions , but he had been reluctant to bring them up players do n't want you coming up and telling them , you need to do this , you need do to that , because what you 're doing is n't going to work , ' long said when you do that , you lose guys for them not to trust me , that would be devastating they started forging a strong relationship back on jan 26 , when granderson visited long in arizona to break down his approach against lefthanded pitching , and they have maintained that connection still , long s hesitance remained he asked nick swisher , whose mechanics long remodeled during the offseason , whether fiddling with granderson s swing four months into the season was risky if i did n't have the offseason to work on all this stuff , i do n't think i could have done it , long said swisher told him granderson seemed confident he could conquer the changes because he had a point of reference during the middle of his class aa season in 2004 , he adjusted to quick pitches and slide steps by keeping his hands back by his shoulders he went on to compared with that overhaul , granderson said , these suggestions were minor in theory , long s goal was simple to eliminate unnecessary movement when granderson swung , his hands were moving forward , then back and forward again in what long described as a big crazy loop because granderson was so far on his back leg when he started his swing , he actually strode twice , long said , opening his stance and lengthening his swing as they got to work for their first session , on aug 10 , long told granderson to put his bat down he asked him to show the ideal contact point where granderson should always hit the ball liking what he saw , long moved granderson s hands back , then aligned the rest of his body so it was squared , in perfect position for hitting his legs were flexed , and his feet , knees , hips and shoulders were properly aligned there s very little moving parts to his swing now , long said you can see it it s very vivid to the eye so was granderson s final tweak , which changed a deeprooted habit granderson had a tendency to let go with his top hand his left hand which is something mark teixeira also does from time to time it looks sweet on a home run , but it is a flaw that adds length to a swing , which can prevent hitters from catching up with a fastball and can cause them to get out in front of breaking pitches twice a day for three days before and after batting practice , when it was held granderson would take 120 swings , up from 40 a day some were without a ball , some came with a ball on a tee , and some came with long tossing underhand at times , long has reminded granderson not to rock backward or shift his hands , but over all , he seems pleased and even a little surprised that granderson has adapted so quickly long asked girardi to hold granderson out for two games in texas to let the changes sink in , and in his first atbat on aug 12 , he singled up the middle off a lefthander , no less his next time up , he rifled a double down the rightfield line a week later , granderson said that his revamped mechanics felt natural and that he hoped they would be a springboard to lasting success that s the way i 've felt with all the changes i 've made up to this point , and sure enough , something happens , granderson said hopefully , this is the last one
washington it was only last month that a 22yearold army intelligence analyst in iraq , specialist bradley manning , reached out to a former computer hacker who apparently seemed like a kindred soul in a single intense week in late may , specialist manning and the former hacker , adrian lamo , traded instant messages about what mr lamo described as specialist manning s personal troubles with the military but over the course of those exchanges , mr lamo said in a telephone interview on monday , specialist manning also took credit for leaking a classified , explosive video of an american helicopter attack in baghdad that left 12 people dead , including two employees of the reuters news agency , which the web site  there was more specialist manning also claimed he gave 260 , 000 classified united states diplomatic cables and video of a united states airstrike in afghanistan that killed 97 civilians last year , mr lamo said he was just grabbing information from where he could get it and trying to leak it so the former renegade , who in 2004 pleaded guilty to hacking into the internal computer system of the new york times , did something he had not expected when specialist manning first contacted him he turned him in on monday , the department of defense announced that specialist manning , of potomac , md , had been arrested and was under investigation a threeparagraph statement said that specialist manning , who is deployed with the second brigade , 10th mountain division in baghdad , was in pretrial confinement in kuwait for allegedly releasing classified information it is unclear whether mr lamo is the main source against mr manning , or if the military has developed other evidence the pentagon would not discuss the investigation specialist manning s family members could not be reached for comment , but wired s threat level blog , and mr lamo s role in it , reported that his father , brian manning of oklahoma , was shocked i was in the military for five years , wired quoted mr manning as saying i had a secret clearance , and i never divulged any information in 30 years since i got out about what i did and brad has always been very , very tight at adhering to the rules even talking to him after boot camp and stuff , he kept everything so close that he did n't open up to anything mr manning told wired that his son is a good kid never been in trouble never been on drugs , alcohol , nothing the leak of the helicopter video , which wikileaks titled collateral murder , caused serious consternation at the pentagon , where senior officials are increasingly concerned about technology that makes it easier to anonymously post documents , photographs and videos online in april , defense secretary robert m gates criticized the helicopter video as a portrayal of war as seen through a soda straw but opponents of the iraq war have said that the video provided irrefutable evidence of a military blunder , and that it should not have been classified the episode also drew wide attention to wikileaks , a oncefringe web site that aims to bring to light secret information about governments and corporations it was founded three years ago by julian assange , an australian activist and journalist , and has published documents about toxic dumping in africa , protocols from guant namo bay and email messages from sarah palin s personal account in the interview on monday , mr lamo said he had contacted the army about specialist manning s instant messages because he was worried that disclosure of the information would put people s lives in danger he said that army investigators were particularly concerned about one sensitive piece of information that specialist manning possessed that mr lamo would not discuss in more detail i thought to myself , what if somebody dies because this information is leaked \? ' he said so far , wikileaks has not posted any video of the american airstrike in afghanistan , although it claims to have it that video , like the helicopter video , is said to be encrypted , meaning it is protected by a secret code working over months , wikileaks said it was able to decrypt the helicopter video mr lamo said monday that he understood that wikileaks had not yet decrypted the afghanistan attack video in , wikileaks denounced both mr lamo and kevin poulsen , a coauthor of the lengthy wired threat level blog post , as notorious felons , informers manipulators and said that journalists should take care wikileaks also said that reports that the web site had been sent 260 , 000 classified embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect mr lamo , reached at his parents' home in carmichael , calif , said that he turned over copies of his chat logs with specialist manning to army investigators , and that they included much personal information that could give clues to specialist manning s motives , should he indeed turn out to be the leaker asked to specify what he saw as specialist manning s motives , mr lamo replied ideology i think he was dissatisfied with certain military policies and he wanted to adversely affect us foreign policy mr lamo would not provide more details it s a personal matter for him , and i do not think it was one his family would want aired in the national media , he said mr lamo , 29 , said he had expressed concern to specialist manning during the course of their exchanges i told him he would be in a world of hurt if he was found out , he said in retrospect i wish i had tried to talk to him more mr lamo said he had promised the fbi he would testify against the specialist i 'll keep my word , but i wo n't do it happily , he said i hope that his parents can forgive me i'm sorry about what happened to their boy but i was backed into a corner ethically in , mr lamo continued the theme i outed brad manning as an alleged leaker out of duty , he said in one i would never \( and have never \) outed an ordinary decent criminal there s a difference in , mr lamo said i know what it s like to be 22 , scared , and in shackles too i 've been there i hope none of you ever have to make a choice like this after mr lamo pleaded guilty to hacking into the new york times he had also hacked into yahoo , worldcom and microsoft he was sentenced to six months of house arrest at his parents' home and two years of probation he said in the interview that he saw a difference in the level of wrong of hacking into the times , which he acknowledged was illegal but did not , he said , compromise national security by mr lamo s account , specialist manning reached out to him on may 20 , after an article on wired s threat level blog described mr lamo s struggles with asperger s disorder and his history as a hacker
it sounds like a tough sell a game that involves catapulting birds at elaborate fortresses constructed by evil pigs but angry birds , a hit game by rovio , a small finnish company , is one of the unlikeliest popculture crazes of the year and perhaps the first to make the leap from cellphone screens to the mainstream angry birds , in which the birds seek revenge on the eggstealing pigs , is meant to be easily played in the checkout line and during other short windows of downtime but some players have trouble stopping rovio says people around the world rack up 200 million minutes of game play each day \( put another way , that is 16 humanyears of birdthrowing every hour \) the game has inspired parodies , homages and fervent testimonials homemade angry birds costumes were big hits on halloween conan o'brien demonstrated the game in a youtube video promoting his new show , and a sketch from an israeli tv show about a birdsandpigs peace treaty was popular online justin bieber and other celebrities have professed their love of angry birds on social networks games like angry birds are reaching a wide audience of players who might never consider buying an xbox or playstation , but are now carrying sophisticated game machines in their pockets smartphones software developers , eager to become the next rovio , are creating socalled casual games for this crowd , games that are easy to learn and hard to stop playing the trajectory of angry birds also suggests a larger shift in entertainment and in the kinds of brands that can win wide popularity and unlike many of the bestknown console video games like the classic super mario bros from nintendo or the latest in the call of duty series , from activision cellphone games like angry birds are often made by small companies and catch on by word of mouth there s no more formula , said james l mcquivey , an analyst at forrester research who studies digital entertainment it does n't matter where it starts a ringtone , a video game , book it has a shot at the big time on cellphones , he added , anyone with coding skills , an idea and good characters can catch on without having to spend 100 million on a movie and marketing anya richardson , a technical writer and editor in mulhall , okla , got swept up in the angry birds craze when her 8yearold son , roenick , asked for a birthday cake based on the game ms richardson spent nearly 80 hours crafting a twotiered concoction that included handshaped replicas of the game s cranky fowl his birthday was in october , but i could n't finish the cake until november , she said her son loved the cake so much that he never let us cut it , ms richardson said i finally talked him into letting us get rid of it , but he kept most of the bird figures a photo of the cake ricocheted around the web requests from people who want one have been pouring in on twitter and via email , she said jordan finley , 30 , who works at a legal consulting firm in los angeles , said he and his boyfriend were such big fans of the game that they decided to create fullbody bird costumes for halloween it was crazy , mr finley said the people who did n't recognize it did n't understand , but people who knew the game loved it everyone wanted to take pictures it felt like being chased by the paparazzi or something fans of the game took to the streets on saturday for angry birds day , celebrating its first anniversary rovio worked with the web service meetupcom to help organize the gatherings in new york , london , jakarta , budapest and dozens of other cities , but fans stepped up to lead the gatherings rovio says it will create angry birds levels for the top 10 cities that celebrate angry birds day although rovio has released two dozen other mobile games , none have come close to the success of angry birds , which cost about 100 , 000 to make and has been downloaded 50 million times in the last year the paid version for the iphone , which costs 99 cents in the united states , has brought in more than 8 million in revenue apple said last week that it was the bestselling iphone app of 2010 the free version for phones running google s android software should produce 1 million a month in advertising revenue by the end of the year , rovio says peter vesterbacka , rovio s head of business development in north america , said the game was born when a rovio designer sketched a rough outline of a bright red bird with a furious expression we did n't know what the game concept would be , but we loved the birds , he said the entire game and storyline was built around the birds mr vesterbacka said the company took notice of the intricate storylines in pixar films and the popularity of mario and luigi , from super mario bros the stars of angry birds do not express themselves much apart from squawks and grunts , but players seem to be connecting with them all the same when thousands of people start dressing up as your characters , you know you 're onto something , mr vesterbacka said rovio is trying to capitalize on its hit and is working on versions of angry birds for gaming consoles and pcs , along with a line of stuffed birds and pigs it also hopes to spin the franchise into a movie or children s tv show rovio made a smart choice in making the birds angry , said jesse schell , a professor at carnegie mellon who studies game design and entertainment technology you can smash them into things and it s ok , he said imagine if they were cute little birds it might be kind of funny on some level , but most people would probably be a little repulsed photos rovio says angry birds players spend 200 million minutes with the game daily \( photograph by rovio , via associated press \) \( a1 \) from left , devon maciver , evan mcgee ,

updated before leaving for the president s day break , the senate tonight confirmed by unanimous consent 27 of president obama s nominees to federal positions , under a threat made earlier this week by the president that he might make recess appointments not requiring senate votes none of these seemed controversial the senators approved these amid a backlog of presidential nominations and holds on some the action was taken after president obama and senate majority leader harry reid warned earlier this week that the weeklong holiday recess might provide an opportunity for the president to make recess appointments , a threat underscoring an intent to break the logjam on some key people who have waited months to be confirmed \( a key democratic chairman , senator patrick leahy of the judiciary committee , was quoted today as saying that perhaps mr obama should consider doing so for dawn johnsen , who has been nominated to head the office of legal counsel at the justice department she s been among those most opposed by republicans and one of the nominees stalled the longest because of her work years ago with abortion rights groups and her views on bush administration interrogation policies , among other reasons \) fingerpointing for the stalling has been rampant earlier this week , republicans blocked the confirmation of craig becker , a labor lawyer , to a seat on the national labor relations board , which has been operating \( some would say not \) with only two of its five members for a few years at an impromptu news conference the other day , just before a procedural vote on mr becker , mr obama complained that he wanted republicans to stop holding up his nominees update after the senate s moves , the white house tonight issued a statement by mr obama , in which he welcomed the votes , and seemed to signal he would not be making recess appointments anytime soon the statement reads at the beginning of the week , a staggering 63 nominees had been stalled in the senate because one or more senators placed a hold on their nomination in most cases , these holds have had nothing to do with the nominee s qualifications or even political views , and these nominees have already received broad , bipartisan support in the committee process instead , many holds were motivated by a desire to leverage projects for a senator s state or simply to frustrate progress it is precisely these kinds of tactics that enrage the american people and so on tuesday , i told senator mcconnell that if republican senators did not release these holds , i would exercise my authority to fill criticallyneeded positions in the federal government temporarily through the use of recess appointments this is a rare but not unprecedented step that many other presidents have taken since that meeting , i am gratified that republican senators have responded by releasing many of these holds and allowing 29 nominees to receive a vote in the senate while this is a good first step , there are still dozens of nominees on hold who deserve a similar vote , and i will be looking for action from the senate when it returns from recess if they do not act , i reserve the right to use my recess appointment authority in the future among those confirmed tonight , according to the office of senator mitch mcconnell , the republican minority leader from kentucky ketanji brown jackson , of maryland , to be a member of the united states sentencing commission susan b carbon , of new hampshire , to be director of the violence against women office betty king to be

the philadelphia daily news blogged last night and the philadelphia inquirer reported today that the nhl is investigating whether the fox sports pittsburgh television crew , the penguins local rightsholder , intentionally or accidentally withheld evidence from video replay officials last thursday of a play that was under review here s the play in question from late in the second period of that game in pittsburgh , the aftermath of a shot by simon gagne the angle at the end of this clip shows penguins goalie brent johnson perhaps nudging the puck back over the line this angle was not made available to the inarena replay booth and the nhl s hockey operations reviewers in toronto until after they made their no goal decision their ruling was based on angles that they found inconclusive had the goal been awarded , it would have given the flyers a 63 lead in a game they eventually won 74 , so it did not effect the outcome of the game still , league spokesman gary meagher told the inquirer s sam carchidi that the nhl was concerned and it is being addressed the league wants to determine how this occurred and whether it was an oversight or intentional frank seravalli blogged in the philadelphia daily news , the nhl has given no indication as to length of the investigation or what penalties may come of it , and he quotes meagher saying , it s a matter between the league , the penguins and fsn that will be handled internally it s not the first time that angles indicating a different outcome than the one reached by the officials have been delayed the most famous incident was in game 2 of a firstround playoff series between the sabres and flyers in 2000 a shot by the flyers john leclair entered the net through the side , but it was not seen by officials on the ice or in the replay booth and the goal stood but espn had an angle from inside the net that showed the puck traveling through the mesh that angle was not available in the booth and espn eventually showed it a few minutes after play restarted here s that ancient clip that was an embarrassing moment for the nhl , especially less than a year after the sabres were victimized by a goal call in the 1999 stanley cup final that s when brett hull s game 6 overtime winner was allowed even though replays later showed his skate in the goal crease when the puck was not , which at the time was prohibited the 2000 episode was not an intentional embargo of evidence by espn that angle somehow fell through the cracks , bungled by everyone involved this time , the nhl wants to know if something sinister occurred , although this incident could very well be as innocent as the case in 2000 seravalli hits some accusatory notes in his daily news blog post , writing , it is not yet clear whether fsn pittsburgh purposely excluded the angle or it was an unintentional oversight , though one penguins announcer can be heard saying we saved that one on the broadcast but it s clear that when expenguin bob errey comments in the clip , he isn t celebrating a successful deception of the officials by his producer as much as expressing a mixture of nervous relief and perhaps mimicking what goaltender johnson might be saying if the penguins producer was trying to hide evidence of this play , he likely would not have shown it at all when the nhl s video replay system was created in the summer of 1991 , one of the concerns raised by skeptics was that some local producers are employees of the club or , at least , employees of the club s rightsholder potentially , they might not be neutral after all , a team that makes the playoffs will have more games televised , providing more work for the crew of their telecasts so some wondered about the possibility of cheating this hasn t become much of an issue perhaps producers who might hide video evidence on behalf of the teams they cover are very good at it but there are also a number of angles available to the replay officials independent of the what is shown on television , not to mention what the other team s broadcasters might uncover \( on thursday , the flyers reportedly did not have any comcast game cameras in pittsburgh and took all their pictures from fsn \) additionally , most of the producers are professionals who want to show fans the true picture of the game , although it is naive to think some wouldn t be sympathetic to their club s cause to our knowledge , this is the first time the league has said it was investigating a rightsholder for possibly withholding video for replay considering this is the 18th year of the nhl s system , that s a pretty good indication of how well the system works and of the integrity of those involved this case doesn t seem to be more than a mistake of some sort but it never hurts to be skeptical , if not suspicious metro report the rangers and devils go at it tonight at madison square garden and , as jeff z klein mentioned in his times article on the blueshirts 31 victory on saturday over the bruins , the devils represent the first opponent in 14 games that can be considered a strong opponent none were more than two games over 500 the rangers got 22 of a possible 28 points in that stretch vinny prospal will return to the rangers lineup tonight and he s likely to play with marian gaborik and erik christensen , who has recently been the hottest skater on broadway christensen has three goals and four assists in his last six games brandon dubinsky , who has 13 points over his past 13 games will likely play with chris drury and ryan callahan the rangers trail new jersey by 13 points but devils coach jacques lemaire had this to say this morning about why they ve played so well lately \( quoted by tom gulitti blogging in the bergen record \) teamwork teamwork is the whole difference they have a few guys that at a time were playing really hard and the other guys could do a little more and a little help on the ice does a lot you get two guys working really hard on the ice and the other guys they don t help at the right time , you re not as effective now , they re confident they do these little plays they re playing well devils forward travis zajac , perhaps their best player in the 21 overtime win over montreal on saturday , took a shot on the ankle in the devils morning skate today and had to leave for a while zajac told tom gulitti , blogging for the bergen record , we came in and just rubbed it down quick and the pain went away you get there and it gets numb for a second then , after it didn t hurt much at all i kind of looked like a wuss zajac has three goals , three assists in his last three games and has returned to the top line with captain jamie langenbrunner \( who has named captain of the us olympic team yesterday \) and zach parise the islanders take on the red wings tonight at nassau coliseum and detroit coach mike babcock had some compliments for the islanders after his team s morning skate \( quoted by chris botta on islanderspointblankcom i really like what they re doing here , said babcock , who is the canadian olympic coach the islanders have a youthful group the whole team looks like first round picks they come at you hard , skate and don t stop they ve looked real good lately they ve got some very talented kids in tavares , bailey and okposo as the three of them grow , they could be a really dynamic force on the other hand , botta writes , islanders coach scott gordon had little sympathy about the wings lengthy injury list , anytime you can roll out datsyuk , zetterberg and lidstrom clearly , he doesn t want his team taking this bangedup foe lightly the wings are getting healthy again , slowly dana wakiji writes in the detroit news that johan franzen is skating and feeling good , even though he s not slated to return from his knee surgery until after the olympic break defenseman jonathan ericsson \( bone bruise , left knee \) could dress as soon as thursday against carolina tomas holmstrom \( broken foot \) is at least three weeks away but niklas kronwall doesn t seem to be progressing from his knee sprain and is scheduled for an ultrasound exam today

the archbishop of munich and freising , reinhard marx , begged forgiveness on friday for everything those working for the church have done as he presented a report that showed more than 250 priests and religious teachers had abused children in a diocese that was once presided over by the lawyer marion westphal said at a news conference that she had found instances of abuse among 159 priests , including about 26 cases of a sexual nature , all of which were prosecuted according to church regulations at the time , she said none of the priests were still alive in addition , the report found 96 teachers commissioned by the diocese to hold classes on roman catholicism in regional schools were abusive , one of them sexually
jim squires is the breeder of the 2001 kentucky derby winner , monarchos , and the author of horse of a different color and headless horsemen in a game where luck is often all that distinguishes the great from the rest , the troubled sport of thoroughbred racing ca n't seem to find any once again on the eve of horse racing s most important showcase , the kentucky derby has lost its star before it could shine out because of injury , the heavy favorite eskendereya was the latest in a series of exciting horses believed capable of becoming a triple crown winner who might revive public interest in racing the way another glistening red speedster , secretariat , did nearly three decades ago and like last year s derby favorite , i want revenge , and the derby winner big brown in 2008 , the focus of public attention on the suddenly missing eskendereya is hardly the kind the sport needs being another injured horse is bad enough , considering the public outcry about the dangers of horse racing but much like the sagas of i want revenge and big brown before him , the eskendereya story packs baggage that further dulls his luster though none of his doing , he now also becomes a poster boy for the sport s considerable economic difficulties and the continuing plague of unsavory ownership squabbles as probably the most valuable horse owned by the bankrupt and legally entangled zayat stables , eskendereya s value was being counted on as a sizable down payment to his principal creditor fifth third bank , which in effect owns if not controls him and exactly what that value is has been the subject of research and conjecture for weeks now , ever since fifth third sued the stable s flamboyant owner amad zayat to take control of his horses and settle a 42 million debt now the news of eskendereya is likely to focus as sharply on the value lost or gained by the injured leg , as it will the nature of the injury itself the minute that rumors spread this week that the horse had a leg issue , the big question among railbirds on the backside of churchill was whether a derby favorite withdrawn with an injury is more valuable to fifth third than a favorite beaten 10 lengths by one of the many unknown and less respected starters in what is generally regarded as an inferior 2010 kentucky derby field when i want revenge was scratched on the morning of the derby last year , the focus quickly shifted to his trainer , jeff mullins , who had been caught earlier giving a substance to a stablemate in a detention barn on the day his derby horse had won the wood memorial and soon the story further disintegrated into a legal soap opera over money involving multiple owners , none of whom presented a sterling public image in subsequent television interviews the owner who sued in the i want revenge case , ieah stables , claimed it had not been told about the ankle injury at the time of purchase ieah was also the principal owner of the 2008 derby hero big brown , another muchhyped and failed triple crown hopeful who will probably be best remembered as the last horse to win the world s most famous race while running on steroids , which have since been outlawed and that derby , of course , will go down in history as the one in which the secondplace finisher , the crowd favorite filly eight belles , broke down after crossing the wire and ignited a public outcry for some kind of regulation of drug abuse in a sport believed totally out of control in the kind of irony endemic to melodrama , this latest setback comes at a time when significant reform of the sport is showing more promise with the threat of federal government regulation again gaining momentum with a senate bill proposed by sen mary landrieu , democrat of louisiana , the industry is again scrambling at least to demonstrate an effort to clean up its own house the badly fragmented sport is reluctantly uniting behind a move to imbue a previously toothless organization of state regulators with the authority of a new national racing compact to enforce stringent model drug and safety rules , supervise uniform drug testing and wipe out the bureaucratic nightmare of individual racing licenses and requirements that vary by state and are in many cases an onerous impediment to racehorse ownership before a meeting of the association of racing commissioners international , one of the most important voices in the sport for the last 20 years , the retired keeneland association head james e \( ted \) bassett , virtually pleaded for the organization to step forward and take control to the very industry leadership of which he has long been a stalwart , bassett gave a grade of f a sign that significant reform may indeed be possible if not imminent simultaneously , a spokesman for the national thoroughbred racing association , a marketing arm of the sport with little if any authority , warned that uniting behind the national racing compact might be the industry s last hope for avoiding federal intervention , which in the minds of most industry leaders is the worst possible outcome this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo calvin borel ,

midfielder yael averbuch helped lead sky blue fc to the championship of in the league s first season averbuch , a montclair , nj , product by way of the university of north carolina , will be filing to the goal blog during the defending champions 2010 season piscataway , nj i forgot how much fun it is to play at yurcak field in front of a home crowd ! as i drove up the gravel driveway and into the parking lot for sky blue fc s home opener last sunday , i had this eerie feeling that no time had passed and we were picking up right where we had left off at the end of last summer i walked into the familiar locker room , the uniforms hung in their usual places and sat in the same seat i had last year but as much as it was all so much the same , it was also different none of the players who had sat alongside me on the far side bench are still on the team i went to take my jersey off its hanger and i took the no 13 , rather than no 10 i looked one more time at the lineup , and felt proud to see my name quite a different start from last year s home opener when i didn t see the field despite these obvious differences , there was also an intangible change in atmosphere there is a confidence about our team this year it comes from a combination of factors in part , it is that we are defending wps champions , but more that we know we are well prepared and each of us understands , and is capable of , our individual role nonetheless , i couldn t help but feel a little bit of the tension from the previous season the pressure of constant subpar performances , both individual and collective but all it took was for rosana to play our team s ritual brazilian song , and all the good , funny memories rushed back even as i write , i realize how scattered my thoughts were at the time as i fought back some unpleasant memories and tried to move forward to a fresh start , it was a sentimental moment playing again in our home stadium i lay on the locker room floor for a few minutes , with my legs elevated on the wall hanging above me was a poster titled , moments it s funny how sometimes you see or hear only what you need and the timing couldn t be better i ve read this quotation more than once , and even have the same poster at home , but it wasn t until reading it then in the locker room that it really hit home for me it s much longer than this , but here s the gist of it in every game there are moments that define us the moment the ball is in front of you the moment it goes by you the moment it hovers in front of the goal how do these moments define you \? the time is today , the opportunity is now , the moment is yours take it  trevor moawad it s so easy to get wrapped up in the excitement of the day , the pressure looming from last year , the family and friends in the crowd , tv cameras , coaches but the quotation on this poster made complete sense and reminded me of the importance of being here , now  in every aspect of life it s so easy to get caught up in past emotions or future worries , but i ve become a lot more aware and appreciative of the instants that ground me , and bring me fully into the present this was one of those moments it freed me to enjoy what was going on simply for what it was music and hanging out in the locker room , a warmup that we ve done many times , listening to the national anthem and feeling thankful , noticing an interesting cloud and the pretty color of the sky , playing the game i love under the lights in front of a home crowd , and nothing more than that we went up , 10 , against the chicago red stars in the sixth minute of the game , thanks to a great finish from tasha kai that took some of the pressure off of us , but we made the mistake of sitting back a little too much after that , so our team s rhythm and possession struggled a bit we were able to hold off the red stars for the rest of the game , though , and it was a great feeling to start the season with a win it took us several games last year to get three points ! i played 65 minutes at center mid , and although i was disappointed to come off , i know that it s a long season last season my confidence struggled , so this game was very important for me to feel that i can be effective and make things happen i did have that feeling at points , so it s a good starting point for me we leave thursday morning for california to play the bay area gold pride my sister , shira , goes to stanford , so i m excited that she ll be able to come to the game more after the trip
london at a time when his relations with pope benedict xvi are already strained over the pope s offer to dissatisfied anglicans of fasttrack conversion to roman catholicism , the archbishop of canterbury has plunged into the crisis over cases of abuse by catholic priests , choosing the easter weekend to describe the catholic church in as losing all credibility because of its poor handling of the crisis in a bbc radio interview , part of which was made public on saturday , the archbishop , the most rev , described the abuse scandal as a colossal trauma for ireland in particular he made no direct reference to the personal controversy that has swirled around the pope in the wake of accusations that he failed to act strongly enough against pedophile priests but archbishop williams , the head of the worldwide , which claims 70 million adherents , was unusually blunt i was speaking to an irish friend recently who said that it s quite difficult in some parts of ireland to go down the street wearing a clerical collar now , he said and an institution so deeply bound into the life of a society suddenly becoming , suddenly losing all credibility that s not just a problem for the church , it s a problem for everybody in ireland his remarks appeared to anger leaders of both the catholic and anglican churches in ireland , who criticized archbishop williams for poor judgment in exacerbating an already tense situation among catholics in ireland their outbursts , in turn , led to an apology from archbishop williams , whose office said he made a telephone call on saturday evening to the catholic archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , expressing his deep sorrow and regret at any offense his remarks at had caused , and to offer an assurance that he meant none according to the bbc , archbishop martin s office confirmed the call , but pointedly thanked anglican leaders in ireland who had spoken out against archbishop williams s remarks , and not archbishop williams himself archbishop williams s original remarks could hardly have come at a more fraught moment for the catholic church in ireland , where cardinal sean brady , the church s allireland primate , faces widespread calls for his resignation the irish scandal , building for years , took on new momentum after disclosures last month about cardinal brady s role as a young cleric 35 years ago , when as a participant in an internal church inquiry he helped to shield a priest from the police after two teenage boys accused the priest of abusing them before archbishop williams s apology , archbishop martin , head of the largest catholic diocese in ireland and the most powerful voice in the irish church after cardinal brady , had issued a sharp rebuke those working for renewal in the catholic church in ireland did not need this comment on this easter weekend , and do not deserve it , archbishop martin said in a statement the unequivocal and unqualified comment in a radio interview of the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , that the catholic church in ireland has lost all credibility , ' has stunned me i have to say that in all my years as archbishop of dublin , in difficult times i have rarely felt personally so discouraged as when i woke to hear archbishop williams s comments , he said archbishop martin has been outspoken in his demands for full accountability in the church over child abuse , and was appointed to the dublin see with a mandate to rebuild there in the wake of revelations about widespread abuses in the archdiocese speaking to reporters after officiating at a mass in dublin on saturday , he said that church leaders should be more careful in their comments about the abuse scandal obviously , the church has lost credibility , he acknowledged but it s very damaging to those who are trying to restore credibility to be just wiped off with a comment like this archbishop williams made his remarks in an interview for a bbc program to be broadcast monday as part of easter coverage his remarks , part of a 40minute discussion with other leading anglicans on a range of church issues , were recorded at lambeth palace in london , regarded as the principal seat of the anglican communion the bbc released a partial transcript of archbishop williams s remarks on saturday a bbc spokesman said no full transcript would be available until after the monday broadcast archbishop williams s decision to speak out on the crisis in the catholic church marked the latest turn in an increasingly strained relationship between the anglican leadership and the , which has also taken on a personal edge both archbishop williams and the pope have said they attach special importance to efforts to bridge the historic schism between the churches , which has its origins in the 16thcentury split between king henry viii and the pope over henry s determination to annul his marriage to catherine of aragon but events in recent months have led to a sharp cooling in those ties that has been unrelated to the child abuse scandal a watershed came last october , amid a crisis over gay rights and women s rights in the anglican communion , when the pope announced that a special section of the catholic church would be established to allow former anglicans to convert to catholicism while keeping some of their traditions and services , and even being led by former anglican bishops , some of them married archbishop williams said then that he was stunned by the initiative , which he said he had heard about only two weeks before it was announced by the vatican reports in british newspapers said that he telephoned the head of the catholic church in england and wales , archbishop vincent nichols , in the middle of the night to protest defending his move , pope benedict said he was creating the new enclave for anglican converts in response to pleas from traditionalist anglicans many of them had declared themselves unwilling to continue in a church that has sanctioned the ordination of women as bishops and hovered on the brink of a schism over the decision of the episcopal church in the united states to ordain gay and lesbian bishops archbishop williams has worked relentlessly to hold the anglican communion together , pleading unsuccessfully , at least so far , with episcopal leaders to suspend the ordination of gay and lesbian priests , and asking traditionalist anglican bishops , particularly in africa , asia and latin america , to be patient while an accommodation on the issue is worked out shortly after the pope s announcement in october , dr williams flew to rome for a brief meeting with the pope that was described as cordial , and which was said to have renewed their shared will to achieve closer ties but anglican officials have said privately that archbishop williams regarded the pope s initiative as undermining his efforts to prevent a breakup of the anglican communion , and as an opportunistic move aimed at taking advantage of anglican woes the new falling out over the pedophile scandal in the catholic church comes as britain prepares for a visit by benedict in september , his first as pope , when he is expected to press his criticism of a new equality law being moved through parliament by the governing labour party that catholics fear will have the effect of criminalizing any moves by catholicrun institutions to deny employment to gays and lesbians , or otherwise discriminate against them in the bbc interview , archbishop williams appeared to strike an attitude of indifference toward the visit the pope will be coming here to lambeth palace , he said we 'll have the bishops together to meet him i'm concerned that he has the chance to say what he wants to say in and to british society , that we welcome him as a valued partner and , you know , that s about it
manama , bahrain the united states and sought to project a unified front on friday , five days after the king of bahrain was quoted in leaked american diplomatic cables as urging washington to stop from getting by whatever means necessary bahrain s foreign minister , while declining to confirm the remarks attributed to king hamad bin isa alkhalifa , said the persian gulf kingdom had repeatedly told iran that it should not pursue a military nuclear program none of the comments attributed to the king , he said , contradicted bahrain s position every country in the middle east has the right for nuclear power for peaceful use , said the foreign minister , sheik khalid bin ahmed alkhalifa , after a meeting with secretary of state  but , he added , when it comes to taking that power and developing it into a cycle for weapons grade , this is something that we can never accept and we can never live with in this region we 've said it to iran the deepening alarm among persian gulf states over iran s nuclear ambitions was not a big surprise but the public disclosure of king hamad s combative comments and similar ones by king abdullah of saudi arabia has rattled the region gulf leaders have preferred to voice their fears about iran privately , avoiding a direct confrontation with the iranian government at their meeting on friday , however , sheik khalifa and mrs clinton took pains to dampen suggestions that had disrupted relations between the united states and bahrain , or that they could fracture the international effort to pressure iran the show of solidarity came three days before iran is to meet the united states and other countries in geneva , for the first time in more than a year , to discuss its nuclear program in a wideranging speech to a security conference here , mrs clinton directly addressed iran s representatives , who sat in the audience , to come to the negotiations in good faith paying tribute to iran as one of the world s great civilizations , she said president obama remained open to diplomacy , but she challenged the iranians to restore confidence by opening up about their nuclear activities and adhering to nuclear nonproliferation obligations we continue to make this offer of engagement with respect for your sovereignty and with regard for your interests but also with an ironclad commitment to defending global security , mrs clinton said at the conference , sponsored by the international institute for strategic studies even the parts of her speech on other topics the stability of lebanon , freedom of navigation in the persian gulf , and the need for an independent iraq seemed targeted at iran , which wields growing influence in all these areas earlier , in an interview with bbc , mrs clinton said that if iran won back the confidence of the world , it would eventually be allowed to enrich uranium to fuel civilian nuclear power plants the first time that a senior obama administration official has explicitly said that iran s current enrichment activities are condemned by the united states and others because of suspicions that iran is manufacturing fuel for a bomb mrs clinton repeated her regret at the disclosure of the cables and said that many of the comments in them had been taken out of context but she insisted that the leaks had not damaged america s relations with other countries , and said there was no debate in the middle east or elsewhere about the need to confront iran to prevent it from obtaining a bomb obviously , if you 're the neighbor of a country that is pursuing nuclear weapons , that is viewed in a much more threatening way than if you 're a concerned country many thousands of miles away , she said but the concern is the same , and we hope that iran will respond in kind to that concern mrs clinton s comments came on the last day of a fourcountry swing through central asia and the persian gulf , which gave her a firsthand taste of the fallout from the disclosures news coverage of the revelations has been more limited in the arab world than in the west but , as on a previous stop in kazakhstan , mrs clinton was questioned about the cables by journalists and later by students at a townhallstyle meeting , and she offered the same mix of regret and resolve on another question , about whether mrs clinton planned to run for president again , she offered a noteworthy response after saying she would not a general demurral she has given many times in settings like this overseas she added an unusually explicit followup i think i 'll serve as secretary of state as my last public position , and then probably go back to advocacy work , particularly on behalf of women and children , mrs clinton said that would appear to rule out not only a bid for the white house in 2016 , but two other recently rumored possibilities a spot on the ticket with president obama in 2012 , replacing vice president joseph r biden jr , or a lateral move to defense secretary after robert m gates retires next year
washington humberto fernandezvargas , deported to mexico , had run out of options a federal appeals court said he could not return to the united states to live with his american wife and son and his lawyer did not have the expertise or money to pursue the case further then the cavalry arrived leading lawyers from around the country , sensing that the case was one of the rare ones that might reach the , called to offer free help mr fernandezvargas s lawyer was delighted , and he chose a lawyer from a prominent firm here but there was a catch , and then a controversy the catch was that the washington lawyer , , would take the case only if he could argue before the supreme court himself the controversy was that groups representing immigrants were furious , suspicious of the new lawyer s interest in the case and fearful of a supreme court ruling that would curtail the rights of immigrants nationwide indeed , mr gossett faced a barrage of hostile questions from the justices , and in june 2006 the court against his client , 8 to 1 the ruling wiped out decisions in much of the nation notably from the federal appeals court in california that had favored immigrants mr gossett is among an increasingly influential cadre of lawyers specializing in supreme court cases , attracted to the importance and intellectual challenge of the work many are willing to serve without charge to draw prestige and paying clients to their firms thirty years ago , 6 percent of cases accepted by the court were brought by lawyers specializing in supreme court advocacy , according to data compiled by , a law professor at the georgetown university law center and faculty director of its supreme court institute in the term that ended in 2008 , the number topped 50 percent for the first time many of the cases involved businesses that paid large fees , but a good number were for clients who could not afford a lawyer and have historically been represented , if at all , by public interest lawyers overburdened public interest lawyers might be expected to welcome the highpowered help but the old guard is often wary of , if not hostile toward , the new breed of skilled and ambitious advocates , fearing that they are more interested in the glory of a supreme court argument than in what is best for their clients and the development of the law there s one and only one reason they 're interested , barry a schwartz , a criminal defense lawyer in denver , said of many of the dozen or so lawyers who called him after he had won an appeals court decision on an issue that was likely to reach the supreme court it s not because they love your client or believe in the legal principle your case presents they want to get the case into the supreme court a related development has only heightened the competition starting in 2004 , leading law schools created student clinics focused solely on the court , all affiliated with prominent law firms the result has been an intense struggle to find and press cases with supreme court potential law firms trying to build or maintain credible supreme court practices must show paying clients that they have a consistent presence in the court , and law school clinics have to provide work to the students separately and in combination , firms and clinics offer their services free to poor clients in exchange for taking a lead role in the case that means people with legal troubles but no money can end up with a toptier lawyer with deep experience before the court the specialists respond to critics by pointing to data showing that their record in the court is quite good they say their ethical obligations are to the individuals they represent and not to the agendas of interest groups but public interest lawyers say firms and clinics have sometimes pushed the wrong cases it s not in every client s interest to be in the supreme court , said john h blume , a law professor at cornell and the director of its , which conducts research and allows students to work on capital cases at all levels of the court system if you 're in the gettothepodium business , it could compromise your judgment mr gossett , a partner with the mayer brown law firm , said his case was not an example of skewed incentives we devoted hundreds of hours , and maybe thousands , and i continue to believe we did so to the best of our ability , he said of the decisions the firm faced , he said , i think we made every one right he added that his obligations were to his client mr fernandezvargas was deported after two decades in the united states , separated from his family i gave us a 30 percent chance of winning , mr gossett said i therefore had a client who had a 30 percent chance of being reunited with his wife and child in the united states , mr fernandezvargas s original lawyer , also dismissed the widespread criticism from immigrant rights groups , saying they were not sufficiently alert to the human stakes in the case mr keen attended the supreme court argument with his client s wife , rita fernandez , and he consoled her after she heard cutting remarks about her husband from justice antonin scalia i was on the front steps of the supreme court while she cried after scalia called him a twotime loser , ' mr keen said still , he said , if you 're thinking strategically , maybe it was n't the best case as recently as 1987 , chief justice william h rehnquist remarked that the days of a few great advocates appearing regularly before the supreme court were gone there is no such supreme court bar at the present time , he said a little more than two decades later , the fanciest firms not only represent corporations for handsome fees but also fight to offer their services free to poor clients in exchange for a halfhour at the supreme court lectern handling cases pro bono has turned into a loss leader and reputation enhancer lots of lawyers are members of the supreme court bar in a nominal way all it takes is a check for 200 , three years as a lawyer , being a member of a state bar and securing the sponsorship of two lawyers who can already practice in the court more than 250 , 000 lawyers have been members of the supreme court bar over the years , and almost none will ever argue before the court indeed , the court has said that trumpeting the mere admission to its bar as significant could be misleading to the general public and is at least bad taste the specialists are another matter professor lazarus developed a definition of supreme court expertise that is now in general use a supreme court specialist , he says , is one who has argued five cases in the court or is affiliated with a practice whose current members have argued at least 10 he concedes some inexactitude at the margins but says the overall trends showing the quite recent dominance of the docket by this group are undeniable a pioneer in this area was , now with akin gump strauss hauer feld a decade ago , he developed a technique to spot the cases most likely to attract the court s attention those in which two or more federal appeals courts had decided the same legal issue differently then he offered to handle such cases free , coldcalling surprised and often delighted local lawyers in his first four years , he argued eight cases in the court , winning four mr goldstein s competitors sneered if i'm going to have heart bypass surgery , i would n't go to the surgeon who calls me up , chief justice , who argued 39 cases before the court before joining it in 2005 , told the american lawyer in 2000 i 'd look for the guy who s too busy for that four years later , chief justice roberts , by then an appeals court judge , said the rise of the specialized supreme court bar had had something of a snowball effect if one side hires a supreme court specialist to present a case , he told the in 2004 , it may cause the client on the other side to think that they ought to consider doing that as well this is just a variant on the old adage that one lawyer in town will starve , but two will prosper the first , started in 2004 it has been joined by similar clinics at harvard , northwestern , pennsylvania , texas , virginia and yale the new specialists have not only prospered but have also compiled an impressive record during the last six years , they have won much more often than relative amateurs , according to statistics compiled by , a director of the stanford clinic , for a coming article \( he used essentially the same definition of experts as professor lazarus and considered the 292 cases in which one of the parties was an individual who was , or could have been , represented by the clinic he thus excluded cases involving , say , disputes between two corporations or two states \) as a general matter , the justices are more likely to reverse than affirm the decisions they review professor fisher explored the gaps between experts and amateurs both when they represented individuals as petitioners the parties bringing the appeals , and so the likely winners and when they represented individuals on the other side , known as respondents experts not affiliated with the clinic who brought appeals won 67 percent of the time , compared with 46 percent for others when representing those responding to appeals , they won 29 percent of the time , versus 16 percent the stanford clinic has generally been even more successful in the 35 cases it has argued before the court , it , too , won 67 percent of the time when representing petitioners but did substantially better than expert counsel in representing respondents , winning 46 percent of the time winning on the merits is not the only way to measure success the supreme court agrees to hear about one in a hundred petitions seeking review in the stanford clinic s first year , the court agreed to hear its first four petitions not so long ago , professor lazarus in 2008 , only the most accomplished private sector supreme court advocates could claim to have persuaded the court to grant four petitions in an entire career the clinic , which includes a dozen second and thirdyear students who take no other classes for three months and often work 60 to 80 hours a week , has handled more than 100 supreme court cases in a little over six years its success in persuading the court to hear cases has dropped , but only to 42 percent , which is almost certainly better than any practice in the nation except for the solicitor general s office , which represents the federal government other clinics are now in the hunt , too indeed , the last term included the first case with lawyers affiliated with clinics on both sides it was an international custody dispute , and the side that included the stanford clinic prevailed over the one that included the clinic at the university of pennsylvania but like the pro bono lawyers specializing in the supreme court , the clinics have sometimes found themselves at odds with public interest lawyers focused on the careful development of the law lawyers concerned with criminal defense , capital punishment , immigration and civil liberties often try to keep cases out of the supreme court , which they view as hostile when the court agreed to hear a case on the exclusionary rule at the urging of the stanford clinic in 2008 , for instance , criminal defense lawyers groaned , saying nothing good would come of it when a 5to4 was handed down last year , it cut back significantly on the rule , which requires the suppression of some evidence obtained through police misconduct in an to be published next year in the new york university law review , , a clinical law professor at nyu , explored what she calls the distorted incentives in supreme court pro bono practice the competition for cases that may be heard by the supreme court on the merits , she wrote , creates a disincentive to the new supreme court bar to engage in full case analysis prior to accepting a case for representation there is nothing new or exceptional about tension between lawyers seeking to move the law in a particular direction and those focused on representing a particular client not everyone agreed with thurgood marshall s incremental litigation strategy in the battle to desegregate public education many gay rights advocates opposed the lawsuit brought by david boies and theodore b olson challenging california s ban on , fearing that it would result in a negative decision if the issue reached the supreme court too soon nor is there anything unusual about conflicts between the interests of lawyers and their clients but all of these tensions are heightened in supreme court practice it s more pointed and more obvious , said , who directs the stanford clinic with professor fisher , because there are so few opportunities and the competition is so fierce distorted incentives were in play in the case of mr fernandezvargas , professor morawetz wrote , calling the case a model of what not to do mr fernandezvargas was a mexican citizen who reentered the country illegally in 1982 after being deported when he applied for permanent resident status more than two decades later , he was arrested and deported again the question in the case was whether a 1996 law denying relief to immigrants who had reentered the country illegally applied to him even though he had come back before the law was enacted in 2005 , the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit , in denver , against mr fernandezvargas , saying he was covered by the 1996 law that decision was at odds with ones from the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , which hears cases from much of the west and so has a heavy immigration docket the supreme court sided with the 10th circuit , effectively overturning the ninth circuit s rulings only justice john paul stevens dissented justice stevens s opinion was notable , said mr gossett , who had argued the case for mr fernandezvargas the fact that justice stevens s dissent tracked our argument has always reassured me that we framed the case correctly , he said unfortunately , the rest of the court disagreed not only with us but also with justice stevens immigration lawyers say they learned a lesson from the experience fernandezvargas was a turning point , said trina realmuto of the immigration advocates realized we needed to be proactive about working together with the pro bono bar she added , noncitizens with even more compelling cases are still living with the consequences of the fernandezvargas

washington the had accomplished most everything they had hoped for saturday they stood in defiantly against the rookie sensation stephen strasburg , scored a couple of runs off him , and forced him out of the game after five innings they received another command performance from their knuckleball pitcher , added insurance runs in the late innings and took a tworun lead into the ninth that is when things changed drastically , and a problem that has plagued the mets all season , the dreaded walkoff loss , came back to haunt them again , whose pitching has been erratic in recent games , surrendered three runs in the ninth inning to blow a save opportunity for the fourth time this season as the , in front of 39 , 214 mostly delirious fans the loss was the mets' 10th in their opponents' final atbat this season and their third such loss in the last five days , so it was perhaps an appropriate way for them to end the mathematical first half of the season at 4536 after the game , a somber rodriguez stood at his locker and offered his mea culpa for a game the mets thought they were going to win it was the worst performance i 've ever had in my entire life , rodriguez said i should be ashamed of myself it s so embarrassing i want to apologize to the fans who were watching that i know i'm better than that and i am capable to do better than i did today , and now i have to be better for tomorrow on friday night , rodriguez might have had a similar fate but for the presence of mind of another rookie , mets shortstop ruben tejada , who called for a successful pickoff of roger bernadina at second base to end the game rodriguez threw to three batters that night and got none of them out with his pitches on saturday , he faced seven batters and got only one out in his last two games , he has pitched to 10 batters and gotten only one out \( not including the base runner \) over his past three games , he has pitched to 19 batters and gotten just five of them out after accepting the blame for the loss , rodriguez sat at his locker and spoke to the pitching coach dan warthen , who watched a dvd of the final inning and said rodriguez had fallen into some old habits with his setup and delivery rodriguez said he was not worried about how he has pitched lately , but in only onethird of an inning , he gave up three hits and three walks one was intentional for the mets , there is little they can do other than work with rodriguez and hope he improves however , these emotional losses are taking a toll yeah , but what , are you not going to run him out there the next time \? jeff francoeur said he s your closer the first sign of trouble came when rodriguez issued a leadoff walk on four pitches to the normally impatient cristian guzman guzman went to second on nyjer morgan s groundout and then to third on willie harris s single to right field rodriguez then walked ryan zimmerman adam dunn then hit a towering shot to straight center field , where angel pagan leapt but was unable to catch the ball it appeared to go over the fence , hit something there and bounce back onto the field , but pagan said it hit his glove the hit was initially ruled a double , driving in guzman and harris with the tying runs the ruling was upheld on review followed with a single to right field , driving in zimmerman and ending the game before that , the nationals were 039 when trailing after eight innings in fact , the last time they won a game after trailing in the eighth was sept 30 , when justin maxwell hit a grand slam off rodriguez here he has his demons in this ballpark , warthen said for the mets , the demons have also come in puerto rico , colorado , milwaukee and san diego , to name a few places where lateinning losses have felled them we have our issues , but we ca n't have issues at the end of the game , manager said the game started out with such promise as the battle between the butterfly , r a dickey , and the jet fighter , strasburg , went the way of beauty over power dickey , who used that comparison to describe the matchup between his slowmoving , unpredictable knuckleball and strasburg s highoctane fastball , outpitched strasburg struggling with his control , strasburg allowed two runs on four hits and three walks in only five innings dickey allowed two unearned runs on six hits and two walks and struck out four over seven innings and would have earned a victory if not for rodriguez s blown save he even said that facing strasburg s pitches was not as bad as he had imagined it was kind of anticlimactic , dickey said not that he s not very good he s good but i felt like the ball was going to be invisible i actually saw it inside pitch jerry manuel said carlos beltran probably would not rejoin the mets during their sixgame homestand july 6 to 11 , but should come back on the ensuing trip realistically , the best time for carlos is right after the allstar break , manuel said missed his fourth straight game saturday with a strained right oblique muscle , which he said was still bothering him and had not improved he is unlikely to play sunday , and manuel said monday was in doubt , too but he also said he did not think reyes would need to go on the disabled list
r richard rubottom , a diplomat who influenced and helped hone united states policy toward latin america in the late 1950s , a time of economic and political tumult that culminated in s takeover in cuba , died dec 6 in austin , tex he was 98 his family announced the death mr rubottom rose from modest roots his parents ran a boardinghouse in central texas to become the official most responsible for defining united states cuban policy in the years immediately surrounding the 1959 cuban revolution , the historian thomas g paterson wrote in \( 1994 \) mr rubottom began grappling with foreign policy issues in latin america as assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs from 1956 to 1960 in 1958 he accompanied vice president on a widely publicized tour of latin america that was marred by violent demonstrations against the united states after in the vice president s car , news reports suggested that mr nixon partly blamed mr rubottom for allowing his motorcade to be put in harm s way as a highlevel strategist on american policy toward cuba in the late 1950s , mr rubottom was portrayed in books and news reports as a strong early supporter of the country s repressive leader , fulgencio batista as he battled the rebellion led by fidel castro but mr rubottom later worried that mr batista s brutal retaliatory tactics were eroding his support and questioned whether the united states should continue to sell tanks to cuba after it became known that mr batista was using them against his domestic opponents , a violation of american law mr batista ultimately canceled the tank order with the rise of mr castro , mr rubottom represented the state department in meetings with military and intelligence officials on whether , how and when to try to eliminate him both before and after he seized power in january 1959 yet when mr castro visited the united states in april 1959 as cuba s new leader , mr rubottom was on hand to greet him , and he was deputized to ask mr castro what american aid he would like mr castro said none some politicians and historians have criticized mr rubottom for not identifying mr castro as a communist before he took control but , a former assistant secretary of state , wrote in the new york times book review in 1962 that he knew for certain mr rubottom had not known however , he and his deputy , william wieland , were convinced that mr castro was a hopeless megalomaniac , mr berle wrote , and that the optimistic image created by the uninformed american press was wrong in 1960 , mr rubottom created a controversy by telegraphing gov edmund g brown of california with an appeal by the uruguayan government to halt the planned execution of , a convicted robber and rapist who had become a global cause c l bre for opponents of capital punishment governor brown granted mr chessman a 60day reprieve , although he was ultimately executed mr rubottom said he had merely been passing on information that related to american foreign policy uruguay opposed the death penalty but his action ignited a debate over federal intervention in state matters and prompted president dwight d eisenhower to issue a statement saying the execution was entirely a california matter roy richard rubottom jr was born on feb 13 , 1912 , in brownwood , tex he won a scholarship to southern methodist university , where he was president of his class and editor of the college newspaper after graduating in 1932 with a journalism degree , he stayed on at smu to earn a master s in international relations in 1935 afterward he traveled the country as national secretary for his college fraternity , lambda chi alpha sold kitchen appliances and oil field equipment and served as an assistant dean at the university of texas during world war ii he served in the navy in mexico and paraguay after his discharge as a commander in 1946 , he became vice president of a bank in corsicana , tex but his interest in foreign affairs led him to join the foreign service after taking a special exam for war veterans his postings included colombia and spain years later he was removed from his post as assistant secretary and appointed ambassador to argentina in july 1960 after persistent reports of dissatisfaction by vice president nixon , according to the times after leaving the state department , mr rubottom had a second career in higher education , serving as a vice president of southern methodist university president of the university of the americas in puebla , mexico and as a professor of political science at smu mr rubottom s wife of 69 years , the former billy ruth young , died in 2008 he is survived by his daughter , eleanor odden his sons , frank and john four grandchildren and one greatgrandson when it came to improving interamerican relations , mr rubottom was not above counting beans literally in 1958 he said in a speech that if each american used 12 more coffee beans in each cup of coffee , coffee consumption would rise by 600 million pounds , enhancing stability and prosperity in coffeegrowing nations
conakry , guinea history is sometimes in sharpest focus from the loser s perspective an here last month set people dancing in the street , but the mood was more measured in the quiet backrooms of those now on the wrong side of history s cusp s old order , five decades of dictatorship , left a disaster pigs snuffle in garbage heaps here , children are bathed in plastic buckets outside dark and filthy colonialera cabins , and there are regular outbreaks of cholera but that legacy may not disappear anytime soon so its defenders speak without bitterness and their vision prevails , even if on the streets outside people are celebrating something else indeed , the new path widely espoused for the country a place with abundant minerals and lush greenery yet little electricity seems molded in direct opposition to the contours of the old the crossing of the desert has lasted a halfcentury , read a recent headline in the newspaper le d fi \( the challenge \) that is the territory of corruption , repression and oneparty rule that nearly everyone else here , among the citizens who waited patiently to vote or the many candidates who ran for president , vows not to return to yet some here are missing it already when i speak of corruption , no one no one can escape it this is cultural , said aboubacar sompar , the candidate of the party for unity and progress , the party of the longtime dictator lansana cont mr cont s rule from 1984 until his death in 2008 enriched him and his inner circle they ended up turning the wealth of the state into their personal patrimony , the article in le d fi commented , but of the united nations human development index no one here would understand why , being a minister , you would n't build houses , added mr sompar , the former president of the mostly supine national assembly under mr cont , and before that ambassador to france near the end of s kou tour s 26year dictatorship to take commissions , that s normal , he said , smiling if i help you win 10 million , you 're going to give me 10 there are certain things you would n't understand , mr sompar explained , noting what he called differences across national cultures it was election day , and all across the capital there was a mood of celebration waiting patiently in line to vote , citizens said it was the first free election they had ever voted in , the first in which there was no ruling potentate to manipulate the results , crush the opposition and reinstall himself in power there was no comparison between this election and the previous , trumpedup ones , many residents said there s a huge difference , said djenabou sylla , a secretary , in line outside a crumbling school , dating from french rule , that is still in use before , even the dead voted this time , it s transparent but mr sompar , a veteran of many previous elections denounced by international observers , was having none of it same thing , he said , smiling the only difference was a minor one , he contended there was no ruling party candidate this time , because the army general who is interim president refused to run , keeping his promise but even that difference would soon be erased , in mr sompar s view he who is elected this time will win next time , he said confidently turnout for the election was estimated at 77 percent by the nation s , and the two top votegetters were sharply contrasted the two candidates cellou dalein diallo , 58 , a former prime minister under mr cont , and alpha cond , 72 , a longtime opponent of the nation s previous rulers will face each other in a runoff this month mr cond was jailed by mr cont , while mr diallo , an economist , was considered the technocratic face of the cont government during his time in office , from late 2004 to 2006 across town , in the airy seaside villa where s kou tour s son and widow live , there was also a bid to claim last month s historic vote as the legacy of a previous era on the patio , bathed in breezes from the ocean , is a shrine to the memory of the man who led guinea to independence in 1958 , then ruled it with an iron fist , seeing conspiracies everywhere and crushing those accused of participating colleagues , friends , ministers , ambassadors no one was exempt thousands died at the camp boiro prison in the center of town , many deliberately starved to death under what the authorities called the black diet , or tortured in the technical chamber about a fifth of guinea s population emigrated , many to escape mr tour s rule , the historian martin meredith writes a polarizing figure even in death , mr tour is remembered both as a panafricanist who successfully defied colonial rule and as an autocrat who sheathed his harsh rule in revolutionary ideology this sharp , bestial cry , coming from i could n't say where , was indeed my voice , wrote a former minister , alphaabdoulaye diallo , describing a torture session during the tour years , in a memoir of the 10 years he spent at boiro there is no hint of this on the patio s walls , adorned with yellowing photographs of a smiling mr tour with world leaders john f kennedy , jimmy carter , val ry giscard d'estaing , fidel castro never during his rule was there a free vote like the one on june 27 the younger mr tour sees it nonetheless in the direct line of his father s work the fight that he led , it s the completion of his struggle , said mohamed tour , who was 23 when his father died in 1984 in surgery at the cleveland clinic the process itself might have not been the order he wanted , said mr tour , explaining that his father favored decentralization , and would have preferred elections for lesser offices than the presidency a friendly man who described himself as a financial consultant , and who has spent years in the united states , mr tour is now the secretary general of his father s old party , the parti d mocratique de guin e , a name that some citizens here said made them tremble mr tour , though , said it had played a historic role in building the nation , and hoped it would do so again the most hideous aspects are exaggerated , he said i do n't deny that guineans lost their lives in the process of constructing the nation , he said but he added , you have got to see everything in context the work of the president must be placed in the perspective of history , the struggle for the emancipation of humanity , he said
andy benoit is the founder of and a writer for he can be contacted at andybenoit at nfltouchdowncom it s awfully convenient that the tampa bay buccaneers chose to rebuild or , as they re calling it , undergo a youth movement right around the time that the glazer family s debt soared sky high buc fans will say it s a little too convenient but they should empathize the economic downturn rocked florida , leaving the state with 12 percent unemployment as a consequence , the bucs have lowered ticket prices on some upperlevel seats but are still facing jaguarlike home television blackouts in 2010 the team only avoided this depressing scenario last season by handing out free tickets to local sponsors and charities the bucs have not gone about their youth movement halfheartedly they have a 33yearold head coach , raheem morris general manager mark dominik is 38 secondyear quarterback josh freeman is 22 morris and dominik drafted big receivers for freeman to build his future with arrelious benn in round 2 and mike williams in round 4 that future starts now , by the way , as both rookies have been inserted into the starting lineup \( ps the top receiver off the bench , sammie stroughter , is in only his second year \) the bucs took a similar approach to their defense , drafting under tackle gerald mccoy in round 1 \( third overall \) and nose tackle brian price in round 2 \( 35th overall \) both are instant starters tasked with helping to fix the league s worst run defense this youth movement will undoubtedly carry growing pains in 2010 the question is , will these youngsters be learning how to be pros together , or is there so much youth in so many key areas that everyone will actually be learning how to lose together \? learning how to lose is dangerous it s not like learning how to deal with adversity , or learning how to take your lumps and move on learning how to lose is toxic somewhere along the lines , the detroit lions learned how to lose the los angeles clippers learned how to lose the pittsburgh pirates , kansas city royals and baltimore orioles all learned how to lose losing has become the culture of these teams the last thing the bucs want to do is recreate a losing culture the creamsicle uniform days are dead tampa bay can t use growing pains as an excuse this roster isn t quite inept enough to allow for it the offense has had a yearandchange to learn coordinator greg olson s system \( which , by the way , is similar to jon gruden s system \) last year , you may recall , they toiled in jeff jagodzinski s new scheme all offseason , only to have morris scrap jagodzinski and his playbook 10 days before the season opener all five buc starters return in what is a solid runblocking offensive line , and the men they re blocking for cadillac williams , derrick ward and earnest graham form a respectable backfield \( especially if williams builds on the burst he showed last season \) defensively , there s a frightening lack of passrushing prowess on the outside , and the linebacking corps is substandard the safeties might be even worse that said , this is the same defense that allowed only 18 points per game after morris took over as coordinator and promptly reinstalled the zonebased tampa 2 last november so the bucs have something to build on we know the defense is building around tackles mccoy and price , and around glistening thirdyear cornerback aqib talib offensively , they re obviously building around freeman but who will this team rally around in 2010 \? none of these young guys are leaders \( yet \) and there aren t many veterans to turn to on offense , only graham is a teamfirst role model , and he s a lowly fullback defensively , coaches want barrett ruud to step up his game , but that s tough when you re an average player without a longterm contract thirtyfiveyearold ronde barber has been around the block , but players know this is most likely his last season \( barber s contract is expiring \) normally , this is where you turn to the head coach morris is energetic and unafraid to make bold decisions but his bosses are the same way last december , bucs management contacted bill cowher to gauge the super bowl champion s interest in morris s job the callow , unstable roster is being guided by a callow , unstable coach so how can they make it work \? offense we won t know for another year or two whether josh freeman can be a franchise quarterback at this point , the 17th overall pick is simply too raw to grade on just about any other team , freeman would be learning from the sidelines but when the only other quarterbacks on the roster are the athletic , scrambleoriented but greenerthangreen josh johnson , the rookie jevan snead and some undrafted secondyear pro from the cowboys named rudy carpenter , it makes sense to let your top prospect develop through trial and error last season , freeman got the error part down he threw 18 interceptions in his 290 pass attempts his turnovers will abate when he becomes calmer in the pocket currently , the athletic freeman is only comfortable throwing on the move but if he is ever to consistently display the big arm that piqued tampa bay s interest , he must learn to work through his progressions while dropping back in the pocket expect those progressions to begin with tight end kellen winslow the seventhyear pro has had six operations on his right knee but is still the game s most fluid route runner at his position winslow s soft hands and athleticism create mismatches that coordinator greg olson needs to emphasize even more in 2010 rookies arrelious benn and mike williams are both big possession targets who can run after the catch that s crucial in a system predicated on slant and dig routes their arrival relegates sammie stroughter to slot duties , where he should flourish given his speed and bigplay propensity none of these receivers were supposed to be here , of course years ago , the plan was for michael clayton to become a bona fide no 1 but clayton , for whatever reason , shines in practice then disappears on game days supple but strong 65 maurice stovall was supposed to be the no 2 instead , he s competing with former eagle disappointment reggie brown for the no 4 job both players are dubious when it comes to doing the little things of course , none of the wide receivers have wasted half the talent that tight end jerramy stevens has stevens has the long arms to be a viable blocker , but john gilmore offers better strength and could be the primary runblocking tight end off the bench strength is an issue for the bucs in runblocking their offensive line has a tendency to get overpowered in shortyardage situations part of the problem is the scheme the bucs almost always look for movement from their guards , which creates space in normal circumstances but congestion when defenses crowd the front focusing on movement from the guards makes sense left guard jeremy zuttah has the combination of agility and brawn needed to get to the second level right guard davin joseph is one of the few players in the game who can land multiple blocks on a single play , and he exhibits pro bowlcaliber power lining up between these two is center jeff faine , a gritty , undersized cog left tackle donald penn was angry about not receiving a longterm contract over the offseason \( he s currently an unsigned restricted free agent and could hold out \) physically speaking , penn is one of the roundest human beings you ll see still , he manages to play with good feet and balance his lack of quickness can be an issue at times , but when he gets his hands on an opponent , he wins when right tackle jeremy trueblood gets his hands on an opponent , there s often a penalty flag thrown trueblood has started every game the past three years , but the bucs only retained him this offseason because he came at a cheap rfa price the fifthyear pro should have no trouble keeping his job the depth along this offensive line is awful but if he wants to continue being a starter , he must develop better feet remarkably , cadillac williams has reignited his career after multiple patellar tendon injuries the 28yearold is coming off his first 16game season and could be in line for a 1 , 000yard campaign this offense has noticeably more juice when williams , not derrick ward , is running behind the lead blocks of earnest graham ward is steady but too mechanical he lacks burst and speed , which is why coaches are hoping clifton smith can emerge as a thirddown option defense so how much of a difference can the top two rookies be expected to make \? defensive tackles generally struggle in their transition to the nfl the bucs can t afford for gerald mccoy or brian price to struggle mccoy is being counted on to provide an interior passrushing presence that can make tampa s mediocre ends at least viable right end stylez white is an energybased veteran left end kyle moore is a secondyear pro who missed half his rookie season with a knee injury moore was ineffective in jim bates s illconceived powerbased scheme last year he s dropped 16 pounds in an effort to regain the explosiveness that morris s tampa 2 system demands \( the tampa 2 system , you recall , relies on getting a speedrush from the four downlinemen \) backup end tim crowder shows flashes of brilliance but little evidence that he grasps the finer points of the game brian price is being counted on to tie up blockers so that tampa bay s finessebased linebackers can perform ryan sims deserves to see some snaps as a blocker eater , too sims is known as the bust from kansas city he never lived up to his no 6 overall draft status but as a role player , he has excellent initial quickness and lateral strength secondyear defensive tackle roy miller has good size and could also compete for playing time , though he may have to pass dre moore on the depth chart there s no guarantee that improved tackle play will make these linebackers effective people don t realize how mediocre barrett ruud is yes , ruud is a productive tackler but many of his stops come too far downfield and when the bucs need a thumper who can blow up a leadblock and make a tonesetting play , ruud is often nowhere to be found strongside linebacker quincy black is quick , especially closing on tackles , but his style of play is more equipped for the weak side however , that position is occupied by geno hayes , an instinctive thirdyear pro who has the downhill speed to blossom into a star \( or at least a semistar \) hayes must become more proficient in traffic , though the linebacking depth is iffy former raider jon alston is the only experienced defender no 2 mike backer niko koutouvides was brought in for special teams you can t blame the linebackers for all 158 rushing yards this defense surrendered on average last season the safeties are culpable , too strong safety sabby piscitelli is a liability in space expect hardhitting free agent pickup sean jones to capture piscitelli s job at some point free safety tanard jackson can operate in the box but hasn t shown the bigplay flair that made him an enticing prospect early in his career jackson is skilled in centerfield coverage and should be a more assertive playmaker now that cornerback aqib talib is on the brink of cover corner status \( cover corner being a step down from the ultimate level , shutdown corner \) talib has great size for a corner he s not the most fluid athlete , but he s better than most and understands the nuances of his position thirdround rookie myron lewis is even bigger than talib and naturally built for this zone system lewis will be an instant upgrade over shaky elbert mack in the nickel veteran ronde barber will cover the slot when lewis is on the field barber is coming off the first interceptionless season since his rookie season in 1997 \( when he played one game \) , but his football savoirfaire still makes him a dangerous underneath defender special teams the bucs signed freeagent kicker hunter lawrence from texas to provide competition for connor barth the team had the secondbest kickcover unit last year sixthround rookie punter brent bowden has a big leg the bucs aren t bringing in someone to challenge bowden for the punting job clifton smith is an outstanding kick and punt returner he made the pro bowl in 08 and led the nfc with 291 yards per kick return in 09 bottom line no one expects the bucs to win more than six or seven games in 2010 this season is about determining the future as much as anything will josh freeman prove he s the guy to build around \?

bangkok it is an obvious move when generals in a military junta decide to step aside in favor of civilian rule shed military ranks and uniforms and transform themselves into civilians last week , several cabinet members in s junta did a quick change , resigning from the armed forces , apparently in preparation for parliamentary elections expected later this year under a new constitution adopted in 2008 , the military that has ruled myanmar , formerly burma , since 1962 is preparing to replace itself with a civilian government that includes a 440member house of representatives the new legislature will set aside 25 percent of its seats for serving military officers , a number that could be augmented by former officers in civilian clothes many foreign analysts , as well as myanmar s opposition party , the national league for democracy , have called the elections a false front intended to put a civilian face on the military s continued grip on power according to the official press , the prime minister , gen thein sein , and 22 cabinet ministers gave up their uniforms on monday , a move that was not unexpected in advance of the elections they maintained their cabinet positions , however , perhaps a foretaste of the civilian governments to come the addition of those and any other newly resigned officers would ensure an even greater role for the military in the legislature , which in any case is not expected by foreign analysts to be independent of the country s top leadership under the new constitution , that leadership will also be dominated by serving military officers , with the armed forces chief remaining the country s most powerful figure the constitution requires a candidate to be a member of a political party , and last week the official press reported that after shedding his uniform , prime minister thein sein , now a civilian , had applied to form a new party on the opposition side , the national league for democracy , headed by daw aung san suu kyi , has announced that it will not participate in the elections , which it condemned as unfair and undemocratic that party won the last elections , in 1990 , by a landslide but was prevented from assuming office by the ruling junta , which maintained its grip on power many of the party s members have been arrested since then , and mrs aung san suu kyi has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest the constitution bars people with criminal records from running for office analysts say myanmar s halfstep toward democracy could begin a long , slow process of greater accountability , at least on a local level in any case , the military so thoroughly permeates the government , bureaucracy and economy of myanmar that it is likely to retain vast influence in all areas of life , no matter what shape the government takes it has been a longterm project for the military junta to seek the legitimacy , at least in form , of an electoral mandate its goal is what it calls discipline flourishing democracy , which would presumably avoid the undisciplined clash of interests in more open westernstyle democracies its neighbors in southeast asia present a range of democratic and nondemocratic formulas of government , including the disciplined parliamentary systems of singapore and cambodia , with their virtual oneparty rule but since the overthrow of president suharto in indonesia in 1998 , none of them have been governed by the military , which analysts say is still likely to be the case in myanmar despite its civilian format
albany it was not even 11 am , but the day already looked lost for gartrell johnson on sunday , the first day of giants training camp , johnson was struggling to complete a conditioning test johnson , a secondyear running back , eventually did finish , bringing up the rear , but that was the closest thing to an incident as the giants kicked off their season rigor mortis , coach tom coughlin said of johnson s struggles otherwise , coughlin said , it was a great way to open camp there were no injuries and none of the players were overweight we have an entire team where no one is overweight , coughlin said all the big guys i can t remember being with a team where all the big guys made it they all made it on the injury front , ahmad bradshaw \( feet and ankle \) and keith bulluck \( knee \) did not participate in the conditioning test in the morning , but practiced in the evening kenny phillips \( knee \) and kevin boothe \( pectoral \) were on the physically unable to perform list but perhaps the giants will be adding another player to the list johnson \( rigor mortis \)
las vegas while none of the 2008 olympians are playing in the fiba world championship this summer , there is much to be learned from how that roster was constructed in 2008 the united states had three point guards \( jason kidd , chris paul and deron williams \) , four wings \( kobe bryant , dwyane wade , lebron james and michael redd \) , four forwards \( carmelo anthony , carlos boozer , chris bosh and tayshaun prince \) and one pure center \( dwight howard \) but those positions are merely suggestions coach mike krzyzewski said that on his guardheavy roster , position flexibility will be key more than the numbers , the key to piecing together that roster is versatility and specialists deron williams , for example , spent time at twoguard \( think russell westbrook \) james spent a lot of time at center in china \( think lamar odom \) and anthony s versatility made him a matchup nightmare as a power forward \( cue kevin durant \) redd obviously was chosen for 3point shooting \( hello , stephen curry \) , boozer for post muscle \( here s your shot , kevin love \) and prince as a defensive stopper the usa basketball assistant coach jim boeheim said the team needed to decide this week on the core eight or nine players who will play the majority of the minutes , then fill the final spots with specialists here is my projection of what the roster could look like the thought here is that the core will be chauncey billups , derrick rose , kevin durant , odom , brook lopez , westbrook , rajon rondo , andre iguodala and tyson chandler the specialists could be curry for spot shooting against zone defenses and love for his rebounding knack and beef green could be selected over love for his versatility , and perhaps gay will nab one of the final slots for his scoring
north korea defended stoutly and gave a sporadically impressive brazil pretty much all it could handle tuesday in johannesburg after a scoreless first half in which the two sides had an equal number of chances , maicon scored on a sharpangle shot in the 55th minute and elano made it 20 on 72 but ji yunnam s goal in the 89th was more than merely a goal of honor for north korea it was a justly deserved laurel for a brave underdog to see how the game unfolded , minute by minute , read on ! i m impressed with north korea they showed toughness and resolve and you ve got to remember most of those guys are playing under poor conditions back home and , under coach kim jonghun s conservative but wellchosen tactics , hung with brazil most of the way brazil \? well , the thing about the world cup is that it never matters how good you look , the only thing that matters is to win dunga understands that , and even though he and his team will be pilloried back home tonight and tomorrow , the fact remains they won thanks for following along today , and thanks to everyone who sent in their comments stay with us for every game at south africa 2010 i m outta here for some bibimbap cheers ! just when it looked like brazil had taken charge and would get out with an acceptable 20 , north korea score and expose brazil s weakness in this game and north korea s stoutness all may not agree with me , citing brazil s huge statistical advantage , but i will stick by my guns in newark , son asher reports that the brazilians watching where he is were shocked into anxious worry by the korea goal , but they re dancing again there , if only halfheartedly from johannesburg , jeffrey marcus writes from ellis park stadium about the maicon goal that was the signature moment of this game hardest working man in the jogo bonito business maicon s goal was impressive for three reasons 1 \) he struck the ball from a nearly impossible angle but using the outside of his right forefoot , toe pointed down , he was able to slice the ball between the north korean goalkeeper and the post roberto carlos , the brazilian left back , used to do this with his left foot on direct kicks what makes maicon s specials 2 \) is that he did it running down the line at a good clip his momentum toward the endline could have carried his broad shoulders out of bounds , or sent him leaning but he kept his center of gravity 3 \) he has been the most active player on the field today for brazil he s had more touches than any other player and made more passes than all but one \( felipe melo \) he s the hardest working man in the jogo bonito business elano made the incisive pass on that first goal , doing well all game to be involved in the attack while kaka struggles his efforts were rewarded when robinho did elano a favor in the 72nd minute and laid a rolling pass out to the right of the box for him to slot it away at the far post dunga then gave elano another reward a warm coat on the sideline he was replaced by dani alves before play restarted with alves , you can never really be sure if it is a defensive substitution to protect the 2 goal lead \( ha ! \) or an offensive substitution his shots from outside are lethal brave north korea won our hearts tonight ! korea desperately try to come forward ! a throwin in their half with seconds to go ! the brazilians sent five forward , were dispossessed , and korea came back to shoot , though it just went wide fifty seconds to go ! ! ! brazil on the attack ! korea will not quit ! unbelievable ! brave korea ! goal on a hard shot from ji yunnam ! he got the ball at the edge of the box , ran past two defenders and scored ! 21 ! ! ! ! after jong is perhaps fouled in the area by juan but the corner is pushed away by julio cesar looks like this will be a 20 good enough for brazil , good enough , really , for north korea but no great shakes for the brazilians but his closerange shot is blocked speaking of lulu , her fine note notwithstanding , victor mather is definitely the king of the mash note in 2006 readers were practically lining up to send him dewy messages while he was liveblogging games nilmar shoots right at ri they get a free kick off a nilmar foul fairly deep cha takes but julio cesar out to catch it and end the danger nilmar , in for kaka while i was fielding mash notes from lulu , just fired from long range but was stopped easily by ri check these stats possession , bra 80 , kor 20 secondhalf shots , bra 11 , kor 2 full marks to to reader lulu , who writes in to say i think i m in love with my minutebyminute description here lulu , thank you , and please get in line i shouldn t assume you re american , but your superb taste suggests that you are full marks to reader an american in sao paulo , who wrote in to advise patience with the selecao while it was still 00 another case of american prescience replaced by dani alves another shot from kaka , easily absorbed by ri well , now brazil can be happy for elano , that was goal no 8 in his 44th appearance for his country the earlier goal from maicon was his sixth , in his 59th appearance robinho sets up elano , who slots home to the far post no chance for ri ! what a beautiful diagonal pass into the box from robinho to the onrushing elano ! 20 brazil ! pak choljin is stretchered off we ll see if he comes back martin tyler rightly points out that he dreads the entry into the game of a second player named pak namchol , the one wearing no 14 , to join the one wearing no 4 or at least so reuters africa reports  an excerpt pretoria \( reuters \) hundreds of chinese soccer fans , including artists and well known singers , have arrived in south africa to lend their support to north korea in their opening world cup match against brazil on tuesday dubbed the fans volunteer army back home , many stayed in pretoria overnight and will meet up with fellow chinese supporters in johannesburg to back isolated north korea in their mouthwatering first game at ellis park \( 1830 gmt \) the chinese will support north korea , wang qi of the china sports event management group told reuters in an interview through a translator , braving the cold morning air the first of the half , goes wide now martin tyler on espn tells us the korean supporters in the stands are actually chinese paid to root for north korea i read something about that before lemme try to dig it up also , asher reports nonstop dancing at his location in newark isn t newark always that way \? from juan , who is in alone but crosses over the bar and now luis fabiano gets himself free in the box but cranks it high from right in front michel bastos drives one that bounds out of the hands of ri , but the rebound is cleared away now michel bastos nutmegs two koreans with some fancy footwork before his cross goes awry the brazilians are showing their stuff now he battles maicon to a draw in the brazil end , but loses the ball on a foul jong said before the match that he wants a nice contract to play in germany or england or somewhere else in europe he may just get one my son , asher , watching among the brazilians in the ironbound section of newark , had just texted that the drums had gone silent there and people were glum but now a new text this place just exploded ! maicon was set free along the right side ! he ran the ball down to the byline and crossed but the ball went to the goalmouth at a sharp angle the goalie , ri , was off his line , and the ball went in , short side ! brazil 10 north korea ! maicon from a sharp angle , out of nowhere ! and here come brazil again jong gets the ball by himself in the brazil half , stalls , gets help , and it all results in a corner for the red team ! great diving punchout from goalie ri myongguk ! now robinho shoots ! but it goes wide by five feet brazil getting closer now michel basos takes the free kick and gets it past the wall , but the ball slices wide reprieve for the dpr ! he flopped when touched right in front of the halfmoon , so now a big chance for the verdeamarelho ! the team locomotive across the front of goal robinho and kaka just ran the ball deep into the korea zone , but there were about eight defenders back to clog things up , and brazil had to come out and try again by three defenders at the by line now here s a long ball for luis fabiano , but he can t get to the ball in the box everything is coming a cropper for brazil and wondering if brazil can get something going here paul doyle is raving about how well organized the korea defense has been it s not that brazil have been bad , it s that the underdogs have risen to the challenge superbly , he offers well , yes , but brazil , not bad in this game \? with nine shots , most of them clear , and none of them really troubling for goalkeeper ri \? allows us to present no motherland without you , written in tribute to the dear leader kim jongil , complete with english lyrics our colleague jeffrey marcus is at ellis park in frigid jo burg he sends us these thoughts while noting , my fingers are numb it s so cold the north korean fans , sitting in section u42 of ellis park , one over from the auxiliary media tribune , are wearing matching scarves and red hats , patiently waiting for a good bit of play from their boys , of which there have been few , or a nod from the dear leader , to uniformly wave their handheld flags and clap their red wooden blocks , which add a nice percussion accompaniment to the vuvuzela soundtrack here two plays in the first half are illustrative of the bizarre and entertaining nature of this match , despite the austere scoreline in the 19th minute , min in guk , on a lark , took a longrange shot from about the halfway line , maybe tryng to float it in over julio cesar s head the brazilian keeper caught it easily , but it showed the north koreans were willing to have some fun it was certainly entertaining to see them counterattack about half a dozen times in the first half despite playing a 532 , they re getting three or four guys forward when they can they even had the first shot on goal , forcing julio cesar to make a save before the brazilians ever tested ri myong guk the brazilians are growing frustrated that their evident superiority and skill hasn t yielded a goal yet in the 23rd minute , luis fabiano rushed the north korean defense , again , and powered to the penalty box when ri kwang chong had the nerve to get in his way , fabiano hauled the defender down with his right arm over ri s shoulder such was the brazilian s frustration the most frustrated has to be kaka he s been dispossessed numerous times in the north korean end , unable to put more than two or three touches together there s a red shirt on him the moment he turns i laughed at my colleague , jere longman , each time he suggested a possible north korean win , or even a tie i m not too worried about picking up the dinner bill no way the selecao goes another 45 mnutes without scoring right \? the whistle blows after no added time , and who would want time added to that \? 00 at the half , a moral victory for the north koreans , a moral defeat for brazil , and a moral slumber for the rest of the world now korea have withdrawn into a defensive shell , and brazil pass it around the perimeter trying to get inside but all they get is an offtarget shot from michael bastos after robinho puts on another pedaling exhibition but it s cleared by the koreans ! brazil try to set up once more they pass it around slowly at their back a long ball to felipe melo and they earn a throwin deep in the korean end thrown in , it pings around the box and korea get it out to maicon danger in the box to felipe melo , his shot goes 10 yards wide and 20 yards high oy this game is awful not from the north koreans , who are defending stoutly , but from the brazilians , who haven t forced a difficult save from the korean goalie yet luis fabiano went up for it in the box but was outjumped by the tall korean defender on the north korean government web site the national post in canada tells us there may be no reportage of this match in north korea should brazil win convincingly but we re not seeing much from them right now , are we \? so until they cough up possession , let s occupy ourselves by looking at the korean dpr web site  they had a footrace down the left side , and jong gets a corner out of it now the corner is taken it goes too long but pak choljin rungs it down , passes to ji , who fires well wide along the left sideline and force a throwin what is going on \? he punches aside a maicon shot he probably could ve caught easily but the brazilians do nothing with the subsequent corner maicon takes down jong , who makes a meal of it jong goes right around michel bastos on the left and breaks into the box on the flank , but so amazed is he at what he has just done that he sends the cross about 20 yards too far still , full marks to the koreans so far kaka killed a brazil thrust by passing the ball sideways , missing his target by 10 feet and sheepishly walking back up the field as the ball rolled out for a korea throwin gets off a quick shot while closely marked in the box , but no trouble for goalie ri myongguk cha , who took that last shot , plays for amrokgang , the security ministry club in the north korean league don t mess with him pak , who is looking good running up and down the left sideline , plays for april 25 , the army club our colleague jeffrey marcus is at ellis park for this game , and we may be getting some onsite updates from him but he did write in before the match to report that his fingers were frozen that could hinder his typing ability cha jonghyok shoots from long range but misses well wide brazil with only a slight edge in play so far easy stops for north korea goalie ri myongguk reader stephanie points out that the greeting at the beginning of this post should not be the informal an nyoung , but the more formal an nyoung ha se yo but stephanie , i m an informal kind of guy easily handled by julio cesar , the world s best goalie but korean dpr team fighting ! be the red ! far too early to draw any conclusions , but brazil are hadly dominating the early going the justabovefreezing temps could those be bothering the tropicalia side \? certainly the koreans are no strangers to cold weather but it s well wide i should point out that on their uniforms north korea are using initials for family names and spelling out the full given names i will adjust accordingly robinho shoots and misses the met by roughly 10 yards cha sends one into the box for jong , who cannot hold it but that counts as a korean advance dear leader ! robinho puts on a stepover exhibit and runs the ball into the korea area , but kaka loses it pedala robinho ! north korea , all in red brazil in their familiar yellow shirts , blue shorts and white socks the koreans begin ! that was jong taese , the japaneseborn forward , the people s rooney , who was crying the emotions come flooding back , perhaps a little too fast , and it s hard to choke back the tears ! the teams march out of the tunnel ! it is time for the brazilian anthem , and all the players sing along to the national hymn , which sounds like an overture to a light opera sprightly ! and now aegukka , the anthem for the korean democratic people s republic the lyrics let morning shine on the silver and gold of this land , three thousand leagues packed with natural wealth my beautiful fatherland the glory of a wise people brought up in a culture brilliant with a history five millennia long let us devote our bodies and minds to supporting this korea forever the lineups are in ! north korea will have five men in the back for their first world cup match in 44 years , trying to hold off the samba onslaught for simplicity s sake and to save wear and tear on my poor fingers , i ll be using the family name plus initials for the koreans ri mg ri kc , ri ji , pak cj , ji yn , cha jh pak nc , an yh , mun ig and up front , hong yj and the people s rooney , jong ts for brazil , their trademark four in the back , with the flanking defenders given licence to rush all the way up the field it s a 424 , really so julio cesar in goal maicon and michel bastos the flanking defenders who will rush up the field , with juan and lucio at home in central defense gilberto silva and felipe melo the defensive midfielders kaka the creator in midfield , with elano , robinho and luis fabiano all poaching up front but will any of this matter if the players freeze to death on the field \? it s in the 30s , fahrenheit , in jo burg tonight , with winds blowing to make it feel colder still moreover , there s a labor dispute over the security employees , and the police have been called in to handle stadium security at ellis park tonight that could add to the atmospherics , no \? we begin with \( a \) a note of clarification fifa is using the designation korea dpr , as the north koreans themselves prefer including the team coach , kim jonghun , who snapped at a south korean reporter on monday for saying north korea but we ll be using north korea here , per times style and \( b \) a note of confusion in response to accusations that the north korean network kbs had pirated the signal to friday s south africamexico tournament opener , the asiapacific broadcasting union said tuesday that north korea does indeed have tv rights to the world cup and that everything is on the up and up right on to the footy as our colleague jer longman wrote on tuesday , the heat is on brazil coach dunga for relying more on the imposing , muscular defense of a player like l cio , galloping counterattacks by right back maicon , and the setpiece artistry of dani alves than the beautiful game of the days of pel so it will not be enough merely to win , but to win beautifully and toward that end british oddsmakers have made brazil an 111 shot to score at least five goals in today s match as for the north koreans , whom jer helpfully profiled in this report , well , they have optimism on their side going into the brazil match forward jong taese , who plays in japan and is known variously as asia s wayne rooney and the people s rooney told reporters last week , everybody thinks we can t win that game , but we have brave hearts , strong spirits and that can help us make a miracle don t discount what jong says turns out he s a worldly guy who speaks portuguese pretty well
john f burns , the new york times s senior foreign correspondent , covered the months leading up to the war in iraq in 2002 and 2003 from inside saddam s iraq , then served as baghdad bureau chief from 2004 to 2007 london at midnight on tuesday , baghdad time , nearly 90 months after the first american troops crossed the iraqi border on their way to overthrow saddam hussein , iraq and america will confront the moment of truth both have seen coming for years the moment the last united states combat troops depart , the war becomes mainly iraq s to fight , and the remaining 50 , 000 american troops are set on a course that , unless the agreed timetable is altered , will see the last american units rumble out of iraq by the end of 2011 it is a watershed in history for the two countries , for the two peoples and for the wider world but it is also a juncture of a more personal kind for all who have experienced the arc of the war at first hand , including reporters like myself who were in baghdad when the first american missiles struck on the night of march 19 , 2003 , who watched as american troops captured the city three weeks later and who remained to cover the years of insurgency that followed hindsight is a powerful thing , and there have been plenty of voices amid the tragedy that has unfolded since the invasion to say , in effect , i told you so but among that band of reporters men and women who thought we knew something about iraq , and for the most part sympathized with the joy iraqis felt at what many were unashamed then to call their liberation there were few , if any , who foresaw the extent of the violence that would follow or the political convulsion it would cause in iraq , america and elsewhere we could not know then , though if we had been wiser we might have guessed , the scale of the toll the invasion would unleash the tens of thousands of iraqi civilians who would die the nearly 4 , 500 american soldiers who would be killed the nearly 35 , 000 soldiers who would return home wounded the hundreds of thousands of iraqis who would flee abroad as refugees the 750 billion in direct war costs that would burden the united states the bitterness that would seep into american politics the antiamericanism that would become a commonplace around the world timeline major events in the warwe could not know , either , the eviscerating ways in which the brutalities of the war would press in on us , and those whose miseries we chronicled anthony shadid s article in tuesday s issue of the times about a family s search for muhammad jassem bouhan alizzawi a father , son and brother who disappeared in 2005 , and was found earlier this month through photographs of the unidentified corpses who passed through the baghdad morgue was a searing reminder of the pain that never relents , that will score the iraqi psyche for generations some of that pain has been intensely personal for the men and women responsible for the times' war coverage by providence , we have lost none of the many reporters and photographers we have assigned to iraq from outside the country but we have lost two iraqis working on our news staff , fakher haider and khalid w hassan both of them assassinated by gunmen we were never able to identify , both with families devastated by their deaths , both leaving those who worked with them with a lifetime to wonder what , if anything , we could have done to protect them and wondering , too , as must all who have suffered a bereavement in the war , if anything in the political rationales for the war could possibly justify their loss but through all of the agonizing over the war and its consequences , everybody involved has always known that this moment would come that sooner or later , america would set course to bring its troops home in essence , that has been the debate s fulcrum for at least five years not whether , but when and it has been clear , for just as long , that the drawdown would come in circumstances that fell short of accomplishing the american goal of leaving behind an iraq that was secure , stable and substantially at peace the formula for withdrawal the gamble , if you will was set out most clearly by an american commander who , if history were written now , would be principally associated with a period of muddle and failure in the american venture , general george w casey jr , who is currently the army chief of staff judgment of the general , like wider judgments about the war itself , may alter as time lengthens , and we see what ultimately becomes of the american attempt to write a new chapter in the history of the middle east as the top american commander in iraq from june 2004 to february 2007 , he was an early advocate of american troop withdrawals , arguing that they had to come sooner or later , and the sooner the better , in america s interest , but also in the interest of pushing iraq to accept responsibility for its own security by 2006 he had drawn up plans to reduce united states troop strength on a schedule that would have brought most if not all american troops home by now , as much as two years ahead of the current timetable
if one of s objectives for confessing his use of performanceenhancing drugs was to help his candidacy , he may need to find another approach far removed from the number of votes necessary to gain enshrinement , mcgwire made a longawaited admission and apology last week it does not appear to have changed the minds of voters , either in his favor or against it , based on an informal poll the new york times , whose reporters do not participate in the balloting , surveyed 35 hall of fame voters , and none who had bypassed mcgwire said the confession would make a difference if anything , mcgwire might have lost a vote or two larry stone , a national baseball writer for the seattle times , said he had voted for mcgwire under the principle that a player must be presumed innocent unless irrefutable proof of performanceenhancing drug use existed of the voters polled , stone came the closest to saying the confession would change his vote , and even he was unsure this is going to make me rethink it , stone said i was operating under the assumption that he was juicing , but i could n't know for certain now that i do , i would say i'm leaning against him it s a very difficult decision twentysix respondents said they had never voted for mcgwire and did not expect to change their minds , although many reserved that right nine , or 26 percent , said they had voted for him , and all but stone said they probably would continue to do so before mcgwire s confession , one who had left him off the ballot eventually voted for him the reason i did n't vote for him before is because i suspected he used steroids during his career , tim brown of yahoo sports said now that he s confirmed it , i wo n't be changing the vote most voters contacted , including those who voted for mcgwire , said the confession was hardly a revelation i did n't learn anything today that i did n't know yesterday , joel sherman of the new york post said the day mcgwire went public sherman said he had not voted for mcgwire and did not intend to in the future nor does ken rosenthal of , who expressed a common theme he and others see mcgwire as a onedimensional player , and that one dimension was artificially supplemented his is a flawed candidacy , rosenthal said it is built on his power , and his power was based on performanceenhancing drugs i do n't rule out changing my mind in the future , but i'm not sure why i would mcgwire , who is the st louis cardinals' new hitting coach , has been on the ballot four times since he retired after the 2001 season and has received almost the same support each time he totaled 128 votes in 2007 \( 235 percent \) and in 2008 \( 236 \) , 118 \( 219 \) in 2009 , and 128 again this year \( 237 \) seventyfive percent of the vote is needed to gain entrance to the hall of fame , so mcgwire seems unlikely to reach that level anytime soon although the use of performanceenhancing drugs is an issue , mcgwire faces another challenge to enshrinement some voters said his play just did not warrant election mcgwire hit 583 home runs with a 263 batting average , and many have compared him to a glorified dave kingman i was n't voting for him based on his performance on the field , said susan slusser , who covers the oakland athletics for the san francisco chronicle now that he s admitted to using steroids , he gets the double whammy from me for those voting in favor of mcgwire , the reasons are multilayered some said it was impractical for voters to judge the moral character of players and na ve to assume that everyone in the hall was an angelic figure others said that if the socalled clean players did not stand up to the cheats , why should the voters protect them now \? some struggled with the seemingly impossible task of sorting the cheats from the clean players in an era saturated with drug use and if this is indeed the steroid era , mcgwire still rose high above most of the others , including some pitchers who threw the pitches he hit cheating is a way of life in baseball , said bruce jenkins of the san francisco chronicle , who covered mcgwire in the early days of his career in oakland it has been since the game was invented you ca n't change that you ca n't turn it into ozzie and harriet' my vote for mcgwire is a vote for baseball , and those who truly stand out but as fraught as mcgwire s candidacy may be , it becomes more difficult in the coming years when some players who have been linked to performanceenhancing drugs barry bonds and roger clemens , for instance become eligible with that in mind , several respondents expressed anguish over the process , including phil rogers of the chicago tribune , who said he might stop voting rick hummel of the st louis postdispatch , who covered mcgwire during his four and a half years as a player with the cardinals , has voted for him since he appeared on the ballot now hummel does not seem quite as certain it s really changing , now , he said sometimes i do n't think i want to vote at all
dorasan , south korea every day , hundreds of south korean managers and engineers gather here at the steel and glass bus terminal to make an unusual commute , through the minefields and tank traps of the demilitarized zone and into an industrial park that sits just across the border in  and while tensions on the korean peninsula are at their highest point in years over the sinking of a south korean warship , the north continues to allow the southerners to enter the park , the industrial complex , where 121 mostly south korean companies employ 44 , 000 north korean workers at a time when the koreas have traded threats of military confrontation and cut most economic and diplomatic ties , the kaesong complex has remained a conspicuous exception the complex , the largest economic link created during a relaxation of interkorean tensions almost a decade ago , has continued to operate even after the sinking in march of the warship , the , and the recent closing of other joint projects so far , the two koreas appear reluctant to meddle too much with the industrial park , even as they show no qualms about manhandling each other elsewhere the south is asking the united nations security council to reprimand the north for the sinking , which it attributes to a north korean torpedo the north vehemently denies the accusation and has vowed to retaliate if there are any new sanctions political experts say the park remains open for now because neither side believes that it can afford to close it , though for different reasons for the isolated north , it is a source of desperately needed jobs and hard currency , pumping 50 million per month into the collapsed north korean economy north korea watchers say it is also one of the few economic successes that the government has to show its people , at a time when the north s ailing leader , kim jongil , appears to be engineering the succession of his third son , kim jongun the leadership knows that unless it can raise people s livelihoods , the succession may fail , said lim eulchul , a professor of north korean studies at kyungnam university in seoul for the south s vibrant economy , the park s 250 million annual output is just a drop in the bucket kaesong has more emotional significance as a symbol that the two koreas may one day peacefully reunify even the administration of president lee myungbak , who has taken a harder line against the north , has been careful to keep the park operating to convey to the north that the door remains open for improving ties , as one senior official put it experts and business leaders with dealings in the north say china s economic rise also makes the park important for the two koreas south korean businesses hope north korea can become a source of lowwage labor to help them compete with china s export machine , while the north appears anxious about its excessive economic reliance on china , its closest political ally neither korea wants to be responsible for shutting down kaesong because of its role in our history , said yoo changgeun , president of , a south korean electronics company that owns a factory in the park none of this has prevented both koreas from using the industrial park as a point of leverage in the showdown over the cheonan the south reduced the number of south koreans who can live in the complex , to about 500 people now the north has repeatedly threatened to close the park , most recently saying it would do so if the south resumed propaganda broadcasts by loudspeakers across the demilitarized zone resuming the coldwarstyle broadcasts is one of the ways the south has vowed to retaliate for the sinking of the cheonan despite the recent tensions , south koreans who work at the complex say they have no difficulty coming or going on friday , 489 south koreans entered the complex , according to s , which manages interkorean relations , a figure that is typical on a recent morning , south korean managers and engineers waiting at the futuristic bus terminal here said the cheonan s sinking had made them nervous about their commutes into the north the buses and trucks move in convoys along a newly constructed highway across the twomilewide , heavily fortified border and into the industrial zone , a sprawling collection of prefabricated factories separated by a tall fence and north korean soldiers from the drably gray north korean city of kaesong the managers said they did not know how their north korean employees felt about the ship s sinking because contact had always been limited , and usually took place through north korean minders however , they said north korean messages over the loudspeakers in the complex had denounced the south s version of the cheonan s sinking as fiction still , the managers' biggest difficulty has been a decline in orders from south korean buyers , who they said had stopped buying from kaesong factories for fear the complex might suddenly be closed down for political reasons they also said they were worried that the north would close the complex if the south resumed its political broadcasts we are being used as bargaining chips in a political game , said jimmy bae , director of strategic planning at cuckoo electronics , a south korean electronics company that has a 10 million factory in the complex while discerning the north s intentions is always a challenge , south korean officials say north korea has made it clear that it wants to keep the complex open in late may , north korean officials told south korean ministry of unification officials that they still wanted to develop the complex , the ministry said north korea also announced new rules to restrict the ability of south korean companies to remove equipment from factories in kaesong a move that the south korean news media interpreted as an attempt to discourage companies from pulling out political experts say the north korean government wants to show its people that mr kim s successor will be able to improve living standards the government has been loosening central control over the economy since a disastrous currency reform last fall wiped out the meager personal savings of many north koreans kaesong is their best hope for luring foreign investment , said cho bonghyun , an author of books about the north korean economy china is also a key reason the north wants to keep the park open , say political experts and business leaders they say the north wants south korean investment to offset its current , almost total , economic dependence on china south korean companies say they were drawn to the park by the prospect of the north s 24 million residents' becoming a pool of lowcost , koreanspeaking labor to help them compete at a time when south korean wages are approaching those in the leading industrialized nations however , many companies that built factories in the park say they have yet to turn a profit , partly because north korean workers are not as productive as their chinese rivals while some managers say they are considering pulling out , others show an almost evangelistic drive to put political considerations above economic we are in

washington the supreme court has heard 25 arguments so far this term , but the court s newest member , justice elena kagan , has been on the bench for just 10 of them her empty chair is an emblem of the supreme court s sometimes rigorous , sometimes idiosyncratic and often quite mysterious recusal practices justice kagan s absences were rooted in her r sum she was until recently the united states solicitor general , the federal government s top appellate lawyer , and she worked on many cases that are now before the court in her confirmation hearings , justice kagan said she would recuse herself from any case in which i served as counsel of record and any case in which i played a substantial role her participation in the court s work will rise as the term progresses and the aftereffects of her last job start to recede last week , she gave some strong hints about how she would apply that standard in cases concerning two major social issues the hints came in two terse and routine orders from the court saying only that the justices would not intervene in proceedings under way in the lower courts one concerned the recent health care legislation there justice kagan that she would not recuse herself the other was about the military s policy restricting openly gay , lesbian and bisexual people from serving in the military there she  how do we know this \? the order in the second case but not the first said justice kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this application that is the court s stock formula justices stephen g breyer and sonia sotomayor used essentially the same language in noting their own recusals from other cases last week there was no indication , on the other hand , that justice clarence thomas had disqualified himself from the case involving the health care law his wife , virginia thomas , has been affiliated with a group that opposes the law and has not disclosed its contributors none of these justices explained why that is both routine and in its way quite odd in other parts of the justice system , there is general agreement on a couple of points one is that you should not be a judge in your own case the other is that courts gain legitimacy by explaining the reasoning for their decisions we do have an inkling about justice kagan s thinking about cases on the health care law in to a letter from republican senators during the confirmation process this summer , she said she had had almost nothing to do with the law or a lawsuit filed in florida seeking to strike it down i attended at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned , she wrote , but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred on the rare occasions when justices address recusal standards , they often say they should avoid stepping aside for fear of a 4to4 tie that automatically affirms the decision under review in a oneline order with no reasoning but those deadlocks are quite unusual according to a 2005 analysis by ryan black and lee epstein in the journal of appellate practice and process , the court decided 6 , 815 cases from october 1946 to the summer of 2004 for various reasons including recusals , ties were theoretically possible in 1 , 319 of them but there were deadlocks only 74 times lower court judges model their behavior on that of supreme court justices in 2008 , for instance , chief justice brent d benjamin of the west virginia supreme court to step aside in a case involving a campaign supporter who had spent 3 million to help elect him in justifying his decision , chief justice benjamin cited a 2004 from justice antonin scalia explaining why he would not recuse himself from a case involving a hunting companion , vice president dick cheney in the end , the last year chief justice benjamin off the west virginia case , saying that 3 million in campaign spending was just too much money justice anthony m kennedy , writing for the majority , also noted that the judicial process had been compromised the sole trier of fact , justice kennedy wrote of chief justice benjamin , was the one accused of bias but justice kennedy did not explore the implication of that point for himself and his colleagues in a recent in the syracuse law review , steven lubet , a law professor specializing in legal ethics at northwestern , wrote that justice kennedy failed to draw the most obvious lesson from this contretemps the lesson , professor lubet said , is that the full court should review recusal motions chief justice william h rehnquist was dismissive of the idea in 2004 when senators asked him about justice scalia s duckhunting trip while a member of the court will often consult with colleagues as to whether to recuse in a case , there is no formal procedure for court review of a justice in an individual case , chief justice rehnquist this is because it has long been settled that each justice must decide such a question for himself you could call that second sentence reasoning , but you would be being generous
here are additional reader letters in response to questioning the pope , squandered trust , censored in singapore and the danger of always being on  re questioning the pope \( april 25 \) the question is not merely whether particular stories are wellresearched or technically accurate in some regard , but , among other questions , whether they are being fairly presented as some sort of real breaking news worthy of frontpage coverage notably , none of the matters discussed in those reports are ones that the times could not have uncovered and reported \( had it wanted to \) many years ago could the sudden appearance of these reports on the front page , no less have been influenced at all by the fact that pope benedict is not as popular as his predecessor and , indeed , has angered some folks with certain of his decisions and actions that have nothing to do with sexabuse issues \? the inescapable reality is that , despite their best goodfaith efforts , newspapers do not merely report the news what the public considers to be news is often greatly influenced , if not dictated , by what newspapers decide will be presented as such and this is especially so when the newspaper making such decisions is the newspaper of record the times s decision to dedicate , as it has , its front page to decadesold matters concerning the catholic church is not indicative of any great investigative reporting on its part or , as you say , of merely follow a story where it leads instead , it reveals , at best , poor judgment by its editors , or worse , some form of anticatholic and or antibenedict bias robert r viducich manhattan , april 26 , 2010  for those who negatively criticize the times for its courageous coverage on sexual abuse , please note had it not been for the investigative journalism of the media , particularly the times , this story perhaps would never have seen the light of day , and those in the clergy directly responsible would still enjoy immunity from moral and legal responsibility even if the times has reported unfairly on the rare occasion , this pales in comparison with the monstrous evil perpetrated by a small but significant number of the catholic clergy , the coverup by bishops and the lack of transparency from a vatican more interested in protecting the image of an institution in deep moral crisis martin d story toronto , april 25 , 2010  i am a practicing catholic , and i completely support and applaud the coverage the new york times has given to uncovering the sex abuse scandal in the church we will never heal and right these wrongs without talking about it frankly , openly and completely i belong to a parish where my pastor has supported letting the truth come out it is doubtful i could remain in the church otherwise nancy keefe rhodes syracuse , april 25 , 2010  while i do not see the times as in any way anticatholic , i do believe that some of its reporters \( certainly not maureen dowd ! \) are less informed about catholic belief than they ought to be a better understanding of catholic belief may lead to a better understanding of why rome acts as it does in certain cases times criticism of rome s inaction in the abuse scandals is clearly justified , yet within the context of catholic belief , especially catholic belief about the nature of priesthood , reporting might appear to be less biased and indeed be more accurate reporters might want to look into the catechism of the catholic church \( sections 1536 through 1589 \) , or perhaps better yet , read the old classic diary of a country priest brother benilde montgomery , osf patchogue , ny , april 25 , 2010  after spending an extended stay in northern spain because of fallout from the volcano , i had the opportunity to follow the coverage of the burgeoning clerical abuse scandal on both sides of the atlantic at least compared with the vehement response of the press in predominantly catholic spain , the new york times treatment of the matter was decidedly measured what the immoderate backlash from a lot of catholic readers reveals is that the initial stonewalling by the hierarchy was not the isolated response of some otherworldly aliens at the top of the ecclesiastical pyramid rather , it was an accurate reflection of what is actually a very primitive reaction at the grassroots level the tribal instinct of selfpreservation at all costs joel brence aspen , colo , april 25 , 2010  re censored in singapore \( april 4 \) the international herald tribune is totally owned by the new york times , and there should be no real justifiable policy differences the times management already in financial crisis has obviously chosen economic benefit over principle to pretend otherwise deceives no one and does little for either newspaper s reputation tom latimer houston , april 4 , 2010  your article censored in singapore , says offending the rulers has a price who is paying the price \?

johannesburg dear diego it is high time that we critics say sorry , and thank you we misjudged your appointment as coach we believed that julio grondona , the 78yearold president of argentina s soccer federation , had lost all sense of reason in asking you , a fading icon without a coaching badge , to pick up a broken national team and lead it through this world cup well , so much for socalled expertise whatever happens between argentina and germany in cape town on saturday , your team has been the joy of this tournament you have breathed life into an overly cautious era in the sport your players lionel messi , of course , and carlos t vez , gonzalo higua n and others have blown away inhibition the talent is obvious , even to us failed knowitalls the group of players you inherited was clearly unbalanced you have more forwards than you need , and too few defenders of real quality even so , most certified coaches would set out to do what during the course of the tournament defend in greater numbers and attack only sporadically not so maradona you liberate the team , play to its strengths , attack , attack , attack and when you give license the way you have to messi , t vez and company , you also liberate us when your team rips apart the caution of opponents , we feel like children who all want to be attackers your antics on the sideline personify this we are not fooled , diego , by the gray suit and the polished shoes we see through that formal attire to a man reliving his youth , a man of 49 who was the devilmaycare genius in 1986 a man who went to germany for the last world cup , dressed in a player s jersey , cheerleading from the stands that enthusiasm reminds us that soccer is a simple game your team has superior attacking skills , so let it play to its nature it sounds , and looks , so obvious germany represents a real challenge , especially to your defense yet we 're not sure you care about any opposition the further your team goes , the closer you get to stripping away the myth and mystique that team management is a science and that a manager can only succeed through years of study of the manual i do n't imagine you reading any books on how to be successful in your game having been on the streets of the villa miseria fiorito , the slum you grew up in outside buenos aires , i can understand that books are hogwash to you a manual for anything written by outsiders would not have taken you out of that impoverished , but in some ways happy , place your skills did that and even englishmen who cursed you fisted in during the 1986 world cup had to acknowledge the genius with which you outwitted six men to score a second in that game the goal of the century genius , playing to your own rules still , when grondona , the argentine soccer federation president since before anyone had even heard of maradona , turned to you as coach , we all flipped how could this work \? how could a player who burned himself out on drugs , alcohol and an apparent inability to cope with life beyond the final whistle be the guide and mentor to players who appeared lost and disillusioned by their own national federation \? betterplaced critics , men who had led argentina to its two world cups , feared for their country and for you many agreed with daniel arcucci , a columnist for la naci n , who wrote last year , maybe maradona is risking too much , as always in his life even his status as a myth arcucci was n't alone in that fear none of us imagined what we are seeing now history is against your team going all the way you know , but probably do not care , that only two men have won the world cup as a player and a coach m rio zagallo played for brazil when it triumphed in 1958 , and was the coach in 1970 franz beckenbauer captained germany to the title in 1974 , and was its manager in 1990 what you are attempting is closer to beckenbauer than zagallo beckenbauer had no background on the sideline , no piece of paper verifying him as a tried and tested coach instead he had , and has , the aura of his status as his country s greatest living player zagallo was the opposite an industrious winger in his time , steeped in the coaching ethos , he stepped in when brazil s federation fired jo o saldanha weeks before the world cup saldanha was your type of guy , diego he loved irreverence he debunked the coaching stereotypes he let great players play he shared with them a love of just being the best that a man could be you told us that your message to messi was simply to say nobody ever told maradona where to play , so you should n't have to tell messi where to play , either interesting , because we thought there might be friction between the man who was argentina s most magical player and the only man since who might challenge that designation if that is another misconception , it s time to say mea culpa , and mean it

camp syverson , iraq one thing did not change after president obama officially declared an end to the american combat mission in iraq on sept 1 the size and role of american special operations forces here and if the first weeks of operation new dawn are any indication , their operations will test the public s perception cultivated by the administration that american combat in iraq is , in fact , over we have stayed at steady state , the american special operations commander here , col mark e mitchell , said in an interview at his headquarters , a highly secured campwithinacamp at joint base balad , north of baghdad operations have not even as thousands of american troops withdrew before the end of august , celebrating the declared end of combat , the number of raids conducted by iraqi special operations forces and their american counterparts have spiked , he said soldiers under colonel mitchell s command the combined joint special operations task forcearabian peninsula were among the americans with iraqi special operations troops , for example , when they were engaged in an intense firefight with insurgents on sept 11 in a palm grove outside al hadid , a village in diyala province colonel mitchell described palm groves as the hedgerows of iraq , evoking the horrifying terrain that gi s clawed through in normandy after dday his troops channeled reconnaissance and called in air support that included two 500pound bombs dropped by f16 s it was the first strike by american jets in iraq since june 2009 , said the american military spokesman , brig gen jeffrey buchanan as newly redefined , the american military mission has three main components advising and assisting iraq s security forces , protecting the embassy and provincial reconstruction teams , and supporting iraq s counterterrorism campaign until a final withdrawal , now scheduled for december 2011 when it comes to combat , by anyone s definition , the latter is a semantic sleight of hand , given that american special operations troops will continue to accompany iraqis as they conduct raids to arrest and often kill people suspected of being insurgents , with all the accompanying risks involved in all , there are more than 4 , 000 american special operations soldiers members of the green berets , navy seals and others remaining in iraq , almost a tenth of the nearly 50 , 000 troops who continue to serve here the cjsotf actually pronounced as seejesotof is the unclassified side of special operations , and from the beginning of the war in 2003 , its troops have served as liaisons and trainers to the newly created iraqi special operations units , including army and federal police forces now numbering 8 , 000 to 9 , 000 the military s covert special operations forces known as task forces of various , changing numbers operate separately , and little , if anything , is said about them publicly it was those forces that four days after the fight in al hadid took part in a raid in falluja that killed at least six people in circumstances that remain unclear and under investigation our operations tempo of our iraqi partners has been up over the last six weeks , colonel mitchell said during the interview , a relatively rare glimpse into a mission largely conducted out of public view iraq s special operations forces a federal police brigade and two brigades of the counterterrorism service , created in 2007 to answer directly to prime minister nuri kamal almaliki have increasingly taken the lead in operations none of my guys are actually active participants in operations , in that they are going to go through the door , he explained that said , they remain embedded with their iraqi counterparts across the country colonel mitchell who received the distinguished service cross , the nation s highest military award below the medal of honor , for actions in mazarisharif in afghanistan in 2001 has worked extensively in iraq since 2003 and described a vastly improved iraqi special operations force i would tell you they are the premier special operations forces in the middle east , he said he might get an argument in some neighboring countries , but it was a striking assertion nonetheless he acknowledged that iraq still faces enormous challenges despite its superiority in gathering information among the populace human intelligence , or humint iraq s military has been slow to modernize , creating computerized systems for storing and sharing files , for example iraq also faces a resilient insurgency , which appears to have regrouped after a series of setbacks this year , including the killing of the two leaders of al qaeda in iraq it hasn t deterred them , he said they haven t changed their strategic goal and they will continue to attempt to reconstitute , which is why it s so important for us to have a sustainable and effective counterterrorism force that will be able to maintain this pressure after we depart in 2011
\( e works vagrant \) mark oliver everett , the songwriter behind eels , regularly casts himself as a man who s solitary , miserable and getting worse , quietly or noisily it s a role that suits his bleary voice and his direct , unadorned lyrics mr everett stays mostly subdued on the eels' eighth studio album , end times , which he has bluntly described as a divorce album in the title song , he sings , the world is ending and what do i care she s gone end times are here mr everett , 46 , has written about heartbreak and separation before , particularly on his 1993 album , broken toy shop , which was full of songs about a woman who left him now he s older , more reflective and more deeply hurt in my younger days this still would 've knocked me down , he sings , but i would 've just bounced right back through a dozen terse , exposed songs mr everett proceeds from bittersweet memory to guilt to resentment to a kind of acceptance even the glimpses of selfpity stay matter of fact much of the album was recorded on fourtrack tape , like bruce springsteen s nebraska by necessity those tracks use only a handful of instruments , with a hissy , lowfi sound that underlines the singer s isolation mr everett is n't strict about the limitations now and then he overdubs a modest string or horn arrangement , though he still leaves empty spaces most of the album is depressive , bankeddown folkrock the beginning recalls romantic moments when everything was beautiful and free , but so somberly that it s clear from the first notes that such comforts are gone forever mr everett s humbled voice is accompanied only by guitar picking and organ chords hovering in the distance every so often anger plugs in the music , turning it into skeletal rockabilly or garagerock in gone man , with maracas , slapecho and a distorted guitar , mr everett blames himself for keeping good things away , imagining his epitaph here lies a man who just wanted to be alone but in paradise blues and unhinged it s the woman s fault one compares her to a suicide bomber , while in the other she s a mean old girl behind her crazy eyes the album ends with on my feet , a slow waltz that circles back to memories of love and concludes , tentatively , i 'll be alright i just gotta get back on my feet he sounds a little closer to doing that but only a little \( rer \) silverwater , like most albums by the necks , is like land passing below you from an airplane window it s so big and slow that it resists description it s the same for miles at a stretch mostly piano , bass and drums repeating , repeating , repeating a grid of static sounds or short melodic figures in a cycle there are small rolls of tomtoms , a fournote ascending bass line , a mutating organ wash , light cymbal crashes on every fourth beat over time the music changes , but so gradually that your mind has erased what it sounded like five minutes ago of course you can go back and find out , but that flattens the experience it s better to experience this in person , and you can do that next week they 'll play at issue project room in brooklyn on jan 27 and 28 \( details at \) none of silverwater , this australian trio s 15th album , follows any straightup idiom , whether jazz or classical minimalism or rock it imitates the surfaces of all those things , at various times the necks know endless ways to stretch their resources they isolate an instrument they make foreground slowly become background they do n't particularly care about melody or moving harmony what they really care about is how to articulate and repeat a short phrase , not only on their three primary instruments but also , here , on organ and shakers and a first for a necks album on electric guitar , played by the drummer tony buck they 'll stagger or layer different approaches to these short phrases , rendering them evenly , intermittently , wavelike when the necks seem vaguely jazzlike \( the big tone of the acoustic bass , the small repeated shards of a chattering drum or piano pattern \) , they sound full and authoritative but the necks imitating rock has no wiggle in it it s as juicy as eating dust i much prefer mr buck s more aggressive , immediate , fugazilike guitar playing and drumming on project transmit , his solo album from 2008 with the necks , it seems , his job is to delay everyone s gratification the audience s , certainly , and maybe even his own the point of silverwater is the entire creation not just the taste of each ingredient but how it gets put into the bowl and , of course , the slow logic of the transitions you 're always waiting , with this band it methodically drips all these ingredients into the mix , never breaking an even pace , and you wonder when it s going to shake it up , displace a few things , stumble or shout ie , make music then at some point , no matter how many times you 've heard the group before , you say , oh i see , this the main event yet you 're still wondering where it s going it s got you twice over \( smalltown supersound feedelity \) the first sound on real life is no cool , an early frontrunner for the year s best norwegian electrodisco album , is a disembodied voice urgent , female , digitally garbled , backwardlooped it sputters alone for a while before a synthetic bass line fades into the mix , followed by a beat what should we do \? the voice asks breathily then , one minute into looking for what , the album s opening track should we start \? should we stop \? should we stop looking \? looking for what \? the voice belongs to christabelle sandoo , and over the course of this album she makes it clear she s not really seeking answers to her own questions as a collaboration between christabelle \( who goes by her first name \) and the producer hanspeter lindstrom \( who goes by his last \) , real life is no cool gestures faintly toward human concerns cooing or speaksinging vague lyrics in her scandinavianaccented english , christabelle is a cool cipher , throwing off more shadow than light that s good enough for lindstrom , who has made engrossing tracks out of less his 2008 debut , where you go i go too \( smalltown supersound feedelity \) , was a slowmorphing opus with a nearly halfhourlong title track nothing here approaches that sprawl the songs average a poplike four minutes and most of them predate where you go , which means lindstrom is n't scaling back so much as picking up where he once left off \( two of the more solicitous tracks , music in my mind and let s practice , were out as singles in the earlytomid2000s , when christabelle went by the name of solale \) beyond looking for what and a psychedelic salvo called never say never the album studiously avoids idiosyncrasy the frame of reference is impeccable 1980s pop from sade , say , to grace jones to michael jackson \( baby ca n't stop has the staccato horn and guitar parts , and the casual effervescence , of a track from thriller \) but it can feel facile , this emulation in a longer form lindstrom lets his allusions bubble up as if from the depths of a lake here they skitter across the surface as for christabelle , aside from keep

york mr mclaren , a former art student , found an outlet for his ideas about fashion , music and social provocation in the inchoate rock 'n' roll scene of london in the early 1970s operating from the clothing boutique sex , which he and the fashion designer ran , he brought together four obscure musicians , called them the sex pistols and provided them with an attitude suited to britain in decline nihilistic rage , expressed at high volume in songs like anarchy in the uk and the vitriolic antianthem god save the queen mr mclaren was a keen student of the french situationists , who believed in staging absurdist or provocative incidents as a spur to social change he arranged for the sex pistols to sign their contract with am records outside buckingham palace and organized a performance of god save the queen on the thames , outside the houses of parliament , on a boat named the queen elizabeth the police quickly intervened , ratifying the group s incendiary reputation until their breakup in january 1978 , the sex pistols epitomized the look , the sound and the attitude of british punk all three came , in large measure , from mr mclaren s restless brain malcolm robert andrew mclaren was born on jan 22 , 1946 , in london and was raised mostly by a wealthy grandmother he attended more than half a dozen art schools at none of them did things go smoothly he was expelled from chiswick polytechnic , and the croydon college of art tried to have him transferred to a mental institution he terminated his education , such as it was , in 1971 at goldsmiths' college in london , but not before completing a series of paintings titled i will be so bad in 1972 mr mclaren and ms westwood took over a store on king s road in chelsea called let it rock and began selling hipster teddy boy fashions the business was run along unconventional lines in a 1997 article for the new yorker , mr mclaren recalled , we set out to make an environment where we could truthfully run wild on most days the shop did not open until the evening and closed within a few hours the goal , mr mclaren wrote , was to sell nothing at all after the new york dolls visited the store , renamed too fast to live , too young to die , mr mclaren followed the group to the united states and became its manager he dressed the band members in red clothing based on the soviet flag , placed politically provocative slogans onstage and presided over their swift demise back in london , mr mclaren , now at sex , took an interest in a group called the strand \( later the swankers \) , three of whose members formed the nucleus of the original sex pistols the group gave its first performance at st martin s college on nov 6 , 1975 hostile audience reaction caused the players to leave the stage after two songs and soon emerged as the leader of the punk scene reliably or not , mr mclaren explained his strategy for packaging and selling the band in the 1980 film the great rock 'n' roll swindle anarchy in the uk and god save the queen \( whose release was timed to coincide with queen elizabeth ii s silver jubilee \) rose to the upper rungs of the pop charts in britain , and the group s only album , never mind the bollocks here s the sex pistols , reached no 1 in 1977 on the band s first american tour , in january 1978 , john lydon , the lead singer known as johnny rotten , walked offstage at the winterland ballroom in san francisco , and the sex pistols dissolved mr mclaren briefly managed adam and the ants and then , with several exants , created bow wow wow around a teenage burmese singer , annabella lwin the group recorded the hits go wild in the country and i want candy through his clothing store , now called world s end , he sold ant and bow wow wow fashions he went on to record his own music his album duck rock \( 1983 \) , a blend of world music and hiphop , generated the hit singles buffalo gals and double dutch i'm much more of a magician than a musician , he told the globe and mail of toronto in 1985 i steal other people s songs and try to make them better in 1984 mr mclaren released the album fans , a mixture of opera and urban music , which included the hit single madame butterfly waltz darling \( 1989 \) , paris \( 1994 \) and other albums followed in recent years his name was linked with film , television and radio projects , most of them never realized , although he did help produce the film fast food nation and presented two series for bbc2 radio , malcolm mclaren s musical map of london and malcolm mclaren s life and times in la he is survived by his son with ms westwood , joseph corr , a founder of the lingerie company agent provocateur a brother , stuart edwards and a grandchild mr mclaren spent much of the last 30 years trying to explain punk i never thought the sex pistols would be any good , he told the times of london last year but it did n't matter if they were bad
i went running with scott jurek on a clear , chilly morning last month , an easy fourmile loop in central park he ran another few miles with 50 or so adoring fans , then another few by himself , for a total of about 15 after that he showered and came to my house to cook lunch before going for a lateafternoon jog of another 10 miles or so that s an easy day for jurek , 36 , an accomplished ultramarathoner but one might say he has been in a slump he has not won a major race since the on the other hand , he set a personal record there , it was his third consecutive victory on the 153mile course between athens and sparta , and he holds the fifth , sixth and eighthfastest times in race history if last year was a wash , this year he is fit and psyched for the 24hour run world championship in brivelagaillarde , france , on thursday and friday it is a grueling race to determine how many miles runners can complete on a 14kilometer road loop \( about ninetenths of a mile \) in a 24hour period jurek says he can break the american record , 162 miles , held by mark godale \( the world record , 178 miles , and just about every ultramarathoning record from 100 to 1 , 000 miles , and from 24 hours to 10 days , are , jurek said , unassailably held by yiannis kouros of greece , who no longer competes \) to win brive , jurek said , he must get on it , crank around it , and get it done it s all in a day s work it s a long day , and one that raises a particular aspect of jurek s training that makes him an especially interesting athlete he is a , consuming no animal products there are other professional athletes who do not eat meat milwaukee brewers first baseman prince fielder , a vegetarian , may be the best known , and the hockey player georges laraque is also a vegan but it is difficult for some to comprehend how this lifestyle is compatible with training weeks of 140 miles and more , easy runs of 40 miles and interval training that includes uphill threemile repeats , all culminating in races that are often 100 miles or more , sometimes through deserts or frozen wastelands or up and down mountains jurek certainly looks healthy enough he is tall , dwarfing most competitive marathoners , not rail thin , with a quick smile and boundless energy a few hours after our morning run , he showed up at my house and began pulling things out of the refrigerator and pantry with abandon vegetables , greens , herbs , miso , , olives , shallots , lemons , nut butter and more he displayed knife skills and good culinary judgment , preparing a meal for me and his girlfriend , jenny uehisa , a designer for patagonia \( he is sponsored by brooks sports \) we ate a greek with cucumbers , , loads of olives and seaweed a stirfry of vegetables with tofu and a miso and cashew sauce and a mound of quinoa where did he learn to cook this way \? and more to the point , how does he survive \? after all , i said to him , none of my running buddies , a group of nonelite but defiantly dedicated marathoners who train in central park , maintain as rigorous a schedule as his , and many claim to have trouble consuming enough calories even while being omnivorous the whole issue , he said , is exactly that getting enough calories the first thing to worry about is n't so much what you eat , but how much you eat you have to take the time to sit at the table and make sure your calorie count is high enough and when you 're a vegan , to increase your calories as you increase training you need more food this is n't an elimination diet but an inclusion diet jurek grew up in proctor , minn , eating cookie dough , canned vegetables and his share of fast food when his mother , lynn , developed multiple sclerosis \( she died this spring \) , he and his siblings began cooking , but the food was , he said , very midwest meat and potatoes in college , his diet began to improve , and as he saw how much disease is lifestyle related , he began eating real food , eating the way people have been eating for thousands of years he made the transition to less meat and more fish , then eventually knocked out dairy and other animal products entirely it s really a mental barrier , he said , and he obviously has experience overcoming those he said he needed 5 , 000 to 8 , 000 calories a day , and i get that all from plant sources it s not hard , either i like to eat , and i do n't have to worry about weight management all i need is a highcarbohydrate diet with enough protein and fat he said he spent a great deal of time shopping , preparing and cooking food and chewing he is among the slowest and most deliberate eaters i know , and there is something about his determination at the table that is reminiscent of his determination on the road he just does n't stop he focuses on three main meals breakfast is key it might be a 1 , 000calorie smoothie , with oil , almonds , bananas , blueberries , salt , vanilla , dried coconut , a few dates and maybe brown rice protein powder unless he is doing a long run , which for him is seven hours , or about 50 miles , he eats after his first workout lunch and dinner are huge salads , whole grains , potatoes and sweet potatoes , and usually beans of some sort or a tempehtofu combination none of this is weird , he said if you go back 300 or 400 years , meat was reserved for special occasions , and those people were working hard remember , almost every longdistance runner turns into a vegan while they 're racing , anyway you ca n't digest fat or protein very well jurek said he hated running when he was in high school , enduring it only to stay in shape for skiing but when he was 20 , a friend persuaded him to try a marathon he finished in less than three hours , good for second place and astonishing for a novice by 1999 , he ran his first western states 100 formally called the western states endurance run , this is an upanddown course in the sierra nevada with a cutoff time of 30 hours he set the course record in 2004 , 15 hours 36 minutes won the race seven consecutive times and in 2005 , two weeks after finishing , ran and won the , a 135mile race that begins in death valley and ends halfway up mount whitney looking back , he wondered , where was my mind \? which brings us to an obvious question what is scott jurek trying to prove \? of the few thousand americans who consider themselves ultramarathoners , most would be happy just qualifying for western states , and most of those would be ecstatic to finish before the cutoff jurek , having proved himself in dozens of offroad races , is focused on the 24hour record and looking forward to the flat race , an environment where it s just me and the clock and the road under my feet after that , he would like to run and win the ultratrail du montblanc , an ultramarathon in the alps at a distance of just over 100 miles the record is a little more than 20 hours his best finish was 18th , and he dropped out twice , so it s a serious challenge i have n't had a great race there , he said but though i want to win , the running is a vehicle for selfdiscovery i 've been racing for 15 years , but i feel like i'm still at my peak evidently , it is n't his diet that s slowing him down

last week defense secretary robert gates visited the district of now zad in afghanistan s volatile helmand province to many , it probably didn t seem like significant news gates reportedly went no farther than a 100 meters outside the forward operating base and there were fully armed marines posted at short intervals not far from where he was walking they had probably been in position for at least 24 hours before gates arrived and the area was likely swept for explosives and insurgents multiple times in the days prior to his arrival this surely reeks of political theater to the skeptical , but for those of us who have experienced the brutality of now zad s history firsthand this news brings us one page closer to the end of long chapter in our lives this time last year i was second in command of the approximately 300 marines fighting it out in this very district daytime temperatures were approaching intolerable levels and i could hardly wait for my time there to come to an end with two and a half months left before i could render my final salute to the place that had taken so much from me , taken so much from us , i was tired i was becoming ever more frustrated with what we were doing there and became doubtful of our purpose now zad had been locked in a stalemate since 2006 , when british forces attempted to regain control of the district after several years of taliban rule around the time that the us launched the initial invasion in 2001 , now zad was actually a relatively peaceful place a thriving district in the pashtundominated south the united nations , the european union , and several ngos even managed to build a school and a health clinic , and install wells throughout the town the calm was of the fleeting type , though , and by 2006 the town had become a major taliban command center and logistics hub the devastating fighting between british forces and the taliban prompted the estimated 30 , 000 residents to flee some moved north , some moved south , and some fled to other parts of the country , but none of them stayed neither the british nor the taliban had enough manpower to drive the other out and the battle for now zad deteriorated into deadlock with no hearts or minds to win , placing troops in now zad had been called into question at various points in time but with blood already spilt , it had become a gem too precious for either side to give up but not valuable enough to warrant the resources to win it was a precarious equilibrium in which both sides were tremendously fearful of the other gaining any kind of advantage it was nothing more than a bloody titfortat game in which the enemy and international forces were both continuously winning and losing by the time i arrived the stalemate was approaching its third birthday little had improved over the years and you still couldn t move more than 300 meters outside the base without expecting to take contact or stumble upon an ied as a 26yearold officer on my first combat tour , i was determined and convinced that we would be the ones to finally break the impasse our commanding officer repeatedly reminded us that we were placeholders , expected to do no more than retain the hard gained territory until more forces could come and take the entire district for young , aggressive , and well trained marines , this was a deeply unsatisfying mission and we constantly pushed the boundaries by conducting patrols farther and farther into enemy territory it didn t take long before the enemy pushed back and we started to take casualties at first it hardened our resolve to fight but as time went on and the number of those hurt and killed mounted , attitudes began to shift for some it was a slow transition that took months , for others it only took a single , horrible event however it came , we all got to the point where we wondered if there was anything we were doing out there that justified these marines , these men , these boys , dying and getting hurt since i was responsible for planning all daily operations , the mounting casualties began to weigh on me they still do after a string of hard missions that resulted in four dead marines , it just felt like no matter how meticulously we planned , how precise our patrol movements , or how unwavering we were in the face of the enemy , we were just destined to get more of our own hurt and for what \? we were fighting for a warravaged town of mud huts in which no afghans lived there was no afghan army or government , just us fighting against a ruthless and uncompromising enemy it all just seemed like some sadist s game that we had to endure every casualty left me more and more dejected i knew the mission but , with little to show for our efforts , i doubted its usefulness we tried so damn hard to improve the situation in now zad but it all just seemed futile it became incomprehensible how anything positive could ever come of the place , and that is how it remained , until last week initially lured by the promise of a modest wage , men and boys started to return to now zad only a couple of weeks ago the marines paid them to clean up debris and ruined buildings in the hopes of making now zad habitable again one day entrepreneurial afghans soon recognized the new economic opportunities that came with the afghan national army and opened up a few shops the marines , with the help of their afghan interpreters , opened up two schools , one for boys and one for girls the repopulation effort happened much more quickly than anyone expected and there are now 2 , 500 afghans who , once again , call now zad home entire families have moved back into that very same town of mud huts ravaged by time and war life is constricted to the security bubble that the marines are able to provide and it is by no means normal or ideal but all this has occurred in a place plagued by conflict , a place that has not been home to afghans in four years it is still political theater to some the 2 , 500 afghans who returned is a paltry sum compared to the 30 , 000 who once thrived there , but value in war is a relative concept with a tense security situation and against the backdrop of very real threats , the afghan people have demonstrated their indomitability by moving back into now zad they have broadcasted their resilience and determination in the face of extreme hardship , the likes of which no people should have to know now zad is a ghost town no more , and in no small way this is an afghan victory in a fight that has lasted so long and , in no insignificant way , this is my victory too michael buonocore spent four years as an infantry officer in the marine corps he returned in june 2009 from a sevenmonth tour in helmand province , afghanistan , where he was the executive officer of lima company , 3rd battalion , 8th marine regiment he is currently a graduate student at harvard university s john f kennedy school of government

to the editor re , by sandra day o'connor , stanley prusiner and ken dychtwald \( oped , oct 28 \) as a woman with alzheimer s disease , i read the article with interest and appreciation further awareness needs to be raised about those of us who receive a diagnosis of alzheimer s at a young age i'm 53 and the plight of those of us who , for one reason or another , have no one to act as a caregiver , when the time comes i think that it is easy to forget \( no pun intended \) about those of us with alzheimer s , because our suffering is invisible none of my neighbors see me going to the hospital for any type of treatment , for example , not because there is nothing wrong with me , as they think , but because i have a disease for which no treatment is available no one at the grocery store i go to sees me in a wheelchair , or wearing a sling , which leads them to think i'm healthy , while , because of the deterioration of my brain , i'm having a hard time making a decision about what type of cereal to buy in the later stages of the disease , i 'll also be invisible , because i 'll be confined to a nursing home kathleen hart longview , tex , oct 30 , 2010  to the editor i 've spent more than two decades hoping that a magic pill was on the horizon , only to become more realistic but we 'll certainly get no closer to this magic pill if we do n't treat alzheimer s as the national crisis it is and develop a concerted federal policy to increase research financing equally important , however , is to equip caregivers with the necessary tools to improve and maintain the quality of life for the person they love too often , the burdens of caregiving lead to illness , stress and depression it does n't have to be that way i know i spent years caring for my mother and did n't have the knowledge that exists today we can do better we must sherrie matza san francisco , oct 28 , 2010  to the editor nobody could disagree that our government needs to spend much more money on alzheimer s research but it is disappointing that the article ignores the great amount of research the national institutes of health has already financed on how to possibly avoid this devastating disease alzheimer s is not a totally capricious disease that strikes everyone equally nor is it genetically inevitable there is considerable evidence that certain lifestyle factors as well as treatable diseases make certain people more prone to alzheimer s for example , smoking , excessive alcohol , diabetes , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , insulin resistance , obstructive sleep apnea , thyroid abnormalities , periodontal disease , highfat , highsugar , highmeat diets , and vitamin b12 and d deficiencies it is time to make alzheimer s a personal responsibility as well as a public one , just as we do with other chronic diseases of aging , like heart disease , cancer and diabetes jean carper key west , fla , oct 28 , 2010  to the editor the article s clarion call for increased financing for alzheimer s disease research is timely and important we are right now experiencing an abrupt change in the rate that the american population is aging since age is the largest risk factor for alzheimer s disease , we can expect to see an equally dramatic increase in the prevalence of this most cruel of diseases but the tidal wave of emotional and financial devastation that is alzheimer s disease will not be restricted to american shores the recently released predicts rates of growth in the elderly populations of asia , latin america and africa far greater than that of the united states alzheimer s does not discriminate geographically the elderly are at risk of developing alzheimer s disease regardless of where they were born or where they live worldwide , today s 355 million dementia patients cost the global economy 604 billion a staggering 1 percent of global gdp alzheimer s researchers are by and large an optimistic bunch whereas the path toward effective treatment is apparent , the funds to pay for that work are not adrian ivinson boston , oct 28 , 2010
the music industry rounded out a difficult decade with a difficult year for the year that ended on sunday , a total of 3739 million albums were sold in the united states , according to data from nielsen soundscan that is a 127 percent drop from 2008 , and a 52 percent fall since 2000 , as consumers have continued to turn from cds to less profitable and often illegal forms of digital music as sales plunged in the 2000s , music retailers have also taken a severe hit since 2004 the hmv , tower and virgin chains have all closed their american stores , and trans world entertainment , which operates fye , one of the last remaining music chains , said on wednesday that it would close 137 of its roughly 700 locations although album sales in 2009 were poor over all , one of the few lights was the close contest for the bestselling album of the year , by two new artists whose success proves that stars can still be made , the 20yearold singer who has been ubiquitous on television and radio , narrowly beat susan boyle , the 48yearold scot who was unknown before her appearance on a british talent show in april ms swift s fearless \( big machine \) , released in november 2008 , sold 32 million copies last year , and ms boyle s i dreamed a dream \( syco music columbia \) , which came out only six weeks ago , sold 31 million \( since its release , fearless has moved a total of 53 million copies \) i dreamed a dream was the hit of the 2009 holiday season , holding at no 1 every week since its release , setting a new billboard chart record but fearless , which had the benefit of 10 more months on sale in 2009 as well as countless more television appearances and magazine covers for ms swift edged it out by 113 , 000 copies michael jackson s number ones \( epic \) was no 3 for the year , with 24 million sales the fame \( interscope \) by lady gaga is no 4 , with slightly more than 22 million in 2009 \( and 24 million since its release in late 2008 \) and andrea bocelli s my christmas \( sugar music decca \) , another holiday hit , is close behind at no 5 , with 22 million \( the numbers are rounded \) for the decade , there was another race between young and old the bestselling artist of the 2000s was eminem , whose 322 million albums sold edged out the beatles' 302 million tim mcgraw was the thirdbestselling artist of the 2000s , with a total of 248 million , followed closely by toby keith britney spears was no 5 , at just under 23 million the beatles' 2000 collection 1 \( emi \) was the decade s most popular title , with 115 million despite the success last year of new talents like ms swift , ms boyle and lady gaga , a number of albums by major artists fell short of expectations u2 s latest , no line on the horizon \( interscope \) , was released in february and has sold just over one million copies in 2004 the band s previous record , how to dismantle an atomic bomb , sold nearly three times as many within two months albums last year by mariah carey , shakira , r kelly , leona lewis , 50 cent and rihanna are also relative flops so far in announcing the holiday sales results for trans world , robert j higgins , the company s founder and chief executive , said in a conference call on wednesday that with the help of popular new releases , december had seen our best performance of the year but for the nine weeks that ended on saturday , sales at stores open at least a year still declined 8 percent from the same period in 2008 , and once the company completes its latest round of store closings , it will have 553 stores , about half the number it had four years ago cds still account for almost 80 percent of all album purchases , but the continuing sales slide has forced record companies to find ways to make money online , said tom corson , general manager of the rca music group sales are one thing , but music usage is through the roof , mr corson said so our challenge is to monetize that and turn it into some kind of legitimate business , rather than filesharing , burning , etc we do worry that we 've lost a generation of consumers who are used to content for free , but there are lots of promising signs over the last decade numerous new models have emerged to sell music online , with varying levels of success apple s itunes store opened in 2003 and has sold eight billion songs subscription services like rhapsody and napster sell monthly subscriptions for access to digital music , as well as mp3s la carte , and a range of other companies , including myspace music and pandora , stream songs over the internet but record companies and financial analysts complain that none of these services make enough money to offset the losses from cds we keep introducing new models that provide less revenue and profit than the ones they are replacing , said russ crupnick , an analyst with the marketing research company npd group one of the things we 're seeing as people start using pandora , myspace music and other access models is that there is a clear cannibalistic effect on how many tracks they purchase on itunes they go to itunes , find the pandora app , and then buy a third less songs one growth area for record labels and retailers alike is vinyl albums , which after nearly two decades of invisibility at major stores are now often featured as premiumprice collectibles last year 25 million albums were sold on vinyl , up 33 percent from 2008 that is the most for vinyl since soundscan began tracking retail sales in 1991 , but vinyl remains less than 1 percent of all album sales as the sale of music in physical form declines , the major record companies are bracing for a future in which digital sales will be the majority , perhaps linked to new technologies like tablet computers or cloud computing , in which users would access their digital collections via the internet cloud instead of storing files on their own machines it s that general merging of content how small can you

starting pitching captured much attention going into the 2010 national league championship series , and with good reason philadelphia s top three starters \( roy halladay , roy oswalt and cole hamels \) are all current or former cy young award candidates , while san francisco has three young hurlers \( tim lincecum , matt cain and jonathan sanchez \) who combined for 42 wins and a 322 earned run average this season although halladay produced a subpar performance in game 1 , this giantsphillies matchup still represents a showdown between perhaps the two finest rotations in the game today but how about tomorrow \? given their current career trajectories , how many wins can we expect each team s crop of starters to deliver over the rest of their careers \? one way to answer this question is to look at each player s similarity scores developed by bill james in his 1994 book the politics of glory , sim scores , as they are known , are designed to find a player s most statistically similar historical comparisons at the same age one theory \( notably used by baseball prospectus in its projection system \) is that those historically comparable players will be able to provide insight into how a current player can be expected to perform in his career there are flaws , of course the sim score is based solely on the numbers and does not account for injuries or for a surge in offensive production like the one that happened in the steroids era let s take halladay , whose most similar historical players through age 33 include mike mussina , andy pettitte and tim hudson the average retired comparable on halladay s list went on to win 45 more games from age 34 onward , which provides us with a baseline expectation for the remaining victories left in halladay s arm repeating this process for everyone who started for the phillies this season and adding up the totals , we find that philadelphia s 2010 starters project to combine for 309 more wins before they retire and san francisco s rotation figures to be even more productive than its nlcs counterparts using the similarity score method , the giants 2010 starters are projected to win 339 combined games from next season onward but as impressive as both rotations are \( and figure to be for the foreseeable future \) , neither of their projected totals holds a candle to the alltime leader in future wins , the 1969 st louis cardinals from 1970 onward , members of that cardinals rotation won an astonishing 1 , 027 games , making it the only team in baseball history whose starters could look forward to 1 , 000 victories leading the way were steve carlton , who won 282 more games , jerry reuss \( 219 future wins \) and mike torrez \( 173 future wins \) consisting of largely the same cast , the cardinals 1970 rotation ranks second all time , with 993 total future wins it bears noting , though , that any list like the alltime future wins leaders is going to be biased toward teams of bygone days , simply because their rotation members have had more opportunities to accrue victories than a rotation stocked with active pitchers that s one reason no team from later than 1987 cracks the top 10 in future wins other reasons include the advent of the fiveman rotation and decreased workloads by starting pitchers in general the top team of the current millennium is the 2000 toronto blue jays , whose rotation ranks just 227th all time with 592 future wins \( 255 of which and counting have been contributed by halladay and the cardinals chris carpenter \) here s one more interesting note about the 1987 cubs , by far the most recent team to make the top 10 in future wins they could conceivably move up the list next season almost every member of that rotation has been retired for years \( even greg maddux hung up his cleats two years ago \) , but one of their pitchers is still at it more than 20 years later the ageless wonder in question \? none other than philadelphia s jamie moyer if moyer wins five more games next season , not only will he add to the 2010 phillies future wins total , but the 1987 cubs will also pass the 1953 braves and move into ninth place all time in future wins
while much of the \( male \) world rejoices with anticipation for the impending world cup to commence in south africa on june 11 , most irish \( male and female \) continue to be livid and feel slighted for being excluded from this event by dint of an egregious refereeing error in ireland s qualifying match against france the referee awarded the french an alldecisive goal that had involved an obvious handplay by the french superstar thierry henry thus catapulting the french into the tournament on the basis of a clear rule infraction had this incident been a rare exception in soccer , it could be chalked up as a tragic for the irish with no larger implications for the game alas , this is not the case indeed , similar errors have come to mar soccer on all its levels , country and club , major as well as minor leagues , globally televised tournaments and matches , as well as local games indeed , it would not be too far fetched to argue that the game s integrity and thus legitimacy have been challenged by these serious refereeing errors whose ubiquity and frequency are increasingly part of the public domain because of all the new media that have rendered the game even more global than it had already been what makes this issue so central to soccer s future is because these errors do not so much result from the referees negligence , inattentiveness or incompetence as much as they emanate from a confluence of the game s speed , its players athleticism , the size of the playing surface and a puzzling resistance by the game s leading authorities to adapt rules that hail from the 19th century to resources easily available in the 21st first , there is the need for video evidence this would literally furnish the game changer in those few key situations that decide a match , such as an unjustifiably denied goal , an erroneous red card or an egregious offside call there are two sensible ways of doing this first , one could install a sort of berofficial who surveys video monitors , immediately overrules a blatantly wrong call , and directly communicates this decision with the referee and linesmen on the field \( who are already equipped with earphones \) or alternatively , one could give each team the opportunity to challenge up to two referee decisions per game , employing video replays to review rules infractions and disputes this procedure would give the referees on the field the opportunity , if necessary , to overrule their initial calls these quick reviews would not waste much time or interrupt the flow of the game in fact , in the current situation the berating of the referee by the slighted team s players consumes more playing time than any review ever will second , we need to make use of the already perfectly functioning electronic chip in the ball this chip would decisively settle whether a ball crossed the field s side or its allimportant goal lines just think how this technology has successfully reduced linerelated controversies in tennis s major tournaments third , serious consideration should be given to the introduction of a second referee with each accorded responsibility for one half of the huge playing field after all , the nba employs three referees on a playing surface oneninth the size of a soccer field these measures , including the overdue use of available modern technology , would not diminish but augment the effectiveness of the alltoooften clueless referees , whose authority has suffered serious decline with the proliferation of mistakes that have come to decide major games and championships while none of these suggested measures are new , they would , if implemented , significantly add clarity and fairness to soccer and thus enhance the legitimacy of the game s allimportant results many of these overdue reforms have long been promoted by leading soccer experts such as the dutch worldclass striker marco van basten and the former fifa referee markus merk of germany decisive reforms that easily minimize refereeing errors have also been supported by a majority of soccer fans around the world like the irish , many of them have become increasingly alienated by soccer s old ruling regime and the conservative authorities that guard it of course we are fully aware that human error will never be eliminated from affecting the outcome in any sports indeed , we actually believe that the we was robbed dimension of all such sports adds to their lore and legend but it surely behooves a global product of soccer s dimension to minimize the most egregious and avoidable errors that have come to mar the game s integrity the authors have just published \( princeton university press \) they both teach at the university of michigan in ann arbor
marja , afghanistan they expected tea , not firefights but the three female marines and their patrol were shot at late on a recent day , when a burst of kalashnikov rifle fire came from a nearby compound the group hit the ground , crawled into a ditch and aimed its guns across the fields of cotton and corn in their sights they could see the source of the blast an afghan man who had shot aimlessly from behind a mud wall , shielded by a halfdozen children the women held their fire with the rest of the patrol so as not to hit a child , waited for the allclear , then headed back to the base , survivors of yet another encounter with the enemy you still get that same feeling , like , oh , my gosh , i m getting shot at , said lance cpl stephanie robertson , 20 , speaking of the firefights that have become part of her life in marja but you know what to do you re not , like , comfortable , because you re just she stopped , searching for how to describe her response to experiences that for many would be terrifying it s like muscle memory six months ago , lance corporal robertson arrived in afghanistan with 39 other female marines from camp pendleton , calif , as part of an unusual experiment of the american military sending fulltime female engagement teams out with allmale infantry patrols in helmand province to try to win over the rural afghan women who are culturally off limits to outside men as new faces in an american counterinsurgency campaign , the female marines , who volunteered for the job , were to meet with pashtun women over tea in their homes , assess their need for aid , gather intelligence , and help open schools and clinics they have done that and more , and as their sevenmonth deployment in southern afghanistan nears an end their tea as a weapon mission has been judged a success but the marines , who have been closer to combat than most other women in the war , have also had to use real weapons in a tougher fight than many expected here in marja which , seven months after a major offensive against the taliban , is improving but remains one of the most dangerous places in afghanistan the female marines have daily skirted the pentagon rules restricting women in combat they have shot back in firefights and ambushes , been hit by homemade bombs and lived on bases hit by mortar attacks none of the 40 women have been killed or seriously injured , and a number have worked in stable areas where the shooting has stopped , but many have seen good friends die one of the women , cpl anica coate , 22 , was on patrol in early september in southern marja five feet behind lance cpl ross s carver , 21 , when he was shot through the mouth and killed by an insurgent sniper corporal coate was the first to reach him , but she could not stop the bleeding a week later , at a memorial service in marja for her friend and two other marines killed around the same time , she said she would not volunteer for the female engagement teams again it s not the living conditions , it s not the mission , it s this , she said , gesturing toward a memorial display of boots , rifles and dog tags belonging to the dead marines she was , she said quietly , too much of a girl to deal with these guys getting killed there have been many other strains as well , not least some male officers who question the female marines purpose and young infantrymen who remain resentful of the attention from commanders and the news media that the women have received stress , rough conditions and patrols in 100plusdegree heat have caused almost all of the female marines , like their male counterparts , to lose weight in afghanistan , some nearly 20 pounds a number of the women have seen their marriages end or their boyfriends leave them it was starting ahead of time , but this definitely didn t help the marriage , said lance cpl sorina langer , 21 , who was divorced during her deployment in one of the most dangerous areas of marja he saw it as walking out
wants more major titles and more children , goals that would appear as incompatible as john mcenroe and silence clijsters defeated vera zvonareva , 62 , 61 , on saturday night championship , then celebrated on the arthur ashe stadium court with her 2 yearold daughter , jada lynch , who was not impressed at one point clijsters s daughter looked at the photographers whose lenses were pointed at her and said , no photos in clijsters s opinion , that was the highlight of the night none of her 17 winners \( to zvonareva s 6 \) were even close if we take pictures she s the same way , a smiling clijsters said sunday during a midmorning interview with a small group of reporters at her midtown hotel she just does n't want anything of it she does n't like it i enjoy seeing that i enjoy seeing her express her emotions the difference in the final was that clijsters kept her emotions in check much better than zvonareva , who ruined one racket in a fit of frustration and was steering her shots rather than hitting through the ball , a sure sign of nerves clijsters , 27 , could sympathize she appeared in four major finals before winning her first grand slam title , at the 2005 open the pressure , she said , overwhelmed her when she was younger i still get nervous , she said saturday night , and get that heavy arm , but i'm able to control it better on sunday , clijsters described the emotions that accompany a grand slam final as something that is very hard to describe unless you 've felt it she added that with age and experience you get to know yourself a lot better you learn to deal with , how can i solve those kinds of emotions in a short time \? ' i still have nerves , but i know , ok , this is what i need to do to try to control it in 2009 , clijsters was a surprise winner , an unseeded player who was competing in her third tournament after ending a 27month retirement she described this year s title run as more satisfying because she was saddled with the expectations and the bull seye that come with being the defending champion and no 2 seed i think it s in a way more satisfying that i was able to defend my title , clijsters said she said her approach to tennis had changed since jada was born in february 2008 clijsters schedules practices , fitness sessions and physical therapy around her daughter s eating and sleeping schedule jada will be starting school soon , she said , which will make the juggling act easier for her and her husband , brian lynch asked if she can be a fulltime mother and a parttime grand slam champion , clijsters smiled and said , that s what i'm going to have to be she added , it s hard to answer and kind of predict what the future will bring , but it s definitely something as a mother your priorities change clijsters , who is from belgium , said she has turned down endorsements that would trade on her status as tennis s most highprofile working mother because the companies wanted to include jada that s something that i do n't want , clijsters said , adding i also do n't see her as a business object you saw how she reacts to the cameras i'm not going to put her through that it s not worth it to me for money clijsters s younger sister , elke , who also played professional tennis , is pregnant with her second child and her kids are going to be a year apart , she said wistfully i 've said from the beginning that the olympics are something i would like to achieve , clijsters said of the 2012 london games i do n't think it would be possible to have a baby and then try to come back for the olympics i do n't know if i can physically do that clijsters looked fresh despite having slept only three hours new york s vibe or maybe it s the blue court and bright lights of arthur ashe stadium brings out the best in her she has not won a major outside the open , which led clijsters to joke that maybe what she needs is for the grass at wimbledon and the clay at roland garros to be painted blue if i can do that and if i can practice hard and work hard , the grand slams will always be my focus , she said so now that i'm playing well , obviously i'm not going to just give it up i just want to keep it up
evaluating the success of nba teams requires assessments in two different frameworks objective measures of performance \( wonlost record , efficiency differential , the four factors , etc \) offer a very straightforward , quantitative means of determining a given team s standing additionally , because the chief operators of nba franchises primarily look to achieve very particular goals , the execution of the team s plan also becomes a crucial part of the evaluative process there s an important distinction between franchises unable to execute a theoretically sound plan and those who struggle because of a flawed approach unfortunately , because of the divide between nba operations and the outside world , it can sometimes be difficult to discern the specific elements of an organization s teambuilding concept or oncourt game plan we can determine some of that information through patterns in roster moves , veiled suggestions from coaches through the news media , or ingame coaching decisions , but there is no replacement for explicitly articulated strategy so , when coaches , general managers or owners openly provide some insight as to their specific objectives , it offers a glimpse behind the curtain sacramento kings coach paul westphal gave fans and members of the news media just such a peek in these comments as relayed by jason jones of the sacramento bee our identity is if we can get out in the open floor and get an early shot , a quick shot , off a miss or off a turnover we want to do that we want to push the ball up the floor , we want to swing it from sidetoside if there s a low post man we want to throw him the ball and run splits we want to swing the ball from side to side if there s not a low post man we want to give tyreke evans chances to slice and cut into the post more , come off pick and rolls we want to space the floor we want to hit the first open man and then run our sets we have basic things that we can run depending on the way that our players are positioned we have different keys we need to read each other and read those keys if the defense takes away one thing you go backdoor and try to go to the next option by external standards , sacramento \( 520 \) has had a very disappointing season but what if we judge the kings by their own internal criteria , as indicated by westphal \? our identity is if we can get out in the open floor and get an early shot , a quick shot , off a miss or off a turnover we want to do that after dissecting but a single sentence of westphal s comments , the kings already rate poorly sacramento ranks 16th in the league in pace at 952 possessions per game , which is more canter than sprint their poor defense is part of the reason the kings aren t able to run by virtue of forced turnovers or impressive rebounding \( they re below average in both defensive rebounding rate and opponent s turnover rate \) , which significantly limits their opportunities to get out on the break improvement in either regard could help bump up sacramento s pace , but at present , they don t often get out in the open floor we want to give tyreke chances to slice and cut into the post more , come off pick and rolls things don t look good for the kings on this front , either according to synergy sports technology , cuts amount only to 2 percent of tyreke evans s offensive possessions pickandrolls , on the other hand , constitute a more significant 221 percent of evans s offensive usage regardless , he uses more of his possessions in isolation situations than any other \( by a wide margin , in fact \) , which does not exactly speak to the diversity of scoring opportunities westphal has highlighted evans s injuries have no doubt had an impact on his shot selection plantar fasciitis doesn t exactly make it easy to be a dive cutter or to explode off a pickandroll , and as a result evans seems far less explosive than he did in his breakout rookie season and , his offensive effectiveness on cuts and the pickandroll has plummeted synergy ranks evans in the lowest percentile of all qualified leaders on scoring cuts to the basket , as his cutting possessions produce only 06 points per possession evans has become a belowaverage threat to score as the ball handler in the pickandroll as well , where he also averages 06 points per possession that s disappointing for a player of evans s caliber , and plantar fasciitis isn t solely to blame his decisionmaking in pickandroll situations too often has him pulling up for long jumpers or barreling to the rim without regard for potential turnovers the proof isn t just in the statistical pudding see for yourself we want to space the floor more bad news , i m afraid though the kings are often spaced reasonably well on the court , they aren t offered legitimate spacing because of their poor outside shooting sacramento is the secondworst 3pointshooting team in the league , and according to hoopdatacom , the kings are not much better at shooting long 2s \( they hit 372 percent of 16 to 23foot jumpers , good for 22nd in the nba \) smart opponents know that every king save omri casspi and francisco garcia can be left open if need be , and unfortunately evans , beno udrih and dont greene have been more than willing to put up bricks spacing is a nice ideal , but without reliable shooters who can punish opponents for cheating to double the ball or swarm the post , it means little if the defense takes away one thing you go backdoor and try to go to the next option rather than approaching this idea from a playcentric perspective , i think it s more telling if we zoom out a bit while the kings offense isn t their biggest problem , it s still a pretty substantial one evans , sacramento s no 1 option , has struggled this season his per game scoring has dipped to 168 from 201 , his turnovers have ticked upward and , worst of all , his field goal percentage has fallen to 391 percent this season from 458 percent last season evans has stepped down , and unfortunately , no one else has stepped up of the kings who have played at least 200 minutes this season , only one has posted an above average per udrih carl landry , jason thompson , casspi , garcia , and demarcus cousins have had substandard seasons , a reality that doesn t bode well for the kings given evans s regressed game evans has needed some serious help from his teammates , but the kings aren t stacked with players who could reasonably be expected to carry that burden there s plenty of talent on this roster , but none immediately suitable for playing the role of evans s sidekick it is somewhat good to know that the kings fall as short of westphal s goals as they do in any outside measure of the team s success after all , if they were somehow competent by the team s own criteria , that could lead to an odd complacency in one of the league s bottomdwellers at least now we know and more important , we know that the kings know that sacramento , a disappointing team in most matters of execution , needs work from top to bottom rob mahoney is an obsessive student of professional basketball , dedicated to the minutiae , the overarching themes and everything in between you can read more of his work at thetwomangamecom , hardwoodparoxysmcom and probasketballtalkcom
washington federal regulators warned offshore rig operators more than a decade ago that they needed to install backup systems to control the giant undersea valves known as blowout preventers , used to cut off the flow of from a well in an emergency the warnings were repeated in 2004 and 2009 yet the , the agency charged both with regulating the oil industry and collecting royalties from it , never took steps to address the issue comprehensively , relying instead on industry assurances that it was on top of the problem , a review of documents shows in the intervening years , numerous blowout preventers and their control systems have failed , though none as catastrophically as those on the well the deepwater horizon drilling rig was preparing leaving tens of thousands of gallons of oil a day spewing into the gulf of mexico agency records show that from 2001 to 2007 , there were 1 , 443 serious drilling accidents in offshore operations , leading to 41 deaths , 302 injuries and 356 yet the federal agency continues to allow the industry largely to police itself , saying that the best technical experts work for industry , not for the government critics say that , then and now , the minerals service has been crippled by this dependence on industry and by a climate of regulatory indulgence everything that s done by the oil industry is done for profit , said senator bill nelson , democrat of florida , who demanded this week that the interior department investigate these backup safety systems throw in the fact that regulators have taken a lax attitude toward overseeing their operations , and you have a recipe for catastrophe last year , bp , the owner of the well that blew up in the gulf , teamed with other offshore operators to and more frequent inspections bp said that extensive , prescriptive regulations were not needed for , and urged the minerals service to allow operators to define the steps they would take to ensure safety largely on their own walter d cruickshank , the deputy director of the management service , disputed the idea that the agency had a history of deference to the industry or a pattern of lax oversight we have inspectors going offshore every day that the weather allows , mr cruickshank said , citing orders to shut down oil operations 117 times last year the enforcement is quite strict he added that agency officials remained committed to adopting the new safety rule , despite industry objections i think you can assume that rule is going forward , he said numerous congressional and internal investigations have called the oversight agency badly mismanaged and at times corrupt it has been rocked by regular scandals , including disclosures in 2008 that agency officials took bribes and engaged in drug use and sex with oil industry officials and its own scientists have said that senior agency officials in recent years that might have complicated oilcompany drilling applications for offshore sites in waters near alaska problems at mms did not originate in this administration or its predecessor , said representative darrell issa of california , the senior republican of the house oversight and government reform committee there is a bureaucracy and dysfunctional culture that has to be held accountable mr issa and other members of congress are now asking why repeated warnings about potentially faulty safety equipment like the blowout preventers apparently went unheeded by the industry and unaddressed by the government questions about the blowout preventers which bp executives have said are at least partly to blame for the april 20 accident date at least to february 2000 , when after a crew member accidentally pushed the wrong button , severing the connection between the rig and its blowout prevention device , known as a bop the rig was not equipped with a secondary system capable of securing the well in the absence of the primary bop controls , said a federal report on the accident to combat this serious safety flaw , the agency and , after yet more problems emerged with a blowout preventer , reminding them that they needed to have a reliable backup system in place but the agency never tried to write regulations that would detail the requirements for the backup systems instead , over a decade ago , with the industry s support , the agency to once every 14 days from once a week , citing the disruptions that these tests caused to oil drilling and extraction efforts in the absence of government regulations , all 23 of the oil drilling rigs currently working in the gulf of mexico rely on a backup device known as a remotely controlled submersible vehicle to turn on the blowout preventers if primary controls fail that was the case with the deepwater horizon rig as well but a consultant hired by the mineral service in 2003 warned that these machines were , moving too slowly and often lacking power to do the job worse , the same consultant concluded in a that even if rig crews managed to turn the blowout preventer on , the most critical safety component inside these machines the shear ram , which is meant to cut quickly through the well pipe to stop the flow of oil and gas was often not strong enough to cut through the modern pipes that drilling rigs use this grim snapshot illustrates the lack of preparedness in the industry to shear and seal a well with the last line of defense against a blowout , said the september 2004 report , written by west engineering industry executives say they have taken steps to address these concerns it is a reliable piece of equipment , robert lanza , a houston oil executive who serves as cochairman of industry s powerful offshore operators committee , said of blowout preventers transocean , the company that operated the deepwater horizon rig for bp , has been cited twice in recent years by the authorities in britain for failing to properly maintain a blowout preventer and related testing equipment on an offshore drill site there , with officials saying in november 2006 that the device failed in service , exposing persons to risks that endangered their safety minerals management service officials have also pointed to in recent years but in an interview this week , senior officials of the agency said that in light of the april accident , they could not confidently assert that the longidentified shortcomings with the blowout preventers had been resolved adequately all of these things need to be reexamined , mr cruickshank said elsewhere around the world , the trend has been to split up agencies like the minerals management service , separating the officials who are responsible for overseeing natural resource extraction from those who are charged with ensuring its safety for example , in 2005 , australia created a separate regulator the , following the lead of britain , which severed these functions after a 1988 oil rig explosion in the north sea , known as the piper alpha accident , that killed 167 people it has to be that way , said david doig , the chief executive of an industryowned nonprofit organization in britain , the offshore petroleum industry training organization you need to divorce operations monitoring from the integrity monitoring , because operations will always be the one driving behavior they 're motivated by the need to keep things going , and the finances rolling

there s one element of the nutcracker that america embraces as europe does not in the various entertainment dances that occur in act ii , there s a comic number for a mother of many clownchildren , la m re gigogne her english name is usually mother ginger tchaikovsky s music for her is like a series of fairground tunes amid a ballet of myriad orchestral colors , the composer is at his most deliberately vulgar here and almost every european production i 've seen has omitted it this episode is simply too coarse for those refined ears i'm british , and my ears used to be that way , too but on this point at least i 've learned from america and from tchaikovsky he puts mother ginger there right next to the mirlitons \( marzipan \) number , which is among his most if you listen to them in sequence , you really hear just how much contrast of tone he wanted in the nutcracker now classy \( the mirlitons are often staged in an 18thcentury french pastorale \) , now brash almost every american nutcracker includes mother ginger and makes her one of its most beloved gueststar turns she s one of the reasons both the nutcracker and america seem so inclusive , so allembracing the ballet , like the nation , contains high and low , upfront on she comes gigantic , sideways ! she s wearing a vast crinoline , and she s nearly always played by a man , on stilts or supported by one or more unseen dancers every company accentuates her a little differently \( at the washington ballet , her skirts are a whole carousel \) , and she s among the many reasons i do n't tire of the nutcracker on saturday afternoon ben delony of ballet memphis played her entry as if she were asleep , sidling on unconsciously then she woke up well , hello , folks ! \( mr delony , also striking as an act i pierrot , is one of many gifted american dance artists i'm discovering on my nutcracker marathon \) next mother ginger tugs at a string to open up a curtain in her skirts out pops one polichinelle \( clown \) child no , two ! no , eight ! well , ballet memphis goes further this ginger has 10 in the hard nut , mark morris s version the only one of the 17 i 've seen so far this season to play all of tchaikovsky s score in its correct sequence without cuts or interpolations there s no mother ginger \( her music is used to tie up other narrative threads \) instead , mr morris has an equivalent character who s more central mrs stahlbaum , the heroine s mother she , too , is played by a man \( john heginbotham \) , and the dance she presides over a fertility ritual she seems not to want to understand is the waltz of the flowers vain , feckless , affected , vulgar , silly but tenderhearted , she s the american dance equivalent of one of the great comic mothers of fiction mrs bennet in pride and prejudice of the five nutcrackers i added to my tally from thursday to sunday , handsomely designed by david walker was the most traditional in other repertory , this company draws on memphis musical traditions , like its , in dreams , choreographed by trey mcintyre but although i caught this nutcracker at the orpheum at the end of beale street , it was another memphis company , the new ballet ensemble , that actually set its version , , on that thoroughfare it also replaced several of tchaikovsky s items with numbers from other sources , including one memphis rb classic , by booker t and the mgs , as well as relatively authentic african , spanish and chinese music and dance alongside a more conventional version of tchaikovsky s arabian dance meanwhile s nashville nutcracker is set at the 1897 tennessee centennial exposition little clara , taken there by drosselmeyer \( her favorite uncle \) , meets characters who will return in her christmas dream a purist could argue that all these stagings are deviations from the one true nutcracker but that one true nutcracker does n't exist among traditional versions , i already had two yardsticks before i set out on this tour george balanchine s at \( it is also danced by several other american companies \) and the royal ballet s 198497 version \( alas , subsequently ruined by revisions \) , but each of them makes cuts in the music and disregards details of the scenario tchaikovsky was illustrating \( the balanchine which actually enlarges the scale of nutcracker drama with its childmothergodfather scene set to music from the sleeping beauty still strikes me as the most endlessly revisitable , the most profound and varied masterpiece among all nutcrackers \) tchaikovsky s score is greater more detailed , more varied than any one staging but what i 've loved in most of these american nutcrackers is that they bring out as few european stagings do the ballet s generosity , its omniumgatherum celebration of diversity it s as if the sugar plum fairy and america , like mother ginger , have abundant room in their hearts and homes the ballet seems to say , bring me your high and your low , your authentic and your fake , your grand classical and your vaudeville hokum does this mean any nutcracker production will do well enough \? not in my heart , no i can take modern dress , fishnet tights , elements of striptease and seamysideoflife drama in the nutcracker in the snow scene cannily sustained the idea of a cocainefest , with its characters going through the giddy ups and miserable downs of drug intake while the snow queen acted as pusher it s possible that i caught this production , now in its fourth new york season , too early in its current run but in the performance i saw , its attempt to treat the nutcracker as the rocky horror show did n't really go far enough the dancers were roguishly flirtatious are n't we just the wickedest things \? as a result , the comedy stayed high school and , worse , smallspirited meanwhile other productions have simply shown me more of america past and present nashville 1897 , memphis today , a in 1902 , manhattan s lower east side now perhaps none shows more sides of america than the hard nut the wizard of oz transformation from blackandwhite into color the secret despair within the artificial bourgeois setting and the affected nuclear white family with its black maid the cartoon craziness and the explosive utopian dream , alternately grand and intimate , of how love and society could be but the month is not yet old other nutcrackers await

through as they come back down to the field they re pretty grimfaced , but remember , a lot of these guys are teammates and friends , and you ve got to get choked up a bit at their sportsmanship now the spanish will pile onto the field with the trophy to pose for their team picture and to run the cup around the stadium in a lap of honor congratulations , spain ! iker casillas climbs onto the podium the last man up there ! blatter comes over with the world cup , hands it to him and he lifts it high ! spain , champions of the south africa 2010 , champions of the world ! the one you get for being world champion nice touch ! they re beaming broadly as they climb the stairs ! first to get a medal is sergio ramos ! reserve player llorente bends over to kiss the trophy itself ! now the players line up on the podium to leap up and down in a moment , they ll lift the world cup ! howard webb and his officiating crew go to the podium to get their medals meanwhile ruud gullit is expressing his disappointment on abc a terrible game he calls it , boring , and not an advert for football today now the dutch to the podium for the bitter task of picking up their medals from blatter and president zuma jeffrey marcus is on scene many of the spanish players can t even celebrate they re too busy crying so much energy and emotion went into this game this tournament that after andres iniesta scored , release was more important iker casillas ran to the exact opposite corner of the field to celebrate the extra time goal while his teammates piled on iniesta in one corner , he jumped to the other and grabbed his face and wiped away tears and screamed after the game , the spanish players embraced in small groups before coming together to bounce and hug as a group mark van bommel went straight to howard webb and his assistant referees to yell some more the dutch players were furious with webb during overtime for both sending off heitinga for a second yellow card offense on a dubious foul \( there were so many in this game ! \) on iniesta they also seemed to be angry that the referee s assistant didn t call offsides on iniesta when he scored in the 116th minute in fact , iniesta was clearly on side the spanish players have now changed into their red shirts , and tried to toss coach vicente del bosque in the air they accomplished the first task with relative ease , the second was more problematic spain have changed into their traditional red shirts to celebrate this title , which they now hold alongside the european championship when iniesta scored the goal that gave spain this world cup , he whipped off a shirt that read , in spanish , dani jarque , you are always with us that was a reference to the espanyol player who died of a heart attack earlier this season  robben on the ground , gutted ! the spanish royal family , leaping into the air to celebrate at the final whistle ! spain s first world championship they are the first team to win the world championship after losing the opening game of the tournament the final whistle ! iniesta on his knees , his fists held high ! spain have won the world championship ! iker casillas in tears ! the spain fans ecstatic in the stands ! torres pulled up lame and rolls around , wasting seconds play resumes , a hoof into the box , but the dutch can t get to it ! but puyol clears ! the dutch on the bench , their hands together in supplication ! the final seconds ! another yellow to xavi for kicking the ball away from the dutch before a free kick time wasting ! the dutch hoof it into the area a desperate attack ! arguments breaking out a free kick for spain now after a foul two minutes have been added ! the dutch complain to webb about offside , but it wasn t ! they gather around the linesman ! now webb issues a yellow to mathijsen , who threw the ball to the ground in anger iniesta also gets a yellow for taking his shirt off to vcelebrate the goal at the other end of the field , casillas in tears ! the emotions too much for the spain keeper ! he ran and ran and ran , got the ball to torres , then to fabregas cesc s pass went to iniesta in the box , who fired past stekelenurg ! 10 to spain ! ! iniesta ! iniesta ! it went off a spanish player in the wall and just missed , with the diving casillas in hot pursuit but webb did not see it and fails to award the corner a foul 35 yards out , and a dutch chance ! five in the spanish wall just seven minutes to go ! please not penalties ! robben just kicked the ball into the spanish net after an offside call breach of etiquette ! iniesta dived to draw that foul ! that was a phantom foul free kick from xavi but stekelenburg punches away ! the dutch survive another threat but xavi shoots too high ! there were five men in the box for the dutch , but he shot too high anyway ! the 10man dutch survive ! a second yellow for heitinga for taking down iniesta in the half moon ! he s out of the game ! a strict foul ! but the dutch now playing with 10 men ! they work their way up the field robben sets up elia , but he can t quite cross it before it goes over the by line this just in from jeffrey marcus at the stadium in his pregame news conference on saturday , spain coach vicente del bosque said his team did not practice penalty kicks ahead of the final he said he didn t believe in it and instead his team would try to win the game outright besides , it wouldn t make a difference , the coach said , because there is no way to duplicate the reallife pressure of such a situation what you do in your training session has nothing to do with what goes on in an official match , he said still , kicks from the penalty spot seems likely here a shocking substitution ! del bosque is going to give torres a try now and now the last 15 minutes begin ! it came on a play early in extra time , a scramble at the lip of the dutch area xavi dove like an olympic springboard champ , but ref webb did not fall for it naughty naughty , mr xavi ! and the whistle blows ! just 15 minutes left before we go to penalties ! it s elia applying pressure on the left side , but sergio ramos won t let him through ! and now a dutch change van bronckhorst leaves for edson braafheid that s it for van bronckhorst s international career what a fine game he had both teams probing , trying to score , trying to avoid the lottery of penalties ! here s fabregas , bursting through and just shooting wide from 20 yards ! jesus navas s shot deflected off a dutch defender s leg and hit the side of the net ! dutch goalkeeper stekelenburg , on the ground , smiling in relief ! so very very close ! ! the real madrrid striker will try to be the hero of the 2010 world cup final iniesta broke into the box on a twoonone , but the veteran defender , playing his last game for the dutch , came over to break it up on the penalty spot ! but too high for puyol to get his head to effectively the action has picked up but maybe that s because i m watching this game now on univision a corner at the other end , and mathijsen headed just over the bar ! his second near miss of the match ! xavi knocked over , and from his knees he asks webb to issue a card but no ! play on ! a breakaway for cesc was stopped by the onrushing dutch goalie ! they stole the ball from the dutch at center and sent fabregas away , but the dutch keeper saved with his foot ! but it falls to stekelenburg watching now on univision , and it s already twice as exciting as on abc maybe extra time will provide the thrills generally lacking in the first 90 robben tried to run through three sapniards just now and got past two before being stopped arjen robben was stopped by casillas on two breakaways , and probably deserved a foul just outside the area on the last one so those complaining about the netherlands rugged play , just remember that before you get all selfrighteous possession in this match ned 33 66 esp and the dutch steal to counter , but sneijder fired wide from 40 yards ok , we re resigned to it bring on extra time ! a dutch counterattack fizzles that s the pattern now spanish control , a cross in , a clearance , a quick dutch counter , nothing and then spain start the sequence anew three minutes added ! and aptly , it s part of a long passage of tocatoca at midfield we re just two minutes from extra time ! the arsenal attacker gets a sniff of action will he be the saviour for spain \? robben ran through puyol and was stopped only by the onrushing casillas ! he had been fouled by puyol just outside the box , but he stayed on his feet , and then was stopped by the goalkeeper all the way back up the field robben shouted at the referee for a foul , but in the end , all he got for his trouble was a yellow for dissent ! the dutch , hard done by ! he had gone right through heitinga but sneijder stopped him cold in the area would ve been a goal for sure ! a moment earlier , xabi had escaped two dutch defenders to set iniesta up for that run here comes another chance for la furia roja but headed away by de jong now xavi crosses in , but it s too far well , it always does seem to take spain 15 or 20 shots to score they ve got to be getting close to that now we ask that as van bommel knocks iniesta down , then iniesta whacks van bommel back , but webb does not issue any cards both could have been ejected from the game for that van de weil tips a shot just wide and now the corner headed high by sergio ramos ! he was unmarked in the box , and he sent the unchallenged header too high ! this is like watching an assistant principal in a schoolyard navas crosses to villa , whose volley in the area wasn t even close heitinga tripped up iniesta in front of the half moon , 20 yards from goal four men in the dutch box villa takes the free kick , but it misses the game grinds on missed this change in the 60th minute jesus navas comes on for pedro in the 60th minute , not fernando torres spain s star striker before the tournament has struggled mightily and despite public pronouncements from coach vicente del bosque , it appears clear he has no faith in torres s ability to play his best at this level in such a crucial game this is only navas s third appearance this tournament and the 24year old hasn t played since the first round victory over honduras before the game , torres didn t even warm up with the substitutes after trotting out with the team and lingering amid the other reserves , he slowly made his way to the players bench and waited there for the pregame ceremony kuyt has done so little tonight after having such a great tournament in comes young elia , who is fast and can make things happen a cross went right through heitinga to villa in front of the net , but his shot from point blank went too high ! did it hit stekelenburg or heitinga \? not sure , but oh , what a chance ! to reader steph a change kit is what north americans would call a road uniform that s what spain are wearing in this match van persie had just escaped a long , chaotic passage at midfield and was darting away when he was tripped robben was charging right up the middle , having beaten the offside trap , and shot as he hit the penalty dot but casillas just got a piece of it with his foot and redirected it wide by two feet close call ! sneijder sets up robben , who barges in on a breakaway , casillas charges out and just tips the ball away ! he got a piece of it with his foot and saves the goal ! great save from the spanish keeper ! most boring world cup final in decades offers reader ratburger , writing , he says , from antarctica , with appropriate hyperbole meanwhile at the stadium , the fans are whistling all the faffing about on the field as much of the planet has now learned through martin tyler , puyol wears his hair so long because he s a little bit self conscious about his ears he s upset because the dutch gave the ball back after that last foul by throwing it all the way down the field that earns his wrath now a free kick to the dutch after sneijder was fouled hard heitinga heads just wide , but he d already been whistled down for a foul he got it over the wall and curled it toward the top corner , but missed by a yard still stekelenburg was there down the other end , robben dipsydoodled past spaniards , would not pass to van persie , and wound up losing the ball exasperating ! now heitinga gets a talking to for a foul and a booking ! a new record for most bookings in a world cup final , seven it goes to van bronckhorst , who got tangled up with sergio ramos outside the dutch area that ties the mark for most yellows in a world cup final now the free kick five in the dutch wall ! they hold the ball and hold the ball and wait and wait , and eventually wear their opponents down can the dutch resist this more successfully than the germans did \? everyone says it all the time , but here it s true this game desperately needs something to ignite it here s jeffrey marcus from the stadium someone will be sent off in the second half someone should have been sent off in the first half nigel de jong went spikes first , chesthigh on xabi alonso in the 28th minute the dutch midfielder was shown a yellow card but referee howard webb would have been justified to show him straight red it took xabi a few minutes to get his wind back at this altitude after such a ribcrunching kick the caution for de jong was one of five handed out in the first half in addition to de jong , robin van persie has a one , for a sliding tackle in the 15th minute that clipped joan capdevila s ankles , as does mark van bommel for a slide tackle that got all andres iniesta s legs and none of the ball , in the 22nd minute carles puyol is carrying a yellow card , as is sergio ramos for spain most in danger , i think , will be de jong , van bommel and puyol , hardtackling defensive players who will have to be very careful not to put their team a man down in the second half there were a total of 20 fouls committed in the first half and persistent fouling could end one of the player s world cup final prematurely the netherlands leads the tournament with the most yellow cards , 15 , and is second in fouls conceded with 98 , one behind uruguay van bommel bowled over xabi alonso in the area , but no call ! hard to see webb giving a penalty in that situation tho with 57 percent possession , but only 1 shot on goal to the dutchmen s 3 now they have earned a corner and puyol went high to head it , and it went right through capdevila s legs at the side of the goal ! spain could have gone ahead there and by the way , it s iker casillas wearing green in goal if this match goes to penalties , he ll have the advantage , studies have shown an angry note is sounded by reader bakes , writing from the castle of my skin the complaints about the dutch being dirty have as much value as the insipid factoids being posted by lucy ferr , he writes would that you all give the griping a rest and just watch the game bakes , i think most of them like the factoids from lucy ferr , like the one about keepers who wear green having the greatest success at stopping penalties you cannot live without that kind of info which goalkeeper is wearing green in this match \? but we all know that most of drama at a world cup final starts in the second half anyway spain s best chances came in the first 10 minutes , like that sergio ramos header that needed stekelenburg s great save the dutch had a couple of chances late including that play where they kicked the ball back to casillas just to give it to him , and it almost bounced in over his head a lot of you are writing in to protest the hard play from the dutch certainly you have to say they re going with what got them here thank god that half is over fun fact to know and tell and ominous sign for spain no team since england in 1966 have won the world cup final in their change kit abc s martin tyler , employing a metaphor from the age of sail the dutch are trying to spike the spanish guns avast , mateys ! enough time for this free kick to yield something it s to the dutch from 4 yards away , headed into danger now robben shoots but casillas dives to push it aside ! that was just going inside the post ! anything to generate some kind of attack , evidently the yellow to de jong was the ninth to the netherlands at this tournament , a record for any world cup the five yellows at this final so far are just one shy of the alltime mark , set in the 1986 germanyargentina finalissima the kick went right to puyol , but heitinga was there when puyol scored the goal that beat the germans , off a corner , he was left unmarked because he waited for everyone to mix it up in the box first , then came in a couple of beats later but the dutch seem wise to that tactic xavi to take it s headed straight up but cleared by the dutch off the corner , the ball went to mathijsen at the edge of the box , but he completely fanned on the shot ! that would have been a dangerous chance , but he whiffed ! down at the other end , pedro takes on four dutch defenders and fires wide , despite david villa standing open to the right and waving futilely for the ball he ran past two men and set up a corner the dutch were giving the ball back to casillas after the spanish goalie had rolled it out of bounds for them for an injury break but the return pass almost bounced into the net over iker s head ! a corner resulted , but van persie restored a sense of graciousness by giving it directly to casillas had that first ball bounced into the net , what would the dutch have to have done to make it right \? give up a goal to spain directly from the kickoff \? and in so doing bowls over his barca teammate puyol casillas s knees were up around puyol s face \( sorry to sensitive readers we don t have a cedilla key for barca \) he s playing the role of nelson mandela watching the match and play has resumed spain slowly building up again , but the ball into the box is well cut off by the dutch , and again it has all come to nothing a high kick from de jong caught xabi alonso right in the chest ouch ! he goes down hard and still hasn t gotten up a welljustified yellow to de jong for that this game is nothing like the squeakyclean spaingermany semifinal , where it took 26 minutes for the first foul to be called but now here come spain to wake things up no , no , broken up by the dutch defense howard webb is like oprah winfrey you get a card ! you get a card ! you get a card ! he shoos complaining spanish players after van bommel , the midfield destroyer , cut down iniesta a yellow to van bommel and now a late tackle from sergio ramos , and he gets a yellow the fourth of the match already he has earned a corner for the dutch but it is cleared out for a throw in van bronckhorst s long throw in is likewise cleared from the spanish area but the point is this the netherlands have gotten back into this game that was supposed to be a cross , i think , but it went right to the spanish keeper whose tv presenter girlfriend , presumably , is standing behind the goal somewhere , distracting everyone he took down robben outside the area , and now the longhaired barca defender has been cautioned 30yard free kick to the dutch now a bit of a reckless challenge on capdevila , who s still down now a minute later perhaps a harsh card from ref webb , but there you are jeffrey marcus reports from jo burg minutes after fabio cannavaro , who four years ago won the world cup with italy , delivered the world cup trophy to the field here at soccer city to be handed over to the winner of tonight s match , spain or the netherlands , a fan ran onto the field and tried to snatch the trophy from its podium a man in a tshirt and jeans sprinted from the northeast corner of the field to midfield , putting on a red ski cap while he ran and taking what appeared to be a red bag out of his pocket as he approached the trophy he was within inches of the trophy when he was stiffarmed by a security guard four others pounced on the stunned man and dragged him off the field the trophy was carried in a specially constructed louis vuitton case cannavaro , however , was wearing dolce gabbana these are the things 90 , 000 fans are forced to witness while we wait for the teams to take the field they re lining up in the tunnel now david villa drew three defenders to him , set up xavi who skinned kuyt and came so close to goal before his shot was deflected over the bar ! and on the subsequent corner , david villa on the half volley hit the outside of the goal heavy pressure from tocatoca spain so far ! xavi into the box with a long pass , but just a little too far for david villa here s a germane fact spain are playing in blue , and the last two teams to play the final in blue , france \( 1998 \) and italy \( 2006 \) , both won how bout that \? ! they get a throwin deep in the spain zone , but give it up quickly then , though , busquets gave it away to kuyt right in front 20 yards away , but his quick shot bounced weakly to goalie casillas off the free kick sergio ramos headed right on , and goalie stekelenburg went to full stretch to palm it away ! close call for spain ! they almost went ahead right there ! after van bronckhorst stepped on sergio ramops s foot the dutch haven t put three passes together yet , while spain , as expected , are tikitaka ing them to distraction the dutch kick off , and this final is under way and 43 seconds later , the first foul of the match , sergeio busquets , tripped by van persie the beautiful dutch anthem is played , and the oranje players sing along and now the spanish marcha real , always performed without lyrics , now resounds the players from spain stand stoically , listening as the stately music plays and a big roar from the fans at soccer city ! the teams peel off to shake hands , and we re just about ready an almost unbearable sense of expectation now the dutch are in their traditional orange kits , shirts , shorts and socks the spanish in their navy blue shirts , navy blue shorts and navy blue socks the officials are wearing blue and on a little podium on the center line , the world cup itself and now for the last time , the teams walk out onto the field , hand in hand with children from south africa ! this is really gonna happen ! sepp blatter comes out to shake hands with the players , accompained by south african president zuma van bronckhorst introduces them to the dutch players , as casillas just did to the spanish players jeffrey marcus tells us about a strange offer re somebody s sister david villa of spain and wesley sneijder of the netherlands are competing for the world cup championship , the golden boot for the tournament s top scorer and a chance to marry luqman moolla s sister moolla , who was wearing a dutch jersey , and his nephew , muaad , sporting a spain top , unfurled a bed sheet in section 509 here at soccer city that read villa vs sneijder winner gets my sister the lady in question , 39yearold naeema of johannesburg , is single and unaware that her virtue is at stake besides , she s not all that interested in either the spanish forward or the dutch midfielder she d probably prefer david beckham or wayne rooney or one of the english guys , luqman said abc has just shown a clip of gio van bronckhorst , the veteran dutch defender , and that provides us with just the segue we need for this note from jeffrey marcus in jo burg win or lose , the world cup final will be giovanni van bronckhorst s last game the netherlands captain , 35 , announced three months before the tournament began that he would retire you hope that your last match will be the final , van bronckhorst said on the eve of his team s final encounter with spain if it happens great it s happening , in less than two hours , and van bronckhorst is approaching his last game with the same sort of resolve he s shown in each of his 105 appearances for the dutch since 1996 i played enough finals in my career to know what it is about , he said you don t play finals , you win finals that is our mindset , he added that s something the dutch have failed to do in two previous attempts , in 1974 against west german and 1978 against argentina the dutch team has made the finals twice before and now we re in the finals and again , van bronckhorst said it cold be the very first time that we win it and i think that could be motivation enough van bronckhorst , who played at barcelona from 2003 to 2007 is close with several members of the spanish team he ll face tonight , including xavi and carles puyol , his former teammates if you ve been playing together for such a long time , you have a close relationship , he said at the beginning of the tournament you ring each other , send each other text messages wishing each other luck it s strange to face each other in the final , he said but there really is only one team who can win and i really hope it is us no surprises here the dutch , playing in their 4231 , with that 2 being the holding midfielders , have van der wiel and de jong back from yellow card suspension 1stekelenburg 2van der wiel , 3heitinga , 4mathijsen , 5van

fur hat , top coat and gloves , nelson mandela rode a golf cart across the covered field at soccer city after a closing ceremony concert that featured south african dance troops , shakira performing her world cup anthem , waka waka the former south african president waved and smiled and exited mandela , who turns 92 next week , has kept a low profile since the tournament began one of his grandsons said that he was under pressure from fifa to appear at the final after that initial report , another of his grandsons said he would appear , but that he would then leave the calabash to go home and watch the game on tv this is the day the whole world stands still to watch the football in spain , where yesterday an estimated million people marched in barcelona in support of greater autonomy for catalonia , today all disputes will be suspended to see la furia roja and its large barca contingent try to win it all in the netherlands , where new realities have led to debate over how to continue to thrive as perhaps the world s most liberal society , that question which is mixed in with the one on whether dutch soccer s new pragmatism is worth the winning results will be put aside to watch the oranje try to win the big one at the third time of asking and everywhere else in the world , fighting will stop , business will stop , animals will speak in rhyming quatrains , you name it , all of that will happen , as it does every four years when the finalissima of the world cup is played what do i mean , at the third time of asking \? that could be your question if you re a relatively new fan , and if so , know ye that the dutch reached this match in 1974 and 1978 , losing to the host country both times \( first to west germany by 21 , then to argentina by 31 after extra time \) but what many fans , even avid ones , don t remember is that the dutch came literally within inches of winning the world cup in 78 it was 11 in stoppage time at the end of regulation when rob rensenbrink struck the goalpost with a shot a couple of inches to the right , and the netherlands would have been world champs that sequence starts at the 2 49 mark of this video right enough history here are some suggestions for further prematch reading dutch fans think wesley sneijder and his girlfriend are somewhat ridiculous , simon kuper in the guardian points out , sort of the becks and posh of dutch football here in the western hemisphere we call it toca toca , but in spain they call it tikitaka ie , the attack of a million precise touches and short passes and , as sid lowe of sports illustrated illustrates , no matter how successful spain is these days and how irritated xavi gets hearing about it , that s the kind of goal spaniards want to see the magisterial zonal marking blog tells us that one of the funny things about today s final is how much influence total football , c 1974 , has had on both teams , and our own jeffrey marcus looks at the specific influence wielded by that seminal dutchcatalan crosscultural figure , johan cruyff and finally , shakira , who will perform waka waka \( this time for africa \) before the match , reveals the procedure for entering south africa through airport customs i arrived at immigration , the colombian songstress tells fifacom , and i saw the immigration officers actually dancing and singing the waka waka that sounds remarkably like the procedure at jfk we ll be back with more as kickoff draws nearer , and jeffrey marcus will be posting updates from the stadium itself , so stay with us
xizhen , china after five months in a rundown ward at the hepu county psychiatric hospital , yang jiaqin no longer suffers terrifying still , his wife dares not mention children , not even their own , for fear of unleashing the demons that possessed him one day last spring on a warm , sunny afternoon in april , mr yang burst from his home in this rural village near the vietnamese border , carrying a kitchen cleaver he encountered three youngsters headed home from school on the dirt path outside he hacked two primary schoolers , badly wounding both , and slit a second grader s throat , leaving him dying on the ground then he moved on by the time police officers caught up and subdued him , he had slashed two more people to death the victims' families have focused their rage on the police three days earlier , mr yang had struck a neighbor in the head with an ax , but was not detained they are completely responsible for this , said wu huanglong , the second grader s father they did not protect us but mr yang s doctors see a bigger failing despite clear signs of , mr yang had received medical care for just one month in the previous five years if he had been given medication and treatment , his illness would not have developed , said chen guoqiang , the psychiatric hospital s chief doctor if he had been able to control his hallucinations , he would not have killed anyone it has been nearly 35 years since the end of the cultural revolution , when mental illness was declared a bourgeois selfdelusion and the sick were treated with readings from chairman mao psychiatric treatment has returned but remains a medical backwater , desperately short of financing , practitioners and esteem too often , the official response to mental illness is to look the other way the government authorities , already shaken by an attack the previous month in which eight schoolchildren were stabbed to death , threw a news blackout over the xizhen incident lest it inspire copycats or incite further outrage at least three of six men whose attacks near schoolyards this year left 21 people dead had earlier appeared deranged or suicidal , according to news reports but in the highestlevel statement on the killings , prime minister wen jiabao said only that needed to resolve social tensions underlying the attacks yan jun , director of the mental health division of the ministry of health , refused repeated requests for an interview the ministry said in a written statement that the government was continuously strengthening both its resources and professionals to provide mental health care it has far to go only 1 in 12 chinese needing psychiatric care ever sees a professional , according to a study last year in the lancet , a british medical journal china has no national mental health law , little insurance coverage for psychiatric care , almost no care in rural communities , too few inpatient beds , too few professionals and a weak government mental health bureaucracy , chinese experts in the field say the health ministry s own mental health bureau , established four years ago , consists of three people dr yan , the director , is a public health specialist , not a psychiatrist every few years , china s news media declare that a national mental health law is speeding toward adoption the first draft was written half a century ago asked how many revisions it has undergone , dr ma hong of the peking university institute of mental health said , countless most psychiatric are financially unviable , said yu xin , who directs the peking university institute of mental health one , in hubei province , opened a box factory in the 1990s to stay afloat the fee structure is so absurd , he said , that hospitals can charge patients more for computergenerated diagnoses based on filledout forms than for sessions with actual  the lancet study estimated that roughly 173 million chinese suffer from a mental disorder despite government efforts to expand insurance coverage , a senior health ministry official said last june that in recent years , only 45 , 000 people had been covered for free outpatient treatment and only 7 , 000 for free inpatient care because they were either dangerous to society or too impoverished to pay the dearth of care is most evident when it comes to individuals who commit violent crimes for example , after liu yalin killed and dismembered an elderly couple cutting firewood in a guangdong province forest , he was judged to be schizophrenic and released to his brother unable to afford treatment , the brother flew mr liu to the island province of hainan , in the south china sea , and abandoned him , a chinese nongovernment organization , shenzhen hengping , said in a recent report last year , mr liu killed and dismembered an 8yearold hainan girl the government does n't want to cough up the money to treat these people , so they just give them back to their families , said huang xuetao , a mental health lawyer and one of the authors of the report left to their own devices , some relatives resort to heartbreaking solutions in 2007 , he jiyue , a government psychiatrist , discovered a 46yearold man locked behind a metal door in a stinking room in a rural hebei province home the man was mentally ill , his aged parents told dr he they had locked him up after he attacked his uncle that was 28 years earlier the man , a high school graduate , could no longer speak i said to the parents how could you do this to somebody \? ' dr he recalled they replied , we had no choice in the past three years , chinese mental health workers have rescued 339 other people whose relatives were too poor , ignorant or ashamed to seek treatment some , shackled in outdoor sheds , were treated just like animals , said dr liu jin , of the peking university mental health institute chronic shortages of both doctors and facilities ensure that what care exists is limited china averages just one psychiatrist for every 83 , 000 people onetwelfth the ratio in the united states and most lack a university degree in any subject , much less mental health , dr ma said professional psychiatrists in china are like pandas , said zhang yalin , assistant director of the mental health research institute at central south university s medical school there are only a few thousand of us psychiatry s bottomofthebarrel image in the medical community deters students from joining the profession dai jun , a 24yearold medical student in wuhan , in central china , said he studied when he enrolled at nanjing medical university six years ago because it was the only specialty with an opening as an intern , he noticed that psychiatrists were not treated or rewarded like other doctors patients often give surgeons and other specialists hongbao envelopes of cash that can make up a third of a doctor s income in exchange for better treatment psychiatrists get neither hongbao nor respect people think , oh , you are constantly locked up with crazy people maybe you are going to go crazy yourself , or you are already crazy that is why you want to do this , ' mr dai said at his first opportunity , he switched to orthopedics although research is scanty , a recent health ministry survey suggests that the need for more specialists is growing fast the study found that the incidence of mental disorders had climbed more than 50 percent from 2003 to 2008 although some of the increase was because of greater awareness and reporting , dr ma argues that the incidence of stressrelated disorders like and anxiety has shot up chinese society is just changing too fast for people to adjust to it , she said the government recently pledged to invest more in mental health care , mostly by pouring billions of dollars into new and renovated psychiatric hospitals many psychiatric hospitals are more than half a century old and located by design far from cities china added 50 , 000 psychiatric hospital beds from 2003 to 2008 but it needs more tibet , a region nearly three times as big as california , lacks a single psychiatric institution , the peking university mental health institute says like much of rural china , xizhen , in southern guangxi , one of china s poorest provinces , is isolated from services here , several hundred villagers tend fields of towering green sugar cane and cassava plants , sinking wells for water and chopping wood for fuel untrained practitioners who call themselves doctors handle most medical needs the nearest hospital is an hour away by car yang jiaqin was a local health care worker although neither he nor his wife , wen zhaoying , had medical training beyond high school , the two dispensed care for years from a tiny clinic opposite xizhen s primary school five years ago , ms wen said , it became obvious that her husband was the one who needed treatment always excitable and easily frightened , she said , he became obsessed with the notion that people were after him one night that autumn , he fled his house during a raging storm relatives found him the next day pacing near a pond , covered with scratches , shaking violently , she said it was very scary , he told her people were chasing me all night relatives ferried mr yang to the hepu county psychiatric hospital , a sprawling , ramshackle collection of onestory buildings outside beihai , the closest city administrators say the hospital s five doctors serve a region of more than one million people there , ms wen said , a psychiatrist prescribed medication that helped calm her husband still , his episodes grew more severe in 2007 , she said , mr yang leaped from a thirdfloor window to escape imaginary pursuers , breaking his leg in 2008 , he fled shenzhen , where he had become a migrant worker , and called the police from a shanghai television tower , threatening suicide doctors at a shanghai psychiatric hospital diagnosed his condition as schizophrenia , administered antipsychotic drugs and , a month later , set him free family members say that was mr yang s last encounter with a mental health professional mr yang refused doctors' advice to return to his local psychiatric hospital , his wife said , so she went alone , shanghai prescription in hand without examining her husband , she said , a psychiatrist decided that he was not and changed his medication by last spring , mr yang , 40 , was afraid to leave his dim mudclay house all he did was stay home and cry , ms wen said last april 9 , the demons inside him took control that evening , mr yang smashed through the wooden door of his 63year old neighbor , wu wenguang , and struck him in the head with an ax at the hospital where doctors stitched his wound , mr wu said , the local police chief told him when crazy people hurt somebody , there is nothing we can do ms wen said the police found her husband at home that friday night but told her the matter was best settled privately none of this would have happened had they arrested him , she said in a statement , the police insisted that they had searched fruitlessly for mr yang , then told his wife he should turn himself in ms wen said she began arrangements that weekend to admit her husband to a hospital mr yang s 74yearold mother , pei renyuan , said her son warned that he would kill himself and take all of you with me mr yang s younger brother was assigned to watch him the following monday afternoon , wu junpei , a spirited 8yearold who loved to draw , sing and practice gymnastics , left school with friends , taking his usual shortcut past the yang house toward his home 10 minutes away mr yang jumped onto the path with a cleaver and slashed a first grader , who fled then he turned on junpei , slicing his arm and neck in quick succession wu zunwei , the boy s 14yearold cousin , was next i fell to my knees and begged him , please do n't hurt me , ' zunwei recalled mr yang slashed his shoulder he did n't say anything , zunwei said he was crying wu huanglong , 43 , raced over on his motorcycle to find his son lying , face up , on his bloodsoaked navy backpack when i saw his eyes were staring up at me , he said , i thought to myself this is it i am finished i have lost everything' running from house to house , mr yang killed a 70yearold woman who was making firecrackers , and a man who was watching a television drama on his sofa he slashed the man s wife and a girl drawing well water the police , who seemed so quick to dismiss mr yang s earlier attack , were suddenly energized junpei s 20yearold sister said riot police officers descended on the hospital that night , wrapped junpei s corpse in a sheet and drove off with it , ignoring her screams of protest the county government has yet to release the body , mr wu said villagers say that is probably because mr wu refuses to sign a declaration that no one is to blame for his son s death in exchange for about 19 , 000 in compensation dr chen , the psychiatric hospital s chief doctor , said mr yang s rampage occurred because he has never been under systematic care his family , he said , did not take his illness seriously enough but he also said that his own hospital sometimes released mental patients purely because families could not afford treatment the government has to invest more so that we can take care of all the patients who need treatment , regardless of whether or not the family can pay for it , he said dr chen and another hospital doctor say mr yang s condition has now stabilized their goal is to send him home but ms wen said she could neither care for him nor cover the cost of continued treatment if she does not pay , she said , hospital officials have warned that her husband will be released to her custody zhang xue , the hospital s president , denies that i have never heard of such a thing , she said the government takes this case very seriously and is devoting resources to it , she said autumn is still warm in xizhen farmers harvest peanuts in their undershirts schoolchildren shoot marbles outside after dinner , mr yang s aged parents like to leave their double wooden door open for air junpei s mother often shows up to burn incense on their doorsill , wailing in the gathering dark she and her husband say mr yang s family is pretending that he is mentally ill to protect him ms pei , mr yang s mother , said she could not face the woman s grief or her own shame as soon as she sees her , she shuts the doors
philadelphia pinning down defenseman these days for his grizzled perspective seems to be as difficult as checking him into the boards the 35yearold pronger , 6 feet 6 inches and 220 pounds , gets a kick out of dodging bigpicture questions after his team rallied from a threegamestonone series deficit and from a 30 score in game 7 against the boston bruins , pronger was asked last week to define the flyers' play in the with one adjective he smiled cagily relentless , he said , because the marketing department had picked that word after the , to take a 20 lead in the eastern conference finals , pronger was asked tuesday if he talked to the flyers much about the edmonton oilers team he helped take to the stanley cup finals in 2006 and the anaheim ducks team he won a cup with in 2007 no , to be honest with you , he said , smiling again the flyers have established their own identity and are on their own playoff ride , he said asked exactly what their identity was , pronger playfully danced around the question for a moment , then said the formula really was not that complicated you know , i think we 're at our best when we 're at our simplest , he said that s getting pucks in deep using our speed , crashing , banging , imposing our will on a team it might not be in the first period , it might not be in the second period but as we continue to bang and crash and grind , we 're going to wear down the other team and we 're going to create enough chances it might not work every single night , but as we continue to push each shift , each period , each game , it s going to have its effects , and we 're going to be able to get into our transition game although the flyers have received remarkable efforts from goaltenders brian boucher and michael leighton in the playoffs , pronger has been the primary member of his team at setting the tone mike richards , the topline center , is the flyers' captain , but the team is following the example set by the unflappable , immovable pronger and has not given up a goal in 165 minutes 50 seconds , a span that covers the last 45plus minutes of the 43 victory friday over boston the flyers have outscored their opponents in that span , 130 i think we 're kind of basically a defensiveminded team , with , obviously , offensive capabilities , but we take care of our own zone first and move up the ice , richards said pronger , in his 16th nhl season , remains a stalwart on the ice he played 28 11 tuesday against the , through 13 playoff games , he is averaging nearly 29 minutes of ice time he has four goals , eight assists and is a plus3 he seems to be the missing ingredient for the flyers they acquired him in a trade with anaheim last year giving up two players and three draft picks simon gagne , the flyers forward who has scored six goals in his last six games despite playing with two screws in his broken big right toe , was asked tuesday at a news conference why the flyers have scored four powerplay goals against the canadiens pronger , seated next to him on the podium , whispered to gagne , do n't tell them pronger had already answered a question about the power play his response keep it simple gagne said you know what , i think it s just about confidence , you know sometimes when you 're confident on the power play , you 're able to make plays a little bit more than usual that you 're not scared to do you just have to keep it simple , and we did tonight pronger interrupted gagne , smiled and said see , told you got to ask it again , huh \? you did n't believe me gagne laughed , then said just keep it simple you throw a puck at the net and good things will happen danny briere , the philadelphia forward with nine playoff goals , said , we still have more in the tank he believes the flyers will need extra fuel when the series moves to montreal for games thursday and saturday briere is looking forward to playing near his hometown , gatineau , quebec , and expects to hear it from montreal fans that would be different usually , pronger draws the wrath of fans on the road , probably because he is barging into the home team s players , knowing what he can get away with , or diving to block shots keeping it simple
pittsburgh nationally , it may seem that in the seven years since fred rogers s death , the legacy of america s favorite neighbor has waned after all , two years ago pbs stopped offering his show , mister rogers' neighborhood , to its member stations every weekday , offering it just once a week , though it allowed stations to digitally stockpile them for daily viewing then , last year , pbs quietly stopped allowing stockpiling , meaning there are no stations showing it daily kids today just do n't know him , said tom dvorak , director of broadcasting for wmvstv , a public television station in milwaukee that in january stopped running its stockpiled shows but here in pittsburgh , where he lived and worked most of his life , mr rogers s legacy seems assured , and not just because everyone over the age of 10 seems to have a story about meeting him images of him and his trademark cardigan sweaters seem to be everywhere , including displays at pittsburgh international airport , the pittsburgh children s museum and the senator john heinz history center , for starters in october , a 10foot , 3 million statue of mr rogers tying his sneakers was unveiled along the city s riverfront to great fanfare , even if it was criticized by some , including jimmy kimmel , the latenight talk show host , who thought it looked more like a mud monster in november , wqed , the local public television station here , decided to reinstall the neighborhood of makebelieve set at its studio where mr rogers filmed his show from 1968 to 2001 more than 5 , 000 people took the tour in the first two days and another statue , this time a wax figure also of mr rogers tying his sneakers will be unveiled at the history center on saturday on what would have been his 82nd birthday none of it seems overdone to pittsburgh residents he s one of our own , you know \? said sheryl strobl , 31 , who was visiting the mister rogers' neighborhood play area at the children s museum recently with her 3yearold son , t j because he s not on tv every day , it s hard for my son to associate him with that but when we come here , the first thing he wants to do is drive the neighborhood trolley he still knows who mr rogers is dave pastorkovich , 49 , a remedialreading specialist from pittsburgh who is an assistant basketball coach at carnegie mellon university here , is also a fan i think he s important because he worked here and played a large part in many people s childhoods , including my own , mr pastorkovich said i thought it was rather strange they stopped running the show there s still goodness for kids in there but building a legacy beyond his hometown could be an uphill trolley ride , said donna mitroff , a children s media consultant , educator and author who has worked more than 40 years in the field , including three years with mr rogers at wqed in the pantheon of children s television performers and creators , dr mitroff places mr rogers on a short list with figures like burr tillstrom , creator of the kukla , fran and ollie show in the 1950s , buffalo bob smith , the host of the howdy doody show in the 1950s , shari lewis , a puppeteer whose show featuring lamb chop replaced howdy doody in 1960 , and bob keeshan , whose captain kangaroo show ran from 1955 to 1984 none of them have any kind of formalized legacy , dr mitroff pointed out pbs , though , hopes that mr rogers will live on for children online last month , pbs began streaming fulllength episodes of mister rogers' neighborhood on both its rogers site and its pbskids site we think about fred every single day , said lesli rotenberg , senior vice president for children s media at pbs the pbskids site is based on a philosophy that i think he pioneered of looking at the whole child but it is another event that begins on mr rogers s birthday that may mean the most to his national and even international legacy as an advocate for responsible children s entertainment starting saturday at st vincent college in latrobe , pa , about 30 miles east of pittsburgh , the fred rogers center for early learning and children s media will host its first conference , called fred forward the last two days of the fourday conference will bring together more than 60 experts in children s media to explore creative curiosity , new media and learning mr rogers grew up in latrobe and , before he died , he began to create the center as a place for his archives the trove of scripts , handwritten music , letters and awards gives a detailed view of how he created the 895 episodes of mister rogers' neighborhood the 15 million center itself , which opened in 2006 , sponsors a fellows program to encourage research , the creation of new screen media and new educational materials that use mr rogers s approach it is also creating a learning network that will provide online tools for raising and educating children for teachers , families and caregivers fred rogers was a techie in the 1950s who realized how to use the new technology of his day , said maxwell king , a codirector of the rogers center our challenge here , and at this conference , is to find out how to use our new media for the benefit of children that will be his legacy this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos a bronze statue of mr rogers tying his shoes was unveiled in october at the old manchester bridge pier in pittsburgh \( photograph by jeff swensen for the new york times \) puppets from mr rogers' neighborhood at the fred rogers media center in latrobe , pa andrew masich checked a rogers shoe at the senator john heinz history center in pittsburgh \( photographs by martha rial for the new york times jeff swensen for the new york times \)
a belated , lengthy post on gay marriage follows below the fold in his response to my original column on this issue , andrew sullivan began with the common ground between us ross core argument is that lifelong heterosexual monogamy at its best can offer something distinctive and remarkable a microcosm of civilization , and an organic connection between human generations that makes it worthy of distinctive recognition and support i m going to repeat what i have said before i don t disagree with this at all i remain in awe of the heterosexual lifelong coupling that produces new human life there is a miraculous , sacred , aweinspiring aspect to it i understand why this is a sacrament , and have no interest in being included in such a sacrament since it is premised on the very thomist arguments ross puts forward but , as ross concedes , the question is whether this ideal should rest on its own laurels or needs to be elevated by law and doctrine to the highest level of human relationship , and also , in order to achieve this ideal , actively exclude others both in the religious and the secular sphere \? this is the core question , i agree but even to acknowledge the distinctiveness of heterosexual lifelong coupling that produces new human life is to make a concession that many gay marriage supporters are unwilling to make sullivan couches this acknowledgment in religious language \( miraculous , sacred \) in order to make the case for a distinction between secular law and religious doctrine but the reality he s acknowledging a lifelong intimacy shared between children and their biological parents isn t necessarily spiritual or religious rather , it s carnal , biological , emotional you can believe , with catholics and others , that god enters into this reality as well , but there s nothing inherently theological about the distinctive qualities that sullivan is acknowledging and once you ve acknowledged that lifelong heterosexual monogamy and its fruits are distinctive in some sense , i think that you only have to look around at the world as we know it to recognize that sullivan s question about whether that ideal can rest on its own laurels answers itself set aside the question of homosexuality , and just consider what s happened to straight life in communities where marriage is no longer elevated , in one sense or another where the incentives and prohibitions that reinforced the sexmarriagereproductionchildrearing nexus have weakened to the point of nonexistence , and where there aren t the potential rewards of the meritocratic ladder to make people intensely cautious and responsible about sex and relationships and childrearing what happens , for the most part , is that the ideal that sullivan claims to be in awe of gradually weakens , diminishes , and disappears absent institutional , cultural and legal support , heterosexual life seems to revert to a kind of serial monogamy , shading into de facto polygamy , in which there s plenty of coupling and plenty of kids , but the ideal of lifelong coupling that produces new human life gradually becomes the exception rather than the rule any ideal rests on exclusions that s how they re defined and upheld by saying that one thing is the ideal , and another thing is not it s true , as gay marriage supporters always note , that the western institution of marriage has always been inclusive of couples who are oriented toward the ideal without being capable of completely fulfilling it , because of age or infertility but when it comes to the wide variety of ways that human beings can form families , the institution has traditionally excluded far more arrangements than it s included being in love , having children , committing to fidelity and or mutual care all of these were components of the institution , but none of them were sufficient to claim participation in it you couldn t marry your sister or your father , obviously , or \( depending on the time and place \) your first cousin you couldn t participate in the institution with more than one person , even if you already had or intended to have children by both \( or all \) of your potential spouses you couldn t participate in the institution if you or your partner had been married once already and their first spouse was still living or at least not without great divorcerelated difficulty and stigma you couldn t participate if you were unwilling to vow sexual fidelity to your spouse \( obviously adultery took place , and men and women sometimes entered wedlock under false pretenses , but the formal intention to be faithful was a requirement to join the institution \) you couldn t participate as a single parent \( if you reared children without their mother or father present , what you were doing might be considered admirable , but it wasn t treated as an expression of the marital ideal \) and you couldn t participate with a member of the same sex we ve spent the last 45 decades removing certain of these exclusions , and weakening others some of the changes have been explicit now you can take a second wife , and a third , and beyond , so long as you inform a court that you no longer wish to be married to your prior spouse some of them have been implicit we do not use the term marriage to describe singleparent families , but neither do we draw anything remotely like the distinction that earlier generations drew between the nuclear family and unwed parenting and as sullivan notes , even in those private institutions where the older exclusions are formally upheld , there have been compromises the number of annulments granted by the catholic church in america reflects a de facto accommodation , even if the old standard is still officially in place these alreadyexisting changes form the core of the case for samesex marriage we have made so many exceptions already , sullivan argues , so many compromises and gestures of inclusion , that to refuse to make another one for homosexuals is either sectarian , bigoted , or both given the diversity of relationships and families that the institution of marriage now covers , he writes , to exclude gays and gays alone is therefore not the upholding of an ideal so much as making a lone exception to inclusion on the grounds of sexual orientation as i ve said , i respect the logic of this argument , and its power is one reason why the cause of samesex marriage continues to gain ground , and seems likely to eventually triumph but two rejoinders are in order the first is that not every exclusion has been leveled , nor every distinction done away with yes , within the institution we call marriage there are now \( as sullivan puts it \) amish families with dozens of kids and yuppie bicoastal childless couples on career paths there are open marriages and arranged marriages there is rick santorum and britney spears but the institution still discriminates based on kinship it still excludes families with more than two spouses , despite the existence within the united states of small communities where polygamy is the norm , and a far larger population of fathers who have relationships with multiple mothers and multiple children at the same time and the existence of open marriages notwithstanding , the prohibition on adultery has actually restrengthened since the brief fad for nostrings experimentation in the 1970s for most americans , the idea of a sexually nonexclusive marriage still remains a contradiction in terms so the institution still discriminates , even if it doesn t discriminate the way it used to and more importantly , the accommodating changes that sullivan cites the legal tolerance for spearsesque disposable marriages and larry kingstyle polygamy , the decline of the cultural disapproval that once surrounded singleparent families have arguably been disastrous for the ideal that he claims to honor and hold sacred to take the most visible example , 40 percent of children in this country are born out of wedlock , which means that there are now communities in the united states where almost nobody gets married , where almost every child is born to single or cohabitating parents , where most fathers have kids by multiple mothers and most kids have more halfsiblings than brother and sisters in much of poor and workingclass america , we may be watching the ideal of lifelong heterosexual monogamy die before our eyes this is the fruit of socioeconomic change as well as legal and cultural shifts , obviously but the trend has been hastened , rather than impeded , by exactly the kind of compromises and gestures of inclusion that are now cited as models for redefining marriage to include samesex couples gay marriage advocates who join sullivan in admiration for the lifelongheterosexualmonogamy ideal tend to argue that this particular redefinition is different in certain crucial respects from the changes we ve already lived through unlike , say , nofault divorce , it doesn t directly change the terms under which straight couples get married , and so it s unlikely to have any direct impact on how heterosexual marriages are approached and understood and inhabited \( this point is usually boiled down to the commonplace and intuitiveseeming argument that my gay marriage can t possibly affect your straight marriage \) and because marriage will have a conservative effect on gay life , they add , the overall cultural impact could actually be conservative as well maybe they re right at the very least , i don t see their proposed redefinition of marriage having the kind of effect on family life in america that the divorce revolution had in the 1960s and 1970s but i suspect that the who gets hurt \? argument reflects a somewhat naive view of the way that institutions and cultures really work as modest as gay wedlock s direct impact on heterosexual relationships may seem , its philosophical implications for the institution of marriage are still sweeping just as judge vaughn walker s ruling suggests , it explicitly separates marriage from any legal connection to the two realities gender difference and procreation that the institution originally evolved to address and it would be very surprising if a change of that magnitude in the way our society conceptualizes the institution doesn t end up affecting straights as well as gays the effects are most likely to show up at the margins , rather than being obvious and immediate and universal \( most of the straight couples who assume that gay wedlock won t affect their unions will be proven right \) but over the long term , even a marginal weakening of the alreadyweakened link between sex , marriage and childrearing would have real , enduring consequences and the philosophical shift may be even deeper than what s explicit in the walker decision consider sullivan s comments , in a later post , on the possibility that gay marriage might undermine norms of monogamy and fidelity as well i think it s fair to say that the fact that gay men are men makes monogamy less likely than even straight marriages if eliot spitzer had married another eliot spitzer , he may have had more sex on the downlow and spent a lot less money on hookers malemale marriages that survive are likelier to have some kind of informal level of permission and forgiveness and defensible hypocrisy on this score than most malefemale marriages or femalefemale marriages , especially if the men marry young i think the honesty within these relationships can actually be a good thing and can help sustain a lifelong commitment rather than weaken it but i can also see why it might worry ross if this became publicly celebrated rather than privately tolerated given the way in which the straight family as a whole is involved in such marriages , i believe private toleration will likely prevail over public celebration but the defensible hypocrisy of straight marriages may have an extra twist here i certainly hope he s proven right about the private toleration public toleration distinction but consider sullivan is writing that he hopes private toleration prevails over public celebration in a post that itself publicly celebrates the honest acceptance of some infidelity within gay unions as a good thing that can help sustain a lifelong commitment \( this is an issue , it s worth noting , that he s been circling around uneasily for years in the meditative conclusion to virtually normal , sullivan s first longform argument for gay marriage , he criticized attempts to educate homosexuals and lesbians into an uncritical acceptance of a stifling model of heterosexual normality , and suggested that there is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman then he hotly denied , in an afterword responding to his critics , that he d meant what the plain language said , and insisted that he believed that in samesex marriage , adultery should be as anathema as it is in heterosexual marriage but now he seems to have worked his way back to a somewhat more latitudinarian perspective \) and sullivan is a thinker , remember , who s deeply invested in making the conservative case for gay marriage , and who insists on his admiration for the traditional marital ideal it isn t hard to find partisans of gay marriage who have a much more explictly positive view of how gay couples might integrate extramarital sex into a revised institution of marriage what s more , sullivan s implication that many \( if not most ! \) straight marriages involve a defensible hypocrisy where infidelity is concerned and thus that the quiet acceptance of adultery in gay male unions would just represent an extra twist on how heterosexuals already approach the institution rests on an exaggerated view of how often and how guiltlessly straight married couples cheat among heterosexuals , he writes , actual real lifelong monogamy is relatively rare , especially if you take into account premarital sex this is true , but the if you take into account premarital sex is doing an awful lot of the work in that sentence as i noted above , when it comes to life within the institution of marriage , the wedlockequalsfidelity norm is still strongly entrenched in the 2000s , you could only get 21 percent of men who had been married at any point to admit to having an affair , and 14 percent of women and when you asked people who were currently married , the numbers fell to 16 percent and 10 percent yes , maybe people are just lying , and the real numbers are higher but there s clearly still an assumption in straight culture that violating the fidelity ideal is deeply shameful , and that adultery is a rupture and a sin rather than something that needs to be informally permitted in order to help sustain a lifelong commitment that kind of permission wouldn t just be extra twist on the inevitable hypocrisies associated with the institution of marriage it would be a move that effectively empties the institution of yet another quality that was once considered essential to its purpose nor am i comforted , on this front , by sullivan s suggestion that because lesbian couples may tend to be more monogamous than straight ones , any deemphasis on monogamy in male homosexual marriages will be canceled out by the example of lesbian fidelity if you change the legal and cultural understanding of marriage to accommodate relationships in which fidelity isn t actually being held up as the ideal , then you ve changed the legal and cultural understanding of marriage admitting a different , more monogamyoriented kind of relationship to the institution doesn t undo that change ideals stand or fall on whether they re enforced among the people most likely to breach them , rather than on the raw number of people who are naturally inclined to live up to them or so i tend to think but of course almost all of these assertions are unprovable the benefits of gay marriage , to the couples involved and to their families , are frontloaded and obvious , whereas any harm to the overall culture of marriage and childrearing in america will be diffuse and difficult to measure i suspect that the formal shift away from any legal association between marriage and fertility will eventually lead to further declines in the marriage rate and a further rise in the outofwedlock birth rate \( though not necessarily the divorce rate , because if few enough people are getting married to begin with , the resulting unions will presumably be somewhat more stable \) but these shifts will probably happen anyway , to some extent , because of what straights have already made of marriage or maybe the institution s long decline is already basically complete , and the formal recognition of gay unions may just ratify a new reality , rather than pushing us further toward a postmarital society either way , there won t come a moment when the conservative argument , with all its talk about institutional definitions and marginal effects and the mysteries of culture , will be able to claim vindication against those who read it \( as i know many of my readers do \) as a lastditch defense of bigotry but this is what conservatism is , in the end the belief that there s more to a flourishing society than just the claims of autonomous individuals , the conviction that existing prohibitions and taboos may have a purpose that escapes the liberal mind , the sense that cultural ideals can be as important to human affairs as constitutional rights marriage is the kind of institution that the conservative mind is supposed to treasure and defend complicated and mysterious legal and cultural political and prepolitical ancient and modern halfevolved and halfcreated and given its steady decline across the last few decades , it would be a poor conservatism that did not worry at the blithe confidence with which we re about to redefine it
