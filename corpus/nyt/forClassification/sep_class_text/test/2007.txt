alex rodriguez slapped his hands as he rounded first base yesterday afternoon and then nearly plowed into the thirdbase coach larry bowa as he rounded third before touching home plate , he heaved his batting helmet toward the sky , a smile on his face every step of the way rodriguez has been playing in the major leagues for 13 seasons but with one swing of the bat , he became a kid again it felt awesome , rodriguez said of his trip around the bases , which he earned after belting a gamewinning grand slam that capped an improbable 107 victory against the at yankee stadium i was so excited i felt foolish running around the bases like it was little league i just remember i almost knocked bowa over at third i saw the fans kind of rocking behind him it was kind of cool it was rare , too the have played 16 , 116 games in their 105year history , but they have ended only eight games with a grand slam yesterday s gameending grand slam , the third of rodriguez s career , may have been the most dramatic and it overshadowed a disappointing major league debut by kei igawa , the japanese lefthander whom the yankees signed in the offseason the yankees \( 22 \) trailed by a run with two out and the bases empty in the ninth inning , a situation similar to the one described in the ernest l thayer poem casey at the bat then robinson can singled up the middle against orioles closer chris ray , derek jeter walked and bobby abreu was hit by a pitch to bring up rodriguez like casey in the poem , rodriguez had two strikes against him but that was where the comparison ended ray offered a 95mileanhour fastball on a 12 count that rodriguez sent over the wall in rightcenter somehow , i knew it was going to come down to me , said rodriguez , who had three hits and six runs batted in , including a tworun homer in the first inning even with two outs and nobody on the fans roared their approval the yankees piled out of the dugout and mobbed rodriguez johnny damon attempted to lift him in the air , but , maybe thinking about his strained right calf , did not jeter urged rodriguez to make a curtain call , and he obliged rodriguez has had a rocky relationship with the fans during his threeplus seasons in the bronx just the other day , after he popped out with the bases loaded in the eighth inning of thursday s 76 loss to the tampa bay devil rays , the fans let him have it he probably puts more pressure on himself than he needs to , manager joe torre said everybody s sensitive to the fans the fans reserved their ire yesterday for igawa , who dug an early hole he lasted five innings , more than any yankees starter had pitched this season , but his pitching line was unsightly seven earned runs on eight hits , three walks , two strikeouts and two pitches that bounced before reaching the plate the yankees paid 26 million for the right to negotiate with igawa , who played eight seasons for the hanshin tigers of japan s central league they signed him to a fiveyear , 20 million contract on thursday , igawa s countryman , daisuke matsuzaka , made his debut for the boston red sox with a fine outing unlike matsuzaka , igawa is not expected to spearhead the rotation , but the yankees hope he proves to be a competent starter igawa mainly threw fastballs , and his offspeed pitches were wayward he made a fielding error in the second inning that allowed nick markakis to reach base we expect better and i'm sure he does , too , torre said igawa allowed a solo home run to markakis in the first inning and a threerun double to melvin mora in the third mora then hit a tworun homer in the fourth inning two outs after mora s homer , igawa walked aubrey huff , and the fans began to jeer loudly i 've been booed in japan , too , so i'm not worried , igawa said through an interpreter igawa is the third japanese player to play for the yankees , following hideki irabu and hideki matsui , who both had memorable yankee stadium debuts irabu earned his first victory here in 1997 , and matsui hit a grand slam in a victory in 2003 matsui has been a success with the yankees , but he left yesterday s game in the fourth inning with a strained left hamstring sustained while running to first base in the second inning torre said matsui might miss a few games , and he was not expected to play in today s series finale but irabu flamed out after three seasons the yankees are hoping that igawa , who arrived with much less acclaim than matsui or irabu , ultimately follows matsui s career trajectory i was disappointed , but this is a long season and there s good days and there s some bad days , said igawa , who watched rodriguez s homer from the dugout if he has not already , igawa may want to drop by rodriguez s locker to say thank you for bailing him out he may want thank jason giambi , too the yankees trailed , 73 , in the eighth inning when giambi hit a threerun homer against the righthanded reliever danys b ez to make it a onerun game orioles starter steve trachsel , a former met , had mostly kept the yankees in check until then the yankees used four relievers , and none of them allowed a run the victory went to mariano rivera , who pitched the ninth our bullpen came to the rescue , torre said and so did rodriguez in thayer s poem , casey strikes out to end the game , bringing no joy in mudville as rodriguez rounded the bases yesterday , there was joy on his face and on thousands of others , too
san juan , pr , aug 4 \( ap \) the federal authorities are searching for nine suspects amid an investigation of dozens of doctors accused of obtaining their licenses through fraud a federal grand jury indicted 91 people in the case wednesday , including a former director and a secretary of the medical licensing board a total of 88 people were accused of having obtained medical credentials by fraud the authorities say the doctors flunked their certification exams more than a dozen times in some cases and then had the results falsified members of the island s medical licensing board are accused of recycling old passing exams under the name of the failed candidates from 2001 to 2005 , according to the indictments among the nine still being sought , three were believed to be in puerto rico and five in philadelphia , florida and the dominican republic , said jose ruiz , an assistant united states attorney mr ruiz said the investigation could produce charges against more people the father of one of the suspects , gilberto rodr guez , himself a doctor , was jailed on a witness tampering charge , accused of threatening to kill anyone who cooperated with investigators a notice taped to the door of his medical practice in a san juan strip mall said he was away on vacation until monday a government official who serves as a patient advocate appealed for calm as rattled islanders checked their doctors' qualifications the accusations against these doctors have grave implications for the health and lives of the patients treated by these professionals , said the official , luz teresa amador patterns of repeated test scores suggest that the cheating began much earlier than first suspected , mr ruiz said it was a pretty blatant scheme , said mr ruiz , who added that investigators were trying to locate rosters from before 2001 we believe this has happened before some of the doctors gave board members gifts or cash payments of as much as 10 , 000 , but others had their scores changed free , according to the indictment about 60 percent of the defendants are puerto rican , and the vast majority received medical training overseas in countries including the dominican republic , mexico and cuba at least 75 were practicing medicine in puerto rico , the authorities said one of the doctors , arcelio torres , a plastic surgeon , previously boasted of treating the acne of denise qui ones before she was crowned miss puerto rico and then miss universe in 2001 mr ruiz said that the authorities would focus on gleaning information from the doctors already indicted and that more arrests were likely in a few weeks the defendants face charges including mail fraud and making false statements to medicare and , if convicted , face prison sentences of 5 to 20 years the caribbean territory s licensing board said states including florida , new york and texas recognize puerto rican medical licenses , but the local health department said none of the suspects were known to have practiced medicine in the mainland united states
so thoroughly has antonio vivaldi s music become the nearexclusive province of periodinstrument ensembles over the last two decades that it almost comes as a shock to see it turn up in a concert by an ensemble performing on modern implements that s perhaps less true of his four seasons , music too picturesque and exuberant for most violinists to resist its charms the latest to succumb is joshua bell , who came to carnegie hall on sunday afternoon as leader of the academy of st martin in the fields it is worth remembering that the academy was at the forefront of the baroque revival in the 1960s its 1969 recording of four seasons , with the violinist alan loveday , remains a reference version there were numerous young faces in the group this afternoon , but collectively it still has vivaldi in its blood the wild card was mr bell , who has not previously been associated with the baroque repertory mr bell stood at the center of the ensemble , crouching and lunging to provide cues his solo work was polished and secure , with beautifully shaded dynamics and an expressive flexibility that lent his playing character he dispatched torrid runs with breathtaking ease and provided an appealing sweetness to languid slow movements equally refined was the playing of the ensemble members , with the violinist harvey de souza , the cellist stephen orton and the harpsichordist john constable making especially vital contributions bucking current orthodoxy , mr bell and the academy players employed vibrato , tastefully and without exaggeration when they abstained in the adagio molto of the autumn concerto , the clean , white sound that resulted stood out all the more the second half was devoted to works by tchaikovsky , music closer to the heart of mr bell s repertory an achingly melancholy m ditation from souvenir d'un lieu cher was followed by a richtoned account of the serenade for strings , which mr bell led from the first violinist s chair there was nothing wayward about the performance the gracious music was allowed to speak for itself a clamorous ovation earned an encore a tasteful arrangement of tchaikovsky s song none but the lonely heart
harriet e miers , president bush s longtime confidante and onetime supreme court nominee , has resigned as white house counsel , officials said thursday tony snow , the white house spokesman , said that mr bush had accepted ms miers s resignation reluctantly and that she had tendered it after deciding she was ready for a change after six years in the job the white house said that a search for a successor was under way and that ms miers would remain at her post through this month ms miers s departure comes as the white house girds for possible confrontations with congressional democrats , who have promised oversight investigations into white house policies , including energy , the war in iraq and national security the white house counsel s office would be central in attempts to stave off subpoenas and requests for sensitive information even before the democratic victories in november , republicans close to the white house speculated that it would seek to beef up the counsel s office mr snow said ms miers s departure was not the beginning of another round of changes in the west wing for those who are speculating about any others within the white house proper , i am aware of none and expect none , mr snow said still , her announced resignation came with mr bush poised to name a new director of national intelligence , j michael mcconnell , a retired navy vice admiral and director of the national security agency from 1992 to 1996 , and move his current director , john d negroponte , to the state department as its second in command rumors of ms miers s departure date back to the white house shakeup last spring , when joshua b bolten became mr bush s chief of staff and undertook a review of all personnel mr bolten was said at the time to have raised the possibility of moving ms miers out of the counsel s office , though white house officials denied it mr snow said her decision to resign did come after a series of meetings with mr bolten she s been here for six years , mr snow said it s hard duty ms miers has worked with mr bush since his days as texas governor and has grown close to him and the first lady , laura bush ms miers started at the white house as staff secretary after the 2000 campaign and became a deputy chief of staff before moving to the white house counsel s office mr bush s decision to nominate her to the supreme court in 2005 provoked the ire of liberals and conservatives , who criticized her as a bush crony who did not have the legal intellectual credentials or r \? m \? he job required she withdrew her name from consideration but returned to mr bush s inner circle and remained one of his closest advisers in her resignation letter , ms miers said her own role in helping mr bush choose nominees for the federal bench was among the most rewarding of my experiences photo harriet miers has been a member of president bush s white house staff , in various jobs , for six years \( photo by doug mills the new york times \)
senator hillary rodham clinton weighed in on universal prek this week senator john mccain outlined his views on ethics in government next week , senator barack obama is expected to detail his proposals for expanding health coverage none of these moments will penetrate the consciousness of the public \( or the press corps \) like a major verbal gaffe captured on youtube , or make it into the latenight comedy monologues like former senator john edward s 400 haircut political professionals and the press rarely see the poetry or deeper meaning in a position paper mr obama himself seemed to suggest , earlier this year , that position papers were exactly what his party did not need we 've had a lot of plans , democrats what we 've had is a shortage of hope but there is a problem with this line of argument when one of these candidates becomes president , the person s campaign platform and issue positions tend to matter a lot despite the lack of engagement in the press and the public , several studies have shown that presidents actually try to deliver on their campaign agenda once in office , said tom patterson , a professor at harvard s kennedy school \( even in instances , he noted , when they probably should not \) in short , all those white papers , now beginning to roll out in iowa and new hampshire , can predict a presidency in the 2000 campaign , for example , george w bush often presented himself as a bipartisan dealmaker in the political center , but most of his domestic agenda was solidly conservative huge tax cuts overhauling medicare to create a prescription drug benefit by opening it up to private health plans creating private investment accounts in social security appointing strict constructionists to the supreme court in the mold of justices clarence thomas and antonin scalia to a striking extent , those actual proposals framed the domestic agenda of the last six years bill clinton campaigned on universal health care , ending welfare as we know it , adjusting to a globalized economy and a more activist but fiscally responsible government that agenda also shaped the first two years of his presidency \( even when parts of it went down in flames \) and still mattered after his party lost control of congress in 1994 the welfare overhaul ultimately passed two years later many candidate proposals , of course , get jettisoned along the way and events have a way , particularly in foreign policy , of shaking the most carefully laid positions , as the bush presidency so amply demonstrated and yes , some of a candidate s positions are simply boilerplate , carried over from one campaign to another but the very process of coming up with a position on energy independence or preventing unintended pregnancies or the growing trade deficit is useful to a man or woman who would be president and watching them do it is useful to the voters who must choose among them proposals advanced in the heat of a campaign are , in fact , deeply revealing an attempt to balance competing interests and philosophies , to adjust longstanding goals to political realities anyone paying attention in 1992 could see the outlines of the clinton approach to national health insurance the new mandates on employers , the reliance on government regulation and competition among health plans to keep costs down , the complexity that this approach inevitably entailed \( 1 , 342 pages worth , in the legislation finally submitted \) and anyone listening to mr bush on medicare in september 2000 , when he paid tribute to the signature program of the great society but then vowed to reinvent it , would not have been surprised by the extraordinary struggle to pass and then implement the program bruce reed , the president of the democratic leadership council and a longtime clinton aide , describes a candidate s policy proposals as the spinfree zone unlike his life story , his persona , his campaign message , the facts of an issue position are what they are health insurance for every american a 13 trillion tax cut winners and losers in every decision so why is there , so often , a dutiful , eatyourfiber quality to the issue debate \? campaigns often grumble that they cannot get the political press corps interested a story about strategy , tactics , the ups and downs of the horse race will always take precedence , they say but many political professionals also believe that voters ultimately make their decisions on the basis of a candidate s personality and character , not his or her plan to balance the budget so most of the energy of a campaign goes into the struggle to define character the candidate s , and the opponent s and yet , a candidate s stand on a particular policy offers its own insights into character and values , mr reed argues in all the talk about authenticity , the most authentic thing to do as a candidate is to say what you will do as president , especially at a time like this , he said
matt desalvo is wearing no 14 tonight in his major league debut for the yankees maybe they should have given him no 45 that is carl pavano s number , but there is almost no chance he ll be wearing it again anytime soon pavano is making his tour of major league doctor s offices now , seemingly searching for someone to tell him he really needs surgery on his troublesome right elbow pavano has seen dr james andrews in birminghan , ala he s also seen the team doctors for the yankees and the mets now , said general manager brian cashman , he is scheduled to see the los angeles angels team doctor , lewis yocum so far , none of the doctors has said that pavano needs reconstructive elbow surgery but it is well known within the clubhouse that pavano wants the procedure , whether or not the leading experts believe it is necessary i would have asked pavano , but when he saw me and mark feinsand of the daily news approaching him a few minutes after the clubhouse doors opened today , he got up from his chair and walked away , into the offlimits weight room when reporters came back to the clubhouse , after batting practice , pavano sat on a couch , chatting on a cellphone he hung up just as reporters were leaving pavano doesn t have to talk he has certainly had his share of bad press but this is getting comical again i m sure fans are tired of pavano and his nearly constant injuries so here s all you probably care about it seems as if everyone around yankee stadium would be surprised if he ever pitched here again interestingly , when i asked cashman if it was pavano who will make the decision on whether or not he ll have surgery , cashman said , no , without elaborating so unless yocum recommends surgery , maybe the yankees will just tell pavano to tough it out and try to pitch which means a lot of updates on playing catch , throwing from halfway up a mound , throwing batting practice , rehab games and , probably , a setback or two or 20
wearing the cutoff sweatshirt that became a wardrobe signature in happier times , coach spent seven minutes yesterday using the san diego chargers as a shield , warding off a barrage of questions about the illegal videotaping of jets coaches that will cost him 500 , 000 and the patriots 250 , 000 and , possibly , a firstround draft pick i know there is a lot of interest here on the situation and decision last night , but as i stated , it s over and we 're moving on , belichick said to begin his news conference in foxborough , mass all my energy and focus and attention is on the san diego chargers game sunday night that s where we 're at it was not where anyone else was at the debate over whether belichick got off easy was in full froth would belichick , perhaps chagrined at being caught in a scheme that blemished his and the patriots' reputation , soften his countenance to indicate contrition \? belichick , looking pained at having to endure another inquisition , assumed his usual monotone as he parried questions with a slightly different variation on the theme chargers moving on he was asked how he misinterpreted the rules about videotaping it does n't matter , he said it does n't matter we 're moving on he was asked about people saying the scandal would taint his record all my focus is on the san diego chargers i'm just working to get ready for that team he was even asked if he gets to pay the 500 , 000 fine the largest ever levied against a coach in installments i'm just thinking about the chargers for a few moments , belichick offered a wan smile , perhaps indicating a reluctant appreciation for the doggedness of the questioners finally , after belichick was asked about the importance of following the rules we 're going to continue to work hard to do that , he replied the patriots spokesman stacey james asked if there were any questions related to the chargers there were none and , with a thank you and a quick step that randy moss would be proud of , belichick was gone behind a door belichick did say that the video assistant matt estrella would not be on the sideline videotaping during tomorrow night s game against the chargers commissioner roger goodell told the patriots the league would be monitoring their videotaping from now on we will change our procedure on that , belichick said the patriots owner robert k kraft , who has been largely silent while the drama played out the last two days , said in a statement that the week had been extremely difficult goodell made a point of noting , when he announced his punishment thursday night , that kraft did not know what belichick was up to kraft is extremely concerned about the image his team projects and he said he was deeply disappointed that the embarrassing events of this past week may cause some people to see our team in a different light how this transgression will affect belichick s relationship with kraft remains to be seen his contract status is unknown but for now , kraft gave belichick , who has won three super bowls with the patriots , a vote of support i believe that coach belichick always tries to do what is best for the team and he is always accountable for his decisions , kraft said he has been a very important part of what our organization has accomplished over the last seven years in this case , one of his decisions has resulted in a severe penalty for our franchise he has paid a heavy price and so has our organization he has apologized for his actions i accept his apology and look forward to working with him as we move forward still , the conversation about whether goodell s punishment was severe enough continued yesterday wade wilson , the dallas assistant who was suspended five games for using human growth hormone , told that he believed a double standard was applied that allowed belichick to avoid suspension and remain on the sideline i do n't want to be seen as a crybaby or as someone questioning the commissioner s decision , but i see some major inconsistencies here , wilson said the giants owner john mara said most teams would think the penalty the patriots also will lose a firstround draft pick in 2008 if they make the playoffs , and second and thirdrounders if they do not was appropriate the loss of a no 1 draft pick is about as serious a penalty as you could impose , mara said you could survive your coach being suspended a couple of weeks but losing a no 1 pick is far more devastating indianapolis colts coach tony dungy is too polite to bash belichick , but he termed yesterday a sad day for the nfl it s another case of the 99 percent good things that are happening being overshadowed by 1 percent bad , dungy said i feel sorry for some really good people on the patriots that are going to be tarnished by this

tampa , fla from his first spring training as the ' manager , in 1996 , knew that the front office had decided that jeter , then a rookie , would be the yankees' starting shortstop torre anointed him as such to the news media then he read what jeter said derek answered the same question better than i did , because he said , i'm going to get an opportunity to become the shortstop , ' torre said and that little thing , it may have been a throwaway line for other people , but i thought you know what \? you 're right' in his mind , he had to earn the right to be the shortstop in mine , i was giving him the right to be the shortstop it s different that impressed me jeter was 21 years old then , but he quickly emerged as a leader on a veteran team that would win the world series seven years later , george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , named him captain much of what jeter learned about leading came from , who once encouraged a young jeter to jog not walk across the field of an empty stadium one night during spring training this year , the veterans had been removed from a game and were eager to leave legends field they were off the next day , the only day off for the team during camp but there was running to do , and jeter made them do it none of us wanted to go , and he s like , let s go , ' johnny damon said he makes sure we get our work in that s why he s him a crucial component of leadership , torre said , is that those being led cannot resent the leader on a team of veterans , the players tacitly accept jeter s status he is a link to the title teams of the late 1990s , he plays the game correctly and he does not betray their confidence he s very private about what he does , said jorge posada , adding that jeter never shares details of meetings that s not the way you lead but if offthefield communication in a group setting or one on one is vital , then there is one player who seems to confound jeter as the captain that , of course , is alex rodriguez , who in many ways is everything jeter is not their differences were evident during camp this year rodriguez reported to camp and immediately addressed his friendship with jeter , finally admitting it had cooled over the years telling the truth seemed cathartic to rodriguez jeter did not roll his eyes in response , but he might as well have he talked about the topic the next day , but not much , insisting it was a private issue that had nothing to do with baseball weeks later , both players made a trip to sarasota rodriguez left the tampa clubhouse first , trailed by a dozen reporters asking him about another flap over his contract , which offers the promise of more riches or a change of scenery because of an optout clause after the season after rodriguez had slipped into the parking lot , jeter strolled through the same corridor undisturbed he raised his eyebrows and smiled jeter also has a mammoth contract , but it includes no loopholes , and no one asks about it jeter and rodriguez exist with no open hostility and probably no hostility at all their relationship is scrutinized , and while neither player likes it , each understands the interest what bothers jeter is the theory that by not helping rodriguez through the regular booing he faced last season , he had failed in his role as captain it was unfair , jeter said of criticism of his captaincy i'm not going to please everybody with everything i do , and that s fine everybody s entitled to their opinion but it s a role i take very seriously , i do the best i can with it , and when people say that , i think that s unfair the author michael shapiro , who wrote extensively about pee wee reese s captaincy of the brooklyn dodgers in the 2003 book the last good season , said he believed a captain like reese would have found a way to help an uncomfortable teammate but by the same token , this is not duke snider , who was younger and deferential , shapiro said this is different alex rodriguez is jeter s peer and rival what jeter would have to be saying is , i am your superior officer here , and i'm going to make things easier for you' it s a tricky thing the pitching coach ron guidry was a captain of the yankees at the end of his career he said a captain must read the personality of each player , knowing when to cajole and when to coddle the team captain is a friendly shoulder , guidry said he s the guy you want to come talk to you , unless you go and talk to him first , who told sports illustrated last year that he had challenged rodriguez in the clubhouse during a slump , played down the idea that jeter needed to help rodriguez jeter and rodriguez get along fine , giambi said , and there is no controlling the fans in any case torre agreed the way i look at it , if derek felt that he needed to do something to make this team better , he would n't hesitate to do it , torre said so i do n't think he felt that he needed to do any more than he was doing at that point in time , least of all to tell the fans to lay off alex these are new york fans they 're about as knowledgeable as any sports fan , and they do n't want to be told what to do when you ask me how i think they 'll receive alex , well , they 'll cheer him because they 'll want to support him , but if he hits into a double play , they 'll boo him that s what happens , and it would n't have changed if derek had said , do n't boo him' they were n't going to listen to derek , because they 're still there to be entertained yet no yankee s voice carries as much weight with the fans as jeter s the news media report anything he says about rodriguez , and a strong call for support could , in theory , sway some fans asked if he believed he could influence fans , jeter , who will turn 33 in june , did not answer directly maybe yes , maybe no , he seemed to say the point was that it was not up to him it s not my job to change the way fans act , jeter said fans can do what they want to do i 've never heard somebody in any sport tell the fans how to act why would you even get caught up in that \? it s not your job to tell fans what to do , bottom line jeter uses that expression bottom line frequently it is fitting for a player who maximizes his talent by keeping things uncomplicated he almost never creates distractions for himself , deftly walking a fine line jeter probably conducts more interviews with reporters than any other yankee he pitches video games and gatorade , and he dates celebrities yet there is much about him that fans do not know , and that extends to his role in the clubhouse a lot of the things that derek does go unseen , giambi said he does talk to guys on the side , but he does n't make it a media thing in his new autobiography , the former yankee gary sheffield said jeter s biracial background helped him relate to everyone , and he praised him for his even temperament in meetings , sheffield wrote , he talks in positive terms maybe even clich s sheffield said mariano rivera was more likely to be blunt in meetings jeter said he felt responsible for answering questions about games and for representing the yankees in public he knows he has an image as a quiet leader who rarely speaks up , and it seems to amuse him there is much about his captain s role he leaves unsaid , and that is how he wants it i always find it interesting when people say , well , he s a leadbyexample guy , he does n't ever say anything , ' jeter said how do you know \? i do n't do things through the media , but that does n't mean i do n't say things or i'm not

paul krugman responds to readers comments on his feb 23 column ,  john berry , maplewood , nj your piece today about california s relative success with conserving energy is right on , but i think it points to the key problem without openly addressing it ultimately , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly enough to have an appreciable effect on climate change , energy prices have to rise quite a bit consumers and business owners have to change their buying patterns companies have to invest in conservation and new technologies in the us economy , these changes can t come from government decree they can only come from prices there s so much oil , gas and coal left to be extracted that the marketplace isn t likely to cause such price increases and i can t see any us politician proposing even a modest rise in , say , the gas tax much less a carbon tax he or she would lose his or her job in the next election indeed , i think everyone in washington still clamors for lower gas prices whenever the opportunity arises us voters take low energy prices and their gasguzzling cars and energyguzzling homes as a godgiven right many now tell pollsters that they are concerned about climate change , but they would revolt against any policy proposal that would make them pay significantly higher energy prices i m from california there d be fighting in the streets if gasoline climbed to , say , 5 per gallon which probably isn t even high enough paul krugman actually , there s a lot of evidence that government regulations can play a useful direct role people and businesses seem to be illinformed about conservation several studies suggest that regulations that push energyefficient appliances , building , etc actually end up leading people to savings they didn t realize were available on prices demand is a lot more responsive to prices than you think you don t need to stop people from driving all you need to do is encourage them to buy more fuelefficient cars carolyn brown , millbrook , ny what is needed in this country is a green party , a third party to be headed by al gore for president in 2008 and joined by all the green supporters from the other derelict parties now in power this would be not only a green party , but also an antiwar party , since war consumes masses of nongreen energy also doesn t biofuel consume more oil than the oil it purports to replace , along with destroying acres of farm land \? conservation is the way to go , along with solar energy paul krugman politically , you have to work with what s possible a third party isn t a political coalition is look , schwarzenegger is actually doing significant conservation , because that s the way the california political wind is blowing i wrote about ethanol a couple of weeks ago it s not good , but it s not that bad justin bullion , wellesley , mass i hear what you re saying , but california s environmental story has benefited from a lack of power plant production no baseload power plants were produced in a generation , and none are planned their gains are somewhat artificial they ll still be ahead of us northeasterners , but the difference will narrow without policy change paul krugman the numbers are consumption , not production everything takes into account energy imported from other states alan donaldson , idaho falls , idaho has california reduced its per capita energy consumption by driving out energyintensive industries \? most raw materialproducing processes are energyintensive electric furnaces for steel for example titanium , with which i am quite familiar , requires about 10 kwh per pound to produce a typical plant would produce 50 million pounds per year , and use 500 million kwh highpriced electricity will ensure california that such industries go elsewhere that type of greening is phony , since these critical materials are necessary for our society paul krugman the answer is basically no the really dramatic divergence between california and the rest has been in the area completely unaffected by industrial location residential electricity use , which has been flat in california since the 70s , while rising about 60 percent elsewhere herbert r haynes , china spring , tex but if every state required that much of its electric power be generated outofstate , as california does , where would we put our power plants \? canada \? mexico \? paul krugman as i responded to previous comments the big success has been in limiting electricity consumption that s a number that takes into account the outofstate electricity shipped into california robert taylor , chevy chase , md it would be helpful to point out that if the average californian is using 60 times as much electricity as the average american , and paying a price that is 50 times higher , the average californian would pay only 90 times as much for electricity the savings from using less electricity in this case more than offsets the higher price paid per kilowatthour that higher prices for something like electricity does not necessarily mean higher costs is an important point , and one not generally understood by the public paul krugman true paul kobulnicky , youngstown , ohio i am still bemused at why all 50 states , and all global economic powers , are not pushing as hard as possible to be in leadership roles as innovative energy conservers if you want to be the future s economic tiger , you have to show that you know how to do as much as possible with minimal energy consumption and minimal environmental impact why is everyone still standing on the sidelines \? talk about irrationality ! katharine butler , sarasota , fla a drastic change in the way we live \? how else could reversing the effects of global warming be achieved , and what s so wrong with that \? our lifestyle is obscene and i d rather deal with changes now than be forced into horrible circumstances later nathan blomgren , richmond , calif as a lifelong californian , i was interested in your article you mentioned early on that some people think global warming is inevitable , and there s nothing to be done you seem to imply that adopting a california lifestyle would change that obviously that s patently false on a global scale if everyone on the planet used the same amount of energy as the average californian , then we d run through our resources 100 times faster than we are now you might look to a vietnamese rice farmer with no electricity as a better example of how we must live if we want to stop climate change sure , every bit helps , but one simple fact remains humans will find and burn almost every last bit of coal , oil , and gas on this planet , and very little of the carbon dioxide will be captured that is inevitable i am yet to be convinced that prolonging this process by a few decades , or even generations , would help maybe it would hurt , like pulling a bandaid off slowly my only optimism lies in alternative energy sources becoming so affordable that some small part of the coal , oil and gas on earth will actually be left in place , deemed uneconomical to retrieve and even that is a pipe dream humans passed an irreversible point a long time ago as far as energy goes , and optimism like yours and al gore s is dangerous it s a bit like we ve driven off a cliff , headed for a hard landing , and you re fiddling with the radio i m not a pessimist in the slightest , but i am filled with guilt about what we ve inevitably done to future generations and the planet they will inhabit i encourage an influential person like yourself to continue championing energy efficiency , but the goal must be honest it will benefit local air and water quality in the nearterm climate change and rising sea levels are coming , and riding my bike to work is not going to keep my childhood home from being swallowed by san francisco bay within the next 100 years paul krugman as i said in the piece , california hasn t done nearly enough but what california shows is that significant conservation can happen with surprisingly little effort more effort would yield more dramatic results gilbert adams , washington , dc i don t consider myself a climate change skeptic , but i m not convinced of a number of things there is a middle ground the record seems fairly clear now that there is a certain amount of global warming going on , but i am not in a position to judge which experts are right and to what degree they are right moreover , i am aware of a number of instances in history when almost all the experts were on one side of a question and much later , it turned out that a single maverick who had been vilified and shunned by the scientific community was right and the community was wrong conceding that there is global warming going on , the next two questions are , how much \? and , to what extent is human activity contributing toward it \? you don t address this directly in the subject column i can readily accept that our overuse , and misuse , of energy has a measurable effect on warming , but the forces of nature are so vast that it almost seems presumptuous to think that what we do has a determining effect the earth goes through climatic cycles , i think , and whether we can disrupt or even significantly affect their amplitude or duration is a lot harder to determine , at least at my level , than whether there is global warming with polemic scientists disagreeing in the media , i find it hard to join a crusade and here we arrive at a basic distinction between a liberal and a conservative the liberal is ready to act for change unless he is convinced that the status quo is better , while the conservative wants to retain the status quo unless he is convinced that a change is necessary and or desirable what happens as long as neither side can be convinced either way \? do we go on as we are until the proof is obvious , and risk acting too late , or do we go allout , sacrificing many other programs , in a possibly futile effort to put the brakes on cosmic forces \? i m afraid that until such questions as those above are addressed , there will be little consensus or productive progress paul krugman i m tempted to be snarky , but i ll try to stay straight here s the outline of the climate change debate , as it has evolved it began with a prediction scientists realized that carbon dioxide emissions should , in principle , lead to global warming but the data weren t initially strong enough to declare definitively that warming was actually happening over time , the warming signature became ever clearer in the data now it s unmistakable all along , skeptics who found the policy implications of climate change , um , inconvenient found every excuse to attack the data , claiming that warming wasn t happening now they re saying that yes , it s happening but it s not clear whether humans are responsible all i can say is , give me a break this is a clearcut case of a prediction verified scientists didn t discover a warming trend , then try to pin the blame on fossil fuels they predicted a warming trend because of fossil fuel consumption , then had their prediction confirmed and there s a lot more than a crude correlation tremendous effort has gone into climate models , into checking whether the predictions of those models match what we re seeing , and so on to imagine that you can just do a dick cheney lean back in your chair and dismiss all of that is the height of arrogant irresponsibility paul krugman a data note tons of state level data on energy consumption , prices , and more at http www eia doe gov emeu states seds html  carbon dioxide emissions through 2001 at http cdiacornlgov trends emis mon stateemis emis statehtm
jupiter , fla , aug 27 s normally pinpoint control was not present monday night he threw far more balls against the class a palm beach cardinals than he had in any of his other rehabilitation efforts yet mart nez said that was a good thing i was able to throw all my pitches , he said after giving up one unearned run in six innings for the st lucie mets and throwing strikes on 52 of his 88 pitches i'm sure if i would have just thrown fastballs and curveballs , i would have thrown more strikes but the idea is to get command of all the pitches concerned about his cut fastball and changeup after his last start , mart nez said he significantly improved on each despite those positive steps , mets manager willie randolph said that mart nez would make another minor league start before joining the mets mart nez said i'm not going to go against anything they say if they feel they need me , i'm pretty sure they 'd take their chances with me in his previous three minor league starts , mart nez s one constant was his control he threw only 19 balls in 63 pitches in his first game , 13 in 60 pitches in his second , and 20 in 72 pitches last week perhaps mart nez s most impressive inning last night was the sixth , when he walked the leadoff hitter and then gave up a double after retiring the next batter on a groundout , mart nez was visited by st lucie manager frank cacciatore , who asked him to walk the next hitter to load the bases i said , no , this is the situation i want , to see if i can make pitches , ' mart nez said i want to test myself he struck out the next hitter and then induced an inningending flyout the mets did not appear concerned that none of mart nez s pitches have hit 90 miles an hour in any of his four minor league starts he reached 88 on three occasions monday night general manager omar minaya has said that mart nez got through a sizable portion of last season throwing only around 85 mph mart nez said when velocity is needed , i 'll click it if it does n't come , then i 'll try to get by with what i can do
las vegas , sept 30 as the public refocused on the offfield life of , kathleen mccarthy of maple springs , ny , thought it might be time to make some money off an autographed book about mr simpson that her father had found years ago yet more than a week has passed since mrs mccarthy posted the 33yearold paperback biography on with a minimum price of 150 , and nobody has bid on it she believed the timing was right to sell the book because mr simpson , the former football star , stands accused of bursting into a las vegas hotel room to reclaim what he said was memorabilia stolen from him i figured there must be a market for his stuff if they say he s stealing it , mrs mccarthy said but maybe not one of the most intriguing twists in mr simpson s most recent brush with the law is that the items the police say he went to retrieve are actually of little interest to most legitimate sports memorabilia collectors the 5 billion business is prone to devalue collectibles from athletes , including michael vick , barry bonds and mark mcgwire , whose public images have been scarred by scandal about 200 items related to mr simpson were available on ebay before his most recent arrest more than 400 were available as of late last week but the vast majority had attracted no bids mr simpson , 60 , has been charged with 10 felonies , including armed robbery , and one gross misdemeanor he is free on bail and due back in court in late october the police report states that mr simpson s group left with boxes and pillowcases stuffed with 100 , 000 in merchandise , but much of that value came from items unrelated to mr simpson , including signed lithographs of joe montana , the former san francisco 49ers quarterback , and baseballs signed by pete rose items related to mr simpson that were reported taken included eight autographed footballs , two plaques , a photo of him with j edgar hoover and three ties he said he wore during his 1995 criminal trial for the slayings of his former wife and her friend mr simpson was acquitted but found liable for the deaths in civil court in 1997 one of the things that experts like me have been baffled by , said thomas s o'connell , editor of sports collectors digest , is that , at least from what was reported to have been in that hotel room , i still have n't heard which items would have justified all the trouble o j is in now mr o'connell said the most impressive item listed was a ball from mr simpson s appearance in an allamerican game that might be worth 700 at least from a memorabilia standpoint , there s nothing that makes my heart spin , he said mr simpson was quoted in the police report as complaining that the two memorabilia dealers who accuse him of armed robbery had stolen his belongings in the first place if these guys were legit , mr simpson is reported to have told the police after the sept 13 episode , they would have got big bucks on the internet but mr simpson s star value has fallen considerably since his arrest on the charges he killed his former wife , nicole brown simpson , and ronald goldman , collectors say prior to o j s criminal issue , he was a player like joe montana , a fan favorite , well liked , said ross tannenbaum , owner of dreams inc , the parent company in fort lauderdale , fla , of a chain of about 30 field of dreams sports memorabilia shops in general , we do n't sell o j simpson stuff there really is n't much demand for it people do recognize him for his footballplaying abilities , but at the same time people are turned off by him other athletes whose items mr tannenbaum does not trade anymore include mr vick , the national football league quarterback who admitted this summer to financing a dogfighting operation , and mr bonds , who in august broke baseball s alltime home run record but under a cloud of suspicion that he had used performanceenhancing drugs that recordsetting ball recently sold at auction for 752 , 457 , far below the 27 million paid for mark mcgwire s 70th home run ball hit in 1998 to set the singleseason home run record mr mcgwire s fate is also reflective of changes in the market his memorabilia s value plummeted in 2005 after he appeared before a congressional subcommittee investigating steroid use in baseball but refused to answer questions about whether he had taken performanceenhancing drugs mr o'connell said the value of mr mcgwire s recordsetting home run ball had plummeted along with his popularity that ball is worth well below that under the circumstances now , said mr o'connell , who estimated it was worth 1 million at the time , it was an extraordinary baseball some scandaltarnished stars have retained their value the baseball great pete rose , despite being banned from hall of fame consideration for having bet on baseball while a manager , draws lines of fans who pay at least 40 for his autograph when he appears three days a week at the field of dreams shop on the las vegas strip and lance armstrong , the seventime tour de france winner , has remained popular despite steroid accusations lance armstrong got a pass because of the cancer thing , said joey sutton , owner of the new orleans celebrity memorabilia store vintage 429 , referring to mr armstrong s muchpublicized battle with testicular cancer he comes across as sort of a good guy he s also very charitable while most of what the police say was taken from the las vegas hotel room was related to the sports careers of mr simpson or other athletes , the three neckties that he is said to have worn during the 1995 trial fall into a category known as murderabilia , items made collectible by their association with a wellpublicized crime five states california , michigan , new jersey , texas and utah have passed laws intended to limit sales of such items , and a bill is pending in the senate to bar the use of the united states post office in the trade ebay has stopped trading in items related to ted bundy , john wayne gacy and other murderers , but private dealers have moved in online none of this would affect mr simpson because he was not convicted in the slayings awesome , said tod bohannon , 30 , a commerce , ga , math teacher and purveyor of the web site , when told of the ties if he really wore it in the trial , i 'd give 500 for one even if mr simpson s items do not necessarily sell , they can still be used to attract attention when the las vegas controversy erupted , mr sutton moved his sole simpson item into his front display window at vintage 429 a 1994 sports illustrated cover , signed by mr simpson , from shortly after his arrest with the headline , charge murder mr sutton has priced it at 3 , 475 but it has not sold interestingly , he says , items related to organized crime figures like al capone and bugsy siegel remain popular despite the oftengruesome crimes associated with them the gangsters , they are not perceived as losers , mr sutton said people glorify them if you take somebody like lindsay lohan , britney spears , paris hilton or o j simpson , their perceived value is very low because they 're perceived to be losers nobody wants to be associated with that

as violence declines in baghdad , the leading democratic presidential candidates are undertaking a new and challenging balancing act on acknowledging that success , trying to shift the focus to the lack of political progress there , and highlighting more domestic concerns like health care and the economy advisers to senators and say that the candidates have watched security conditions improve after the troop escalation in iraq and concluded that it would be folly not to acknowledge those gains at the same time , they are arguing that american casualties are still too high , that a quick withdrawal is the only way to end the war and that the socalled surge in additional troops has not paid off in political progress in iraq but the changing situation suggests for the first time that the politics of the war could shift in the general election next year , particularly if the gains continue while the democratic candidates are continuing to assail the war a popular position with many of the party s primary voters they run the risk that republicans will use those critiques to attack the party s nominee in the election as defeatist and lacking faith in the american military if security continues to improve , president bush could become less of a drag on his party , too , and republicans may have an easier time zeroing in on other issues , such as how the democrats have proposed raising taxes in difficult economic times the politics of iraq are going to change dramatically in the general election , assuming iraq continues to show some hopefulness , said michael e o'hanlon , a senior fellow at the brookings institution who is a supporter of mrs clinton s and a proponent of the military buildup if iraq looks at least partly salvageable , it will be important to explain as a candidate how you would salvage it how you would get our troops out and not lose the war the democrats need to be very careful with what they say and not hem themselves in at the same time , there is no assurance that the ebbing of violence is more than a respite or represents a real trend that could lead to lasting political stability or coax those who have fled the capital to return to their homes past military successes have faded with new rounds of car bombings and kidnappings , like the market bombing that killed at least eight on friday in baghdad neither mrs clinton , mr obama nor the other democratic candidates have backed away from their original opposition to the troop escalation , and they all still favor a quick withdrawal from iraq but mrs clinton , for one , has not said how quickly she would remove most combat forces from iraq or how many she would leave there as president former senator , by contrast , has emphasized that he would remove all combat troops from the country , while mr obama favors withdrawal at a rate of one to two brigades a month those plans stand in contrast to the latest american strategy of keeping most american combat brigades in iraq but giving them an expanded role in training and supporting iraqi forces the democratic candidates received a boost yesterday from a former american commander in iraq , lt gen ricardo s sanchez , who delivered the party s response to mr bush s radio address general sanchez said that despite the security gains , there was no evidence that iraq s leaders were working toward a peace accord he endorsed a democratic measure in the house to withdraw all combat troops by december 2008 lately , as the killing in baghdad and other areas has declined , the democratic candidates have been dwelling less on the results of the troop escalation than on the lack of new government accords in iraq a tonal shift from last summer and fall when american military commanders were preparing to testify before congress asking for more time to allow the surge to show results this is a delicate matter by saying the effects of the troop escalation have not led to a healthier political environment , the candidates are tacitly acknowledging that the additional troops have , in fact , made a difference on the ground a viewpoint many democratic voters might not embrace our troops are the best in the world if you increase their numbers they are going to make a difference , mrs clinton said in a statement after her aides were asked about her views on the ebbing violence in baghdad the fundamental point here is that the purpose of the surge was to create space for political reconciliation and that has not happened , and there is no indication that it is going to happen , or that the iraqis will meet the political benchmarks , she said we need to stop refereeing their civil war and start getting out of it while the war remains a top issue for many democratic voters , the candidates are also turning to pocketbook concerns with new intensity as the nominating contests approach in january mrs clinton devoted a week to her energy plans recently , and spent monday and tuesday talking about the economy mr obama , meanwhile , still draws strong applause from audiences when he criticizes congress for authorizing the war and mr bush for waging it , but he is increasingly highlighting other concerns we 've never seen gas above 3 in november , mr obama told a crowd on a recent evening in allison , iowa people are working harder for less folks are maxing out on their credit cards , trying to stay afloat people are struggling and it does n't seem like washington is listening mr obama s spokesman , bill burton , said that the reduction of violence in iraq was welcome news , but he also noted that a record number of troops had been killed this year and that political differences among the iraqis had not been bridged the best leverage we have to get iraq s political leaders to do their job is to immediately begin to withdraw our troops , mr burton said mr edwards told reporters in des moines on tuesday that there was not enough political movement to justify reassessing his iraq policy at this stage i think the underlying question has not changed in iraq , and that question is whether there has been any serious effort , serious movement on the political front , mr edwards said until there is political reconciliation between the sunni and the shia , there cannot be stability , there will not be an end to the violence so i think that s the ultimate test , and i have seen very little progress if any on that front mr edwards regularly brings up iraq , but his focus is less on the troop escalation and more on his opponents' judgment , especially mrs clinton s he frequently lumps her in with mr bush by noting her senate votes supporting both the iraq war and a recent resolution designating the iranian revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization we 've seen this movie before we know how it ends , mr edwards says about iraq and iran senator joseph r biden jr , a democratic candidate who has been praised by his rivals as a thoughtful voice on iraq , agreed in a statement that there had been real progress on security in iraq on the campaign trail , though , he frames discussions of the troop escalation around his plan to create strong regional governments in iraq , rather than talking about the declining violence as an end in itself two other democratic contenders , senator christopher j dodd of connecticut and representative dennis j kucinich of ohio , have also insisted that there is no military solution for iraq and that troops should be withdrawn swiftly one candidate favors withdrawing all troops immediately and unconditionally gov bill richardson of new mexico let s be clear 40 dead american troops is 40 too many , said tom reynolds , a spokesman for mr richardson measuring progress through

doha , qatar one thing that has always baffled me about the bush team s war effort in iraq and against al qaeda is this how could an administration that was so good at swiftboating its political opponents at home be so inept at swiftboating its geopolitical opponents abroad \? how could the bush team swiftboat john kerry and max cleland authentic vietnam war heroes , whom the white house turned into surrendering pacifists in the war on terror but never manage to swiftboat osama bin laden , a genocidal monster , who today is still regarded in many quarters as the vanguard of antiamerican resistance dive into a conversation about america in the arab world today , or even in europe and africa , and it wo n't take 30 seconds before the words abu ghraib and guant namo bay are thrown at you yes , both are shameful , but abu ghraib was a day at the beach compared to what al qaeda and its sunni jihadist supporters have been doing in iraq , yet none of their acts have become onepunch global insults like abu ghraib and guant namo consider what happened on aug 14 four jihadist suicidebombers blew themselves up in two iraqi villages , killing more than 500 kurdish civilians men , women and babies who belonged to a tiny preislamic sect known as the yazidis and what was the bush team s response to this outrage \? virtual silence after much googling , the best i could find was we 're looking at al qaeda as the prime suspect , ' said lt col christopher garver , a us military spokesman wow excuse me , but what exactly are we fighting for in iraq , or in this wider war against islamist extremism , if the murder of 500 civilians can be shrugged off \? even if we do n't know the exact perpetrators , we know who is inspiring this sort of genocide al qaeda and bin laden and we need to say that every day ask yourself this if osama bin laden were running against george bush for president , how would karl rove and karen hughes have handled the yazidi murders \? within an hour , they 'd have had a press release out saying this genocide of iraqi civilians was inspired by bin laden we accuse bin laden of the mass murder of 500 women and children bin laden has killed more iraqis and muslims than any person alive support bin laden and you support genocide against muslims and they would have repeated that point on every network , every day why should we care \? because bin laden and his sidekick ayman alzawahiri care ! read their statements they care about their image they do not want to be labeled as genocide perpetrators they want to be known as the resistance , because it affects their street appeal and therefore their ability to recruit and operate sure , some sunni tribes in iraq , who are directly threatened by al qaeda , have turned against it , but in the wider arabmuslim world bin laden has outmaneuvered mr bush the man who swiftboated john kerry and max cleland has been swiftboated by bin laden mr bush is losing a pr war to a mass murderer yes , it is not easy breaking through the innate , antiamerican tilt of the arab media , but we have barely tried i spent friday hanging around the newsroom of al jazeera here in doha , on the persian gulf i asked arab reporters here what would be the results of a popularity poll in the region between mr bush and bin laden mr bush would n't stand a chance , they said one big difference between them , though , added one journalist , is that bush s term is about to come to an end and bin laden is staying in office an egyptian analyst here added that liberals in the arab world who supported the us democratization effort in iraq are now dismissed in the arabic press as intellectual marines us marine is now a term of insult bin laden has created a situation in which the us occupation in iraq is viewed as entirely illegitimate and therefore any violence there by sunni jihadists against americans or iraqi civilians is considered entirely legitimate resistance as the economist magazine just noted , this is profoundly mistaken yes , military attacks against foreign soldiers who have come uninvited into your country can be called resistance but the mass murder of iraqi civilians can make no such dignified claim under all established norms and laws of war \( and by most accounts under islamic law , too \) , the deliberate targeting of civilians for no direct military purposes is just a crime so why do n't we say that \? if you ca n't win a pr war against bin laden , you have no business fighting a real war anymore in iraq
washington be honest who would you rather share a foxhole with a gay soldier or mitt romney \? a gay soldier , of course in a dicey situation like that , you need someone steadfast who knows who he is and what he believes , even if he s not allowed to say it out loud hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue , as the gloriously gay oscar wilde said and gays are the sacrifice that hypocritical republican candidates offer to placate values voters even though some candidates are not so finicky about morals regarding their own affairs and divorces they may coo over the photo of dick cheney , whose reelection campaign demonized gays , proudly smiling with his new grandson , the first baby of his lesbian daughter , mary but they 'll hold the line , by jiminy , against gay americans who are willing to die or be horribly disfigured in the cursed bush cheney war in iraq peter pace , whose job as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff became a casualty of iraq on friday , asserted in march that homosexual acts are immoral yet in may , he wrote a letter to the judge in the scooter libby case , pleading for leniency for the cheney aide scooter always looked for the right way to proceed both legally and morally , general pace wrote of the man who lied to a grand jury about the outing of a spy , after he pumped up the fake case for the war that has claimed the lives of 3 , 500 young men and women serving under the general at the gop debate in new hampshire last week , the contenders were more homophobic than the mobsters on the sopranos , unanimously supporting the inane do n't ask , do n't tell policy even rudy giuliani , who loves to crossdress and who stayed with old friends , a gay couple , to avoid gracie mansion when his second marriage was disintegrating , had an antediluvian answer wolf blitzer asked him about the arabic linguists trained by the government who have been ousted from the military after being outed mr giuliani , who procured three deferments to avoid vietnam , replied that , with the war in iraq raging , this is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this if he s so concerned with disruptive issues , maybe he should start worrying about this one two straight guys who slithered out of going to vietnam are devising a losing strategy in iraq year after year w and dick cheney have fouled things up so badly that robert gates and tony snow are now pointing to south korea where american troops have stayed for over half a century as a model mitt romney agreed with rudy on the issue instead of going to vietnam , mr romney spent two and a half years doing mormon missionary work in france is n't that like doing peace corps work in monte carlo \? at the memorial for mark bingham , the gay 6foot5 rugby player who was on flight 93 on 9 11 , john mccain said he might owe his life to the young man who helped fight the hijackers , bringing down the plane aiming to crash into the capitol but senator mccain wants gay troops to stay closeted the policy , he said , is working but it s not the army in iraq is like that exhausted nag scarlett o'hara whipped on to tara yet republicans surge on , even as they expel gays in a times friday , stephen benjamin , a gay arabic translator eager to go to iraq , told how he was dismissed when the navy learned his status consider , he wrote more than 58 arabic linguists have been kicked out since do n't ask , do n't tell' was instituted how much valuable intelligence could those men and women be providing today to troops in harm s way \? he noted that 11 , 000 other service members have been shoved out since 1993 and speculated that if the army had not been so short of arabic translators , the cables that went untranslated on sept 10 , 2001 , might have been translated , preventing 9 11 in 2000 , the british military began letting anyone who served say if they were a poof , as one squadron leader put it sarah lyall that the military reports that none of its fears about harassment , discord , blackmail , bullying or an erosion of unit cohesion or military effectiveness have come to pass america has been willandgraced since bill clinton had his kerfuffle on the issue in 1993 tolerance has blossomed , especially among younger americans according to a pew poll , 4in10 americans say they have close friends or relatives who are gay the republican field seems stale and out of sync they should have listened to the inimitable barry goldwater , who told it true you do n't have to be straight to shoot straight
pinot noir demands much of both vine grower and winemaker , wrote jancis robinson in the oxford companion to wine but as challenging as the grape may be , once it is in the bottle , it often becomes the most forgiving of wines pinot noirs are typically safe choices , especially in restaurants , when a party of four , for example , may order a diverse assortment of dishes and seek a wine to accompany them all there is no better red wine to drink with fish , especially meaty , rich varieties like salmon , arctic char , tuna and black cod \( also called sablefish \) of these kinds of fish , none is easier on the cook than black cod , whose high fat content makes it almost impervious to drying out from overcooking though i love salmon with pinot noir , it is more sensitive to time and temperature for those , like me , who prefer it cooked moist and somewhat underdone for this recipe i decided to use black cod , which is called black for its skin , like the noir skins of the grapes the wilted radicchio upon which i bedded the saut \? fish provides an earthy component that works beautifully with the flavors of the best of the pinot noirs from santa barbara county cooking subdues the bitterness of this member of the endive family , and brings out its sweetness a touch of fennel complements the hint of licorice i found in some of the wines the recipe is quick to prepare , but it can also be made in advance and kept warm for a good hour in a 175degree oven , a convenience for a dinner party it s best to undercook the fish slightly if you plan to hold it in the oven warm the vinaigrette and drizzle it on at the last minute , along with the scattering of parsley , just before the dish is served black cod on wilted radicchio time 45 minutes 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 mediumsize red onion , sliced 1 4 pound italian sweet sausage , casing removed , diced 1 large head radicchio , cored and shredded 1 teaspoon fennel seeds , crushed 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar 2 pounds black cod \( sablefish \) fillets , skinned , in 4 pieces salt and black pepper 1 tablespoon violet mustard from brive , or di jon mustard 1 tablespoon finely chopped flatleaf parsley leaves 1 preheat oven to 200 degrees heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet add onion , cook over low heat until wilted add sausage and cook , stirring , until it loses redness add radicchio and cook , stirring , until wilted , about 6 minutes stir in fennel seeds and 1 tablespoon vinegar season with salt and pepper 2 transfer to a baking dish large enough to hold fish in a single layer , cover with foil and place in oven 3 pat fish dry on paper towel and season with salt and pepper add 2 tablespoons oil to skillet increase heat to mediumhigh and cook fish , turning once , until very lightly browned and just cooked through , about 3 minutes on each side transfer fish to baking dish , cover again and return to oven 4 dissolve mustard in remaining vinegar stir in remaining oil pour mixture into skillet and cook briefly , stirring , until warmed 5 divide fish on radicchio among four plates , drizzle with vinaigrette , shower with parsley and serve or serve from baking dish , sauce and parsley added yield 4 servings
assistant sports editor jay schreiber is the driving force behind much of the new york times s baseball coverage schreiber , a sort of madgenius on the sports desk , spends the better part of his day working the phones and reporters to develop the themes , personalities and story lines you read in the times schreiber will contribute items each weekday on bats that draw on his knowledge and love of the game he ll talk about the ideas we kick around the newsroom as we make our plans for postseason baseball coverage you can read , listen and watch it here and send your comments , suggestions and questions below what s different this year \? there are eight teams in the playoffs this year you know how many of them are the same from this year to last year \? one the only team that s back , not surprising , is the yankees what s different about the yankees is that for the first time in 10 years , they ll be the wild card team , not the first place team even though the yankees are the wild card team , if you probably went around the country and asked 100 baseball writers , who is your pick to win the world series \? the majority would say the yankees think about it for a minute the yankees are the wild card team in the american league , but they re probably the favorite to win the world series which is another way of saying the al is stronger than the national league of the four al teams in the playoffs , none have less than 94 victories of the four nl teams to make the playoffs , none have more than 90 , and two have less than 90 is there any hope for the national league \? what is in the nl s favor , perhaps , is that the two hottest teams in baseball are in the national league the phillies and the rockies now these two teams play each other the rockies matt holliday , who had been touted as a strong mvp candidate in the national league , will now take that candidacy to philadelphia to play the phillies who have the only other guy in the running for mvp , jimmy rollins it s sort of fitting the two hottest teams will meet and the two most valuable players in the national league will meet one of those teams will make it to the nlcs , obviously , but whether being hot at the end of the season will carry either of those teams to the world series is very hard to gauge
it happened again this time before halloween as we reached the cashier s station at the party store the clerk , who must have been about 18 , took a long look at my daughters are they yours \? she asked yes , i said tersely , hoping my tone would dissuade further inquiry it didn t are they adopted \? she asked now i was ready to give her a blast , a lecture about manners and boundaries yes , they are but the young woman cut me off , interrupting with a perky , i m adopted , too ! oh um , never mind in the last year or so , i ve noticed that i have these kinds of conversations more and more people who once would have intruded with a boorish question seem to have been replaced by others who want to share their own abiding connection to adoption they were adopted themselves or they re in the process of adopting a waiting family or their grown son or daughter is on his or her way back from overseas , about to make them a grandparent in fact it seems to me dare i say it \? that adoption is becoming normal or least more normalized sure , it s taken 60some years but attitudes are changing and that s not my imagination ten years ago , 58 percent of americans had a family member or close friend who had adopted a child , were adopted themselves , or had placed a child for adoption , according to a national survey by the evan b donaldson adoption institute in new york by 2002 , that figure had risen to 63 percent it s surely higher now the same studies found that the percentage of americans who have seriously considered adopting a child rose from 36 percent to 39 percent a 3 percent increase that s statistically insignificant , but which the institute believes may mark the start of a permanent change in the way people think about how to build their families adoption is routinely in the news these days , and not just because brangelina and madonna have new children the coverage reflects the sheer number of people who are adopting , particularly from overseas , and the way in which each individual adoption radiates outward , from nuclear family to extended family to friends and coworkers in the last 15 years , nearly 62 , 000 children have arrived from china alone another 76 , 000 have come from russia and guatemala today more are coming from african nations like ethiopia most of those families couldn t hide their adoptions if they wanted to and they don t that s a big change from the 1950s and 1960s , when adoption was a secret so shameful it had to be kept even from the child when that clerk spoke up at the party store , my daughters paid no attention sure , jin yu , 7 , was busy admiring her high school musical cheerleader costume zhao gu , 4 , had her arms wrapped around her dorothy of oz dress , perhaps contemplating the most efficient means to dispose of unwanted witches but it was more than that both of them know adoption as a common word in their household and a routine fact of their lives four adopted children live on our street jin yu s best friend is adopted so is a boy in her firstgrade class and a teacher at her school none see it as extraordinary which is not to say things are perfect adoptive families magazine recently carried the story of a florida woman who was asked to prove that she was her daughter s mother before hospital personnel would treat the child it s impossible to conceive of a biological parent being asked to verify the same relationship and every adoptive parent i know has endured frustrations like my own the woman who approaches our group at a restaurant , demanding to know who among our girls are the real children the relative who laments that i never had children of my own , oblivious to the little girls beside me the strangers who feel free to ask why my wife and i adopted and how much it cost as if the doctors and nurses who deliver babies work for free i wonder how these folks would feel if i turned the tables , if i were to tap them on the shoulder while they and their child waited in line for a movie or a seat at a restaurant hey , was your daughter born by invitro \? she looks invitro to me am i right or am i right \? last summer we were on vacation in germany when jin yu tugged on my arm dad , she said , those boys keep pointing at me why are they pointing at me \? i knew why but i didn t want to say because i hated that the rudeness of strangers should compel me to explain to my daughter again that some people see our family as different so i didn t respond at first , and in that moment s pause jin yu answered her own question with the very words her father should have offered it s not polite to point , she said no , it s not it s encounters like that one that make me brace for wounding questions more and more to find that i needn t have worried not long ago , i was leading zhao gu along a beach at the jersey shore excuse me , a woman said from her seat on a towel , is your daughter from china \? yes , she is , i said and kept walking but in a moment the woman was on her feet , trying to catch up with me in the sand we re a waiting family ! she called oh why didn t you say so \?
for nearly five years , the diocese of bridgeport has been fighting to keep secret thousands of documents that detail how it handled 23 sexabuse cases settled in 2001 several newspapers , among them the times , have gone to court repeatedly to argue that the documents involved should be public last month judge jon alander of the superior court dismissed the diocese s latest attempt to keep the cases sealed the diocese announced it would appeal judge alander s ruling on 19 different grounds in a democracy , any person or institution can appeal almost anything , so this case may not be resolved for years but the diocese s sanctimonious statement in reply to judge alander s decision is so outrageous it should not go unanswered in that brief response , the diocese justified its campaign to keep the records closed on the basis of promoting the privacy and wellbeing of the it also said , reopening and exposing longsettled cases , extensively covered by the media , to renewed public scrutiny is not a productive way to achieve the healing and resolution that the community seeks yet the lawyer for the victims has told the court , as early as 2002 , that none of them not one objected to release of the more than 900 documents involved that the diocese would dare to use the welfare of the victims to justify keeping secret the crimes of the clergy against them is downright orwellian church officials have also taken pains to point out that releasing the records could threaten the right to a fair trial of defendants in two of the cases in which there is pending litigation but , as judge alander wrote , reasonable alternatives exist to adequately protect such rights short of keeping secret all 23 cases and more than 12 , 000 pages of information the diocese of bridgeport covers all of fairfield county , where 51 percent of the population more than 450 , 000 people is catholic the diocese is spending enormous amounts of time and money to keep from its own the shameful details of how it sheltered child molesters if there is any justice , the state supreme court should quickly dispense with this latest appeal the diocese should not be allowed to lock out the public indefinitely and common decency should have prevented the diocese from attempting to justify its actions in the name of caring for victims whom its clergy molested
jin yu is 7 now , and lately she s been telling me she wants to go and visit her nannies , the women who cared for her at the orphanage in china not so much for herself , she says , but for them because she is sure they must miss her and wonder how she s doing i promise we will try to go they are going to be so surprised ! she tells me i hope so but the turnover in chinese orphanages can be steep low pay and 24hour shifts are not strong inducements for tenure a friend recently sent photos from the orphanage in xiangtan , where my daughter spent her first two years , and i didn t see one nanny i recognized there s every chance that by the time jin yu returns , everyone who might remember her will be gone i wonder if my child is hoping to visit people as much as a time and place , to somehow grab hold of a life that fell away when she was a toddler if in wanting to visit her nannies , she is seeking to regain part of what she surrendered in coming to this country but i can t give my daughter china i can only give her chinatown every saturday morning , my wife and i take jin yu to lion dance class , watching as she and the other children practice their steps under the critical eye of their sifu the troupe s public performances dictate the schedule of our lives the way those of other families are organized around travel soccer on tuesday nights , jin yu and her little sister , zhao gu , attend a chinese culture class near our home , learning the mandarin words for vegetables and fruits , dancing with long blueandyellow ribbons , and helping to make dumplings and wontons is that enough \? or perhaps too much \? jin yu is old enough to be enchanted by china , although zhao gu , at 4 , is much more interested in leap pad than the great leap forward my daughters are two of the nearly 62 , 000 chinese children who have been adopted into new homes in this country during the last 15 years almost all are girls , abandoned by chinese parents barred from having extra children and pressured to raise sons for these kids , a new family comes at high cost their language , their food , the sights and smells of their homeland , the faces of their countrymen my wife and i try to mend that severed connection by making china an integral part of our lives , expressed in everything from the music we buy to the art we hang on the walls but culture is a tricky thing and in me , my daughters have a poor teacher i have no experience at being chinese certainly my parents never felt the need to drag me to fiddle lessons and clogdancing contests to show me i was irish they didn t send me to afterschool classes to learn about the great famine then again , they didn t have to for them , and through them for me , the past was close behind how my maternal grandfather dropped the mc from the start of his surname , because to be identified as irish was to go without work how my paternal grandfather trained horses in ireland and america how his wife tried to teach her children my father among them to speak gaelic how that language disappeared within a generation , and none mourned its passing , the ways of the old country no longer relevant or useful i worry i m succeeding only at forging my children s links to a vanished , historical china that knowing the starting and ending points of the great wall , the home city of the famous terra cotta warriors or the animals of the chinese zodiac will do little to help them thrive as asian girls living in 21st century america a chinese friend who visited from beijing thinks i m daft , lugging my girls to new year s banquets and dragonboat races they are not chinese they are american , she told me she meant american in more than address , american in a way that s obvious to anyone who is not from america it s the way they stand , how they carry themselves , the cut of their hair , the things they find funny or sad the irony is that in this country , my daughters are seen as wholly , fully chinese indeed it is chinese blood that runs in their veins like every father and mother , i know that later on , it will be all my fault as it has been the fault of parents through millennia so when that time comes , when jin yu is a teenager , full of the certainty of her years , which blame can i live with \? for having dragged her to national day parades and moon festivals \? or for not having done so , for having let the tie to her past slip away like the string of a windtossed kite \? at least i get to pick i hope someday my daughter will see that her mom and dad made an effort , however flawed and imperfect , to restore part of what was taken from her i hope if we do return to china that some of what jin yu learns in this country will help her make sense of that one that if we can visit the orphanage , she will feel at ease , even if she doesn t feel at home jin yu asks me if her nannies loved her , and i tell her i am sure that they did i ask what she plans to say to them i ll say , ni hao , she answers i still speak a little chinese

is not happy i have n't had to talk to him to know that i have n't had to talk to anyone who has talked to steinbrenner to know that be assured , though , that he is not happy his team is on the brink of elimination from the first round of the postseason for the third consecutive season and with the ahead , two games to none , the are in danger of being swept in a postseason series for the first time since the 1980 league championship series against kansas city the yankees played 28 postseason series between that one and this one a couple of weeks ago , the word at the yankee stadium offices was that steinbrenner would attend one or more division series games in the bronx if he had planned to be at tonight s game , he may want to reconsider watching his team expire prematurely before his eyes may be too much agony for the 77yearold steinbrenner to endure  everyone knows steinbrenner is a demanding owner who does n't take defeat easily but i have come up with a 10figure reason why he insists on his team winning , demands that it does the idea is n't new or revealing , but the number is in the 13 consecutive years that the yankees have played postseason games , 1995 through 2007 , they have spent just short of 16 billion on their payrolls 1 , 589 , 672 , 681 to be more precise this figure is not readily available , like batting averages and earned run averages but it was compiled from data obtained from various baseball offices it s a real number it s a mindboggling number the man spends between 1 billion and 2 billion , and he expects to get the return he wants you spend 50 , 000 a year for college tuition , you expect your child to get a degree all right , the yankees gave steinbrenner four world series championships in a fiveyear stretch , but what have they done for him lately \? right now they are down by two games to none to a team with a payroll not quite onethird of theirs a team from his hometown yet in 2001 , the yankees , with a 109 million payroll , lost the world series to the diamondbacks , a team that paid its players 80 million two years later , the marlins , a team with a significantly smaller payroll at 48 million , beat the yankees and their 150 million players in the world series the past three years , the yankees have n't even reached the world series , and now they are one loss away from making sure it does n't happen this year all four of the division series were 20 entering yesterday , with the yankees , the angels and the cubs heading home to play game 3 the phillies were on the road in three of the four series , the team with the lower payroll was ahead the indians \( 705 million \) over the yankees \( 216 million \) , the rockies \( 606 million \) in front of the phillies \( 1006 million \) , and the diamondbacks \( 698 million \) up on the cubs \( 1135 million \) with the rockies , ranked 26th among the 30 teams in payroll , the diamondbacks \( 23rd \) and the indians \( 22nd \) in these playoffs , major league baseball has its largest postseason representation ever of lowpayroll teams indians general manager mark shapiro , who should be the executive of the year for the impressive way he has made cleveland a division champion , put the economic difference between his team and the yankees in context friday they had a 20 million pinchhitter last night , he said , referring to jason giambi that s a third of our team giambi s salary is n't quite a third of the indians' payroll , but it s close enough who s going to quibble over a few million dollars \? putting the yankees' payroll expenditures in another perspective , the atlanta braves spent 917 million in winning an unparalleled 14 consecutive division championships salaries were lower in the first few years of the braves' run in the early 1990s , but the yankees' total nevertheless dwarfs theirs the yankees' 159 billion expenditure during the last 13 years is , not surprisingly , well ahead of the runnerup spenders , the red sox at 115 billion , the dodgers at 104 billion and the mets at 101 billion  as unhappy as steinbrenner likely is over not getting to or winning more world series , the yankees have at least made the postseason the past 13 years , giving them an annual return for their money of the three teams behind them in payroll spending during those 13 years , the red sox have reached the postseason seven times , the dodgers four times and the mets three times how do you think fred wilpon , the mets' principal owner , feels about the return on his money \? wilpon s spending philosophy is n't in steinbrenner s book , but because he feels the need to compete with the yankees in new york , for fans and prestige , he spends more than he would like to but a year like this one is especially painful for him the mets' 119 million payroll was the fourth highest this year , and the mets are n't playing this weekend of course , the yankees may not play after this weekend , and steinbrenner s pain will pierce his competitive and economic soul
twentyfive years ago today , glenn allison bowled three consecutive 300 games , the first to record the feat in a sanctioned league but nothing has been the same in the sport since allison s 36 strikes in a row were initially heralded , then , after a protracted legal fight , disallowed because of what officials cited as noncomplying conditions at la habra 300 bowl in california hightech balls and synthetic lanes have replaced the plastic and wood of allison s era higher scores and dwindling memberships are dividing purists and recreational bowlers over the sport s priorities even the oncesacred 900 series and the 300 game have become so common that bowling parties have upstaged latenight leagues in the last 10 years , 12 sanctioned 900 series have been bowled , including two by robert mushtare , an 18yearold from carthage , ny , who also rolled a third that was disallowed by the united states bowling congress but the most startling statistic is the number of 300 games 51 , 162 in 20045 and 56 , 212 in 20056 in 198182 , the total \( which did not include the few 300 games by women and children \) was 5 , 949 it s easy conditions that s kept my average up , not excessive talent , said allison , 77 , who was averaging 215 and 227 in two summer leagues he added , i'm truthfully a 190 average now even mushtare , who said he tried to bowl 10 games a day , found himself having to defend the three perfect series he rolled at the pine plains bowling center in fort drum , ny , from november 2005 to february 2006 they thought i cheated and was lying , he said during a telephone interview last week i can understand where it was coming from jealousy is a factor , too four other bowlers as far back as 1931 preceded allison with 900 scores , but none were in a sanctioned league or under tournament conditions allison said he was not upset that noncompliance with oil distribution on his lanes left him as an asterisk in bowling record books if allison rolled a 900 series in a league tonight , it would be approved without an inspection rule changes now allow for seasonlong certification of lanes , another accommodation that rankles traditionalists but as tennis and golf have had technical and tactical shifts in their sports with the introduction of new equipment , science has found bowling allison used one ball for every shot , but many league and pro bowlers now have three or four the new balls grip the lanes better , he said , creating a coefficient of friction that is much higher than years ago you can buy a hook with these new balls , and it s so much easier , allison said la habra 300 bowl is commemorating the anniversary of allison s achievement with a tournament this weekend allison , who has been working the desk there for the last seven years and is affectionately known as mr 900 , will join in the celebration it s an altogether different game , said mickey curley , who has worked at the lanes for 44 years and whose son dennis bowled with allison on the night of his perfect series fitting and drilling bowling balls now is a science roger dalkin , the chief executive of the united states bowling congress , said one of the difficulties we have as a governing body is trying to manage the technology and not eliminate it there s always a debate what s too much , what s too easy \? registered membership in the bowling congress fell to 27 million last year from close to 10 million in 1982 but according to simmons research , 70 million americans \( 37 million men , 33 million women \) bowl at least once a year , and many are prepared to spend 10 a game and more for the lively social activities at places like bowlmor lanes in manhattan the bowling congress has also initiated sport bowling , a division that tries to emulate pro tourtype conditions for more serious competitors begun three years ago , it has 40 , 000 members and has doubled in membership each of the last three years thirty years ago , 90 percent of bowling was leagues , mark miller , a bowling congress spokesman , said by telephone from las vegas , where the bowl expo , which ended friday , attracted 5 , 000 exhibitors , including bowling center proprietors and product manufacturers now , 60 percent of all bowling is recreational the game has changed , and you ca n't go backwards allison is adjusting with the times he uses a 14pound ball instead of a 15pounder mushtare , who prefers the 16 , said , if you can throw 16 , throw 16 allison , a member of the bowling hall of fame , recently moved into ninth place for career pinfall with more than 103 , 000 and has his sights set on the leader joe norris s 120 , 000plus total while teasing allison as the old man , curley praised his longevity he s the greatest , she said some things change in our sport , but the place would n't be the same without him
washington , jan 23 following is the opening statement by lieutenant general david h petraeus this morning before a senate armed services committee hearing on his nomination to be the commander of us forces in iraq , as recorded by federal news service gen petraeus mr chairman , senator mccain , members of the committee , thank you for the opportunity to appear before you i 'd like to begin this morning by briefly reviewing the situation in iraq , explaining the change in focus of the new strategy and discussing the way ahead this statement is a bit longer than usual , but as i discussed with you last week , mr chairman , i believe it is important that the committee hear it , and i appreciate the opportunity to present it the situation in iraq has deteriorated significantly since the bombing this past february of the alaskari mosque in samarra , the thirdholiest shi'a islamic shrine the increase in the level of violence since then , fueled by the insurgent and sectarian fighting that spiraled in the wake of the bombing , has made progress in iraq very difficult and created particularly challenging dynamics in the capital city of baghdad indeed , many iraqis in baghdad today confront lifeordeath , stayorleave decisions on a daily basis they take risks incalculable to us just to get to work , to educate their children and to feed their families in this environment , iraq s new government , its fourth in three and a half years , has found it difficult to gain traction though disappointing , this should not be a surprise we should recall that after the liberation of iraq in 2003 , every governmental institution in the country collapsed a society already traumatized by decades of saddam s brutal rule was thrown into complete turmoil , and the effects are still evident throughout the country and in iraqi society iraq and its new government have been challenged by insurgents , international terrorists , sectarian militias , regional meddling , violent criminals , governmental dysfunction and corruption iraq s security forces and new governmental institutions have struggled in this increasingly threatening environment , and the elections that gave us such hope actually intensified sectarian divisions in the population at the expense of the sense of iraqi identity in this exceedingly difficult situation , it has proven very hard for the new government to develop capacity and to address the issues that must be resolved to enable progress the escalation of violence in 2006 undermined the coalition strategy and raised the prospect of a failed iraqi state , an outcome that would be in no group s interest save that of certain extremist organizations and perhaps states in the region that wish iraq and the united states ill in truth , no one can predict the impact of a failed iraq on regional stability , the international economy , the global war on terror , america s standing in the world and the lives of the iraqi people in response to the deterioration of the situation in iraq , a new way ahead was developed and announced earlier this month with implementation of this approach , the mission of multinational force iraq will be modified , making security of the population , particularly in baghdad , and in partnership with iraqi forces , the focus of the military effort for a military commander , the term secure is a clearly defined doctrinal task , meaning to gain control of an area or terrain feature and to protect it from the enemy thus , the tasks will be clearcut , though difficult certainly upcoming operations will be carried out in full partnership with iraqi forces , with them in the lead whenever possible and with arm s length when that is not possible transition of iraqi forces and provinces to iraqi control will continue to feature prominently in the coalition plan , and as recommended by the iraqi \( sic \) study group , the adviser effort will be substantially reinforced the primacy of population security in the capital will mean a greater focus on that task , particularly in the most threatened neighborhoods this will , of course , require that our unit commanders and their iraqi counterparts develop a detailed appreciation of the areas in which they will operate , recognizing that they may face a combination of sunni insurgents , international terrorists , sectarian militias and violent criminals together with iraqi forces , a persistent presence in these neighborhoods will be essential different approaches will be required in different locations whatever the approach , though , the objective will be to achieve sufficient security to provide the space and time for the iraqi government to come to grips with the tough decisions its members must make to enable iraq to move forward in short , it is not just that there will be additional forces in baghdad , it is what they will do and how they will do it that is important some of the members of this committee have observed that there is no military solution to the problems of iraq they are correct ultimate success in iraq will be determined by actions in the iraqi political and economic arenas on such central issues as governance , the amount of power devolved to the provinces and possibly regions , the distribution of oil revenues , national reconciliation and resolution of sectarian differences , and so on success will also depend on improvements in the capacity of iraq s ministries , in the provision of basic services , in the establishment of the rule of law , and in economic development it is , however , exceedingly difficult for the iraqi government to come to grips with the toughest issues it must resolve while survival is the primary concern of so many in iraq s capital for this reason , military action to improve security , while not wholly sufficient to solve iraq s problems , is certainly necessary and that is why additional us and iraqi forces are moving to baghdad the way ahead is designed to be a comprehensive approach indeed , the objectives of helping iraqis increase the capacity of their governmental institutions , putting iraq s unemployed to work , and improving the lot and life of iraqi citizens requires additional resources , many of which will be iraqi in carrying out the nonkinetic elements of this strategy , however , our soldiers , sailors , airmen , marines , and civilians downrange must get all the help they can from all the agencies of our government there is a plan to increase that assistance , and it is hugely important this clearly is the time for the leaders of all our governmental departments to ask how their agencies can contribute to the endeavor in iraq , and to provide all the assistance that they can our military is making an enormous commitment in iraq we need the rest of the departments to do likewise , to help the iraqi government get the country and its citizens working , and to use iraq s substantial oil revenues for the benefit of all the iraqi people having described the general approach , i would like to offer a word on expectations it will take time for the additional forces to flow to iraq , time for them to gain an understanding of the areas in which they will operate , time to plan with and get to know their iraqi partners , time to set conditions for the successful conduct of security operations , and of course time to conduct those operations and they to build on what they achieve none of this will be rapid in fact , the way ahead will be neither quick nor easy , and there undoubtedly will be tough days we face a determined , adaptable , barbaric enemy he will try to wait us out in fact , any such endeavor is a test of wills , and there are no guarantees the only assurance i can give you is that if confirmed , i will provide multinational force iraq the best leadership and direction i can muster i will work to ensure unity of effort with the ambassador and our iraqi and coalition partners and i will provide my bosses and you with forthright , professional military advice with respect to the missions given to multinational force iraq and the situation on the ground in iraq in that regard , i would welcome opportunities to provide periodic updates to this body beyond that , i want to assure you that should i determine that the new strategy cannot succeed , i will provide such an assessment if confirmed , this assignment will be my fourth year or longer deployment since the summer of 2001 , three of those to iraq my family and i understand what our country has asked of its men and women in uniform , and of their families , since 9 11 in fact , i would like to take this opportunity to thank the american people for their wonderful support in recent years of our men and women in uniform tom brokaw observed to me one day in northern iraq that those who have served our nation since 9 11 comprise the new greatest generation i agree strongly with that observation , and i know the members of this committee do too over the past 15 months , i have been privileged to oversee the organizations that educate our army s leaders , draft our doctrine , capture lessons learned and help our units prepare for deployment this assignment has provided me a keen awareness of what we 've asked of our soldiers and of their families in view of that , i applaud the recent announcement to expand our country s ground forces our ongoing endeavors in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere are peopleintensive , and it is heartening to know that there will be more soldiers and marines to shoulder the load i recognize that deploying more forces to iraq runs counter to efforts to increase the time at home for our troops between deployments i share concerns about that however , if we are to carry out the multinational force iraq mission in accordance with the new strategy , the additional forces that have been directed to move to iraq will be essential , as will , again , greatly increased support by our government s other agencies , additional resources for reconstruction and economic initiatives , and a number of other actions critical to what must be a broad , comprehensive , multifaceted approach to the challenges in iraq many of the emails i 've received in recent weeks have had as their subject line congratulations i think i understand the message they are conveying i know how heavy a rucksack i will have to shoulder in iraq if confirmed i am willing to take on the position for which i have been nominated because i believe in servings one \( sic \) nation when asked i because i regard it as a distinct honor to be able to soldier again with those who are part of the brotherhood of the close fight and because i feel an obligation to help the shab eliraqi , the people of iraq , the vast majority of whom have the same desires of people the world over security for themselves and their loved ones , satisfaction of their basic needs and an opportunity to better their life in closing , the situation in iraq is dire the stakes are high there are no easy choices the way ahead will be very hard progress will require determination and difficult us and iraqi actions , especially the latter , as ultimately the outcome will be determined by the iraqis but hard is not hopeless , and if confirmed , i pledge to do my utmost to lead our wonderful men and women in uniform and those of our coalition partners in iraq as we endeavor to help the iraqis make the most of the opportunity our soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines have given to them thank you very much
to the editor re bush declares that free iraq' is within reach \( front page , aug 23 \) president bush said in a speech to the veterans of foreign wars that one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people , ' reeducation camps , ' and killing fields' one could argue that the legacy cited by mr bush was also the result of our escalation and involvement in that war , not just our withdrawal from it and our legacy in iraq will not come just from our eventual withdrawal , whenever that may be , but from the actions taken by mr bush s administration in the first place we already have a new set of painful vocabulary terms for this war like abu ghraib and ied it appears that mr bush has sheltered himself as much from the reality of this war as he did from vietnam in the past dan shea seattle , aug 23 , 2007  to the editor i have to wonder , why did president bush not apply the lesson of vietnam before entering iraq \? it is hypocritical to evoke this horrendous past mistake now there were many voices six years ago making the obvious comparison and warning that iraq would become a quagmire , but president bush rejected the comparison it does no good to evoke it now w steven ward honolulu , aug 23 , 2007  to the editor in declaring that a free iraq is within reach , the president once again urges us to stay the course , as a withdrawal now would have consequences similar to vietnam s i look at vietnam today and say it is reason enough to stop the madness and begin an immediate withdrawal from iraq obviously , we have learned different lessons from vietnam the president s declaration is not that much removed from secretary of state henry kissinger s peace is at hand remark , and we know how many more lives were lost needlessly after that statement mr president , we wo n't be fooled again michael ash springfield , mass , aug 23 , 2007  to the editor the vietnam comparison is appropriate but limiting the comparison to the potential pullout and its ramifications is disingenuous president bush can blame the united states' withdrawal for the southeast asian genocide that followed , but the more appropriate comparison , and one that many americans are making , is of the flawed policies that led us to these battles in the first place bill salzmann kingston , ny , aug 23 , 2007  to the editor how ironic and audacious it is that george w bush would make such a comparison is he suggesting that we should have stayed longer in vietnam , and that 58 , 000 american deaths and countless disabilities were not enough \? whatever the case , his deeply flawed thinking invites the question why did n't you step up and go \? vaughn a carney stowe , vt , aug 23 , 2007  to the editor president bush regularly revises history , using any analogy , no matter how contorted and inaccurate , to try to maintain support for his hopeless venture in iraq the critical question is how long we americans will accept this level of dishonesty from our president ken swensen pound ridge , ny , aug 23 , 2007  to the editor at last president bush is starting to acknowledge the comparisons between vietnam and iraq perhaps he will recall that after we left vietnam , none of the predicted dominoes fell and vietnam became a tourist destination welcoming americans ! eugene kutscher jamaica , queens , aug 23 , 2007
to kelby jasmon , there was only one answer the question if he received yet another concussion this football season , while playing offensive and defensive line for his high school in springfield , ill , would he tell a coach or trainer \? jasmon , with his batteringram , freshly buzzcut head and eyes that danced with impending glory , immediately answered no chance it s not dangerous to play with a concussion you 've got to sacrifice for the sake of the team the only way i come out is on a stretcher jasmon , a senior with three concussions on his r sum , looked at two teammates for support and unity they said the same thing with the same certainty they did not quite know what a concussion was , and would never tell their coaches if they believed they had sustained one matt selvaggio , who plays with jasmon on both lines , said our coaches would take us out in a second so why would we tell them \? many of the 12 million teenagers who play high school football are chanting similar war whoops as they strap on their helmets they either do not know what a concussion is or they simply do not care their code of silence , bred by football s gladiator culture , allows them to play on and sometimes be hurt much worse sometimes fatally the national football league has recently faced questions about its handling of concussions after four former players were found to have significant brain damage as early as their mid30s but teenagers are more susceptible to immediate harm from such injuries because , studies show , their brain tissue is less developed than adults' and more easily damaged high school players also typically receive less capable medical care , or none at all at least 50 high school or younger football players in more than 20 states since 1997 have been killed or have sustained serious head injuries on the field , according to research by the new york times experts say many of these accidents could have been prevented by simple awareness of and respect for their gravity poor management of high school players' concussions is n't just a football issue , said robert sallis , president of the american college of sports medicine it s a matter of public health interviews with players indicate that even those aware of the dangers of concussions ignore them coaches , trainers and parents can detect a gimpy knee or a separated shoulder , and act but a concussion is often the player s secret it is the one injury no one sees until a case like will benson s , which no one forgets  benson carried himself with a verticality that captivated teachers , classmates and coaches a handsome , straighta student headed for the ivy league , he was the star quarterback for st stephen s episcopal school in austin , tex he loved the idea of playing for his teammates and his brothers on that battlefield of the gridiron , recalled his good friend and classmate kashif sweet , now a senior at columbia he was a naturally tough kid with a high threshold for pain he liked to endure things , to conquer things , and have people follow him on a play during st stephen s first game of 2002 , as a pile of bodies grew too dense to see through , a crack was heard throughout the stadium the sound of helmet meeting helmet , two shells of polycarbonate alloy crashing together watching from the stands , judy ryser , benson s mother , heard the sound everyone did and turned to a friend next to her oh , my goodness , she said i hope that was n't will  in the stifling heat of july in alabama , hundreds of high school players from across the united states gathered at hoover high school outside birmingham , preparing to compete in a preseason tournament they ambled about the field in baggy polyester shorts , helmets dangling from their fingers give them each five years and 50 pounds , and it could be an nfl rookie camp some sat on the grandstand s metal benches , waiting for their games to begin they were asked about concussions garrick jones , a senior quarterback at whitehaven high school in memphis , said he sustained one last year he was briefly knocked unconscious when a linebacker picked him up and threw him to the ground on his head no flag was thrown he said he wobbled to the huddle , took the next snap and dropped back to pass before his vision blurred completely i could n't come out my team needed me , jones said you have to keep playing until you ca n't some players airily guessed at describing a concussion you feel dizzy and stuff when you 're crosseyed when you feel real sleepy it s like when you turn into someone else only a few of more than 50 players interviewed at the tournament came close to defining the injury a blow to the head that causes the brain to crash into the skull concussion the word derives from the latin concutere , meaning shake violently is typically followed by dizziness , headache , nausea , lethargy , impaired vision or other disruptions in brain function studies show that concussions are drastically underreported in high school football in part because many youngsters even adults still mistakenly think the injury requires the player to have been knocked unconscious athletic trainers report about 5 percent of high school players as having had a concussion each season , studies show , but formal widespread surveys of players strongly suggest the number is much higher anonymous questionnaires that ask specifically about concussions have reported rates among high school football players at about 15 percent each season when the word concussion is omitted and a description of symptoms is provided instead , close to 50 percent of players say they had one , with 35 percent reporting two or more although concussions remain one of the more imprecise diagnoses in sports medicine magnetic resonance imaging exams and cat scans cannot detect them the players' testimony has been taken by experts to indicate that a vast majority of concussions are not treated asked to define a concussion , josh bailey , a senior safety at patterson high in louisiana , could not after being told , he said he definitely had one last year , when his head slammed against another player s knee he said no one noticed , and he never considered leaving the game football , it s all about contact you kind of have to suck it up , bailey said because you 're going to feel pain that s what the game is about if you do n't put yourself through that , you do n't really love the game  the crack on the st stephen s field five years ago was indeed the sound of will benson s helmet slamming into another he played the rest of the game , which his team lost admitting to headaches several days later , benson sat out the next game and st stephen s lost again he felt a lot of responsibility , recalled jay lamy , a volunteer coach that season he did n't want to let his teammates down he knew the impact that he had that influence was felt the next friday night filling his no 7 uniform as only a star quarterback can , benson ran for a touchdown in the first quarter but later in the half , with seemingly no provocation , he took off his helmet and walked off the field benson told his coach he felt weird and had big blobs in his vision he sat on the bench and put a towel over his head then a golf cart took him to the trainer s room a few minutes later , benson was screaming in a way that no one present will ever forget mom ! he shrieked before he lost consciousness mom ! mom !  doctors call it secondimpact syndrome almost solely among teenagers , sustaining another blow to the head even a seemingly benign one before a first has healed can set off a devastating chain of metabolic events cerebral blood flow increases , arteries swell past capacity , and pressure builds inside the brain , often leading to and death helmets can do only so much to keep youngsters' brains from sloshing inside their skulls , like the yolk inside an egg a recent study in the american journal of sports medicine led by barry p boden of the orthopaedic center in rockville , md , found that catastrophic football head injuries were three times as prevalent among high school players as college players and that an unacceptably high percentage of high school players were playing with residual symptoms from a prior head injury for many victims , staying alive is only the first challenge kort breckenridge of tetonia , idaho , has trouble holding down a job because of shortterm memory problems stemming from a football brain injury two years ago brady beran of lincoln , neb , emerged from a coma reading at a kindergarten level he remains in with hopes of running again secondimpact syndrome is relatively rare , however experts said that for every such case there can be hundreds of victims of postconcussion syndrome , leaving youngsters depressed , irritable and unable to concentrate , and they sometimes miss school for weeks or perform poorly on tests ben mangan of lewisburg , ohio , still has mood swings and cognitive problems deriving from at least one major concussion in 2002 it definitely has held me back in progressing through school , said mangan , now 20 and attending a small ohio college i was a b student in math before , but now i sit there and i'm like , why ca n't i get this \? i 'll do the same problem five times and keep getting different answers it s really frustrating with no limp or wince to advertise most concussions , coaches and sideline medical staff must be keenly aware of their signs waiting for gross disorientation or nausea invites disaster diagnostic methods vary in science and scope , but most involve asking questions to gauge a player s awareness , testing shortterm memory by repeating strings of words and numbers backward and forward , and administering short pencilandpaper tests players are encouraged to be reexamined after physical exertion to see if headache or cognitive problems return many school districts require an ambulance and paramedics to be onsite in case of emergencies , but a sideline physician is often a luxury only 42 percent of high schools in the united states have access to a certified athletic trainer , according to the national athletic trainers' association budgets are tight , said bob colgate , the assistant director of the national federation of state high school associations you hate to say that , but it s a reality howells high school is among the 77 percent of nebraska schools without an athletic trainer the football coach , mike spiers , said that he cannot monitor the health of every player , many of whom he speaks with only a few times a game i have a tremendous fear of all injuries that could permanently damage a kid , spiers said it s something that may convince me not to do this anymore at midweek practices , which often feature even more banging and tackling than games , volunteer coaches with little training typically evaluate injuries while the head coach calls plays sallis , of the american college of sports medicine , joined many experts in saying he was not trying to discourage the playing of football , only the widespread acceptance of playing it unsafely it s crazy , he said high schools hire a zillion coaches before they wonder about hiring a trainer if you hire a head football coach , that next hire should be an athletic trainer  as will benson wailed , vomited , had a seizure and lost consciousness , the ambulance dispatched for him could not find the entrance to the st stephen s campus according to records released by the local emergency medical services unit , it spent 13 minutes trying to find the trainer s room a helicopter whisked benson to a hospital as the game continued coaches were confused he had not been involved in any notable hits or tackles in the game bleeding in his brain , benson slipped into a coma that night and never regained consciousness a neurosurgeon operated to relieve pressure inside the skull but could not revive him five days later , benson was declared brain dead he was kept alive overnight so his organs could be harvested for donation  there is no shortage of unenlightened coaches scott robertson , a volunteer team physician for nipomo high in southern california , said he had seen coaches at other schools berate and ostracize players who complained of concussion symptoms jerry bornstein , another team physician for several los angelesarea schools , said a coach once yelled at him for refusing to let a concussed player return to a game his response i 'll be happy to , coach , as long as you accept the responsibility for this kid waking up dead tomorrow morning ellen marmer , the team physician for rockville high school in vernon , conn , said that after she determined an offensive player from the opposing team was unfit to play after a concussion , his coach had him switch uniforms to try to play defense parents lose perspective as well garrick jones , a quarterback from memphis , said that the week after his concussion , his father pleaded with the coach to let him play \( the coach won \) vito perriello , the team doctor for st anne sbelfield school in charlottesville , va , said , i have had parents tear up the form that i 've filled out strongly recommending their child not play , and shop a doc to get their kid ok 'd yet many experts say that as poorly as adults can behave , it is the football bravado they instill in children , the thirst for competition and the blind eye to pain , that keeps players in the game more than a dozen high school players at the alabama tournament said they had hidden concussions from their coaches and medical personnel to stay on the field if the coach knew about it , he 'd take us out , said matt arent , a quarterback in nashville they treat us like we 're their own kids it comes down to the player not telling the coach that something s wrong players will hide from trainers and try to sneak back into huddles they will rehearse answers to impress the trainer , so they wo n't forget to use magic phrases like i do n't have any headache at all when asked one maneuver involves the preseason memory and cognitive tests many schools administer as a baseline for comparison should a player sustain a concussion several doctors and trainers said they have heard players boast of purposely doing poorly on the preseason tests so they will be more readily found fit to play a paradox has developed in high school football the more strict the rules , the more likely they are to be evaded by the players they aim to protect many doctors support a rule whereby any player sustaining a concussion cannot return to play that day but sallis supported a more realistic approach , in which a player may return to the game if doctors are convinced the symptoms have cleared if not , sallis said players are all going to stop telling the team physician that they have any symptoms they 're going to hide them which we know they already do , but i think it s going to get even worse it s putting them at more risk  dick benson spent five years trying to wring something positive out of his son will s death in june , will s bill , legislation he crusaded for , was signed into law it requires every texas high school coach and official involved in every sport to be trained in basic safety and emergency procedures beyond neck injuries and heart attacks , special attention will be afforded to the symptoms of concussion and roots of secondimpact syndrome benson said we 're not teaching people the principles of neurology this is fundamental , basic stuff the law does not apply to will s old high school , however it originally covered parochial and private schools , but the primary sponsor of the bill , state senator leticia van de putte , said it became entangled in a raging schoolvoucher argument the legislation had to be scaled back over politics , she said benson said that he hoped that the steps taken in his son s name would reach other states , but added that the process would be slow at best it usually takes something like will to get people to take this kind of thing seriously , he said people like learning things the hard way particularly adolescents playing linebacker two years ago , riley haynes of ponte vedra beach , fla , tackled a running back with such force that he found himself on the ground , all but unconscious , not remembering his name his head throbbed , and he had no idea where he was a teammate reminded him he jumped on top of haynes and screamed through his face mask that s football , baby ! that s football , baby ! haynes gathered himself , stumbled back to his position and took his stance for the next snap
rio de janeiro , oct 2 a brazilian military investigation into the causes of a fatal air crash above the amazon rain forest last year has found that five officers who worked as air traffic controllers were among those responsible for the crash , the brazilian newspaper folha de s o paulo reported today brazil s air traffic control system is run by the armed forces , and the internal military investigation said there was sufficient evidence to indict the five in a military court they could face suspension , prison or discharge but a military judge rejected those findings today , calling them inept and saying the investigation did not specify which military norms had been violated an air force spokesman refused to comment on the investigation or the judge s decision but confirmed that an investigation was continuing the fatal accident occurred on sept 29 last year when a legacy private jet clipped the wing of a gol boeing 737800 and sent it spiraling to the ground in the middle of the amazon all 154 people on board died the legacy survived the accident but was forced to land at a nearby airstrip with a damaged wing none of the seven people aboard were hurt the legacy was piloted by joseph lepore and jan paladino , two american pilots who were delivering the embraerbuilt plane to excelaire , a charter company based in ronkonkoma , ny a federal judge in june ordered the two americans and four air traffic controllers to stand trial on charges of exposing an aircraft to danger , but no trial proceedings have begun a lawyer for the two american pilots , meanwhile , said today the leaked military report confirmed he pilots' version of events i have n't read the report , only the folha article , said the lawyer , joel weiss but i think to the extent that it outlines crucial mistakes and mishaps on the part of the air traffic controllers it is accurate both planes were flying at the same height in the same air lane and controllers claimed they did not receive a signal from the legacy s transponder , the device that indicates a plane s speed and altitude the legacy was flying at a different altitude from that logged in its flight plan , but the pilots said they were given permission to fly at that height by air traffic controllers the military inquiry also suggested that controllers were unable to communicate with the pilots because they had not told them to change radio frequencies when entering a new air space zone the leaked military investigation criticized mr lepore and mr paladino , accusing them of negligent conduct , according to the folha story but its main targets were the military s own officers the 77page report used words like carelessness , complacency , lack of diligence and excessive delay in describing the actions of the five , the paper said four of the five men identified were air traffic controllers who worked in bras lia and had already been summoned by the federal judge they were named as sgts felipe santos dos reis , jomarcelo fernandes dos santos , lucivando tib rcio de alencar and leandro jos dos santos barros a fifth man , jo o batista da silva , worked in s o jos dos campos , the city where the legacy took off on its maiden flight before heading north to bras lia
natanz , , april 9 iran said monday that it was now capable of industrialscale uranium enrichment , a development that would defy two resolutions passed to press the country to suspend its enrichment program the announcement was greeted with skepticism by western diplomats and nuclear experts , who said the declaration seemed to have more to do with political showmanship than technical progress while reporters were invited to the country s main nuclear complex at natanz , they were not shown any evidence that enrichment of uranium , the step needed to make reactor fuel or bomb fuel , was under way in a speech on monday , president warned that if the west did not end its pressure against iran to halt the production of uranium , iran would review its policy of cooperation with the , the united nations nuclear monitoring entity it was unclear whether that was a threat to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , as north korea did four years ago , but mr ahmadinejad said the west should know that the iranian nation will defend its rights and that this path is irreversible with great pride , i announce as of today our dear country is among the countries of the world that produces nuclear fuel on an industrial scale , mr ahmadinejad told government officials , diplomats , and foreign and local journalists at the natanz site this nuclear fuel is definitely for the development of iran and expansion of peace in the world the government had decreed april 9 a national nuclear technology day monday was the first anniversary of mr ahmadinejad s announcement that iran had produced enriched uranium at a pilot plant the spokesman for the national security council , gordon johndroe , told reporters traveling with president bush that the administration was very concerned about iran s declaration , adding , iran s decision to limit even further its cooperation with the iaea is unacceptable but the administration has carefully avoided making specific threats about how it might respond , other than to press for tightening sanctions through the united nations security council the council unanimously passed a resolution on march 24 to expand sanctions on iran in an effort to curb its nuclear program the resolution barred all arms exports and froze some of the financial assets of 28 iranians linked to the country s military and nuclear programs the united states and some european governments have accused iran of having a clandestine weapons program , but iran contends that its program is peaceful , for energy purposes , and that it wants to produce fuel for its reactors talks between ali larijani , iran s chief nuclear negotiator , and javier solana , the european union s foreign policy chief , resumed last week after iran released 15 british sailors and marines who , iranian officials contended , had strayed into iranian waters mr solana negotiates on behalf of the permanent members of the security council russia , china , britain , france and the united states plus germany iran s sprawling facility in the desert at natanz has a small pilot plant where for more than a year engineers have periodically shot uranium gas into scores of spinning centrifuges in an experimental effort to master enrichment , a complex kind of purification process uranium enriched to low levels can fuel reactors if enriched to high levels , it can fuel nuclear weapons introducing uranium gas into centrifuges at the pilot plant would be nothing new injecting it into the larger facility under construction at the site , the one intended for industrial production , would be a step forward nuclear experts said it was unclear what mr larijani was referring to when he said monday , yes , we have injected gas the large industrial plant under construction at natanz is roughly half the size of the pentagon inspectors say iran is constructing 3 , 000 centrifuges as a first step toward 54 , 000 a senior european diplomat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because diplomatic negotiations were under way , said he doubted that iran had crossed the line and begun enriching uranium at the larger plant because iranian and european negotiators were seriously discussing potential ways to resolve iran s standoff with the security council i would be surprised if they fed the centrifuges because it would jeopardize the talks , the diplomat said there are proposals out there that are quite serious the diplomat , who follows the nuclear agency s work , added that none of its inspectors were currently at natanz but that they were on their way he said their assessment would clarify what , if anything , the iranians had actually achieved frustrated western experts have said for months that the underlying question is whether the frenetic activity at the desert complex is real , a bluff or a little of both the issue , they say , is whether iran has really mastered the centrifuge basics or is involved in a political show to strengthen its bargaining position in the global standoff david albright , president of the institute for science and international security in washington and a former united nations weapons inspector , also said iran for the moment seemed more interested in scoring diplomatic points than in making technical advances ahmadinejad is trying to demonstrate facts on the ground and negotiate from a stronger position , he said if they enriched today in the cavernous industrial plant , it would destroy the ability to go forward on any negotiation mr albright said such enrichment would escalate the confrontation , adding , it raises all kinds of worstcase scenarios that , if not managed correctly , could escalate up to a military action it was unclear how seriously to take iran s threat to reduce further its cooperation with inspectors iran s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who has the final word on state matters , issued a forceful warning last month after the security council resolution was passed , saying iran would strike back against any threats or violence until today , what we have done has been in accordance with the international regulations , he said in a nationwide address observing the first day of the persian new year on march 21 but if they take illegal actions , we too can take illegal actions and will do so ayatollah khamenei said the nuclear program was more important than the nationalization of oil in 1958 , a source of great pride for most iranians if they want to treat us with threats and use force or violence , the iranian nation will undoubtedly use all its capabilities to strike the invading enemies , he added
cj nitkowski , the longtime major league veteran now playing with the softbank hawks in japan , has answered our questions from time to time all year here are his latest responses from the emailbag nyt what are the ballparks like in japan \? it seems like mainly domes and turf fields and or alldirt infields do you think the mlb retro ballpark craze could ever catch on there despite the lack of tradition , in that sense \? cj the ballparks lack character of the 12 teams , 6 are in domes two have alldirt infields the others are outdoor turf fields one team has what we would call a traditional field , a regular grass infield that team is orix , which plays half their games at the kyocera dome and half at skymark stadium \( outdoor \) orix is the product of two teams combining into one a few years ago , so they split their homes games at both parks the clubhouses are not designed to be comfortable we spend very little time in the clubhouses compared to the states on the road you get dressed in your hotel , so you go to the park in uniform it was a little weird at first but everyone else is doing it , so it ends up not being a big deal i have wondered myself if stateoftheart stadiums would work here like they do in the us i would think they would although , npb doesn t have the money mlb has , so the money would probably be the biggest obstacle the last couple of new stadiums in japan are nice but not nearly as nice as places like seattle or san diego nyt who are some of the other american players over in japan this year that we might remember from the states \? and who in particular seems to be a good prospect to return to mlb in 2008 \? cj there are a lot of foreigners in japan none are real household names in the states though aaron guiel , who was with the yankees last year , is playing for yakult brian buchanan , the yankees firstround pick in 1994 \( traded for knoblauch \) , is on my team , as is adam hyzdu , who played with boston and pittsburgh ryan vogelsong is with hanshin as is andy sheets , jeff williams and esteban yan tuffy rhodes is back this year with orix , his 10th in japan nyt your manager is sadaharu oh did he have any reaction to barry bonds passing hank aaron as the mlb home run leader , and does he consider himself , with 868 home runs , to be the true world record holder \? and if he didn t have any reaction or wasn t asked about it , why do you think it was not a story for the media over there \? cj mr oh is very diplomatic he speaks very humbly about his accomplishments he was pretty quiet about bonds but did congratulate him publicly when he broke the record he would never say he was the true world record holder it s just not in him to do that it was a story here , just not nearly as big as it was in the states if someone hits 868 , it will probably be big news here i think the culture here is very proud of mr oh s record and doesn t acknowledge bonds as much more than second place

it is language that would not be out of place on cable , but the raw epithets of the battlefield are usually censored by broadcast stations worried about upsetting viewers and running afoul of the federal communications commission on s broadcast of operation homecoming writing the wartime experience on monday , a handful of stations , including wnet in new york , have chosen not to bleep out eight words and not to obscure a few crude images , none of which the stations would normally put on the air the stations that are showing the film unfiltered , which also include weta in washington , wgbh in boston and wmht in albany , will broadcast it at 10 pm eastern time , outside the socalled safe harbor zone of 6 am to 10 pm , when the fcc has determined there are likely to be children in the audience there is unanimity among lawyers we have screened this with that certainly we are safe in showing the program after 10 pm , said joseph b bruns , executive vice president and chief operating officer of weta the move comes at a time when many public television stations have chosen to be overly cautious to avoid tangling with the fcc on indecency issues , given the hefty fines that have been imposed when viewers complain the film , which originated as a project of the national endowment for the arts and has been released theatrically in new york and a few other cities , features interviews with veterans of the united states military who have served in iraq and afghanistan it also includes dramatizations of their firsthand written accounts of war we 're not doing it to be provocative of the fcc we 're doing it because we believe in the merits of the film as it s been done , mr bruns said , adding that , as a vietnam war veteran himself , i think it s important that people do feel the raw emotions of people who were sent to war although some stations have requested an unedited film , the official version that pbs will distribute to its stations will be edited to cover up the offending words the vast majority of stations are expected to use that version
san francisco , june 13 for six months or so , ed jew , a new member of san francisco board of supervisors , has spoken on all sorts of issues involving this city he has spoken about san francisco laws , san francisco people and even san francisco animals there is one small problem , the authorities say mr jew does not live in san francisco on tuesday , mr jew , a florist and real estate investor , surrendered after being charged with nine felonies , including perjury , filing false documents and election code violations in keeping with the geographic mystery , mr jew surrendered in burlingame , 18 miles southeast of here , where the authorities theorize he lives according to charges filed tuesday by the san francisco district attorney s office , mr jew posed as a resident of the often fogbound sunset district along the pacific mr jew has said he does live there in his father s house , despite skeptical neighbors and utility records that the district attorney s office says show sporadic use the city attorney is also investing whether he meets residency requirements a lawyer for mr jew , steven f gruel , said that his client denied the charges and that he did not use much water at home because he showered at his florist store mr gruel said mr jew surrendered in burlingame because it was more convenient questions about the residency began last month after the fbi , in a bribery inquiry , searched mr jew s store , city office and listed residence none of which seemed to bode well for mr jew , a surprise winner in an election in the fall who has made small waves by opposing bans on plastic bags in grocery stores and feeding wild parrots in a downtown park the bans passed anyway the board president , aaron peskin , said although mr jew was presumed to be innocent , his continued presence on the board is eroding san franciscans' confidence in their government i hope , mr peskin said , he 'll do the honorable thing and move on for one day , at least , mr jew seemed to have done that an aide in his office said the supervisor was down the peninsula on wednesday , visiting his extended family but , she said , he will be back here for board business on thursday
i'm glad democrats are keeping the pressure on president bush for a withdrawal date from iraq it s the only way to keep him and iraqis focused on the endgame but if democrats really want to be taken seriously on foreign affairs , they need to recognize that they have only half a policy on iraq and it s the easy half you ca n't be in favor of setting a date to withdraw from iraq without also being in favor of a serious energy policy to radically reduce our dependence on oil now to call for withdrawing from iraq by a set date , no matter what the situation is on the ground there without a serious energy plan here is reckless all we would be doing is making ourselves more dependent on an even more unstable middle east , because any us withdrawal from iraq is likely , in the short run , to be destabilizing the middle east today is deeply troubled if we determine that our efforts to tilt that region in a different direction by building a decent iraq have failed , then our efforts to minimize our exposure to that region have to begin but the last thing we can afford to do is walk away from the middle east militarily while remaining chained to it economically more important , if iraq totally fails , but we still believe it is in our interest to promote reform in the middle east , a serious us energy policy that permanently brings down the price of oil by developing scalable alternative energies is actually the best plan b there is you will see reform in the arabmuslim world only when regimes there ca n't survive just by extracting oil , but have to extract the talents of their people by educating , empowering and connecting them but to hasten that day , democrats have to be a lot more serious about energy than they have been up to now everyone has an energy plan for 2020 but we need one for 2007 that will start to have an impact by 2008 and there is only one way to do that get the price of oil right either tax gasoline by another 50 cents to 1 a gallon at the pump , or set a 50 floor price per barrel of oil sold in america once energy entrepreneurs know they will never again be undercut by cheap oil , you 'll see an explosion of innovation in alternatives right now we 're looking for solutions in all the wrong places , argues the noted oil economist philip verleger the only way one can effectively address this problem today and get an immediate kick is by raising the price at the pump and keeping it there some of the revenue could be used to buy back the most fuelinefficient vehicles on our roads , he added the best monument to 9 11 we could erect would be a mountain of crushed gas guzzlers there are some hopeful signs chris dodd has just broken ranks and become the first presidential candidate to issue a serious , comprehensive energy plan that includes the t word he has called for a corporate carbon tax that would both help fight global warming emissions and raise gasoline prices you say the word tax' and people usually head for the hills , mr dodd told me but this is one where the american people can handle the truth unless you address the issue of price , you 're not serious about moving us from point a to point b barack obama also just got right in detroit s face he went to motown , called for much tougher fuel economy standards and bluntly told automakers and autoworkers the truth for years , while foreign competitors were investing in more fuelefficient technology for their vehicles , american automakers were spending their time investing in bigger , faster cars whenever an attempt was made to raise our fuel efficiency standards , the auto companies would lobby furiously against it , spending millions to prevent the very reform that could 've saved their industry those are fightin' words ! finally , in a move that also merits praise , general motors announced that it was joining other major us corporations , like general electric , and signing on to the united states climate action partnership \( uscap \) , which calls for a capandtrade program to control carbon dioxide emissions gm is the first auto company to do so none of these go far enough , but they are all new positions and may be harbingers of a new competition in which companies and candidates try to outdo each other in being serious about energy rather than phony that would be a big deal and it might give the democrats a more comprehensive iraq policy just in the nick of time you ca n't be serious about getting out of iraq if you 're not serious about getting off oil
in a corner of brentwood , where the streets have names like apple , peach and cocoanut , there is a wooded path known as a place of drug use and violence its reputation is well deserved a pair of shocking crimes there in the last 11 months claimed two male victims both were savagely attacked and died of their injuries the first victim was found unconscious on a lawn on apple street in september he had staggered there from the path after being beaten his skull was fractured and his brain damaged he lingered until june a friend who had been with him , and was also beaten , told newsday that the attackers were four men with baseball bats the homicide remains unsolved and largely ignored by the public the death received brief coverage in newsday , and none in this paper the second victim was chained to a tree , tortured and burned alive he died in the hospital last month the crime was covered heavily by television , radio and newspapers it led nonprofit groups to swiftly solicit donations for the victim s medical care and to offer a 20 , 000 reward it also prompted a quick reaction from the suffolk county executive , steve levy , who announced that detectives had been assigned in every precinct in the county to prevent similar brutality the manhunt ended quickly a defendant was arrested and charged last week he has pleaded temporary insanity the two attacks came in the same place , with the same deadly result , but with strikingly different reactions what is the explanation \? perhaps this the first victim was a latino immigrant named oscar cruz the second victim was a dog the dog s name was spike , though the people who treated him called him maximus , for his courage when the defendant the dog s owner , a young man named derick phanord was arraigned last week , radio , tv and newspaper reporters were there they clustered around his mother , a fraillooking woman with a cane she told them that derick was a gentle boy who had cared for her as she was battling cancer , carrying her like a baby when she was too weak to walk newsday reported this on its web site , prompting a flood of comments from readers someone needs to tie him to a tree and burn him alive i do n't understand why judges wo n't do these things the whole family should be set ablaze the attack on maximus was a sickening crime whether it was a product of a sick mind , as mr phanord s lawyer claims , is for a court to decide but there are other sicknesses to be diagnosed here , too in the passions of a mob that is calling for a troubled young man to be killed , and in the community s silent acceptance of the suffering of its immigrant neighbors the deadly attack on mr cruz , a salvadoran laborer , has prompted little reaction from the county , besides the police investigation and the standard homicide reward of 2 , 000 hardly anyone has paid attention , except mr cruz s family and the long island press , which made the connection between mr cruz and maximus in an article last month it is hard to blot out the evidence of this region s monumental indifference to the lives of latino immigrants they work , suffer and die among us , ignored as long as they serve our needs , but hated if they intrude like streetcorner day laborers too clearly into view besides mr cruz and his companion , there was the honduran man who froze to death in huntington station last winter , and the man who was found fatally beaten in bedford , in westchester county , in april , in the area s third unsolved killing of a guatemalan immigrant in the last four years the newspaper accounts of immigrant laborers maimed or killed by machinery or falls are as frequent and routine as they are brief and unnoticed there exists among us a separate , hidden class of human beings who have no route to legal status and little recourse to medical attention and police protection , and who suffer from chronic exploitation and abuse from wage theft to robbery to beatings to homicide there also exist people who exhibit extreme cruelty toward their pets which is the bigger outrage \? it is clear , and regrettably so , what many long islanders think
to the editor i find it interesting that allan ripp has the time to write an article entitled under the scaffold , a nofight club \( new york observed , may 13 \) , but could n't make the time to perform his civic duty and properly file a report with the police about his horrible assault does n't he understand that if he does n't report a crime , it does n't exist \? the swarms of teenagers to whom mr ripp refers frequently congregate between 57th and 58th street on broadway they often cause disruptions in the street , and on many occasions they have had loud fights and confrontations with one another i suspect that the police are fully aware of their activities if an ordinary citizen can be assaulted on a very busy street in broad daylight , then none of us can be safe in addition , if we allow the police department to dissuade us from filing crime reports , then i expect we will continue to read about how crime is down in new york city barbara malpica upper west side to the editor i am a doorman in the east village we had a scaffold in front of our building in the past and groups of people for whatever reason would hang out under them , and it s always the people who are not from the area and look as if they are about to do something illegal we never went out to approach the people we simply called the police what allan ripp did n't realize was that he was going to be punched the minute he decided to say something to the kids under the scaffold and when he offered his hand in friendship it was considered a sign of weakness that s why he was punched after that gesture when you decide to take matters into your own hands you better be prepared to fight you just do n't walk up to a group of kids and try to challenge them if mr ripp witnessed them assaulting other people , he should have called the police yes , he was lucky not to be stabbed in the back i hate to say it , but he found out the hard way why no one gets involved steven vigo williamsburg , brooklyn to the editor it s a sad state of affairs when police officers discourage a victim of a crime from reporting it maybe they would n't have caught the truant who assaulted allan ripp , but they should 've made an effort at the very least they could 've scared away the loitering louts delmo walters jr highbridge , the bronx
memphis earned its first no 1 seeding in the ncaa tournament and fell a game short of the final four last season but the tigers were hardly expected to achieve similar success this season after losing two top players from that team to the nba now , having won an ncaa division ibest 19 consecutive games and being the first team to streak through conference usa undefeated since 2000 , the sixthranked tigers \( 273 \) are poised to be seeded no 2 or no 3 in this month s ncaa tournament whether they merit a no 1 seed , i do n't know , but i do think they 're better than they were last year , rice coach willis wilson said in a telephone interview as the conference usa tournament starts on its home court wednesday , memphis is perhaps college basketball s most mysterious highly ranked team the tigers have victories against kentucky \( 2010 \) , mississippi \( 1911 \) and gonzaga \( 2210 \) , and their only losses are to georgia tech \( 2010 \) , tennessee \( 229 \) and arizona \( 209 \) , all of whom were ranked at the time but 16 of their wins were in conference usa , which is ranked 11th nationally in the ratings percentage index , behind such leagues as the mountain west , the western athletic conference and the atlantic 10 as a result , memphis , led by the sophomore guard chris douglasroberts and a stingy defense , is ranked eighth in the rpi , but its strength of schedule is 77th unless the topseeded tigers fail to win the conference usa tournament , no other team from the 12team league will receive an invitation to the ncaa tournament last year , it sent memphis and alabamabirmingham still , memphis coach john calipari said his team deserved consideration to be seeded no 1 again if i was picking , you know i 'd be picking us for one , calipari said in a telephone interview based on the rpi , conference usa is stronger this year , calipari said he said six of the league s teams had improved 50 spots in the rpi this season compared with last year the conference s rpi average is also more than 30 spots higher this season , calipari said none of that seemed to hurt us a year ago , he said joe lunardi , the ncaa tournament bracket expert for espn , projected memphis to be seeded second or third he said that he did not believe that the tigers had a chance of being seeded no 1 and that they were more likely to fall instead of rise in the tournament s seeding there s no real way to evaluate a team that has not competed against other top teams outside its conference , lunardi said in a telephone interview it s much more of a qualitative judgment with teams like memphis and nevada , which is in a similar position \( nevada , 273 , is ranked 10th after going 142 in the western athletic conference \) for memphis to be seeded no 2 , lunardi said , teams like texas am and georgetown would need to lose early in the their conference tournaments this week they 're not going to play good enough teams on their own to move up , he said southern methodist coach matt doherty , a former coach at north carolina and notre dame , said he believed that memphis would be great in any conference i 've coached against duke when they won the national championship , maryland when they won it and to me , this memphis team would be able to compete with either one of those teams , he said teams with work to do for several majorconference teams teetering on the bubble for the ncaa tournament , this week s league tournaments will be a decisive factor in determining who receives the 34 atlarge bids if sixthseeded illinois \( 2110 \) beats no 11seeded penn state \( 1118 \) in the first round of the big ten tournament , a quarterfinal matchup against thirdseeded indiana \( 209 \) should determine whether the illini will play in the ncaa tournament or the nit fifthseeded purdue \( 2010 \) also needs to win its first tournament game , in the quarterfinals against iowa \( 1713 \) , to lift its ncaa hopes in the big east tournament , seventhseeded west virginia \( 218 \) figures to need at least two victories to receive an atlarge bid a firstround loss by fifthseeded syracuse \( 219 \) would help the mountaineers georgia tech \( 2010 \) , which defeated boston college yesterday , probably needs to win its firstround game in the atlantic coast conference tournament to ensure its spot in the ncaa tournament in the big 12 , fifthseeded texas tech \( 2011 \) most likely needs to defeat 12thseeded colorado \( 719 \) in the first round to secure its atlarge berth fourthseeded kansas state \( 2110 \) , which has a firstround bye , would probably seal its entry with a quarterfinal victory kansas state coach bob huggins told reporters after saturday s 7261 victory against oklahoma that he liked his team s chances of making the ncaa tournament historically , no team from a bcs conference has had 20some total wins and doubledigit league wins and not gotten in , he said why would they start with us \?

francorchamps , belgium , sept 13 mclaren mercedes , the leading team in the formula one championship , was fined 100 million on thursday and excluded from the constructors' title in the spying scandal that has plagued the sport all season the international automobile federation , the sport s governing body , found the mclaren guilty of cheating by using data obtained from ferrari , its main rival , to improve its own car , the federation said in a statement issued following a hearing in paris the team may continue to race , however , and its two drivers lewis hamilton and fernando alonso , the top two in the points standings will be allowed to keep their points and will be eligible for the driver s title it was the harshest punishment given to a team in the 57year history of the sport the federation , known as fia , said it had stripped mclaren of all its constructor s points in the 2007 fia formula one world championship , and the team can score no points for the remainder of the season the federation added that the team would not share in the sport s revenue this season , either this is the first time that the leading team in the championship had been excluded should another team fail by the end of the season to score more points than mclaren currently has , then there will be no constructor s title winner in 2007 as the teams gathered here for the belgian grand prix this weekend , mclaren led the series , and ferrari , by 23 points a team may accumulate a maximum of 18 points for finishing both first and second place in a race with four races left including this weekend s in belgium ferrari is almost certain to earn enough points for the title ferrari issued a statement saying that it was satisfied that the truth has now emerged for its part , mclaren continued to claim that it had gained no competitive advantage from the ferrari data ron dennis , the director and part owner of mclaren , said , having been at the hearing today , i do not accept that we deserved to be penalized in this way he said the engineering team of more than 140 people had testified that they had never received or used the ferrari information the spying scandal broke in early july , when ferrari accused mclaren of using data given by a ferrari employee to a mclaren employee to improve the quality of its racing car the police had found documents regarding the ferrari car in the english home of mike coughlan , mclaren s technical director ferrari said it thought a former employee , nigel stepney , who had been frustrated by organizational changes at ferrari this season , had provided the information to coughlan at a previous hearing , on july 26 , the international automobile federation found mclaren guilty of possessing the data , but it did not punish the team , because it could not prove that the team had used the information to improve the car the federation said , however , that if new evidence appeared to show that the data had been used to the detriment of the championship , then mclaren could be thrown out of the series this season and also in 2008 there have been other constructors' penalties over the years the tyrrell team was removed in 1984 for various technical infringements , but the team was not a leading team the benetton team was suspended from two races in 1994 after its driver , michael schumacher , ignored a black flag requiring him to quit a race in 2005 , the bar honda team was disqualified from one race and banned from two others for using an illegal fuel tank although the decision on thursday destroyed the efforts of mclaren to win its ninth constructors' title , it saved the biggest story of the season the battle between the mclaren drivers hamilton , a rookie , has led most of the season in his rookie year , with alonso , the twotime defending world champion , trying to catch him the mclaren team was founded by bruce mclaren , a driver who died in a racing accident in 1970 it won its first team and drivers' title in 1974 it has won seven more since , but none since 1998 it also won its first drivers' title in 1974 it has won 10 more since , the last in 1999
it s fair to say that the relationship between the press and the bush white house has often been one of mutual suspicion and sometimes outright hostility and the administration and its allies have at times been outspoken in their belief that the mainstream press was biased against it but as evidenced by the frontline fourpart series news war , whose first episode appears tonight on pbs , government skepticism toward the press is just one of the trials faced by today s news organizations those challenges include everything from declining audiences , to the warp speed of the 24 7 news cycle , to the internet s undercutting the press s monopoly on information , to news operations beholden to conglomerates that sometimes view news as another entertainment portal the first program in the series , secrets , spin and the future of news , concentrates in part on white house efforts to manipulate coverage for political ends during the prelude to the iraq invasion virtually the entire hour centers on the outing of the cia agent valerie plame , whose husband , the former ambassador joseph c wilson iv , had accused the white house , while making its case for war , of knowingly using discredited evidence that iraq had tried to buy uranium ore from niger the episode led to a criminal investigation that on the one hand compromised the white house and on the other undermined the news media there was no more tangled business between the bush administration and the press than the plame case , says will lyman , the regular narrator of frontline , in his urgent baritone it was a case that would raise profound questions about reporters' ability to protect their confidential sources the leak investigation , the program claims persuasively , had a cascading effect , eroding press powers beyond anything the bush team ever envisioned as a variety of legal experts attest in news war , the aggressive tactics of the special counsel patrick j fitzgerald and the jailing of a reporter for the new york times for withholding the name of a secret source have resulted in the rethinking of 30 years of case law , which had underwritten a journalist s right to protect an anonymous informant s identity there s no ambiguity at all , insists floyd abrams , a longtime counsel to the times in the aftermath of the plame affair there is no protection , he said , for journalists in situations in which a grand jury seeks information in good faith from a journalist period the timing of the series is kismet lowell bergman , formerly a special projects reporter for the new york times , parades reporters , exwhite house aides and lawyers before the frontline cameras just as a parallel cast is appearing at the trial of vice president dick cheney s chief of staff , i lewis libby , on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice and the gravity of the issues at hand are bolstered by the courtroomdrama style of the series , in which video snippets take us from a meeting of times editors to the washington courthouse where lawyers and reporters stood their ground to defend their sources in addition mr bergman has collared a slate of marquee names woodward and bernstein koppel and safire markos moulitsas of the daily kos blog eric schmidt , the chief executive of google to reflect on journalism s prospects of retaining its status as a public trust the first program is not perfect in particular laying out plame 101 , three years after mr wilson spoke out , feels way late , while going to air just weeks before an expected libby verdict seems premature more to the point is the lack of context frontline might have been better served by opening with what s happening to the news \? , the third installment in the series , which focuses on the fundamental challenges confronting the news media , all of which have contributed to the government s bold posture in questioning the press s traditional role none of this is precisely new , but law and news enthusiasts will find gems here , if few revelations in the first program , for example , the media watchdog tom rosenstiel analyzes how white house spinners enlist presscorps spinnees , turning the news into an everflapping spinnaker and mr bergman interviews an impressive roster of plamecase players to comment on how events played out joseph wilson , the former time inc chief norman pearlstine and key executives and journalists at the washington post and the new york times the post s bob woodward , echoing previous statements , admits his blunder in believing that iraq probably possessed weapons of mass destruction it was totally wrong i think i dropped the ball here i should have pushed much , much harder and he roundly criticizes judith miller , the former correspondent for the times she had the wrong sources , he says the excuse ca n't be i'm only as good as my sources' surprisingly , though , mr woodward says he still regards the plame affair as much ado about gossip there was a lot of energy and air time and ink spent over something that really did n't amount to a violation of the law , he says there s no echo of watergate watergate s echoes , however , reverberate throughout the broadcast , in the sense that the basic relationship between press and government may be in question two first amendment lawyers , james goodale and mr abrams , both long connected to the times , seem to feel that way , as they look back at the watershed 1972 branzburg decision , which , along with a number of state laws , established a reporter s right to shield a source mr goodale says that judges now look at prevailing legal opinions and say that a reporter s got to testify and there s no privilege to protect a journalist or his source in the end , the achievement of news war is to remind viewers of the fundamental principles at stake in this showdown between the government s desire for secrecy in the post9 11 age and the journalist s ability to report what mr woodward once termed the best obtainable version of the truth a frontline production in association with the university of california , berkeley , graduate school of journalism lowell bergman , series correspondent secrets , sources and spin \( tonight and feb 20 \) is a frontline coproduction with a little rain productions raney aronson and arun rath , producers ms aronson , director seth bomse , coproducer what s happening to the news \( feb 27 \) is a frontline coproduction with cam bay productions stephen talbot , producer ken dornstein , senior producer stories from a small planet \( march 27 \) is produced by frontline world sharon tiller , frontline world series executive director frontline and frontline world are produced by wgbh , boston
houston , may 2 an investigation into sexual abuse and mismanagement at the texas youth commission has led to the dismissal of 66 employees with records of felony charges or arrests , including one convicted of homicide and another who had pleaded guilty to attempted murder , the state official leading the inquiry reported wednesday the employees included guards , case workers and maintenance staff members , most of them in regular contact with hundreds of troubled youths officials said they had no information on whether any of the 66 were accused of harming youths in their custody citing reforms already instituted , the official leading the inquiry , jay kimbrough , issued 56 recommendations for changes , including background checks on staff members and the release of juveniles being held beyond sentencing requirements or for misdemeanors the smoke signals were clearly visible the dots should have been connected , said mr kimbrough , faulting a variety of watchdogs , from the youth commission headquarters itself to a west texas prosecutor , the governor s staff and legislative officials the scandal broke in midfebruary with news accounts of a shelved 2005 texas rangers report confirming sexual contacts between confined youths and a school principal and assistant superintendent at the west texas state school in pyote both resigned without charges but were recently indicted accusations of abuse at other youth centers came later mr kimbrough , a former deputy state attorney general and director of homeland security , was named by gov rick perry in march as conservator of the youth commission from early march through april 27 , mr kimbrough reported , 2 , 972 calls and complaints came into a command post hot line , with 1 , 463 of the cases closed eleven employees have been arrested , and 12 senior executives and three facility superintendents have been fired or have resigned , the report said in addition , it said , 473 youths of the more than 4 , 500 in custody have been released and reviews of other cases are continuing the commission failed to take reasonable and appropriate actions to ensure that employees working with youths do not have a criminal background , mr kimbrough found jim hurley , a spokesman for mr kimbrough , identified the employee convicted of attempted murder as cynthia patterson , 52 , a juvenile corrections officer at the west texas state school records of the texas department of public safety say ms patterson pleaded guilty to forgery and attempt to commit murder in 1980 , and was sentenced to 10 years' probation the employee with the homicide conviction , mr hurley said , was charles crawley , 55 , a case manager at the ron jackson state juvenile correction complex in brownwood department of public safety records say mr crawley was convicted of murder with malice aforethought in 1971 , sentenced to 15 years and released in 1981 a corrections officer at the ron jackson facility and a maintenance technician at the west texas state school had convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , mr hurley said all 66 , he said , had received letters of termination , which some were challenging , but none of the workers were still on the job among the agency s problems cited were a nearly 50 percent rate of staff turnover annually more than double that of the adult prison system and severe crowding mr kimbrough called for checking all new commission employees against state and federal criminal databases , and setting a cap on youth placements he also recommended a ratio of one correctional officer per six youths , rather than the current average of one officer to 15 youths , and sometimes as many as one to 24 and he called for increasing the training of officers to 300 hours , from two weeks now he said that children as young as 10 should no longer be grouped with offenders as old as 21 , that superintendents in charge of facilities should be rotated to new jobs about every five years , and that electronic surveillance should be upgraded in detention facilities
thanks to emily bazelon \( jan 21 \) for reminding us that abortion is often a grim event as bazelon writes , you do n't have to be an antiabortion advocate to feel sorrow over an abortion , or to be haunted about whether you did the right thing are some antiabortion advocates using flawed research to support the belief that abortion does emotional damage to many who experience it \? perhapsyet an act that can be described as grim and questionable , even by those who support it , may do longterm emotional damage to some of those who choose it it will be wonderful when those who wish to make abortion illegal and those who wish it were simply rare can stop shouting and find common ground for dialogue kathryn kirui montclair , calif rhonda arias s tragic experiences were haunting but were largely a result of her own poor choices her acceptance of an evangelical form of religion may help her deal with her personal issues , but her message is dangerous we have been down this road before abortions will not simply disappear if they are once again criminalized instead , thousands of women are likely to be brutalized by unsafe and unsanitary practitioners in back alleys , and that is a postabortion syndrome i hope none of us have to see ever again dennis a greene , md newport , ri those of us who have worked in these trenches know the truth no one is more inconsolable than a mother who has destroyed her child postabortion healing programs have come about because of the countless women who need them please respect their pain and grief , and do not turn their reality into a political football in the abortion debate maureen vetter russell floral park , ny every woman s decision to have an abortion comes with a heavy emotional price counselors interested in helping do not do so by nurturing guilt and selfblame rhonda arias s clients would be far better off learning to forgive themselves and moving on with their lives and so would she marilyn loden naples , fla one ca n't help but wonder if abortion had been outlawed during the period in which arias had her unwanted pregnancies whether she would n't now be blaming her life s problems on the lack of access to the procedure diane garlick augusta , mich i was pleased that you ran an article about contemporary abortion politics but i was disappointed that the voices of women who have had abortions and did not suffer psychological damage as a result of the surgery \( which , as noted in the article , are the majority \) were not present rebecca m kluchin sacramento , calif it is tragic that the women most vulnerable to the message of postabortion syndrome are further victimized by a political religious agenda it feels like emotional blackmail for this cause julie hauer brookline , mass i do not deny for a moment that there are women who experience real grief and sadness over having an abortion , and these women should not be ignored , and their grief should not be denied they deserve support and comfort and assistance the focus on this , however , seems to ignore the simple fact that it is human nature to wonder whether the other choice might have been better for every woman who thinks that her life would have been different if she had n't had an abortion , i would be willing to bet that there is a woman who had the baby and who believes her life would have been a lot different if she had n't j greene weston , wva it may well be that those women featured in your article , who chose to confront their feelings about their aborted babies , might be in a better psychological state than those who dismiss their abortions as the best decision they ever made jean redegeld white plains , ny photo \( photograph by tom schierlitz \)
after only a year and a half with a new scheduling arrangement , the nhl is considering another change in the current setup , each eastern conference team does not play 5 of the 15 teams in the western conference moreover , an eastern team will play in a western city once every three seasons fans in the west are complaining because they seldom see young stars like sidney crosby , evgeni malkin and alexander ovechkin , who play on eastern teams and canadian television executives are upset that the canucks , the flames and the oilers will not play the canadiens , the senators and the maple leafs next season at the board of governors meetings last month , officials explored the idea of realigning the divisions and changing the schedule so that each team plays every other team at least once a season one idea was to have each conference consist of two divisions with seven or eight teams , rather than the current three divisions with five teams the issue will be discussed further in february on wednesday , fans signed on to s fan faceoff panel were asked to fill out an extensive online questionnaire on the current schedule and possible alternatives the league s uncertainty is nothing new the current schedule , with its emphasis on increased play within divisions and between regional rivals , was devised in the wake of the 20045 lockout it was a response to the complaints from team officials , television executives and alienated fans that there were too many games against faraway teams that fans did not care about , and too much fatiguing and costly air travel for players the fact that no satisfactory schedule has emerged may be indicative of a deeper problem if you look at the discussion of realignment in a broader context , the question that comes up is , is there too much hockey content \? ' said paul swangard , managing director of the warsaw sports marketing center at the university of oregon there are a lot of levers the league can pull to affect content you could have fewer games or fewer teams there was speculation at the time of the lockout that the nhl would contract by one or more teams , but commissioner gary bettman discounted the idea swangard , alluding to this season s lower attendance figures , low television ratings in the united states and a handful of financially troubled franchises , said one alternative to reducing the number of teams or to altering the schedule might be that the owners eventually decide to reduce the number of games , to make each game more meaningful and draw more fan interest european champions cup the european champions cup , the showcase event on the continent s club calendar , will run from thursday through sunday in st petersburg , russia its format is succinct the 2006 champions of europe s top six leagues are seeded into two divisions each team plays the other two in its group once , then the two group winners meet in a goldmedal match this is the third european champions cup , all in st petersburg the first , in 2005 , was won by the russian champion , avangard omsk , on an overtime goal scored by jaromir jagr in 2006 , the russian champion won again dynamo moscow in a penalty shootout the tournament will not be televised in north america , but it can be followed live on the international ice hockey federation s web site ,  the tournament teams are older than most nhl franchises , as is true for most clubs in europe the newest is ak bars kazan , founded in 1956 the oldest , sparta prague , dates to 1903 here are the teams in the division named for aleksandr ragulin , the former soviet defenseman the hockey playing knights won the finnish championship last april now in second place in the smliiga , hpk made a curious signing last month , adding the enforcer billy tibbetts a boston native , tibbetts served a jail term from 1996 to 1999 and has been suspended from the nhl and at least two minor leagues for brawling or gross misconduct sparta won the czech title last year by beating its city rival , slavia prague now in fourth place in the czech extraliga , sparta is led by last year s playoff star and this year s leagueleading scorer , center jaroslav hlinka mshk zilina zilina has slumped since winning the championship of slovakia in 2006 now in ninth place in the 10team slovak extraliga , zilina is given little chance in the tournament here are the teams in the division named for ivan hlinka , the former czech forward and coach ak bars kazan the team from the tatar capital , it made an allout push for the russian championship in 2005 to mark the city s 1 , 000th anniversary , signing 15 lockedout nhl players and spending a reported 65 million in salaries that bid failed , but last year ak bars won the title by going 121 in the playoffs with a mostly russian lineup this season , it is in first place in the superliga with a highpowered offense led by the former penguin alexei morozov fourth in the nationalliga a , lugano won the swiss championship last year , in one series rallying from a threegamestonone deficit its blue line features defensemen jason strudwick , who played for the rangers last season , and dick tarnstrom fbk s run to the swedish championship was highlighted by two lastminute goals in a game 7 semifinal victory over hv71 jonkoping second in the elitserien , fbk has many nhl veterans in its lineup , including defenseman fredrik olausson
9 55 pm last call the major question from this debate , the first presidential forum in which the questions were asked by the public via video , was whether the format made any difference did it elicit a different kind of answer , or new information , from the candidates \? it s hard to know , of course while it was refreshing to see real people in their native habitats \( ie , their living rooms \) , the medium did not overshadow the message the use of questions on video may have been groundbreaking , but the answers , while often passionate , were not did the debate fully take advantage of the format \? most of the videos from the public showed someone up close and personal speaking into the camera the videos from the candidates were similar to campaign commercials mr edwards s video making fun of his hair did not receive the proper introduction to be fully appreciated perhaps the most visually adventurous move was mrs clinton s selection of a coral jacket , a striking statement in the long gray line of presidential candidates \( it prompted a few comments from the other candidates at the end of the debate mr edwards i admire what senator clinton has done for america , what her husband did for america i m not sure about that coat mr obama disagreed i actually like hillary s jacket i don t know what s wrong with it but the lasting moments from the debate are probably not visual , with the possible exception of the melting snowman who asked about global warming and the man who brandished his weapon and called it his baby the lasting moments were the verbal statements from the candidates , which could have taken place in a traditional debate mr obama saying that it was evident that he was authentically black when he tried to catch a cab in manhattan mrs clinton asserting that she would be careful about meeting with leaders of rogue nations because she would not want to be used as propaganda but it seems as if this debate crossed some sort of divide the videos added such a personal element and an unpredictable element , and made the debate seem so broadly open to everyone in the country , that it seems unlikely that future debates will not include them read the full debate transcript 9 15 pm the after party in a postdebate interview on cnn , elizabeth edwards , the wife of john edwards , is sticking to her guns that her husband would do a better job than mrs clinton of advocating women s issues she said that mrs clinton would be more convincing if she had offered a universal healthcare plan , as mr edwards did several months ago are we witnessing the hijacking by the edwards campaign of health care , which had been mrs clinton s signature issue when she was first lady \? from the transcript wolf blitzer in other words , when she answered the question tonight that really came up in part because of what you said in recent days , did she convince you \? elizabeth edwards she would do a better job of convincing me if she had a universal health care plan you heard her say tonight that what we need to do is to build a national commitment for universal health care i ve been out there talking to people for the last four years , and let me tell you , there is a there is a national will for universal health care now , what we need is not a national will we need a leader who will take us there and in this election , among this group of democrats , john edwards is the one who is doing it she could go a long way by either endorsing john s universal health care plan , or by adopting a universal health care plan of her own , instead of saying that we need a continued conservation women in particular are underinsured and uninsured and if we re going to better women s lives , we re going to have to have a universal health care 9 00 pm what i like about you they are all sharing a few jolly minutes at the end here , having been asked to say something nice about the person to their left but really , everyone looks relieved that this is over the candidates videos obama mr obama s video was perhaps the most highly produced a good , upbeat bit of selfpromotion that stuck with the theme of his campaign he is the one to bring about real change 8 57 pm my baby best line of the night mr biden chides a man who refers to his weapon as my baby and asks if the candidates can keep his baby safe if that s his baby mr biden said , he needs help he added that he hoped this man doesn t come looking for me 8 50 pm cynicism mr obama just offered a good summary of many of the questions in this debate almost every question , he said , reflected cynicism about the capacity of any of the candidates to change the country this was also a smart diversion from the actual question and a statement from mr gravel indicating that mr obama , mrs clinton and mr edwards had taken special interest money still , mr obama said , he was best qualified 8 50 pm a more intimate debate \? there was a lot of talk before the debate that the candidates might offer more personalized responses to the questions because the format was so intimate in response to the composite video of questions from various people about their health problems , mrs clinton did mention each of their names and she acknowledged how hard it must be for them to discuss such problems before the world but for the most part , the candidates focused on the television audience 8 40 pm social security this video kind of embodies the promise and the pitfalls of this supposedly revolutionary debate he s wearing a baseball cap and shades , not something you usually see in traditional debates but his question is not a fringe or radical one , and people have been asking it for years to keep social security healthy would you raise taxes or cut benefits \? the candidates videos kucinich mr kucinich s video , also similar to a standard campaign video , asks people to text peace the candidates videos biden going to the last break of the evening , mr biden s video was played it was a serious campaign commercial saying that he had the experience to get out of iraq now without leaving chaos behind 8 31 pm how did i get here \? in response to a question about climate change and saving energy , anderson cooper asked , who took a private jet to the debate \? mrs clinton , mr obama and mr edwards all appeared to raise their hands , as did others , but it was hard to see everyone in response to a question about nuclear energy , mr edwards said he was not in favor of expanding the use of it mrs clinton said she is agnostic on the question of nuclear power but mr edwards was right , she said , in the need to figure out what to do about nuclear waste and the cost of building nuclear power plants commercial break at the second break , it seems as if this may be the most intense and serious debate of the season the candidates look uniformly grim there is none of the jocularity that marked the earlier debates it may have something to do with the personal nature of the videos and the virtual presence of citizens with serious , urgent questions it may have to do with the rising frustration , clear in the citizen videos , over the lack of progress in ending the war in iraq it may have to do with a need by the candidates to try to seize an opening to break through and rearrange their hierarchy in the polls in repose , mrs clinton has had a look of solemnity the confidence she showed in earlier debates has not come through so far 8 11 pm women as president this debate might be remembered as the woman debate rather than the youtube debate so many questions that at heart get to the question of whether a woman can serve as president mrs clinton declares there isn t much doubt in anyone s mind that i can be taken seriously she noted that other countries have women as presidents and their compatriots on the world stage take them seirously it would be quite appropriate to have a woman deal with muslim and arab countries on behalf of the united states 8 07 pm women and the draft the questioning turned to whether women should register for the draft mrs clinton , mr obama and mr edwards all said yes the candidates videos gravel 7 57 pm more iraq a woman who identifies herself only as the mother of a soldier deployed in iraq asks if the democrats are bogged down by politics in not bringing the troops home how many more have to die before the us leaves , she asks mrs clinton did not answer directly , though she did discuss her recent runin with the defense department mr kucinich said yes , the problem is politics and it s important for congress to defund the war mr obama took a jab at mrs clinton , saying it was fine for her to ask for exit plans from the pentagon , but the time to ask how we re going to get out of iraq was before we went in , and said that if he sent troops into battle , the decision would be based on sound intelligence 7 45 the war in iraq mr biden is playing to his strength on foreign policy he said the us can t pull out of iraq until there is a political solution his rivals , he said , should start telling the truth the candidates videos edwards the candidates videos clinton 7 38 pm darfur on darfur , bill richardson says the answer is diplomacy and to send in un peacekeeping forces , dodging whether america should send in troops in a heated followup , joe biden asserts where we can , america must america should send in troops now , he said those kids will be dead by the time the diplomacy is over mrs clinton also calls for un peacekeepers , sanctions and a nofly zone but only under repeated questioning does she say american ground troops do not belong in darfur this is tricky ground to navigate some candidates , like mrs clinton , have gotten in trouble for voting to authorize the use of force in iraq and they don t want to be wrong again , especially in a region involving poor , black victims 7 31 pm gay marriage two lesbians from brooklyn want to know about gay marriage mr edwards said he did not support gay marriage he said he felt enormous conflict about it , but did not say why he was against it 7 28 pm running as a jordan williams from lawrence , kan , asks if barack obama is authentically black , and mrs clinton if she is running as a woman mr obama quips that when he s trying to catch a cab in manhattan , his blackness is evident mrs clinton said that she couldn t run as anything other than a woman , and she is proud to be doing so , which draws a huge applause john edwards notes that if anyone is considering not voting for mr obama because he is black or mrs clinton because she is a woman , i don t want their vote under questioning , he goes on to defend his wife s statement last week that he would be a better advocate for women than mrs clinton would be mrs clinton appeared slightly rattled , or at least annoyed , by the subject and does her best to avoid saying anything negative about mr edwards she finishes by enthusiastically saying , isn t it great that they are debating who is going to be better for women \? 7 16 pm slavery what about reparations for slavery \? john edwards said he is not for reparations and converts the question to his theme that blacks are paying more for their mortgages and that he would take on the big corporations he gets some applause , but mr obama s answer to the same question gets a huge wave of applause the real reparations to be made , he said , are in providing better education mr kucinich is the only one who says he is for reparations and repairing the breach the candidate videos richardson the candidate videos dodd the campaigns have submitted their own videos chris dodd s is the first to be shown it s a spoof of trivial media questioning , with an interviewer wanting to know why mr dodd has white hair but what was up with the mousse at the end \? 7 11 pm republican running mate \? joe biden said that if he had to choose a republican as his running mate , he would pick chuck hagel and senator richard lugar as secretary of state 7 10 pm are you liberal \? rob porter from irvine , calif , wants to know how mrs clinton would define the word liberal and whether she would apply it to herself she gives a bit of a history lesson about its origin as a word that meant you were for freedom , but over the last 30 or 40 years it has been used to mean a proponent of big government i prefer the word progressive , she said i consider myself a modern progressive 7 09 pm differences \? davis from groton , mass asks a similar question to dennis kucinich about what makes him different from his opponents mr kucinich gets a little closer to an answer strength through peace , he says , but he declines to paint why he is different from his opponents hillary clinton , dressed in a coral suit , says she is ready to lead on day one 7 02 pm first question here s the historic first question , from zach from provo , utah what will make you more effectual than other politicians \? so far , not an historic answer from chris dodd he seems to think it was an opening for a nonanswer barack obama seems to relate a little bit better to the questioner , saying his campaign is all about change 7 pm what you won t see cute opening from chris from oregon about hoping the candidates will not beat around the bush , so to speak will it set the tone for what we are in for tonight \? but heavens , does anderson cooper need to take up so much time with videos we are not going to see \? katharine q seelye is liveblogging the cnn youtube democratic debate previous posts what to look for cable coverage of the youtube debate
in april , jerry miller , an illinois man who served 24 years for a rape he did not commit , became the 200th american prisoner cleared by dna evidence his case , like the 199 others , represented a catastrophic failure of the criminal justice system when an airplane crashes , investigators pore over the wreckage to discover what went wrong and to learn from the experience the justice system has not done anything similar but a new study does brandon l garrett , a law professor at the university of virginia , has , for the first time , systematically examined the 200 cases , in which innocent people served an average of 12 years in prison in each case , of course , the evidence used to convict them was at least flawed and often false yet juries , trial judges and appellate courts failed to notice a few types of unreliable trial evidence predictably supported wrongful convictions , professor garrett concluded in his study , judging innocence , to be published in the columbia law review in january the leading cause of the wrongful convictions was erroneous identification by eyewitnesses , which occurred 79 percent of the time in a quarter of the cases , such testimony was the only direct evidence against the defendant faulty forensic evidence was next , present in 55 percent of the cases in some of those cases , courts put undue weight on evidence with limited value , as when a defendant s blood type matched evidence from the crime scene in others , prosecution experts exaggerated , made honest mistakes or committed outright fraud most of the forensic evidence involved problems with the analysis of blood or semen fortytwo cases featured expert testimony about hair , an area that is , professor garrett wrote , notoriously unreliable informants testified against the defendants in 18 percent of the cases \( in three cases , it turned out they had an unusually powerful motive for their false testimony , as dna evidence proved they were in fact guilty of the crime they had pinned on the defendant \) there were false confessions in 16 percent of the cases , with twothirds of those involving defendants who were juveniles , mentally retarded or both the 200 cases examined in the study are a distinctive subset of criminal cases more than 90 percent of those exonerated by dna were convicted of rape , or of both rape and murder , rape being the classic crime in which dna can categorically prove innocence for other crimes , there is often no biological evidence or , if there is , it can give only circumstantial hints about guilt or innocence only 14 of those exonerated had been sentenced to death , 13 in rapemurders there is a widespread misconception that dna evidence has freed many inmates from death row , but it is actually a rare murder not involving rape in which biological evidence can provide categorical proof of innocence dna testing is available in fewer than 10 percent of violent crimes , said peter neufeld , a founder of the innocence project at cardozo law school , which was instrumental in securing many exonerations but the same causes of wrongful convictions exist in cases with dna evidence as in those cases that do n't professor garrett s study strongly suggests , then , that there are thousands of people serving long sentences for crimes they did not commit but who have no hope that dna can clear them in a second forthcoming study of false convictions , this one focused on capital cases , two law professors samuel r gross of the university of michigan and barbara o'brien of michigan state cautioned that exonerations are highly unrepresentative of wrongful convictions in general the main thing we can safely conclude from exonerations is that there are many other false convictions that we have not discovered , the michigan study said in addition , a couple of strong demographic patterns appear to be reliable black men accused of raping white women face a greater risk of false conviction than other rape defendants and young suspects , those under 18 , are at greater risk of false confession than other suspects professor garrett also found that exonerated convicts were more apt to be members of minority groups than was the prison population generally for instance , 73 percent of the convicts cleared of rape charges were black or hispanic , compared with 37 percent of all rape convicts the courts performed miserably in ferreting out the innocent thirtyone of the 200 exonerated prisoners , for instance , had appealed to the united states supreme court , but the justices refused to hear 30 of the cases in the one case they did hear , they ruled against the inmate of course , appeals courts do not typically reconsider a jury s factual findings , focusing instead on asserted procedural errors only 20 of the 200 even appealed on the ground that they were innocent none of those claims were granted perhaps the most troubling finding in professor garrett s study was how reluctant the criminal justice system was to allow dna testing in the first place prosecutors often opposed it , and 16 courts initially denied requests for testing yet dna evidence can do more than free the innocent in many cases , it also identified the person who actually committed the crime in 40 percent of the cases handled by the innocence project , mr neufeld said , dna not only exonerated the innocent prisoner but also provided evidence that helped identify the person who committed the crime in every single one of those cases that perpetrator had committed violent crimes in the intervening years , he said the era of dna exonerations should be a finite one these days , dna testing is common on the front end of prosecutions , meaning that in a few years , the window that the 200 exonerations has opened on the justice system will close we should look carefully through that window while we can
jerusalem , feb 19 the first peace talks in six years between the leaders of israel and the palestinians ended without any apparent concrete progress beyond an agreement to meet again but secretary of state , who convened the meeting , said she intended to keep pursuing the process for the rest of her time in office after two hours of talks with prime minister of israel and palestinian president , ms rice read a vaguely worded joint statement saying the two men discussed their views of the diplomatic and political horizon and had agreed to meet again soon ms rice and her aides made clear that mr abbas s decision to bring his fatah faction into a joint unity government with hamas , which western governments consider to be a terrorist organization , had complicated her efforts at peacemaking she suggested that if this meeting had not already been scheduled before the unitygovernment agreement was reached , mr olmert might not have agreed to meet with mr abbas still , she praised mr abbas for supporting international requirements that the palestinians recognize the right of israel to exist , that they forswear violence and that they accept previously negotiated agreements with israel hamas has resisted all three steps neither mr olmert nor mr abbas appeared by ms rice s side as she read the official statement , reflecting the tenuous nature of the talks , which apparently are so fragile that no side has even been willing to label them as negotiations one american official called them an informal dialogue the official statement read by ms rice referred to them simply as efforts the president and the prime minister agreed that they would meet together again soon , ms rice said in that vein , i expect to return soon but she expects that the two men will meet again within weeks , not months , even if it is without her the commitment from mr olmert to meet again with mr abbas is a minor victory for mr abbas , also known as abu mazen , since it signals that israel will continue to deal with him despite the unitygovernment agreement , reached earlier this month in mecca , saudi arabia later in the day , mr olmert said there will be a dialogue , and we will continue the communication channel with abu mazen we will not accept a situation in which we have no channels of communication with the palestinian public , as i think this will be a dire mistake all this without compromising over the principle we have established not to conduct ties or acknowledge institutions that fail to endorse the basic principles which are the foundation to any future dealings but according to a senior israeli official , mr olmert told a group of visiting american congressmen today that he is very frustrated and disappointed with the palestinians the official continued he was n't frustrated with the meeting itself , but with the feeling that abu mazen is going toward hamas , not the other way around the prime minister feels that the bottom line is moving toward the extremists , not the pragmatists the palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said that mr abbas had agreed to the mecca deal to end the fighting between hamas and fatah , and said that mr abbas , as the head of the palestine liberation organization , recognizes israel , and that s what really matters ms rice made it clear that she felt it wise to continue to talk to palestinians like mr abbas who accept israel and nonviolence , which she said represented the majority of palestinian people but a new palestinian unity government that does n't explicitly recognize israel or renounce violence and thus far , the mecca agreement does not oblige it to will make these talks on a political and diplomatic horizon for a settlement even more complicated it is one thing for israel to begin talks with mr abbas while it continues to boycott a government including hamas that mr abbas helped to create but it is quite another for israel to actually make meaningful progress toward a substantial peace settlement with a government that refuses to recognize it or renounce violence against it ms rice defended the decision to hold the talks right now sure , we could have said , we 'll just wait until it all sorts out , ' she said today but the mecca agreement has strained relations between mr abbas and mr olmert to the point , mr rice said , that the two needed to clear the air between them it s really valuable that they sat face to face still , middle east analysts who have been critical of the bush administration s handsoff stance on arabisraeli peace negotiations for the last six years lauded ms rice for getting back into the game in this environment , given the odds against even launching a process , what she s done is an achievement , said aaron david miller , a scholar at the woodrow wilson center who was a senior adviser for arabisraeli relations at the state department under the last three presidents even so , he cautioned that the odds for success will remain long until the palestinians acquire a government that is willing to recognize israel oddly enough , we 're now dressed up for the party the possibility of serious israelipalestinian talks but we 've got nowhere to go , mr miller said the israeli government also remains deeply skeptical of mr abbas s ability to deliver calm in the palestinian territories , let alone a peace agreement with israel mr olmert and his aides view mr abbas as having been weakened by the mecca agreement , because the hosts of the talks , the saudis , treated him not so much as the palestinian president , but as a leader of the fatah faction , and an equal to the exiled hamas political leader , khaled meshal the israelis also believe that mr abbas arrived at mecca weakened by the fighting in gaza , in which forces loyal to hamas took over northern gaza and large parts of gaza city fatah forces did not collapse , but they did not defeat hamas , and were perceived as weaker mr abbas argued to ms rice that the top priority for the palestinians , and for him as their president , was to stop the infighting thus , his willingness to abandon his call for early elections and instead pursue creation of a unity government led by hamas and including fatah ms rice and the americans were against the idea of a fatah unity deal with hamas one senior official said today that washington was surprised by the deal and none too happy about it but mr abbas told her that he felt there was no other choice in gaza , the hamas spokesman , ismail radwan , said that ms rice did not succeed in pressuring president abbas to withdraw from the unity government mr radwan said that hamas calls on the us administration to respect the palestinian people s will , and recognize the government , and open a dialogue with the government the meeting today , beginning with a stilted threeway handshake among ms rice , mr olmert and mr abbas , took place at ms rice s hotel in jerusalem according to a senior bush administration official , after about an hour of discussions about the mecca accord and the proposed unity government , ms rice turned to the two men and said let s go upstairs and talk about your future the three then went to ms rice s suite on the 10th floor , overlooking jerusalem s old city , where they talked for more than an hour about what ms rice has termed the political horizon diplomaticspeak for the contours of an eventual palestinian state american officials said that mr olmert and mr abbas have agreed to meet again in the next few weeks but a senior israeli official said that while contacts between the two men would continue , including phone calls , the next facetoface meeting may not come so quickly soon is the future , and not necessarily the near future , the official said standing in the way of that next meeting are the stilltobedetermined specifics of the national unity government in particular , the united states and israel want to see what formal goals the government sets out on paper such a document would not commit the hamas movement , but it could go further than the vague mecca agreement toward meeting the three requirements of western donor nations concerning relations with israel ms rice will probably make her next visit after the new government is formed , perhaps in mid to late march if no new government is ultimately formed , or if one is formed that does not meet the three conditions , then very little will have changed the americans will continue to talk to mr abbas as the leader of the palestine liberation organization , the legally established leadership of the palestinians , and as the palestinian president they will continue to shun the hamasdominated palestinian authority and allow no direct financing of it but at the

whenever i'm asked , and sometimes even before i'm asked , i advise parents of collegeage children to not send their sons and daughters to private schools , but to send them to public institutions , at least if there are any good ones in their state i say this for the obvious reason the tuition fee difference between a good private school and a good state school can be as much as 40 , 000 , and , aside from the dubious coin of prestige , it s hard to see what you would be buying ivy league colleges once had a monopoly on worldclass faculty , but today highpowered scholars and teachers can be found in the classrooms of any number of good state universities there s that word good again a \( relatively \) inexpensive education may not be such a bargain if along with the lower price comes a lower quality the challenge is to combine firstclass schooling with affordability and access the temptation is to do things on the cheap both the challenge and the temptation are on display these days in florida where a drama in many acts is unfolding a former governor , bob graham , is suing to take away the legislature s claimed authority to determine tuition and fees at the state s 11 public universities graham contends that the legislature has been ignoring amendment 11 , which created a board of governors in 2002 to manage the university system the board , in turn , has been accused of surrendering its responsibilities to the legislature meanwhile , the same legislature voted a 5 percent tuition increase , which was promptly vetoed by the current governor , charlie crist , at the same time that statewide budget cuts threatened to remove 100 million from the system s coffers gov crist has , however , reversed his opposition to a differential tuition raise of 15 percent for three of the state s research universities confused yet \? i am but things clarified a bit on july 10 when the board of governors , sometimes called the somnolent overseers , woke up and took three actions that amounted to laying down a gauntlet first , the board joined graham s suit , thereby defying the legislature second , the board voted for a 5 percent tuition increase , thereby defying the governor third , the board froze enrollment at current levels , thereby defying everyone , including , potentially , parents with children in high school moreover , the board did these things despite warnings issued at the meeting by two state legislators who serve on the house and senate higher education appropriations committees these actions did not come out of the blue carolyn k roberts , chairwoman of the board , fired a warning shot in an oped in the st petersburg times in june by every indicator , she wrote , florida falls behind in higher education mark rosenberg , chancellor of the state university system , brought a background and options paper to the july 10 meeting , documenting in detail how bad things are \( lowest tuition and highest studentfaculty ratio in the country \) after their vote , board members braced themselves for a firestorm of criticism but except for a dyspeptic threat by senate president ken pruitt \( see you in court \) none arrived instead , state newspapers published editorials with titles like at long last and universities' board right what does it all mean \? the hope is that it means the beginning of the realization of the goal announced in 1980 by graham , who called for a thrust for greatness and the building of a worldclass university system more easily said than done at present , as rosenberg and his board know , florida is not even in the second tier of university systems in this country florida does not have a single campus that measures up to the best schools in the systems of virginia , wisconsin and georgia , nevermind firsttier states like california , michigan and north carolina climbing that hill will be an arduous task , and the key will be a persistence few states are up to the conditions that leave a university system depressed have been a long time in the making and will take time to reverse five straight years of steadily increased funding , tuition raises and highprofile faculty hires would send a message that something really serious is happening ten more years of the same , and it might actually happen
news of the death of the philosopher richard rorty on june 8 came as i was reading about a small brazilian tribe that the french anthropologist claude l vistrauss studied in the 1930s a strange accident , a haphazard juxtaposition but for a moment this pragmatist philosopher and a fading tribal culture glanced against each other , revealing something unusual about the contemporary scene mr rorty was one of america s foremost philosophers , who in midcareer , after devoting himself to the rigors of analytic philosophy , decided that it is impossible to step outside our skins the traditions , linguistic and other , within which we do our thinking and selfcriticism he argued that we are always dealing with multiple and conflicting claims of truth , none of which can be conclusively established we choose what to believe based on what is useful for us to believe for mr rorty , the importance of democracy is that it creates a liberal society in which rival truth claims can compete and accommodate each other his pragmatism was postmodern , tolerant to a fault , its moral and progressive conclusions never appealing to a higher authority but the caduveo of brazil would not have welcomed that kind of allinclusive embrace , and probably that embrace would not have been so readily offered to them when mr l vistrauss wrote about this dwindling tribe in tristes tropiques , his fascinating 1955 memoir , he compared these knightly indians with their aristocratic arrogance to a deck of european playing cards they even looked the parts of jacks , kings and queens , he wrote , with their cloaks and tunics decorated in red and black with recurrent motifs resembling hearts , diamonds , spades and clubs the tribal queens , mr l vistrauss noted , even seemed to trump lewis carroll s imagined queen of hearts with their taste for playing with severed heads brought back by warriors the caduveo , in mr l vistrauss s description , would never have considered for a moment that their beliefs and their society were arbitrarily constructed the caduveo had all the presumption and selfimportance of royalty they tattooed their bodies with elaborate asymmetric arabesques that served as coats of arms and signs of status their leaders removed every bit of facial hair , including eyelashes , and sneered at hairy europeans they even intimidated their spanish and portuguese conquerors they were , then , preliberal , premodern in their midst every principle mr rorty valued was violated they provided their own transcendent authority and demanded its universal recognition a neighboring , related tribe essentially became their serfs , cultivating land and turning over produce the caduveo founding myth recounts that , lacking other gifts at the moment of creation , the tribe was given the divine right to exploit and dominate others mr l vistrauss once suggested that the indian tribes of the americas were like peoples of the middle ages , lacking the example of rome but the caduveo , in his descriptions , are more like nobility from the 17th to mid18th century , lacking the example of either the american or french revolutions but there was also something else about this tribe that drew mr l vistrauss s attention it was a society remarkably adverse to feelings that we consider as being natural its members disliked having children abortion and infanticide were so common that the only way the tribe itself could continue was by adoption , and adoption more properly called abduction was traditionally implemented through warfare the tribal disdain for nature extended into its active denigration of hair , agriculture , childbirth and even , perhaps , representational art in all of this the tribe was proclaiming that while its dominance derived from nature and was beyond question , its superiority meant that nature had no further claim on it everything else was created by the tribe itself , particularly the ornate and elaborate tattoos and paintings on members' bodies in this respect the tribe was not countercultural but counternatural it refused to defer to external forces or commands in mr l vistrauss s telling the caduveo actually take on a strangely postmodern flavor , shedding the very idea of natural law or constraints even mr rorty might have found his sympathies touched he once suggested that science had been established by modern man to fill the place once held by god but that it did n't merit that position it should be seen , mr rorty said , as having the same footing as literature or art , and he suggested that physics and ethics were just differing methods of trying to cope the caduveo might have agreed , as long as they were permitted to determine which methods of coping were used but what place would such a society have in a rortian democratic landscape \? how would they be answered if their claims to divine right and arbitrary power came in direct conflict with the more embracing arbitrariness of mr rorty s vision \? in reasoning one s way into pragmatism , in minimizing the importance of natural constraints and in dismissing the notion of some larger truth , the tendency is to assume that as different as we all are , we are at least prepared to accommodate ourselves to one another but this is not something the caduveo would necessarily have gone along with mr rorty s outline of what he called the utopian possibilities of the future does n't leave much room for the kind of threat the caduveo might pose , let alone other threats , still active in the world one tendency of pragmatism might be to so focus on the ways in which one s own worldview is flawed that trauma is more readily attributed to internal failure than to external challenges in one of his last interviews mr rorty recalled the events of 9 11 when i heard the news about the twin towers , my first thought was oh , god bush will use this the way hitler used the reichstag fire' if that really was his first thought , it reflects a certain amount of reluctance to comprehend forces lying beyond the boundaries of his familiar world , an inability fully to imagine what confrontations over truth might look like , possibly even a resistance to stepping outside of one s skin or mental habits but in this too the caduveo example may be suggestive as mr l vistrauss points out , neighboring brazilian tribes were as hierarchical as the caduveo but lacked the tribe s sweeping fanaticism in rejecting the natural world they reached differing forms of accommodation with their surroundings the caduveo , refusing even to procreate , did n't have a chance they survive now as sedentary farmers such a fate of denatured inconsequence may eventually be shared by absolutist postmodernism the caduveo s ideas were n't useful , perhaps some were n't even true
one issue spurring leaders in division iii of the to lobby for a realignment is the belief that the membership could expand to almost 600 from 420 in as little as 10 years a frequently voiced worry is that the national association of intercollegiate athletics , a smaller sports organization that lost more than 125 members to the ncaa in the 1980s and '90s , will dissolve more than a dozen college presidents and administrators from national collegiate athletic association institutions said in recent interviews that the naia s financial wellbeing was a factor in their support for splitting division iii soon , before it is overrun none , however , said they had specific knowledge of the naia s solvency division ii , which , like the naia , permits member colleges and universities to award a limited number of athletic scholarships , is also seen as a destination for defecting naia members there has always been the thought that if enough naia schools leave , it will reach a tipping point and then the naia contributes dozens of schools to the ncaa , said steve ulrich , executive director of the ncaa s centennial conference the naia traces its history to the late 1930s and once had more than 450 institutions it now has 282 as schools leave , the amount of money from dues collected by the naia s central office goes down , said andrew zimbalist , an economics professor at smith college but the central office must continue to maintain the same level of activities and competition , so they are on a vicious cycle and that does inevitably lead to questions about the naia s solvency executives at the naia were surprised to hear there was so much apprehension about the association s future i appreciate the concern , but we have a pretty solid picture of where we stand financially , said john leavens , the naia s vice president for membership i feel pretty good about where we are and where we plan to go we 're not making any plans to dissolve , i can tell you that jim carr , the naia president , called discussions about its financial prospects a misinformed rumor he said the naia operated at a surplus the past seven years we 're not bringing in 600 million , but we 're not spending more than we get either , he said leavens conceded that from the late 1980s to the mid1990s , the naia was losing members to the ncaa at a high rate sometimes as many as 30 colleges a year but leavens said that the rate of attrition had slowed considerably and that the naia had a net loss of one member last year because some institutions left but a few transferred from the ncaa he added that the naia was the economical choice , saying that on average naia institutions had athletic budgets half as large as those in ncaa s division ii
whatever exuberance toyota and its teams brought to daytona international speedway in february for the seasonopening race is long gone so is the fear that toyota , the first foreign brand to compete in s premier series since the 1950s , would come into the nextel cup this year with an open wallet and buy its way into victory lane the reality of toyota s first season has set in , complete with stumbles and missteps that few could have imagined forget about winning with none of toyota s contingent of seven drivers on three teams locked into the top 35 in points and thus guaranteed a starting spot in the 43car field each week , toyota cannot even buy its way into a race there s not a team with the toyota mark on it that is real proud of their program , ty norris , general manager at michael waltrip racing , told reporters at richmond international raceway in virginia earlier this month we all have a lot of work to do the best thing we know is we 're with the right manufacturer we 're in the right place we just have to hold our breaths to see if we can get through the year that is what it has come to 11 races into the 36race first season for toyota and its teams holding their breath and holding out hope that a breakthrough will come and they can be competitive at some point maybe it will happen sunday at the cocacola 600 at lowe s motor speedway in north carolina toyota is supplying an upgraded engine for its teams , and perhaps that will be the difference between securing a spot on the starting grid or going home after failing to qualify , as many toyota drivers have done this season toyota has yet to place all seven of its drivers in a points race this year the best it has managed is five , at bristol motor speedway in tennessee , with its lowest being two , at las vegas the annual allstar challenge on saturday night at lowe s was the first time since the qualifying races before the daytona 500 that all toyota drivers competed in the same week although kevin harvick took home the 1 million winner s check in his no 29 chevrolet , dale jarrett was 12th and brian vickers 13th among the toyotas , with the others racing in the preliminary nextel open they will all be back to the qualifying grind this week , facing the likelihood that several toyota teams will not make the field for the 600 this is not what toyota had in mind when it planned its entry into the nextel cup i think that over all we would have thought that things would have been better than where we are at this particular stage , jim aust , president and chief executive of toyota racing development , said in a telephone interview the competition is extremely high in the cup series and i guess that is what everybody is talking about this has been a particularly trying year for a new manufacturer to try to step into the nextel cup there are as many as 49 fully financed and other partly financed teams competing for 43 spots each week and every team has been forced to divide time and money developing the current car and the new car of tomorrow , the nascardesigned racecar being phased in this year week to week , they are missing races by only a fraction of a second only bill davis racing , an established team led by the driver dave blaney , has had meaningful success with toyota blaney has made 10 of 11 races and competed with the leaders at times , but he is 37th in points , in part because of bad luck he has been getting caught up in crashes caused by other drivers meanwhile , his teammate jeremy mayfield has failed to qualify in 8 of 11 races it is the same for the other toyota teams team red bull , with the drivers brian vickers and a j allmendinger , has struggled , with each driver missing more than half of the races this year , although vickers has toyota s only top10 finish this year , at california both missed the daytona 500 when you go to the biggest race of the year , the daytona 500 , and your cars are n't in it , it s a gutwrenching experience to pack up and go home , team red bull s general manager , marty gaunt , said in a recent telephone interview but team red bull has fared better than michael waltrip racing , the signature toyota team going into the season the threecar team features waltrip , the twotime daytona 500 winner and face of team toyota , as well as the 1999 points champion , dale jarrett , and the rookie david reutimann reutimann has had some success , making 8 of 11 races jarrett has used up six champion s provisionals guaranteeing him a spot in the field , and he has failed to qualify for the past two races as his highly respected crew chief , matt borland , left the team rather than be reassigned it has been an embarrassing season for waltrip an illegal fuel additive was found in his racecar at daytona and nascar came down hard , fining him 100 , 000 and suspending his crew chief , david hyder , and the vice president for competition , bobby kennedy waltrip was also fined 100 driver and owner points although waltrip made the field for the daytona 500 , he has not raced in a cup points event since he is 0 for 10 in qualifying and is at minus27 in the points race we 're just starting , waltrip said during a recent test session at lowe s give us a little bit of chance to figure out who we are and which way we 're heading it has not been much better off the track for waltrip , who was cited for reckless driving and failing to report an accident when he was involved in a crash in sherrills ford , nc , in april norris , the general manager , has denied speculation that sponsors are looking to bail out as for toyota , it is showing patience with waltrip and the rest after all , toyota is still winning where it really counts fortunately , the car side of our business has been very good , very strong , aust said and we 're fortunate , i guess , that the nascar performance has not been detracting from the sales of our cars as well
the ' president , john mara , typically affable and approachable , increasingly avoided reporters as the team s season deteriorated he knew that tough decisions were coming , and that he was about to begin shaping his true legacy for days , if not weeks , mara has mulled the most important decisions of his career what makes them more difficult is that he is doing so without his father before wellington mara died in october 2005 , every key move that john mara made from hiring as coach in 2004 to raising ticket prices needed his father s approval john mara ran the team s daytoday operations for years his father , who coowned the franchise for 75 years , provided the steady hand from the office that john mara now uses yesterday passed without word about the intentions of mara , whose family coowns the team , and the brothers steve and jonathan tisch , whose family owns the other half the giants are deciding whether to retain coughlin , and who would take his place if they fire him they must decide on a general manager to replace the retiring ernie accorsi they must determine which move should be made first , or if they should be made simultaneously most teams allow a general manager to choose a coach , but the giants are likely to decide coughlin s fate first they do not want to leave coughlin , his assistants and their families in limbo one possibility is that the decisions about coughlin and the general manager will be announced together , as early as today , a likely possibility if the giants promote one of their four internal generalmanager candidates after the giants' 2320 playoff loss to the philadelphia eagles on sunday , mara said he would have something to say in the middle of the week the passing of time would seem a good sign for coughlin and a bad one for his assistant coaches if coughlin 2523 in three seasons , and 02 in the playoffs is fired , there is little reason it will not happen quickly if he keeps his job , it is likely that giants ownership will require him to shuffle his assistants , a reasonable cause for the delay coughlin s contract runs through next season if he returns , he will probably receive a short extension , mostly to help hire assistants who otherwise may be hesitant to work for a coach in the final year of a contract with each passing hour , the spotlight on the giants burns brighter , as fans and reporters look for the proverbial puffs of smoke to rise from the team s offices on the north side of giants stadium none of it can be easy on mara , a softspoken 52yearold with an aversion to attention just a couple of months ago , he had no reason to anticipate these decisions the giants were 62 , and accorsi s replacement seemed likely to come from within by all signs , the franchise was moving in the proper direction mara sat in his office during an october interview with the new york times it took 10 months after his father died for mara to bring himself to move in he left everything virtually unchanged mara joked about his credentials for his job he picked the right parents , he said , and had the good sense to be born first he said he guided the giants largely by considering what his father would do i always think that way , mara said i agreed on most things , but not necessarily everything it is a little bit of a different age that we 're in right now , but i'm always conscious of what his standards were it is probably why mara is reluctant to keep coughlin twisting in uncertainty until a general manager is found but the decision on coughlin is complex on many levels , not the least of which was wellington mara s approval in the decision to hire coughlin three years ago it was john mara and accorsi , not wellington mara , who interviewed coughlin then , after the team fired jim fassel they also interviewed the nfl assistants charlie weis , romeo crennel and lovie smith , who went on to become head coaches elsewhere there were certain decisions you did n't dare make unless you consulted him first and got his ok , john mara said of his father , in october the hiring of tom coughlin was one of those but john mara is being forced to make different decisions than his father faced he already helped negotiate the deals that will culminate in a 12 billion stadium that the giants and jets will share at the meadowlands , a stadium his father did not think was entirely necessary he knows that the tenures of coaches and players are growing shorter , in line with the attention span of fans he was always a big proponent of resigning our own players , mara said we differed on that there were certain players i felt over the years that he could have let go , and he , emotionally , never wanted to do that john mara is haunted by the memory of seeing his father hanged in effigy by unhappy fans at giants stadium in the lean seasons of the 1970s it has spooked him from the spotlight and driven him to build a champion yet john mara has never been the focus of public criticism this season , coughlin was the popular target of animosity when things soured accorsi has also taken some hits for the team he assembled mara has avoided that it is about to change he has spent most of the past two days in his office , talking to the tisches , figuring out his options , deciding what to do the mara and tisch families each hold one vote on significant decisions , and it is unclear what would happen if they disagreed outside giants stadium , there does not seem to be a majority opinion no matter what decisions are made , criticism will come from many directions and it will increase if they appear to be the wrong ones in the next few months or years from the office of his father , john mara is about to begin shaping his legacy
qalai sayedan , , july 9 with their teacher absent , 10 students were allowed to leave school early these were the girls the gunmen saw first , 10 easy targets walking handinhand through the blue metal gate and on to the winding dirt road the staccato of machinegun fire pelted through the stillness a 13yearold named shukria was hit in the arm and the back , and then teetered into the soft brown of an adjacent wheat field zarmina , her 12yearold sister , ran to her side , listening to the wounded girl s precious breath and trying to help her stand but shukria was too heavy to lift , and the two gunmen , sitting astride a single motorbike , sped closer as zarmina scurried away , the men took a more studied aim at those they already had shot , killing shukria with bullets to her stomach and heart then the attackers seemed to succumb to the frenzy they had begun , forsaking the motorbike and fleeing on foot in a panic , two bobbing heads one tucked into a helmet , the other swaddled by a handkerchief vanishing amid the earthen color of the wheat six students were shot here on the afternoon of june 12 , two of them fatally the qalai sayedan school considered among the very best in the central afghan province of logar reopened only last weekend , but even with kalashnikovtoting guards at the gate , only a quarter of the 1 , 600 students have dared to return shootings , beheadings , burnings and bombings these are all tools of intimidation used by the and others to shut down hundreds of afghanistan s public schools to take aim at education is to make war on the government parents are left with peculiar choices it is better for my children to be alive even if it means they must be illiterate , said sayed rasul , a father who had decided to keep his two daughters at home for a day afghanistan surely has made some progress toward development , but most often the nation seems astride some pitiable rocking horse , with each lurch forward inevitably reversed by the backward spring of harsh reality the schools are one vivid example the ministry of education claims that 62 million children are now enrolled , or about half the schoolage population and while statistics in afghanistan can be unreliably confected , there is no doubt that attendance has multiplied far beyond that of any earlier time , with uniformed children now teeming through the streets each day , flooding classrooms in two and three shifts a third of these students are girls , a marvel itself historically , girls' education has been undervalued in afghan culture girls and women were forbidden from school altogether during the taliban rule but after 30 years of war , this is a country without normal times to reclaim in so many ways , afghanistan must start from scratch the accelerating demand for education is mocked by the limited supply more than half the schools have no buildings , according to the ministry of education classes are commonly held in tents or beneath trees or in the brutal , sunsoaked openness only 20 percent of the teachers are even minimally qualified texts are outdated hundreds of titles need to be written , and millions of books need to be printed and then there is the violence in the southern provinces where the taliban are most aggressively combating american and nato troops , education has virtually come to a halt in large swaths of the contested regions in other areas , attacks against schools are sporadic , unpredictable and perplexing by the ministry s estimate , there have been 444 attacks since last august some of these were simple thefts some were instances of tents put to the torch some were audacious murders under the noon sun by attacking schools , the terrorists want to make the point of their own existence , said mohammad hanif atmar , the minister of education westerneducated and notably energetic , mr atmar is the nation s fifth education minister in five and a half years , but only the first to command the solid enthusiasm of international donors much of the government is awash in corruption and cronyism but mr atmar comes to the job after a muchpraised showing as the minister of rural redevelopment he has laid out an ambitious fiveyear plan for school construction , teacher training and a modernized curriculum he is also championing a parallel track of madrasas , or religious schools students would focus on islamic studies while also pursuing science , math and the arts this society needs faithbased education , and we will be happy to provide it without teaching violence and the abuse of human rights , mr atmar said to succeed , the minister must prove a magnet for foreign cash and donors have not been unusually generous when it comes to schools since the fall of the taliban , the united states agency for international development has devoted only 5 percent of its afghanistan budget to education , compared with 30 percent for roads and 14 percent for power virtually every afghan school is a sketchbook of extraordinary destitution i have 68 girls sitting in this tent , said nafisa wardak , a firstgrade teacher at the deh araban qaragha school in kabul we 're hot the tent is full of flies the wind blows sand and garbage everywhere if a child gets sick , where can i send her \? the nation s overwhelming need for walled classrooms makes the killings in qalai sayedan all the more tragic the school welcomed boys through grade 6 and girls through grade 12 it was terribly overcrowded , with the 1 , 600 students , attending in two shifts , stuffed into 12 classrooms and a corridor but the building itself was exactly that two stories of concrete with a roof of galvanized steel , and not a collection of weathermolested tents two years ago , qalai sayedan was named the top school in the province its principal , bibi gul , was saluted for excellence and rewarded with a trip to america but last month s attack on the school caused parents to wonder if the school s stalwart reputation had not itself become a source of provocation qalai sayedan is 40 miles south of kabul , and while a dozen other schools in logar province have been attacked , none has been as regularly , or malignly , singled out three years ago , qalai sayedan was struck by rockets during the night a year ago , explosives tore off a corner of the building in the embassies of the west , and even within the education ministry in kabul , the taliban are commonly discussed as a monolithic adversary but to the villagers here , with the lives of their children at risk , it is too simplistic to assume the attacks were merely part of some broad campaign of terror people see the government s enemies as a varied lot with assorted grievances , assorted tribal connections and assorted masters villagers ask , has anyone at the school provided great offense \? is the school believed to be unislamic \? at the village mosque , many men blame ms gul , the principal she should not have gone to america without the consultation of the community , said sayed abdul sami , the uncle of saadia , the other slain student and she went to america without a mahram , a male relative to accompany her , and this is considered improper in islam sayed enayatullah hashimi , a whitebearded elder , said the school had flaunted its success too openly the governor paid it a visit , he said disparagingly he brought with him 20 bodyguards , and these men went all over the school even among the older girls education is the fast track to modernity and modernity is held with suspicion off the main highway , 100 yards up the winding dirt road and through the blue metal gate , sits the school it was built four years ago by the german government on monday , ms gul greeted hundreds of children as they fidgeted in the morning light dear boys and brave girls , thank you for coming the enemy has done its evil deeds , but we will never allow the doors of this school to close again these would be among her final moments as their principal she had already resigned my heart is crying , she said privately but i must leave because of everything that people say they say i received letters warning about the attacks but that is n't so and people say i am a foreigner because i went to the united states without a mahram we were 12 people i'm 42 years old i do n't need to travel with a mahram in the village , she wears a burqa , enveloped head to toe in lavender fabric this is a conservative place for some , the very idea of girls attending school into their teens is a breach of tradition shukria , the slain 13yearold , was considered a polite girl who reverently studied the koran saadia , the other student killed , was remarkable in that she was married and 25 she had refused to let age discourage her from finishing an education interrupted by the taliban years she was about to graduate a new sign now sits atop the steel roof the qalai sayedan school has been renamed the martyred saadia school another place will be called martyred shukria for three days now , students have been asked to return to class each morning , more of them appear older girls and women are quite clearly the most reluctant to return shukria s home is only a short walk from the school nafiza , the girl s mother , was still too scalded with grief to mutter more than a few words shukria s uncle , shir agha , took on the role of family spokesman we have a saying that if you go to school , you can find yourself , and if you can find yourself , you can find god , he said proudly but for a child to attend school , there must be security who supplies that security \? zarmina , the 12yearold who had seen her sister killed , was called into the room she was not ready to return to school , she said even the sound of a motorbike now made her hide but surely the fear would subside , her uncle reassured her she must remember that she loves school , that she loves to read , that she loves to scribble words on paper someday , she would surely resume her studies , he told her but the heartbroken girl could not yet imagine this never , she said

the eyes of all members of congress were aimed toward the front of the house chamber when president bush began his state of the union address none , perhaps , were trained more enviously than those of the gaggle of senators democrats and republicans alike who aspire to be delivering the address in three years the eyes of photographers , though , were pointed toward the crop of prospective presidential candidates senator hillary rodham clinton was sitting one row ahead of senator barack obama in recent days , they have taken good care to not cross one another s path on the senate floor , but tonight they had no choice but to follow an assigned seating chart that practically placed them within arm s reach as they walked into the house chamber , mrs clinton was about 10 paces ahead of mr obama both senators received warm embraces from the represenatives that lined the aisle they both shook hands of the administration s top military officials general peter pace , chairman of the joint chiefs , and three other advisers as they made their way to their seats senator john kerry drew a better seating assignment than either of his two prospective democratic rivals he sat on the aisle seniority has its advantages and applauded when mr bush came in other possible presidential candidates in the house chamber included republican senators john mccain and sam brownback and , of course , back on the democratic side , representative dennis kucinich
it was the ninth of august , summer of 2003 , when beat in a semifinal in montreal it s about time , roddick said that day , smiling at his own audacity no one beats me five times in a row roddick can be a funny dude , full of sardonic asides while coping with spending his career bumping into federer in major tournaments since that day in 2003 , federer has now beaten roddick 10 consecutive times , including last night s quarterfinal at the united states open , when federer edged roddick , 76 , \( 5 \) 76 \( 4 \) , 62 , a match so close that it left roddick tense at serving so well and still losing in straight sets i did n't make mistakes , he said i'm not walking off with any questions roddick generally walks the fine line between being what no athlete at this exalted level wants to be the proverbial good sport and the kind of cranky loser that serena williams was on tuesday night roddick has been equal parts respectful and remorseful while running up a record that is now 114 against federer in official tournaments he did beat federer in the final of an exhibition in melbourne early this year , but that does not count for much none of this has been easy for andrew stephen roddick , who totally understood that it was not a terrible tragedy to play his heart out in a full arena in a quarterfinal of the open i 'd have to be completely out of touch not to realize that and appreciate it , he said afterward roddick does not have the hustler s patience of brad gilbert , his coach for that memorable match in 2003 , or the monomaniacal gall of jimmy connors , his current coach if naughty jimbo had run into a serene force like federer during his estimable career , he would have aggressed the gracious swiss or upended the potted flowers at center court or bent the rules about bathroom breaks or trainer visits , just to disrupt the flow jimbo is older and wiser now , sitting in roddick s box last night and looking conservative of dress and demeanor he knows roddick will not pull any of his patented disruptive stuff he urges roddick to concentrate , to play hard , but it s not easy although roddick is still relatively one dimensional , throwing serves 10 miles per hour faster than federer s , he does have topfive skills still , he finds himself locked outside the rivalry between federer and rafael nadal now , with the aching nadal bounced out tuesday night , there is busyhaired and versatile novak djokovic looking to invade that rivalry three in a marriage , as diana , princess of wales once said in a context decidedly not about tennis that leaves roddick to confront his own place in the world , often with a smirk and a comeback as quick as federer returning his serve the other day , a sportswriter suggested that because of defaults by two injured opponents , roddick had not yet found his emotional rhythm in this tournament you sound like my therapist , roddick said the other night when tomas berdych had to default , roddick admitted , then , of course , i'm trying to eavesdrop on his whole conversation he s having with the trainer one reporter said berdych was having trouble breathing yeah , that s what i heard , roddick added that makes tennis difficult the transcripts from federerroddick outings , courtesy of , demonstrate that roddick has been mostly a mensch , an adult , even after his worst moments immediately after the 64 , 60 , 62 83minute drubbing by federer in this year s australian semifinal , roddick used words like frustrating , miserable and terrible , and even earthier than that besides that , it was fine , he added asked after that match whether he would read about it the next day , roddick replied , probably not but it s kind of tough , though i read the sports section every day of my life i'm going to kind of have to like maneuver my way around it somehow like get an oversized coffee mug , kind of like smoke and mirrors or something when roddick lost to federer in the finals at the us open last year , he said , he s the best player in the game there s no question in my mind or if you ask any player s mind about that after the threeset loss in the wimbledon final in 2005 , roddick said , you know , listen , i want another crack at him till my record is 131 and he added , he s the measuring stick , so you kind of know where you are and where you go i still want to go against him again you want to compete against the best roddick also volunteered i have loads of respect for him , as a person as well i told him , i 've told him before , 'i 'd love to hate you , but you 're really nice' is n't there something negative about federer \? i'm sure there is , but i do n't know if i know him that well , roddick said , adding , i can look into it for you to date , he has come up with nothing but in showing respect for federer , roddick has earned respect for himself
for the first 16 minutes , it looked like memphis spent too much time out on bourbon street last night the tigers were sluggish , their offense impotent and north texas was improbably controlling the game the mean green played harder , crashed the boards and played with the verve of a team poised to pull an upset then memphis woke up and reminded all of us that there s a galactic talent gap between no 2 seeds and no 15 seeds memphis finished the first half with a flourish that drained most of the hope out of new orleans arena the tigers finished on a 90 run to take a 3728 lead into halftime \( memphis went on to win the game , 7358 , with tiger coach john calipari claiming north texas as the best no 15 seed in tournament history \) this came after north texas controlled a majority of the first half and led by as many as six points the 6foot9 memphis forward robert dozier highlighted the 90 flurry with a block of the north texas guard kendrick davis s shot and then finishing with an alleyoop on the other end \( not only does memphis have the better team , but they also have a distinct homecourt advantage as it is only about a 5hour drive to new orleans from memphis \) the 16minute nap still leaves questions about memphis , which entered the game as the tournament s most enigmatic team the tigers have 30 wins , but none of them are the signature variety they also have three good losses this would not be a good loss but memphis woke up and looks like it is poised to roll their longterm potential is now the bigger question
beirut , a powerful car bomb killed one of lebanon s top generals and his bodyguard in a suburb of beirut on wednesday , striking an unexpected blow at the country s most widely respected institution and further undermining lebanon s precarious stability the army officer , brig gen fran ois alhajj , was killed when a bomb under a parked blue bmw sedan exploded as he drove past on his way to work at the defense ministry general hajj , 54 , was a top contender to succeed gen michel suleiman , the army chief who is poised to become the country s next president he was also the operational commander during the threemonth battle over the summer against islamic militants holed up in a refugee camp in northern lebanon whether it was intended as a political message or as revenge , the blast underscored the persistence of the bitter political confrontation that has crippled the government during the past year the crisis has deepened since nov 23 , when mile lahoud stepped down at the end of his term as president without any agreement on a successor a solution seemed possible two weeks ago when the major political groups agreed to support general suleiman as president but since then political negotiations have foundered , with leaders disagreeing over procedure and the makeup of the next government if the lawmakers do not elect general suleiman by the end of the year , they may be forced to wait until midmarch lebanese law limits the calendar sessions for amending the constitution a necessary first step before an army chief can be allowed to become president the killing reverberated far beyond lebanon condemnations poured in from the united states , iran , syria , france and germany factions from across the lebanese spectrum deplored the assassination , including hezbollah , which called it a great national loss the army , which splintered during the 15year civil war , has in recent years been viewed as the one neutral institution in a country whose leaders are deeply divided over ideology , foreign patrons and their share of power the explosion , which also wounded six people , took place about 7 am in baabda , an eastern suburb , on a mountainous road overlooking the city that the general regularly took to work the blast , caused by what an army spokesman described as a 77pound bomb that was placed under a car parked on the street , set other cars on fire and left a hole six feet wide in the ground in its aftermath , scores of soldiers could be seen milling around the blackened ruins of a car some wept openly security men searched for body parts in the valley below the road it was a scary scene , said tony deeb , who works at a nearby supermarket people started running and screaming i saw a man walking with blood coming down his face , cars on fire , others were shattered and smoke filled the area some leading antisyrian politicians blamed damascus for the killing , as they have for a series of political assassinations during the past three years they pointed to comments made tuesday by the syrian vice president , farouq sharaa , who said that syria s friends in lebanon were stronger than ever and that no one in lebanon , even with foreign support , can win the battle against syria syria has denied any role in previous assassinations in lebanon , and on wednesday the syrian foreign minister , walid almoallem , denounced the criminal attack on general hajj , saying , we condemn any action that threatens lebanon none of the previous assassinations were aimed at the army , which has remained neutral during the past year s political crisis some speculation focused on the possibility of revenge by fatah al islam , the jihadist group that lost a bitter fight against the army in the refugee camp but one senior lebanese army official said the methods used in the bombing were too sophisticated for fatah al islam the way the bomb was placed rules out the possibility of a personal account , the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the news media it requires infiltration , someone who is familiar with the area and knows what time the general leaves his house every day instead , the official said , the bombing could be related to behindthescenes negotiations between the parliamentary majority and the opposition which is supported by syria and iran over the successor of general suleiman as top army commander members of the americanbacked parliamentary majority , known as the march 14 alliance , said general hajj had been their preferred candidate for army chief a broad hint that the assassination was aimed at them but michel aoun , a christian leader in the opposition alliance backed by syria and iran , disputed that , saying he too supported general hajj , with whom he had been close since mr aoun was himself the top army commander in the late 1980s those recriminations seemed likely to lessen the chances of electing a new president , which have grown dimmer in recent days members of the majority accuse the opposition of deliberately obstructing the effort they have begun talking again about the possibility of electing a president on a simplemajority basis , a move that would infuriate the opposition opposition members say they want a broader agreement about the cabinet before agreeing to make general suleiman president if you want to elect a president , you must protect him by providing a vision , said ibrahim kanaan , a legislator with mr aoun s party to elect general suleiman without making further agreements , mr kanaan said , would be to replicate the situation under mr lahoud , an ally of syria who lacked the support of the parliamentary majority in his last years in office and was therefore largely powerless
twentytwo united states opens and counting that s how long it s been since a lefthanded player last held the men s singles title let s really think about how much time has passed since john mcenroe lost his title to ivan lendl in 1985 today s best lefty , the threetime french open champion rafael nadal , wasn t alive the soviet union still existed ronald reagan was in the first year of his second presidential term no one had ever heard of a tennis blog nadal , seeded no 2 , is certainly the favorite to eventually end this drought , but much has been made of his vulnerability on hard courts , with good reason he has lost twice on hard courts this year to novak djokovic , the serb who s seeded third there s also a clutch of other players lleyton hewitt , james blake , tomas berdych and mikhail youznhy , to name just four who have shown they can handle nadal on hard courts and it s doubtful that the other notable lefties in the men s draw fernando verdasco , donald young and jarkko nieminen can win the title so we ll probably have another righthanded champion \( nadal won t count he may be a righty off the court but on court he s all lefty \) it s a long way from 197484 , when a lefty won the men s title every year the story isn t much different on the women s side no lefthander has won the title since monica seles captured the second of her two open titles in 1992 the lefties patty schnyder , sybille bammer , and lucie safarova are seeded among the top 20 players this year , and all are considered dangerous and capable of pulling off an upset but they aren t given much of a chance \( none , really \) of winning seven straight matches in a grand slam tournament and taking the title well , let s lower the bar a little maybe a lefty can at least make it to the final but considering that it has been 10 years on the men s side \( greg rusedski \) and 11 on the women s side \( monica seles \) since that happened , don t count on it

the 28yearold b dard described himself as an average joe from navan , which is about 15 miles east of ottawa he likes to do normal stuff , like fish and play golf his native language is french before switching to norwalk , he briefly attended la cit coll giale , a college in ottawa that does not have a baseball team , either he seemed amazed that a reporter would inquire about his personal life , adding that during interviews , he preferred to talk about his career , which has been marked by highs and lows in his first year at norwalk , in 1998 , b dard helped the panthers , a team that no longer exists because the college dismantled its athletic program in 2001 , win the national junior college athletic association division iii world series he was n't physically overwhelming , and he was always quiet , said curtis antrum , norwalk s former athletic director and its current associate director of admissions but when it came time for baseball , the kid was accurate to be honest with you , we thought he would move on to a division i college nobody thought he was going to get drafted b dard s fastball jumped about 10 mph during his year and a half in norwalk , quickly attracting the attention of major league scouts he was selected by the orioles in the sixth round of the 1999 draft and pitched in the minors for three seasons before making his major league debut on april 17 , 2002 two months later , he blew out his left elbow while pitching for an orioles affiliate , an injury that required reconstructive surgery and kept him out of baltimore s rotation for a season and a half initially , you always think that s it , baseball s over , said b dard , who added that if his career had ended , he probably would have returned to navan and worked with his father and his brother as an elevator mechanic after an arduous rehabilitation program , b dard went 610 in 2004 and 68 in 2005 , a season in which he was sidelined for about two months with a knee injury he went relatively unnoticed last season despite a 1511 record b dard said he did not recall a point this season when he realized he was better than ever it just happened gradually , he said , adding that he had no clue how much better he could be whatever happens , happens , b dard said when asked about his career goals sometimes when you put a goal , you try too hard for it so goals are overrated for me on july 7 , b dard struck out 15 texas rangers thirteen days later , he allowed one hit over seven innings against the oakland athletics the orioles' vice president for baseball operations , jim duquette , said he was not surprised by b dard s accomplishments this season i think his stubbornness makes him a good pitcher , duquette said maybe he stands out with his takeitorleaveit attitude with the media but he s his own guy duquette will have a problem on his hands if b dard continues to pitch well the orioles , in fourth place in the american league east , are already under pressure to give b dard , who is slated to become a free agent after the 2009 season , a longterm contract extension he is making 34 million this season but could command four times that amount on the open market b dard remained noncommittal when asked whether he wanted to become a free agent , saying his agent would handle the details if b dard wants advice , he will probably turn to his family , with whom he remains close his parents have not seen him pitch in person this season , but they speak with him nearly every day it s overwhelming , to say the least , b dard s mother said with a laugh when asked about his breakout season we hear so much about him in the newspapers right now that everybody calls us and says , did you see about you son \? ' it s exciting , but it s something none of us are used to
he said that there were no homosexuals in not one and that the nazi slaughter of six million jews should not be treated as fact , but theory , and therefore open to debate and more research , the president of iran , aired these and other bewildering thoughts in a twohour verbal contest at columbia university today , providing some ammunition to those who said there was no point in inviting him to speak yet his appearance also offered evidence of why he is admired in the developing world for his defiance toward western , especially american , power in repeated clashes with his hosts , mr ahmadinejad accused the united states of supporting terrorist groups , and characterized as hypocritical american and european efforts to rein in iran s nuclear ambitions his speech at columbia , in advance of his planned speech on tuesday at the united nations , produced a day of intense protests and counterprotests around the campus on the upper west side of manhattan if you have created the fifth generation of atomic bombs and are testing them already , who are you to question other people who just want nuclear power , mr ahmadinejad said , adding , pointedly i think the politicians who are after atomic bombs , politically , they 're backwards retarded it was a performance at once both defiant he said iran could not recognize israel because it is based on ethnic discrimination , occupation and usurpation , and it consistently threatens its neighbors and conciliatory he said he wanted to visit ground zero to show my respect for what he called a tragic event and he said that even if the holocaust did occur , the should not pay the price for it he began the afternoon on the defensive lee bollinger , the president of columbia , under intense attack for the invitation one protester outside the auditorium passed out fliers that said , bollinger , too bad bin laden is not available opened the event with a 10minute verbal assault on mr ahmadinejad mr president , you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator , mr bollinger said , adding , you are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated the iranian president , who was seated 10 feet away from mr bollinger on the stage , wore a frozen smile the antiahmadinejad portion of the audience which appeared to be running about 70 percent cheered and chortled mr bollinger praised himself and columbia for showing they believed in freedom of speech by inviting the iranian president , then continued his attack he said it was welldocumented that iran was a state sponsor of terrorism , accused iran of fighting a proxy war against the united state in iraq , and questioned why iran has refused to adhere to the international standards of disclosure for its nuclear program i doubt , mr bollinger concluded , that you will have the intellectual courage to answer these questions mr ahmadinejad did not , in fact , directly answer the questions , but he did address them before doing so though , he said , pointedly in iran , tradition requires when you invite a person to be a speaker , we actually respect our students enough to allow them to make their own judgment and do n't think it s necessary before the speech is even given to come in with a series of complaints to provide vaccination to the students and faculty he added , to some cheers nonetheless , i shall not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment mr ahmadinejad s much talkedabout appearance at columbia came as the opening act of a week of dramatic theater here as the united nations general assembly opened its annual session mr ahmadinejad , along with his nemesis , president bush , is scheduled to address the general assembly on tuesday mr bush , asked about columbia s decision to host mr ahmadinejad , told fox news that it was ok with me , but added that he might not have extended the invitation himself when you really think about it , mr bush said , he s the head of a state sponsor of terror , he s and yet an institution in our country gives him a chance to express his point of view , which really speaks to the freedoms of the country i'm not sure i 'd have offered the same invitation the president s aides sounded frustrated by mr ahmadinejad s remarks look , what would be helpful is for iranian officials to give some direction so that they would stop the movement of equipment into iraq and training people in iraq who are killing innocent iraqis , iraqi security forces and our kids , the president s national security adviser , stephen j hadley , said mr ahmadinejad is allowed under international law and diplomatic protocols to travel freely within a 25mile radius of columbus circle in midtown manhattan but the new york city police said last week that he would not be allowed anywhere near ground zero during his trip inside the auditorium , the columbia students laughed appreciatively when mr ahmadinejad pushed back against the attempts by john coatsworth , a university dean and moderator of the event , to get him to stop rambling on tangential issues and to answer questions specifically do you or your government seek the destruction of the state of israel \? mr coatsworth asked we love all people , mr ahmadinejad dodged we are friends of the jews there are many jews living peacefully in iran he went on to say that the palestinian nation should be allowed a referendum to decide their own future mr coatsworth persisted i think you can answer that question with a simple yes or no mr ahmadinejad was having none of it you ask the question and then you want the answer the way you want to hear it , he shot back i ask you , is the palestinian issue not a question of international importance \? please tell me yes or no for that , he got a round of applause from the students , who had lined up four hours before the scheduled speech to get into the auditorium online tickets had evaporated in 90 minutes last week , they said , almost on par with a bruce sprinsteen concert i'm proud of my university today , said stina reksten , a 28year old graduate student from norway i do n't want to confuse the very dire human rights situation in iran with the issue here , which is freedom of speech this is about academic freedom it remains unclear whether columbia s leaders were able to mollify critics through their critical treatment of mr ahmadinejad but they made some headway the america israel public affairs committee , known as aipac , sent an email message out shortly after the speech this afternoon , a must read columbia university president s intro of iran s ahmadinejad today inside the email was a transcript of mr bollinger s introduction
washington , march 30 visits to have become a required part of the political wardrobe for lawmakers hoping to be taken seriously in the debate over the future of the war over the past two months , as lawmakers have debated the supplemental spending bill for the war and the troop buildup , they have brought up their trips again and again , wielding their experiences as rhetorical weapons to bolster their case according to the pentagon , as of midmarch , 365 members of congress had visited the country since may 2003 , when mr bush declared the end of major combat operations but it is unclear just how illuminating the trips have been the duration and scope of congressional visits are tightly controlled lawmakers from opposing parties often travel together , but draw opposite conclusions from the same trip on the war s progress and while lawmakers say they are deeply moved by their experiences , they almost always return with their previous convictions firmly reinforced i was there in iraq , representative loretta sanchez , a california democrat , said several weeks ago while detailing her reasons for opposing mr bush s plan to send 21 , 500 additional troops to the region rising in support of the president s strategy , representative mike pence , an indiana republican , said he spoke as one who has been there he made his fifth trip over the weekend a recent survey by the medill news service found that about twothirds of house republicans had been to iraq , while fewer than half of democrats had visited representative christopher shays , a connecticut republican who is the ranking member on the house government reform subcommittee on national security , has visited 15 times , more than any other member among the presidential contenders , senator hillary rodham clinton of new york made her third visit to iraq this year her chief democratic competitor , senator barack obama of illinois , visited for the first time last year senator john mccain of arizona , who is vying for the republican nomination and has largely linked his political fortunes to the president s new strategy , made his fifth trip to iraq on sunday with senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina , and two republican congressmen , rick renzi of arizona and mr pence representative patrick murphy , a pennsylvania democrat and former army paratrooper who served a sevenmonth tour of duty in iraq and later visited the country as a member of a congressional delegation , said lawmakers' trips were invariably somewhat scripted he said , i demanded that i break bread with guys i served with that would give me the straight story jack keane , a retired general and former army vice chief of staff , said the trips had been very limited because of security concerns members rarely spend more than a night in iraq , often flying back to kuwait or jordan at the end of the day the trips are heavy on meetings with american military and embassy officials , with almost no opportunities for unscripted encounters with regular iraqis mr keane said the new commander in iraq , gen david h petraeus , was trying to get congressional delegations out into the field more he wants them to have primary sources , he said , not just secondary sources even with the extraordinary security precautions , the trips are clearly dangerous representatives ike skelton , democrat of missouri , and tim murphy , republican of pennsylvania , were traveling in a minibus when a tanker truck accidentally sideswiped them in 2005 , tipping their vehicle over the two were hospitalized , but not seriously injured many prominent critics of the war have never been to iraq fewer than onethird of the 75 members of the house s out of iraq caucus have visited and some insist that they are none the worse for it i do n't like to fly , said representative walter b jones , a north carolina republican who broke with his party last month to oppose president bush s troop buildup where you really need to go is go to walter reed see the legs that are gone see those who are paralyzed and cannot control their bodily functions but senator lisa murkowski , an alaska republican who made her first visit to the region a few weeks ago with three senate colleagues john e sununu , republican of new hampshire , sheldon whitehouse , democrat of rhode island , and amy klobuchar , democrat of minnesota said she found there was no substitute for seeing things firsthand before her visit , she said , she had been skeptical of the president s new strategy but she said she came away believing that it had a chance of making a difference i'm willing to give petraeus what he has asked for , she said he said , i will know by midsummer whether or not this surge has worked' mr whitehouse , who made his first visit to iraq this year , admitted that his 36hour trip had been tantamount to drilling a tiny , tiny , little core sample out of some vast geologic mass and then drawing conclusions from it nevertheless , he said , he returned from the trip convinced that repeated democratic efforts to force an american withdrawal were having a desirable effect we are actually arming general petraeus with arguments to get the iraqis off their tail ends to do what they need to do , he said but mr sununu said he returned more convinced than ever about the danger of legislation that imposes conditions on war financing the message was very clear , he said , citing his own conversations with troops we need this funding , and we need it immediately the most valuable parts of the trips , however , transcend politics , said ms klobuchar at the end of their visit , when the senators were waiting to leave , the military transport plane next to theirs was being loaded with six coffins while mr sununu and ms murkowski participated in the ceremony honoring the dead service members , a group of national guardsmen from minnesota called ms klobuchar to stand with them they saluted the dead together
in these final stages of the campaigns in iowa , some of the candidates have retooled their styles and their speeches on the stump the times s adam nagourney examines john edwards s closing argument to iowa s caucusgoers , voters who know him well mr edwards , a north carolina democrat , almost won the iowa caucuses in 2004 by introducing , in the final weeks of the contest , a closing argument that drew huge crowds and , polls suggest , rallied supporters to his corner right up until the night of the vote now , mr edwards , a former trial lawyer , is offering yet another closing argument to his jury of voters here and there is evidence from the size of his crowds to the decision by an opponent , senator barack obama of illinois , to challenge him more directly in the past few days that it may be working in the process , though , mr edwards is raising questions about his political identity that have followed him throughout this campaign there is , in this final appeal to iowa democrats , no more talk about two americas , and barely a whisper of the optimism that distinguished him from the field in 2004 and which he exhibited as recently as a few weeks ago he has dropped the attacks that he was aiming just weeks ago at senator hillary rodham clinton of new york and washington politicians , and iraq is an issue that he mentions almost in passing , albeit with fervor instead , he is issuing a defiant pledge to fight big business , to voters in a state that has been buffeted by national and global economic forces and is still reeling from the closing of maytag plant in newton in october that s part of mr edwards s larger plan to edge out mr obama as the top secondchoice candidate of caucusgoers patrick healy wrote yesterday that the two had begun to gently criticize each other the chicago tribune takes on that shift in recent days , obama and edwards have traded mild rebukes to differentiate themselves still , their strategies fall along the same lines to become the singular anticlinton candidate , win over undecided democrats and become the second choice among those backing others who won t get enough support on caucus night this , i think , is going to be more of a horse race to the finish among the three horses who have been in the front for quite a while , said obama adviser david axelrod , who , ironically , served as a strategist for edwards four years ago that third horse , if you will , on the democratic side , rolled out basketball legend earvin magic johnson on the trail yesterday as senator hillary rodham clinton and her husband worked hard in iowa to emphasize her likability but could all the schmoozing be too little , too late \? the times s patrick healy was with mr johnson and the clintons in iowa the couple s onetwo political punch , still going strong after three decades , has special import now mrs clinton has embarked this week on a warmandfuzzy tour , blitzing full throttle by helicopter across iowa to

the ways we think we are affecting our children as parents and the actual impact we have are two different matters already i see evidence of this with my four my richest memories of their childhood and their richest memories are not the same memories they 'll say , remember that time , dad and i do n't , even though i was there , and i'm in the story from a young age , they are editing our family s life through their filters i lived this with my own father in several basic ways , he shaped me he was a newspaperman who valued education and family but the most vivid memories i have of my childhood , i know , are not the ones he would have selected those memories have pushed me to try and be a different sort of parent than he was one of the most central influences he had on me developing my voice as both a writer and parent came about in ways that he never would have guessed and that i myself did not recognize until well into my adult years as a young reporter , i was constantly in search of my writer s voice , since i 'd been told all real writers as opposed to journalists had one in the early going , this produced ludicrous results as i discovered my voice was exactly the same as whatever literary giant s i happened to be absorbed in that week \( particularly deadly for newspaper readers was my faulkner phase \) by my third newspaper and my 30th birthday , i had given up i 'd resigned myself to being a journalist without a voice and then one night after work at the miami herald , i went out to johnny raffa s lobo lounge with a terrific editor , doug balz after a few beers , doug asked where my distinctive writing voice came from i was stunned someone thought i had a voice \? this was the moment i 'd been waiting for , except i had no clue what my distinctive voice was i had to ask him he told me i had an ability to poke fun at people in my writing , to accurately portray their foibles and yet still convey my genuine affection for them and the moment he said it , i knew where it came from my writer s voice was the mechanism i 'd developed that let me live with my father and hold onto his love the voice was so central to my being while growing up , it was inaudible to me my dad was a good , loving man , but difficult and troubled on the street where we grew up , the houses were so close together every neighbor could hear the next neighbor s business we knew who the drinkers were , who the adulterers were , who was out of work dad was none of these he drank in moderation , came home to my mother and worked steadily as a newspaper copy editor seven days a week at one point , to put us through college but as the whole block had to know , dad was a vicious screamer he was floridly profane and verbally abusive , usually toward my mother , and it could go on , with rest breaks , for hours throughout high school , i did not bring home friends for fear my father would have one of his explosions it was n't until after he died , in 1980 , at the age of 65 , that i got some insight into his rage piecing it together with family members , i guessed that my father suffered from obsessivecompulsive disorder , a mental illness that can compel people to obsessively repeat rituals in some ways , this served my dad well he was the slot man at the boston herald the final person to check stories before they were printed , to pore over every piece of copy to make sure no error got into the paper today , this illness has become a part of mainstream culture my father most likely had the same disorder as the amusing private investigator on the tv show monk however , if there were funny parts when i was growing up , i do n't remember them i do remember , as a boy , catching my father repeatedly washing his hands , then seeing him struggle to turn off the bathroom light with his elbow to avoid germs it s not hard to imagine why he 'd build up rage inside , having to deal daily with a humiliating disorder that he did not understand somehow , in the course of my childhood , i found the voice to let him know he was behaving badly , to convey the message in a way that communicated my love and , at times , defused his rage my mother used to say , michael , you 're the only one who can placate your father i 'd guess that what reached him as much as my words was a child s na \? attempt to make things right he was so mercurial from cruel to remorseful and back that he forced us to feel deeply and often he could launch into a screaming fit if the kid next door accidentally kicked a ball into our yard , and if i got up the courage to challenge him he s a good kid , dad , what do you think , he did it on purpose , dad \? we do the same thing , dad he 'd stomp upstairs then , just when everyone was drained and humiliated and hoping he 'd never come down again , there were the footsteps on the stairs , and we braced for the next explosion you boys want to take a ride and get some ice cream \? he 'd say on a good day besides my writer s voice , he influenced my own parenting style , though not in the ways he would have guessed that same voice i used on my dad i use on my kids to make sure they know how much i love them even as i'm grounding them i also repeatedly remind my kids that their friends are welcome at our home and i 've always strived to avoid arguing with my wife in front of our children i 've sworn a silent oath never to do to my kids what my father did to me drawing \( drawing by jason schneider \)
one of the more shocking photographs to emerge from the current war was taken last year in a rural farm town in the american midwest it s a studio portrait by the new york photographer nina berman of a young illinois couple on their wedding day the bride , renee kline , 21 , is dressed in a traditional white gown and holds a bouquet of scarlet flowers the groom , ty ziegel , 24 , a former marine sergeant , wears his dress uniform , decorated with combat medals , including a purple heart her expression is unsmiling , maybe grave his , as he looks toward her , is hard to read his deadwhite face is all but featureless , with no nose and no chin , as blank as a pullover mask two years earlier , while in iraq as a marine corps reservist , mr ziegel had been trapped in a burning truck after a suicide bomber s attack the heat melted the flesh from his face at brooke army medical center in texas he underwent 19 rounds of surgery his shattered skull was replaced by a plastic dome , and a face was constructed more or less from scratch with salvaged tissue , holes left where his ears and nose had been ms berman took this picture , which is in the solo show at jen bekman gallery , on assignment for people magazine it was meant to accompany an article that documented mr ziegel s recovery , culminating in his marriage to his childhood sweetheart but the published portrait was a convivial shot of the whole wedding party maybe the image of the couple alone was judged to be too stark , the emotional interchange too ambiguous maybe they looked , separately and together , too alone marine wedding , the portrait s title , was not ms berman s first encounter with wounded iraq war veterans she photographed several others beginning in 2003 , and 20 of her portraits were published as a book , purple hearts back from iraq \( trolley books , 2004 \) , with an introduction by verlyn klinkenborg , a member of the editorial board of the new york times these pictures , accompanied by printed interviews with the sitters , have been traveling the country , and 10 are now at bekman none are as startling as marine wedding , even when the disability recorded is more extensive former spc luis calderon , 22 , of puerto rico , had his spinal cord severed when a concrete wall he was ordered to pull down it was painted with a mural of saddam hussein fell on him he is now a quadriplegic , though this is not immediately evident from his portrait nor can we see from the photograph of spc sam ross , 20 , of pennsylvania , that he lost a leg in a bomb blast , which also caused permanent brain damage almost all the veterans in ms berman s pictures look isolated , even if someone else is present and a sense of loneliness comes through in their brief interviews mr ross , separated from his family , lives by himself in a trailer mr calderon , who waited months for veterans' benefits , says he feels abandoned by the military because he was not wounded in combat , he has not been awarded a purple heart spc robert acosta , 20 , a californian who lost a hand in a grenade attack , says he is psychologically unable to resume his former social life i do n't like dealing with the questions like , was it hot \? ' did you shoot anybody \? ' they want me to glorify the war and say it was so cool mr acosta s interview has the only overt antiwar sentiment in the bekman show , and there are few words of bitterness or recrimination mr ross calls combat in iraq the best time of his life randall clunen of ohio remembers the excitement of search missions in iraqi homes as a peak experience sgt joseph mosner , at 35 the oldest in this group , was 19 when he enlisted there was no good jobs , he said , so i figured this would have been a good thing he still thinks so , despite his severe facial scarring from a bomb explosion sgt jeremy feldbusch , left braindamaged and blind by an artillery attack , once had plans for medical school but says i do n't have any regrets i had some fun over there i do n't want to talk about the military anymore he claims , as do others , that he has no political opinions ms berman adds no direct editorial comment to the presentation she has said in interviews that she started photographing disabled veterans soon after the war began mainly because she did n't see anyone else doing so in what may be the most intensively photographed war in history , the visual documentation has been selective the fate of the injured veterans was not a public issue until news reports about substandard treatment at walter reed army medical center this background provides the context for ms berman s photographs , which are themselves tipoftheiceberg images no matter what the viewer s political position , the images add up to a complex and desolating antiwar statement mr acosta makes that statement outright yeah , i got a purple heart i do n't care i do n't need anything to prove i was there i know i was there i got a constant reminder i mean like all the reasons we went to war , it just seems like they 're not legit enough for people to lose their lives for and for me to lose my hand and use of my legs and for my buddies to lose their limbs and marine wedding speaks , as powerfully as a picture can , for itself
natanz , iran , april 9 iran claimed monday that it is now capable of industrialscale uranium enrichment , a development that would defy two united nations resolutions passed to press the country to suspend its enrichment program the announcement was greeted with skepticism by western diplomats and nuclear experts , who said the declaration seemed to have more to do with political showmanship than technical progress while reporters were invited to the country s main nuclear complex at natanz , they were not shown any evidence that enrichment of uranium , the step needed to make reactor fuel or bomb fuel , was under way in a speech on monday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad warned that if the west did not end its pressure against iran to halt the production of uranium , iran would review its policy of cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , the united nations nuclear monitoring entity it was unclear whether that was a threat to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , as north korea did four years ago , but mr ahmadinejad said that the west should know that the iranian nation will defend its rights and that this path is irreversible with great pride , i announce as of today our dear country is among the countries of the world that produces nuclear fuel on an industrial scale , mr ahmadinejad told government officials , diplomats , and foreign and local journalists at the natanz site this nuclear fuel is definitely for the development of iran and expansion of peace in the world the government had decreed april 9 national nuclear technology day monday was the first anniversary of mr ahmadinejad s announcement that iran had produced enriched uranium at a pilot plant the spokesman for the national security council , gordon johndroe , told reporters traveling with president bush that the administration was very concerned about iran s declaration , adding , iran s decision to limit even further its cooperation with the iaea is unacceptable but the administration has carefully avoided making specific threats about how it might respond , other than to press for tightening sanctions through the united nations security council the security council on march 24 unanimously passed a resolution to expand sanctions on iran in an effort to curb its nuclear program the resolution barred all arms exports and froze some of the financial assets of 28 iranians linked to the country s military and nuclear programs the united states and some european governments have accused iran of having a clandestine weapons program , but iran contends that its program is peaceful , for energy purposes , and that it wants to produce fuel for its reactors talks between ali larijani , iran s chief nuclear negotiator , and javier solana , the european union s foreign policy chief , resumed last week after iran released 15 british sailors and marines who , iranian officials contended , had strayed into iranian waters mr solana negotiates on behalf of the permanent members of the security council russia , china , britain , france and the united states plus germany iran s sprawling facility in the desert at natanz has a small pilot plant where for more than a year engineers have periodically shot uranium gas into scores of spinning centrifuges in an experimental effort to master enrichment , a complex kind of purification process uranium enriched to low levels can fuel reactors if enriched to high levels , it can fuel nuclear weapons introducing uranium gas into centrifuges at the pilot plant would be nothing new injecting it into the larger facility under construction at the site , the one intended for industrial production , would be a step forward nuclear experts said it was unclear what mr larijani was referring to when he said monday , yes , we have injected gas the large industrial plant under construction at natanz is roughly half the size of the pentagon inspectors say iran is constructing 3 , 000 centrifuges as a first step toward 54 , 000 a senior european diplomat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because diplomatic negotiations are continuing , said he doubted that iran had crossed the line and begun enriching uranium at the larger plant because serious discussions were under way between iran and european negotiators over potential ways to resolve iran s standoff with the security council i would be surprised if they fed the centrifuges because it would jeopardize the talks , the diplomat said there are proposals out there that are quite serious the diplomat , who follows the nuclear agency s work , added that none of its inspectors were currently at natanz but that they were on their way he said their assessment would clarify what , if anything , the iranians had actually achieved frustrated western experts have said for months that the underlying question is whether the frenetic activity at the desert complex is real , a bluff or a little of both the issue , they say , is whether iran has really mastered the centrifuge basics or is involved in a political show to strengthen its bargaining position in the global standoff david albright , president of the institute for science and international security in washington and a former united nations weapons inspector , also said that iran for the moment seemed more interested in scoring diplomatic points than in making technical advances ahmadinejad is trying to demonstrate facts on the ground and negotiate from a stronger position , he said if they enriched today in the cavernous industrial plant , it would destroy the ability to go forward on any negotiation mr albright said t such enrichment would escalate the confrontation , adding , it raises all kinds of worstcase scenarios that , if not managed correctly , could escalate up to a military action it was unclear how seriously to take iran s threat to reduce further its cooperation with inspectors iran s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who has the final word on state matters , issued a forceful warning last month after the security council resolution was passed , saying iran would strike back against any threats or violence until today , what we have done has been in accordance with the international regulations , he said in a nationwide address marking the first day of the persian new year on march 21 but if they take illegal actions , we too can take illegal actions and will do so mr khamenei said that the nuclear program was more important than the nationalization of oil in 1958 , a source of great pride for most iranians if they want to treat us with threats and use force or violence , the iranian nation will undoubtedly use all their capabilities to strike the invading enemies , he added
president bush announced an initiative on monday to shore up the palestinian president and to begin building a palestinian state , signaling that his administration will use its remaining months to make a major push for peace between israelis and palestinians mr bush called for a regional peace conference this fall to be led by secretary of state condoleezza rice that would include highlevel arab envoys and their counterparts from israel and the palestinian west bank he exhorted israel s arab neighbors to open talks with israel and to show leadership by ending the fiction that israel does not exist and stopping the incitement of hatred in their official media he also urged them to send cabinetlevel visitors to israel , a request directed implicitly at america s closest arab ally , saudi arabia , which has refused to do so with all these steps , today s arab leaders can show themselves to be the equals of peacemakers like anwar sadat and king hussein of jordan , mr bush said he even took a rare jab at israel , using the word occupation to refer to the israeli presence in the west bank with gaza now under the control of the militant islamic group hamas , mr bush said palestinians have arrived at a moment of choice between the violent path that hamas has charted against israel and the more peaceful route to a palestinian state embraced by mahmoud abbas , the palestinian president , and his fatah faction , which retains control of the west bank hamas would be excluded from the regional meeting that mr bush proposed the planned meeting , the first of its kind in mr bush s presidency , signals another pivotal shift for an administration that is desperately seeking some kind of foreign policy victory in the volatile middle east that would draw attention away from the war in iraq for several years , the bush administration has eschewed direct engagement in peace talks between israelis and palestinians , and has refused to press israel to dismantle settlements or to sit down at the table with palestinian counterparts to discuss a future palestinian state but now the united states is mired in iraq and looking for a way to build good will among arab allies that have pushed for america to reengage in middle east peace talks administration officials also are hoping to capitalize on growing antihamas sentiment among leaders in egypt and jordan both of those countries have diplomatic relations with israel the big question remains whether saudi arabia , which does not , will embrace the administration s approach the most notable previous middle east peace conference was a regional meeting held in madrid in 1991 under the sponsorship of the soviet union and the united states during the administration of the first president bush to try to gain support for the american position , the current president bush is sending ms rice and defense secretary robert m gates to the middle east at the end of july they will prod arab leaders to show up for the regional meeting , which is at an undetermined place and date , administration officials said administration officials said that while the guest list had not been fixed it remains unclear , for example , whether syria will be invited mr bush would not have gone out on a limb with such an announcement if ms rice had not received some assurances from arab allies that they would not embarrass mr bush by boycotting a meeting hamas denounced mr bush s announcement we condemn this american conference which aims to serve the interests of the zionist enemy , a spokesman for hamas , ismail radwan , told agence francepresse several critics of mr bush s middle east policy said his speech on monday should have been delivered two years ago , after mr abbas was elected president of the palestinian authority , and before hamas won the palestinian legislative elections in early 2006 another criticism was made by daniel levy , a former israeli peace negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the new america foundation dividing the region into extremists and moderates may sound nice , neat and tidy in a speech , he said , but on the ground there is a huge gray area that the president apparently refuses to acknowledge hours before mr bush spoke , mr abbas went to jerusalem for another meeting with the israeli prime minister , ehud olmert these meetings are a direct result of american pressure on mr olmert to try to talk about a political horizon for a future palestinian state but with the putative state split between fatah in the west bank and hamas in gaza , american , israeli and fatah policies seem to be aligned in trying to make the west bank a model for the palestinian future and the focus for aid and diplomacy another aspect of that policy is to squeeze hamas in gaza , preventing normal trading or business relations , but allowing imports of food supplies , fuel and medicine mr olmert confirmed that israel planned to release 250 palestinian prisoners , of 10 , 000 currently held , by the end of the week , probably on friday , after an israeli cabinet committee approved the names the release is intended to bolster mr abbas and show the benefits of moderation the israelis emphasized that none of them were guilty of killing israelis mr bush also announced that mr abbas would receive about 80 million to help the palestinian authority overhaul its security forces while the money is not new it had previously been set aside for palestinian needs it will now go directly to mr abbas , and will not be funneled through outside organizations , administration officials said administration officials said more aid would come after tony blair , the former british prime minister who is now the envoy for the middle east quartet of the united states , the united nations , the european union and russia , reports success in building a plan to bolster palestinian security and political institutions photo president bush said yesterday that palestinians had arrived at a moment of choice , and that today s arab leaders can show themselves to be the equals of peacemakers like anwar sadat and king hussein of jordan \( photograph by doug

hans wegner , whose danish modern furniture most famously his chairs helped change the course of design history in the 1950s and '60s by sanding modernism s sharp edges and giving aesthetes a comfortable seat , died on jan 26 in copenhagen he was 92 his death was confirmed by his daughter marianne wegner , who worked alongside her father for more than 20 years mr wegner \( pronounced vegner in english and vayner in danish \) was one of a small group of danish furniture designers whose elegant but comfortable creations made danish modern all the rage among cosmopolitan americans of the '50s and '60s he also earned a footnote in political history , when , in 1960 , vice president richard m nixon and senator john f kennedy were seated on wegner chairs during the first nationally televised presidential debate he was one of what i think of as the humble giants of 20thcentury design , those men who would probably shun the term designer and prefer to call themselves cabinetmakers , said paola antonelli , the curator of architecture and design at the museum of modern art in new york , where many of mr wegner s chairs are not only on display but in use , in the museum s several restaurants describing the appeal of his furniture , she said , first and foremost , it s comfortable , and saying that it s comfortable before saying it s beautiful is really high praise , because the truth is that it s incredibly elegant mr wegner rose to international prominence as one of a handful of danes who seized the design world s attention with a fresh aesthetic of sculptural and organic modern furniture others were arne jacobsen , finn juhl , borge mogensen and poul kjaerholm their works , often made in warm blond wood , domesticated the cold chrome shine of the bauhausinfluenced international style in the process , they found a way to dovetail the words danish and modern for the first time , joining cabinetmakerguild traditions of high craftsmanship , quality and comfort with modernist principles of simplicity and graphic beauty this unity was epitomized by mr wegner s two bestknown chair designs , both introduced in late 1949 one was the wishbone chair , with a yshaped back split and a curved back and armrest suggested by a child s chinese chair he saw sometimes called the yback , it is an understated work of simplicity and comfort , its graceful shape hinting at both east asian design and modernist ideals it is still made today by the danish firm carl hansen son his other 1949 success became known simply as the chair , or the round chair \( mr wegner did not name his chairs , letting manufacturers or customers name them as they liked , leading to some confusion over the years \) the chair is a strikingly modern design , with a caned seat and a back and armrests made of one continuous semicircle of wood this was the chair used in the kennedynixon debate born in 1914 , hans jorgen wegner learned woodworking as a boy , the son of a cobbler , in tondern , in southern denmark he was studying design in copenhagen in 1938 when he was hired by mr jacobsen and erik moller to design furniture for the town hall they were creating in aarhus , denmark before the project was over , he met inga helbo , a secretary in mr jacobsen s office they later married once the aarhus project was completed , mr wegner started his own design business , and by the mid1940s he had created chair designs for the fritz hansen and johannes hansen furniture companies , including the peacock chair , a smart update of the windsor chair working out of a studio at his house , mr wegner produced hundreds of prototypes and had to be pressed to leave work for family vacations asked what his other interests were , his daughter marianne , said with a laugh apart from furniture \? none mr wegner s wife and another daughter , eva wegner , also survive him by the late 1960s , the rage for danish modern had cooled in the united states but mr wegner kept working , creating new designs for another danish company , p p mobler he retired in the early 1990s , when marianne , an architect , took over his studio over the last decade he was able to witness a surge of renewed interest in his work midcentury modern furniture is again in high demand , according to spokesmen for p p mobler and carl hansen what was a chic look a halfcentury ago has today joined the pantheon of mainstream style , perhaps a fitting tribute to a man who believed that a chair should be made well enough to last at least 50 years

mexico city indicated monday in a statement read on state television that he was willing to hand over the reins of s government to a younger generation of leaders but his statement remained silent on whether he was speaking hypothetically or had a transition plan in mind my basic duty is not to cling to office , nor even more so , to obstruct the rise of people much younger , but to pass on experiences and ideas whose modest value arises from the exceptional era in which i lived , said the statement attributed to mr castro , who is 81 the ailing mr castro , acting in a sort of emeritus role , has produced numerous commentaries in the 16 months since he had abdominal surgery and temporarily handed over power to his younger brother , ra l , who is 76 but none of the statements until now have addressed the important question of mr castro s future as cuba s president , a position he has held for nearly five decades the most recent speculation in havana had been that mr castro might be trying to make a comeback his health was said to be improving , and on dec 2 he was officially nominated as a candidate for the next national assembly the assembly meets in march to choose a 31member council of state , which will select the next president because only assembly members qualify for the top job , mr castro s nomination as a candidate seemed to rule out the notion that he was retiring from politics and ceding power to ra l , the defense minister and constitutionally designated successor fidel castro s future is considered a very delicate affair , analysts say , given his singular role in running the country only he can decide to opt out of the presidency , and those below him in the ranks , including his brother , have been careful not to be seen as pressuring him to cede power despite his health problems in his latest statement , read on the nightly discussion program round table , mr castro did not speak of any future leaders he envisioned governing cuba

foxborough , mass , jan 8 after the throttled the jets on sunday , 3716 , someone asked patriots linebacker tedy bruschi if the patriots took their game to another level during the playoffs the next level to us is the super bowl , he said and we have n't been there in a while a while \? the patriots won their most recent super bowl title two seasons ago only one championship has been decided since then , and it went to the pittsburgh steelers that s a while to me , bruschi said so it is these days in new england , where a trip to the super bowl is a rite of winter but this winter will be a bit longer for the patriots if they are to reach their fourth super bowl in six seasons in their three title runs , they did not have to take the long way the patriots had firstround byes and needed only two victories , the first at home , to make it to the super bowl last season , when the patriots had to play a firstround game , they beat the jaguars the next week , they lost to the broncos in denver , 2713 of course , the steelers won the super bowl after winning three playoff games on the road the patriots were 124 this season , but that earned them only the fourth seeding in the american football conference and their victory over the jets set up a meeting with the , an opponent that no team wants the chargers have a 10game winning streak and are unbeaten at home the patriots , as the lowestseeded team remaining , cannot be the host for the afc championship game the patriots were 71 on the road , with their only loss a 210 shocker at miami but none of their previous road opponents had the offensive firepower that the chargers possess the game presents excellent matchups the upandcoming quarterback philip rivers against tom brady , the best playoff quarterback in the game brady will also go against one of the best pass rushers in the game , shawne merriman chargers tight end antonio gates matches against whatever combination of defenders have to chase him the biggest matchup will be the patriots' front seven , the best in the league , against chargers running back ladainian tomlinson , the nfl s most valuable player tomlinson , who was also named offensive player of the year , rushed for 1 , 815 yards and 28 touchdowns this season he s explosive , cornerback asante samuel said of tomlinson if you sit back , he 'll gas you like he does everyone else chargers coach marty schottenheimer , who has notably failed in previous postseasons , goes up against bill belichick , perhaps the best coach of his era still , this is the most balanced team schottenheimer has ever had , and he has said that tomlinson is the best running back ever to play in the league patriots nose tackle vince wilfork called the chargers handsdown the best team in the nfl tomlinson has faced the patriots only three times since he came into the league in 2001 , but he has turned in memorable performances , averaging 1417 yards in 2002 , he ran for 217 yards and 2 touchdowns last season , he had 134 yards and 2 touchdowns as the chargers scored 24 unanswered points in the second half to win , 4117 samuel remembered feeling as if a professional team were playing a college team in that game , with a sense of hopelessness that the patriots rarely have he killed us last year , belichick said monday we 're usually looking at the back of his jersey we have n't done very well against him he s killed a lot of people besides us , and he s killed us a team might keep him down for a few carries , but it s just a matter of time before he breaks out , in one way or another , and gets in the end zone the patriots had the fifthbest run defense in the league this season \( they were 12th against the pass and 6th over all \) , but the perception is that the patriots lack tremendous speed among their linebackers , a potential liability against tomlinson the jets , who did not have much of a running game , used the speedy leon washington to slash through the patriots' defense he averaged 45 yards while being defended by bruschi , although he had only 11 carries safety rodney harrison , who is critical to holding off a multipronged offensive attack , missed the game against the jets because of a right knee injury sustained in the regularseason finale against the titans on monday , belichick said harrison was day to day and would not say if he would be available sunday in their most successful seasons , the patriots relied on harrison in the playoffs to disrupt an explosive offense usually that of the colts and peyton manning with his hard hits and intensity manning and the colts play the ravens on saturday in baltimore on sunday , perhaps without harrison , new england again faces the most dangerous offensive player , this time in tomlinson
a new feeling swept through madison square garden yesterday afternoon , something that was neither elation nor misery and not easily defined cautious joy \? angstriddled relief \? modest merriment \? what , exactly , should a team feel when it finally stops a losing streak that sapped morale , endangered the coach s job security and incited nonstop vitriol \? the were not sure they had beaten an equally distraught team , 8578 , and finding the proper adjectives was of secondary concern an eightgame losing streak , the knicks' worst in two seasons , was over s job as coach and team president was , for the moment , secure speculation was officially over until the next pratfall it feels a lot better being on this side , said eddy curry , who led the knicks with 21 points and also had 7 rebounds but we got a long way to go still i thought we came out this afternoon and played with a lot of effort , and we just stayed together we had some moments where we could have folded and where we have folded in the past but today we kept pushing and we were able to get a win the knicks \( 39 \) built a doubledigit lead amazingly , their first of the season then lost it before surging again down the stretch to hold off chicago \( 29 \) zach randolph overcame a rough start , hit two big shots down the stretch and finished with 20 points stephon marbury , who with thomas was a main target of the fans' ire , had 19 points there were no fist pumps , chest bumps or other major gestures at the final buzzer a capacity crowd stood and clapped politely as the knicks left the court quentin richardson \( 15 rebounds \) briefly raised his arms , but he said it was a reaction to holding off the bulls , not because the streak had ended it had been a rough 18 days between victories thomas benched marbury , who abandoned the team for a day , then returned to a resentful locker room the knicks looked frayed and , at times , uninterested last tuesday , the misery reached a peak when the garden echoed with boos and chants of fire isiah there were no such chants yesterday , and the boos evaporated by midafternoon when you lose eight in a row , there s a lot of things that can go on inside your locker room , as you can see from speculation from other people that are n't true , marbury said we 're staying together , and that s the most important thing marbury played rugged defense against ben gordon , and kirk hinrich and made a key shot in the final minutes \( although he missed two others \) i thought marbury was great tonight , thomas said i told him , november is almost over and it 'd be good to see him back marbury dismissed the suggestion that he had ever strayed from his game , although it was his failings as a defender and a leader that had prompted the recent benching i was back to myself when it all started , marbury said i never changed and i'm not going to change i know what happened , and it s behind me the bulls were without luol deng , perhaps their best player their usually explosive backcourt seemed oddly out of sorts gordon and hinrich combined to shoot 9 of 35 from the field , finishing with 24 points and 7 turnovers andres nocioni , who replaced deng , had 23 points and 9 rebounds the knicks rode curry and randolph and punished the undersized bulls inside curry and randolph combined for 22 freethrow attempts , 3 more than the entire bulls roster randolph was shaky for most of the game , missing 7 of 13 free throws and committing 6 turnovers but he hit two baskets in the final 61 seconds that helped put the game away james l dolan , the garden chairman , was not in attendance he has made no recent public statement regarding his coach , and thomas said he needed none in new york , you 're either dead or alive , thomas said you lose a game and you 're dead , and you win one and you basically get to survive the afternoon began with familiar ill will thomas and marbury were booed during pregame introductions , and marbury was booed every time he touched the ball in the opening minutes the mood brightened quickly , as the knicks built a 12point lead in the second quarter it grew to 14 in the third , and the knicks had a fourthquarter lead for the first time since nov 16 , when they lost at sacramento the boos returned briefly as the bulls , behind nocioni s shooting , tied the score twice late in the fourth quarter but chicago never took the lead thomas joked that the knicks would be able to go out to dinner and show their faces publicly last night the good feelings , however defined , may only last two days the utah jazz , a contender in the west , arrives tomorrow night so you do n't necessarily relax and say it s over , thomas said if we do n't win monday , then it s the same thing all over again
lenzerheide , switzerland , march 18 julia mancuso , a 23yearold from squaw valley , calif , finished third in the overall standings of the 20067 world cup circuit , the best finish for an american woman since 1984 nicole hosp of austria and aksel lund svindal of norway clinched the women s and men s overall titles sunday in the final races of a ski season that was often made surreal by record high temperatures in the alps svindal said that the biggest obstacle of the winter had been the warmth , which caused numerous race postponements and relocations , and seemed to compromise athlete safety the heat required several organizers to import snow from higher elevations , and even use helicopters to move snow in an unsuccessful effort to save the hahnenkamm , the celebrated latejanuary downhill at kitzb hel , austria i think it s a good thing that we had a bad winter because people get their eyes up for , svindal said a big and friendly 24yearold who rarely crashes and often competes while injured , svindal could be the face of the sport for another decade , especially now that hermann maier , who had his worst season at age 34 , is contemplating retirement switzerland s largest daily newspaper , blick , suggested sunday that the key to svindal s success was romantic affection from mancuso svindal played down the report i think you should n't always believe what you read in swiss and austrian newspapers , svindal said but i have to say i 've been hanging out with her , and she s a nice girl after racing in all 36 of the season s races , in 10 countries , as well as in each of five individual events in the world championships in february , svindal nearly lost the title in the blink of an eye in sunday s slalom had he finished just eighthundredths of a second slower , he would have finished 16th , without enough overall points to hold off the defending champion benjamin raich of austria , who won the race raich ended up 13 points behind svindal asked if she had provided svindal with his luck , as the newspaper suggested , mancuso laughed and said , i wish i was a little luckier for myself hosp is the eighth austrian woman to win the overall title she benefited from the absence of the threetime overall champion janica kostelic of croatia , who sat out the season kostelic has had 10 knee operations and her thyroid removed since starting her career i do n't know what she will do next year , hosp said , but when she comes back , i think it will be a very big fight again most skiers expect normal temperatures to return to the alps next season , but the chaos of their calendar this season changed many of them to climatechange activists , perhaps none more so than mancuso we leave a pretty big carbon footprint as skiers , staying in hotels and flying , but we can also help raise awareness , she said gian franco kasper , the president of the international ski federation , which has run the tour for 40 years , said , in general , it was a lousy season , to be honest it was lousy if you think about the youngsters who could n't race or train or even get on snow it was a big loss for the industry and tourism

ron washington does not have some elaborate plan now that he is finally a major league manager except for his title and role with the , nothing has really changed for him i'm a baseball man , washington has said repeatedly since being hired by texas in november after 10 seasons as a parttime player for five teams and 11 years as an assistant coach in oakland , washington has not changed his philosophy now that he is a manager he stresses fundamentals and a teamfirst attitude with a keep it simple , stupid approach and he is doing it with an unbridled enthusiasm and passion he has that desire every guy should have , and that s to love the game and to cherish it and give the game whatever you can with no regrets , catcher gerald laird said none of that has changed for washington after his managerial career started with texas being swept in a threegame series at the los angeles angels the rangers never had a lead against the angels , their american league west rivals you want to win , so some frustration sets in , but we 're not going to feed on that , washington said we know we 're better than we played here we will get better that was certainly the case when the rangers defeated the red sox , 20 , on friday in washington s managerial debut at rangers ballpark in arlington the rangers' first victory was also sammy sosa s first home game at the stadium , which opened five years after he played 25 games for texas as a rookie in 1989 he was then traded to the chicago white sox for harold baines sosa , 38 , has 588 home runs , fifth on the career list , but went to camp during spring training on a minor league deal after a year out of baseball he earned his roster spot by hitting 408 with five home runs in 17 games he singled in what proved to be the winning run friday while sosa tries to regain his timing in games that count , washington is making a bigger adjustment not being on the field , not out there getting dirty , that s the biggest thing , washington said as oakland s infield instructor , washington helped develop third baseman eric chavez into a sixtime gold glove winner the athletics led the al in fielding percentage in 2004 and 2005 , and were second in 2006 i'm just happy he has an opportunity to do what i think he s going to be really good at doing , chavez said it s just unfortunate it s not a chance to do it here washington was also the athletics' thirdbase coach for the past 10 seasons , but he was not chosen as their new manager when ken macha was fired bob geren , who worked alongside washington as oakland s bench coach , replaced macha

krakow , , jan 9 poland was convulsed in fingerpointing and recrimination on tuesday as more allegations of former secretpolice collaborators among the roman catholic clergy members spilled onto the country s front pages , sullying an institution that for decades was considered spotless in its fight against communism and the stream of disclosures now promises to become a torrent here in krakow , the rev tadeusz isakowiczzaleski is preparing to publish a book that will identify 39 priests whose names he found in krakow s secret police files , three of whom are now bishops in the polish church perhaps the most explosive assertion by people in the church is that the taint of collaboration was known for decades but kept quiet out of respect for or perhaps even at the behest of the polishborn pope john paul ii , who died in 2005 the church did n't want to hurt the pope , but actually , more harm was done by keeping silent , father zaleski , 50 , said in an interview at the hilltop compound of a charity he runs outside krakow the sudden focus on the fallibility of a church thought to be heroically anticommunist followed the s choice of bishop stanislaw wielgus as archbishop of warsaw despite clear signals of his ties to poland s secret police bishop wielgus resigned sunday after admitting his secret past there is a sort of unholy alliance in poland that has been present for many years , but is fully visible only recently , that is based on a culture of mendacity , said andrzej zybertowicz , professor of sociology at nicolaus copernicus university in torun , the heart of the polish church s most conservative camp he argued that there were three elements of this alliance former members of the secret police and the communist party who are now active in business and politics apologists who wanted to forgive and forget past collaboration and an influential part of the hierarchy of the polish church collaboration in the clergy is not unique to poland church officials across the communist world were commonly bent to ignoble service some of that has come to light as eastern bloc countries have peered into their secret police archives but poland is unique in that the church remained stronger there than elsewhere in the communist world that was largely because poland s primate at the time , archbishop stefan wyszynski , agreed to cooperate with the communist authorities , preaching compromise up to a point , beyond which he said the faithful should not yield most researchers who have delved into the archives of the sluzba bezpieczenstwa , or security service , estimate that thousands of the country s priests , monks and nuns at the time as many as 10 percent of the total collaborated with the secret police to some degree poland s current primate and archbishop of warsaw , cardinal jozef glemp , told an italian news agency last year that the overall percentage was 15 percent the percentage was likely to have been much higher in major cities and university towns , some historians say , where surveillance was heavier but the most troubling aspect of the recent allegations is how high past collaborators have climbed in the church hierarchy on tuesday , the dziennik newspaper , the third largest daily in the country , reprinted excerpts from a secret 1978 police document concerning a dozen highranking church officials at least one of whom was a bishop at the time indicating that the secret police tried unsuccessfully to influence the appointment of a new primate of poland , the highest position in the polish church the document gave only code names , like ramses \( cited as a bishop \) , professor and shepherd , but the newspaper promised to disclose those identities soon the disclosures have gripped this deeply religious nation the largest bloc of devout roman catholics left in europe and sparked anger toward the church for letting the frenzied news media disclose them , rather than researching the archives and reporting the findings on its own the church is guilty because it had the possibility to cleanse itself by publishing honest data about the clergy s activities during the communist time , father zaleski said the church argues that coming to terms with the past is a matter of personal sin that should be handled within the church in a spirit of forgiveness it also argues that the public disclosure of secret service files on clergy members could do the church harm because many of the documents are false or misleading but many people say the church has been overly cautious for fear of tarnishing its communistera image as a champion of freedom but the church is caught in the dilemma of risking a loss of trust whether it explores the collaboration or continues to treat it as an internal matter the results could be as bad for the vatican as they are for the polish church , because rome had hoped the church could keep this bastion of the faithful in an otherwise fast secularizing europe church officials now say that collaboration by some of the polish clergy members was a quietly understood fact of life under the communist government that ran poland from 1944 until 1989 that was obscured while the pope was still alive but not even two weeks after his death , in april 2005 , the institute of national remembrance published documents that showed that the rev konrad stanislaw hejmo , a dominican priest posted to the vatican , passed information to the secret service s antichurch branch father hejmo admitted giving the information but denied that he was a spy during the 25th anniversary celebrations for the solidarity trade union in gdansk that august , a friend told father zaleski that there was a secret police file on him in krakow when he returned to the city , father zaleski visited the archives and was stunned to find a file crammed with 500 pages of documents about him i was shocked by that , father zaleski said in his garret office he was even more troubled when he read that two priests had provided the secret police information on his activities though the priests were identified only by code names , they were described so precisely , he said , that he knew who they were i just could n't imagine that there were priests who had cooperated with the secret police , he said he sought guidance from the krakow archbishop , cardinal stanislaw dziwisz , a longtime personal secretary to pope john paul ii but father zaleski said he was at first ignored and then told to pray eventually , his superiors advised that he burn the documents they were n't interested at all in knowing anything about this , he said , rifling through a stack of photocopies stamped by the institute of national remembrance in a meeting with former solidarity members at a krakowarea steel mill last january , father zaleski suggested that the church authorities engage in lustration , as the process of vetting people for past communist collaboration is known in the former eastern bloc journalists attending the meeting wrote about father zaleski s suggestion it started a storm among the church authorities in krakow , he recalled the archbishop s office published an open letter condemning my activities he decided to undertake the project alone and promised to publish his findings the church , meanwhile , publicly acknowledged that some of its clergy members had collaborated and issued an apology for their sins in march it called on priests , monks and nuns who had collaborated with the secret services to confess to the church if not publicly seven of the country s 41 roman catholic dioceses have since set up commissions to help priests review their files but none of the commissions has issued a report on its findings the disclosures continued , each more shocking than the last in may , the rev michal czajkowski , copresident of poland s council of christians and jews , was accused of having spied for the secret police for 24 years he resigned his posts and issued an apology next , the press accused the rev mieczyslaw malinski , a close lifelong friend of pope john paul , of collaborating under the code name delta father malinski admitted having had contacts with the secret police but denied that he was a spy when father zaleski decided to begin publishing disclosures in may , cardinal dziwisz forbade him to do so or to speak to the press because it would undermine love for the church and christ the cardinal issued an order prohibiting any member of the clergy from delving into krakow s secret police archives without his authorization but after he met with cardinal dziwisz in june , the archbishop agreed to let him proceed on the condition that father zaleski seek comment from the clergymen he intended to identify cardinal dziwisz could not be reached for comment the rev jozef kloch , the warsaw episcopate spokesman , said that while father zaleski can publish whatever he likes , he and his editorial office will be responsible for the consequences father zaleski found the 39 priests identified as tws , short for tajny wspolpracownik , or secret collaborator four of them are now bishops of the 39 , 22 answered his request for comment , the majority denying that they were collaborators , and 4 admitting that they were one of those who he wrote to was the rev janusz bielanski , who resigned as rector of wawel cathedral here on monday , citing the allegations only one of the bishops responded , and he supplied father zaleski with documents that showed he had refused to cooperate with the secret police but the three bishops who did not respond , along with the other priests , will be identified in his book , which goes to print in midfebruary
if the college football regular season ended today , would play south florida for the national title that is the first development from the release of the bowl championship series standings yesterday , as ohio state holds the top spot and south florida is no 2 thanks to strong numbers in the computer polls the only thing certain from here on is more changes in the next few weeks , given the volatility at the top of the rankings and all the games remaining with the chances of two oneloss teams playing for the national title increasing every week , perception may be a key the rest of the season think it does not matter \? just look at south florida s scoring 64 points against central florida , including 75 and 28yard touchdown passes in the fourth quarter usf is no 1 in the computers right now because they 're a little more accomplished than ohio state or boston college , said jerry palm , an analyst for but the voters do n't know beans about them they could n't even probably find it on a map there are other reasons perception will factor in down the stretch it is highly unlikely that undefeated teams will play for the championship , because only four are serious contenders ohio state , south florida , boston college and arizona state that means a oneloss team will have to be strong in voters' eyes boston college and south florida began the season unranked , so if they lose , the perception may be that they are not worthy of playing for the title no 4 louisiana state is still considered the most talented team in the country the tigers lost in three overtimes to kentucky on saturday but have a huge lead over no 5 oklahoma in the bcs standings some of that comes from computer strength the rest comes from the idea that lsu has unworldly talent winning the rest of its games in the southeastern conference , especially with a title game , is no small task but voters may look favorably on the tigers there are two intriguing notions here can the tigers stay that high in the rankings with two losses , and would they hop over an undefeated team like boston college or south florida if all three of them won out \? six teams are unbeaten no 1 ohio state , no 2 south florida , no 3 boston college , no 8 arizona state , no 13 kansas and no 18 hawaii there may be none by the end of the regular season if there is only one , chances are it would be hawaii , which has the easiest schedule , with four home games at no 18 in the bcs , hawaii has little chance of reaching one of the top two spots to qualify for the title game , but it is poised to crack the top 12 and qualify for a bcs bowl if it stays unbeaten the top three teams all have enough tests left to think that they will lose ohio state travels to penn state and michigan south florida goes to rutgers on thursday and has cincinnati at home later boston college plays at virginia tech on oct 25 and at clemson , with home games against miami and florida state the wild card could be arizona state , which also began the year unranked the schedule falls nicely for the sun devils , who have marquee home games against california and southern california and a road trip to oregon \( do not count out the no 10 ducks yet , either \) it is unlikely the sun devils will navigate that gantlet unscathed , but coach dennis erickson has proved he can win the pacific10 because of perception , however , arizona state probably has no chance if it has a loss \( no 14 usc really does not have much of a shot , either , showing how the trojans' reality has changed by losing to stanford \) no conference s perception has been worse than the big ten s , coming off ohio state s loss to florida in the title game last season and michigan s losses to appalachian state and oregon if ohio state wins out and plays for the national title , it is unlikely that a big ten team will land in the rose bowl the minimum standards for atlarge teams for the bcs games are nine wins and a top 14 bcs ranking michigan is no 25 and has to play ohio state if the wolverines finish 93 , there is little chance they would be in the top 14 there is less of a chance that another big ten team would get there boston college s matt ryan , kentucky s andre woodson and florida s tim tebow are the quarterbacks receiving the most attention for the heisman trophy graham harrell of no 22 texas tech \( 61 \) is hardly mentioned but texas tech coach mike leach said that harrell , a junior , is worthy of such consideration , despite criticism that his statistics are inflated by the red raiders' spread offense he leads the nation in passing yards \( 3 , 151 \) , passing yards per game \( 4501 \) , touchdown passes \( 31 \) , completions \( 258 \) , attempts \( 347 \) and completion percentage \( 744 \) he s a real good quarterback , texas am linebacker mark dodge said of harrell , who threw for 425 yards and 3 touchdowns against the aggies on saturday give him credit for that it s real hard to defend when you 've got guy a like that because harrell and wide receiver michael crabtree , who leads the nation in receiving , play for texas tech , leach said it was a copout for heisman voters to discount their accomplishments just because they do their work more efficiently than others , does n't mean they should be penalized , leach said in a telephone interview everybody else is trying to achieve the same thing they 're just doing it in a better fashion
durham , nc , jan 11 in an interview last month with a district attorney s investigator , the woman who has accused three former lacrosse players of sexual assault contradicted critical evidence and parts of her earlier accounts , dealing a new blow to a faltering case in her account , made public today in a motion by defense lawyers , the woman said two players attacked her in the bathroom at a team party in march she also gave a new version of the timing and revised some of the men s descriptions the lawyers' motion said the latest account , from an interview on dec 21 with an investigator for district attorney michael b nifong , raised further questions about the credibility of the central witness in the case the accuser s most recent recollection of events demonstrates clearly that she cannot accurately recall and describe her attackers and that any identification made by her is necessarily unreliable , the motion said the disclosure was made as mr nifong is increasingly embattled last month , he dropped rape charges against the men after the accuser said she was no longer certain of some details of the incident the state bar has filed an ethics complaint against mr nifong for what it said were prejudicial public statements the executive committee of the north carolina conference of district attorneys has called on him to drop out of the case he has also been widely criticized for withholding exculpatory dna evidence in the interview , the woman , 28 , a stripper and the mother of three children , said she was attacked after she and another woman had danced at the party she said the assault occurred between 11 40 pm and midnight on march 13 that contradicts timestamped photographs of her dancing at the party after midnight , as well as a nextdoor neighbor s report of seeing the two women entering the house at midnight although the woman had told the authorities that all three men sexually assaulted her , she now said two had done so the third , whom she identified as reade seligmann , was only present in the room , she said she also revised her statement at a photo lineup that another defendant , david evans , looked just like an attacker without the mustache the statement was widely used to discount her identification because mr evans has never had a mustache the woman said in her new statement that she meant stubble or a 5 o'clock shadow the woman also said she could not be certain what had penetrated her it was that statement of uncertainty that led mr nifong to drop the rape charges on dec 22 , a day after the investigator , linwood e wilson , interviewed her the defendants , who have strenuously denied the charges , continue to face charges of sexual offense and kidnapping , carrying equally serious penalties the fivepage typed interview was released in a motion adding arguments to suppress the woman s identifications of defendants the motion is scheduled for a hearing on feb 5 and could , if granted , end the case mr nifong did not respond today to requests for comment the interview is the first time anyone from the prosecutor' office talked with the woman about the case she has made five comprehensive statements interviews with a sexual assault nurse and detectives , recorded remarks at the photo lineup with the police , a statement in her handwriting and the interview with mr wilson each statement contradicts parts of the others in the newest statement , the woman said she arrived at the house about 11 10 pm , joining the other stripper and dancing briefly before they stopped when a man threatened them with a broomstick she said that the two women retreated to a car , received apologies from three men , were enticed back inside and separated , and that she was sexually assaulted starting about 11 40 pm defense lawyers have made public timestamped photographs of the women dancing between midnight and 12 04 am the district attorney has questioned the authenticity of the time stamps the neighbor , jason bissey , gave the police a statement that he saw the accuser talking calmly with the second dancer in the yard outside the house shortly before midnight and then going inside , apparently for the first time that version is consistent with the timestamped photos i'm absolutely certain , mr bissey said in a telephone interview today i had looked at my cellphone , and i was sure they had gone into the house at 12 i had assumed that s when they first got there but i ca n't say for sure that was the first time they showed up it seemed to me that it was they had been talking calmly , and it seemed to me they were just fine the defense motion said the woman s cellphone records contradicted her version because she was speaking with someone at the time she now says the attack started she was on the phone from 11 25 pm to 11 32 and 11 36 to 11 39 the most recent account leaves a gap of more than 50 minutes in the timeline the second dancer called the 911 emergency number at 12 53 and reported that racial slurs had been shouted at them she later told the police that she had made the call as they were driving away from the party in previous statements , the accuser said three men calling themselves adam , matt and brett had held her in a bathroom , raped and assaulted her she had given different versions about what each had done , but had said three people attacked her the statement on dec 21 represented the first time that she said the same man , mr evans , had used multiple names and that she did not remember any name being used for collin finnerty , the third defendant defense lawyers wrote , in fact , nowhere was this said or even hinted at before dec 21 , 2006 the lawyers added , in short , by claiming that any one of the defendants could be any or all of her attackers , the accuser has now created the equivalent of a do over' in an attempt to try to make sense of her prior conflicting statements based on the earlier timeline , mr seligman had a strong alibi cellphone records , a timestamped photo from an automated teller machine and a cab driver s account showed that he was on the telephone or had left the party when the attack was said to have occurred the information released today raised new doubts about his role on april 4 , when the woman identified mr seligmann in a photo lineup , she said , he was the one that was standing in front of me um that made me perform oral sex on him in the new statement , she said mr seligmann stood in front of her while someone else sexually assaulted her from behind , but she did not say he made her perform oral sex instead , according to the statement , mr seligmann stood there and refused to go back behind her because he was getting married the report says , both finnerty and evans were trying to get seligmann to do it' but he kept saying no the woman also said in the statement for the first time that the men had used a white towel to wipe her face , mr evans s penis and the floor where she said she had spit she had previously said someone wiped her vagina with a rag defense lawyers wrote that the new account of the white towel was an effort to explain why

major league baseball has been given documentary evidence by the albany county district attorney s office that a player linked in published reports to shipments of performanceenhancing drugs did indeed receive a banned substance , according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the case the district attorney s office is leading the investigation of signature pharmacy , an orlando , flabased company that illegally provided clients with performanceenhancing drugs investigators are expected to provide baseball with evidence about other players in the coming weeks , an official affiliated with baseball said the law enforcement official and the baseball official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly baseball officials say they believe they need documentary evidence , thought to be shipping or pharmacy records , to ensure that an arbitrator will uphold whatever disciplinary action they take major league baseball introduced anonymous testing for steroids in 2003 and has increasingly toughened the policy since the periods in which the players are believed to have received drugs range from 2003 to 2006 , and baseball plans to use the testing policy in place at the time a player received a shipment as a nonbinding guideline when determining discipline the policy in 2004 allowed a player to test positive for steroids once without being publicly identified or suspended , with only counseling being mandated a second positive test required a suspension , but no major league player in 2004 was publicly identified with a positive test in 2005 , the policy was toughened and firsttime offenders were identified and suspended although there is no reliable test for human growth hormone , the league banned its use before the 2005 season that year the penalty for a first positive test for steroids was increased to 50 games from 10 three players jerry hairston jr , gary matthews jr and rick ankiel reportedly received hgh before 2005 and so are unlikely to be disciplined however , three other players could face suspensions if baseball can establish their guilt orioles outfielder jay gibbons reportedly received six shipments of hgh and two shipments of steroids between october 2003 and july 2005 blue jays third baseman troy glaus reportedly received multiple shipments of steroids between september 2003 and may 2004 , and mets reliever scott schoeneweis allegedly was sent shipments of steroids between 2003 and 2004 the identity of the player tied to the documentary evidence , one of the three players linked to the steroid shipments , is not known none of the three have been publicly linked to a positive test although baseball s testing policy does not expressly address how a player should be penalized for having received a shipment of a banned substance , the commissioner can suspend the player based on just cause the players union can appeal a suspension on a player s behalf major league baseball officials contend they can discipline a player more harshly if he is caught violating drug policy outside the testing system that was collectively bargained between the union and the league the union s position is that possession is less severe than a positive test it has indicated it would likely fight harsher penalties none of players linked to the shipments are in the playoffs , and baseball will probably not announce any suspensions until after the world series the district attorney s office said in march that it would provide major league baseball and the national football league with a list of players connected to shipments from the pharmacy the nfl was given the names of a coach , a player and a team doctor who were tied to shipments
so much for the racial dialogue the imusrutgers imbroglio was supposed to provoke though i guess words like idiotic and ridiculous and , in effect , shut up , qualify as honest discourse , albeit of the shockjock variety let me say right from the start that i am not here to champion a 13year study by a professor and a graduate student that found that white referees in the nba had called fouls at a greater rate against black players than against white players , and a corresponding but lesser bias by black refs against whites not as a basketball issue , anyway regarding the impact on the outcome of nba games and the integrity of the sport , my many years of being inside the arena tell me there are way too many variables beyond mere data solely extracted from box scores to draw meaningful conclusions from this but as a study of the human condition , it is fascinating , and who among its critics qualifies as the authority on how the brain stores information and makes that splitsecond call \?  the main findings of the asyetunpublished paper by justin wolfers , an assistant professor of business and public policy at the wharton school , and joseph price , a cornell graduate student in economics were reported wednesday in the new york times , setting off a fusillade of denunciation by the nba , its coaches , players and some members of the news media the league countered with a study of its own , no doubt prepared in haste to counter wolfers and price , and one that concluded , in the words of commissioner , no demonstration of any bias here none \? whatsoever \? not possible \? nba referees are not subject to the same betrayals of the subconscious as the rest of the human race \? must be a mighty rigorous psychological testing regimen these guys undergo before they are handed a whistle countering the predictable backlash in the wake of the exhausting imus episode , , the maverick who owns the mavericks , told the times we 're all human we all have our own prejudice that s the point of doing the statistical analyses it bears it out in this application , as in a thousand others no wonder cuban has made a gazillion dollars in business , while , foremost among the smirking naysayers , specializes in gambling in las vegas and in making politically incorrect wisecracks on television , many of them advancing the very biases and stereotypes he ca n't believe some referees might have stored deep in their craniums it is understandable why the nba is sensitive to the study and to the inevitability of incendiary overstatement , like the one by wolfers , who said , basically , it suggests that if you spraypainted one of your starters white , you 'd win a few more games but making the nba the guinea pig for such a study can also be perceived or spun as complimentary by stern s own admission , his league is always held to a higher standard on racial and social issues , and has historically bent over backward to meet them so if i were him and were presented a statistical anomaly no graver than a foul differential of up to 45 percent \( in favor of whites \) , i 'd say , is that all \? i 'd say if the officials in our league which has been outrageously ahead of the racial curve in all personnel aspects , ownership included produced that number irregularity in a country as politically and socially polarized as this one , imagine what our competitors would score imagine some of the numbers the authors of the study would find in corporate workplaces far less enlightened than ours the nba has long been a sports industry leader , but let s not get carried away here , it is no racial utopia it is the same league that several years ago was guilty of airbrushing s tattoos from the cover of an inhouse magazine , that has alternately embraced and beat down on the hiphop culture , and that over the years has had to recalibrate marketing strategies , like dr j and jordan creating in midair , as a predominantly black league catering to a largely white audience black players have long been sensitive to public perceptions and news media coverage of them in recent years , after failure in the international arena , there is an entirely new front in the neverending battle against preconceived notions and outright bias remember s accusations two years ago for which stern fined him 100 , 000 that officials were targeting the chinese center \? how many critics do you think were waiting for dirk nowitzki to come up short last night with dallas facing elimination at golden state to recycle the soft european chant \?  nba officials may be stalwart professionals , but they miss calls all the time because , first and foremost , they are imperfect people , which should also tell us they are vulnerable to the same hidden prejudices most of us would be embarrassed by if we were put to the implicit association test but in the final analysis , my guess is that nba refs are far more likely to make their most critical judgments correctly or not based on what they 've been conditioned to believe about the player more than the color of his skin and do n't expect the box score to tell you how they overlooked that pushoff on the dribble and that extra last step to the rim
washington , nov 18 it probably should not come as a surprise that dwayne de rosario scored the goal that gave the houston dynamo its second consecutive mls cup title what is a surprise is how he scored it i can say that i ca n't believe dwayne scored it with his head , coach dominic kinnear said after houston struck for two secondhalf goals sunday to defeat the new england revolution , 21 , before 39 , 859 fans at robert f kennedy stadium he just does n't score with his head , not in practice , not ever for the second year in a row , the orangeclad dynamo crushed new england s dream of winning the major league soccer title the revolution has been to three straight mls championship games , and four in the past six years , but has failed to take home the silverware new england is owned by robert k kraft , whose other team , the new england patriots , has been the nfl s dominant team this decade we just did n't take our chances , revolution coach steve nicol said they had two chances and scored two goals we could have scored three or four goals , but we left them hanging around , and that s why we lost , again de rosario , who was named the game s most valuable player , led the houston attack , which was without the injured striker brian ching and the suspended midfielder ricardo clark the revolution seemed to have synchronicity on its side as it tried to join the world series champion boston red sox , the unbeaten patriots and the surprising boston celtics among the region s sporting royalty but de rosario , as he did with the san jose earthquakes in 2001 , scored the goal that gave his team a championship san jose won titles in 2001 and 2003 before moving to houston at the start of last season new england , which had not allowed a goal in three previous playoff games this season , took the lead in the 20th minute when shalrie joseph sent a pass down the right flank to steve ralston ralston , who played in his 371st game in mls to set a record for an american in firstdivision soccer in this country , hit a cross that found the forehead of taylor twellman twellman beat houston goalie pat onstad low to the near post the goal seemed to shatter the dynamo s stingy defense , which had allowed only 23 goals in 30 regularseason games and 2 in three previous playoff matches houston got even in the 61st minute when brad davis s leftfooted cross from the right flank glanced off the head of new england defender avery john and landed at de rosario s feet , about 6 yards to the right of goalkeeper matt reis de rosario s cross went to joseph ngwenya , who started in place of ching ngwenya whiffed on his first shot , then scrambled to the ball and tucked it behind reis that was a scrappy goal that really hurt , revolution defender jay heaps said fifteen minutes later , onstad tipped ralston s cross away from twellman , and houston went right back down the field davis sent a laserlike cross to de rosario , who nodded it down and past reis from 12 yards out brad played a perfect ball , and it was an easy job for me putting my head on it , de rosario said it was more instinctive , more flashy i usually would be trying a bicycle kick or a volley but this time , my head was the only option this one is even more special because we are the second team to win back to back in league history dc united won the first two league titles , in 1996 and 1997 as his daughter and young son , clutching the mvp trophy , sat with him on the podium , de rosario said , i 've scored some big goals only because i have big players around me but none seem to have his head for the goal
timbaland is not an invisible man not exactly he has released four majorlabel albums , none a big hit but all respectfully received he tried to become a music mogul by starting his own label , beat club , which did n't take off for years he has popped up in music videos hiding in the shadows of aaliyah s are you that somebody , haunting s cry me a river he has popped up on albums too , murmuring encouragement to missy elliott or seconding jayz s boasts but he has spent much of the last decade hidden in plain sight , his name buried in the liner notes he long ago established himself as the most exciting producer in pop music , a composer who has changed the way rappers and singers and their fans think about rhythm it s no exaggeration to compare him to james brown , another rhythm fanatic who found new possibilities in old grooves the only difference james brown was a bona fide star timbaland has never seemed very comfortable in front of the camera , and collaborators have occasionally complained about his gruff mixingboardside manner nonetheless over the last year or two he has redoubled his efforts to achieve pop stardom , even if he s not well suited for it he has been writing himself into the hit songs he produces , turning his clients into duet partners he spars with justin timberlake on sexyback and my love and flirts awkwardly with nelly furtado on promiscuous and with the pussycat dolls on wait a minute all this has been building up to the release , on tuesday , of timbaland presents shock value \( mosley music group interscope \) , his fifth album and his most ambitious timbaland now has more clout than ever over his sharp and twitchy beats , teen heartthrobs sound daring , established pop stars sound hip , rough rappers sound radiofriendly shock value proves that just about everyone returns his phone calls the guest list ranges from fall out boy to elton john , from dr dre to 50 cent and for the first single , give it to me , he delivers a verse alongside mr timberlake and ms furtado nowadays a real star needs a real feud , so timbaland used give it to me to vent longsimmering frustration with scott storch , the miamibased producer \( and , before a rift , a timbaland collaborator \) who has emerged as a hitmaker in his own right i'm a real producer and you just the piano man , timbaland sneers , and those two words , real producer , suggest a whole constellation of claims and paradoxes how can some guy who plays the piano compare himself to timbaland , who wait , what exactly does he do again \? ever since there have been pop stars , there have been people charged with making them sound their best these people soon realized that working in a recording studio could be a musical job , not just a mechanical one but often being a producer meant being a bandleader phil spector worked with the musicians known as the wrecking crew , and norman whitfield worked with the funk brothers as electronic production took over , the process of musicmaking got more abstract , and it got harder for a nonexpert to figure out exactly what tools a producer was using \( although we 're all pretty sure computers are involved \) it has become much easier to see the product the star , the video , the live performance and much harder to picture the process producers who want to be players in the imagedriven world of pop music have to find ways to fight off obscurity in hiphop the answer is simple start rapping that s what dr dre did \( effectively \) , and what kanye west did \( brilliantly \) you can create an outrageous character for yourself , as lil jon has done no doubt many listeners do n't realize that the doofus with the pimp cup is also a firstrate knobtwiddler or you can demand attention in other ways the new orleansraised hiphop producer mannie fresh appends a ridiculous and attentiongetting announcement to every song he produces \( yo ! rednecks , coloreds , asians , africans , ethiopians , whatever you is it s your boy , freshly snipes , ya heard \? \) even if the song circulates on mp3 , with no liner notes attached , there can be no mistaking who made it timbaland , 35 , was born timothy mosley in norfolk , va , and he spent about a decade as a dj and fledgling producer he broke through in 1996 , the year he produced ginuwine s spaceage mating call , pony , and aaliyah s live comeon , if your girl only knew the next year he produced supa dupa fly , the dazzling debut album from ms elliott , an old high school friend also in 1997 timbaland made his fulllength rapping debut when he joined with the virginia rapper magoo to release the album welcome to our world it was a modest success , and though it did n't turn either man into an alist rapper , it was a sleek showcase for timbaland s signature style heavy , indolent beats enlivened by skittering syncopation \( like james brown before him , he found a way to emphasize the downbeat , not the backbeat \) then as now timbaland was a rapper whose main subject was producing it s time to change my style my rhythm , my ism , my prism , my beat mannerism since then timbaland has never stopped making hits , although some years were better than others \( the year of ms elliott s get ur freak on , 2001 , was one triumphant year 2006 was another \) and as part of his long campaign for visibility he never stopped making albums , all of which have included at least a fistful of breathtaking tracks his 1998 solo debut , tim s bio from the motion picture life from da bassment , was fidgetier and more severe than his earlier work \( it also introduced the world to a young rapper billed as ludichris \) his next album with magoo , indecent proposal , from 2001 , scrambled influences and rhythms and samples fluttering tabla drums here , a smudgy house track there and in 2003 the two released under construction part ii , a sequel of sorts to ms elliott s under construction it was full of sparse , drumdriven dance music throughout , the common lyrical theme was frustration timbaland complained that he was n't being given his due no doubt most producers feel this way , including timbaland s current antagonist , mr storch in built like that , his rather lame response to timbaland s give it to me , mr storch takes credit for mr timberlake s cry me a river \( mr storch is listed as one of three songwriters , alongside timbaland and mr timberlake he is n't listed as a coproducer but does receive a credit for playing keyboards \) he also mentions timbaland s prot g nate hills , known as danja , who is emerging as a firstrate producer with a knack for melody \( he helped produce five of these songs , including give it to me , and produced one himself \) mr storch raps , your boy danja got to hate you with a passion , man he makes the hits while you taking all the credit , damn it s inevitable , perhaps , that a beef between producers would devolve into a squabble over liner notes in any case timbaland wins this round , not just because of his decadelong track record but also because give it to me sounds so much better than built like that it s an instantly addictive song built from a muscular rhythm and a few wellplaced synthesizer notes and timbaland s halfrapped , halfsung verse fits snugly between ms furtado s spooky segment \( she always sounds as if she s just seen a ghost \) and mr timberlake s boyish taunts not every collision on shock value works this well , but all of them are worth hearing , even for those perverse people who do n't consider themselves timbaland fanatics the way i are , featuring keri wilson and doe , is a swirling electronic comeon oh timbaland , the album s only true solo track , is built from a playful piano loop , menacing syncopations and strobed synthesizers \( he s obsessed with this last technique right now you can hear it in mr timberlake s my love and in omarion s icebox \) even more intriguing are his experiments with rock , which dominate the album s second half one only , the fall out boy collaboration , must be the most futuristic emo song ever timbaland creates a breakneck rock 'n' roll backbeat and then , after the second chorus , shifts to half time , changing the rhythm while keeping most of the sounds the same apologize showcases one republic , a young band based in los angeles timbaland s hissing counterrhythms turn a handsome rock ballad into something even better inevitably , there are times when this cd feels more like a compilation , and times when timbaland goes overboard trying to prevent that elton john s appearance comes at the end , in a song called 2 man show he does n't sing , he only plays piano , but timbaland goes out of his way to remind listeners who they 're listening to come on , elton , he keeps saying does n't he trust us to read the liner notes \? maybe not , and who can blame him \? in an age when songs are often mislabeled or unlabeled or sold without production information \( as often happens at the itunes shop \) , liner notes themselves are starting to seem obsolete one day timbaland will get his box set , including all the hits but also the shouldabeenhits , by brandy and ms jade and petey pablo and well , it s a long list in the meantime you ca n't blame him for seeking the spotlight any way he can unlike mr west , timbaland will never be mesmerizing on the microphone , and so he 'll probably never be an oldfashioned star but maybe he s a newfashioned star a spectral one even when he does n't have the microphone , timbaland often overshadows whoever does he s not one of those musical therapists who make singers sound more like themselves on the contrary , he prides himself on challenging his clients they have to find a way to work around his weird beats \( many of his productions do n't really make sense until you hear them a few times he loves songs that sound wrong at first \) his music is n't predictable , but it s definitely recognizable in that sense he s among the most assertive pop producers of all time shock value includes a track called bounce , featuring ms elliott , mr timberlake and dr dre there s a heavy downbeat that almost sabotages the rapped verses you can feel some syncopation , but you ca n't quite hear it and then , at the end , everything stops all that s left is a looped hiccupping sound the syncopation you thought you had imagined it had been there the whole time , pushing the track forward , mischievously throwing the rappers off balance and once you 've heard it clear , it s impossible to ignore everything else about the song seems like an afterthought that tricky little rhythm is the star

this year , after 10 years of avoiding the issue , the connecticut general assembly authorized a study to examine the effect of gambling on the state as a whole this is a good step forward after all , connecticut is home to two casinos , mohegan sun and foxwoods , that are among the world s largest the state s lottery offers numerous games of chance , sold by about 3 , 000 vendors and while gambling is harmless fun for many adults , it is a serious problem for some it is therefore important for the state to get a balanced picture this means that the division of special revenue , which will issue a request for proposals in early september , must insist that the study measure gambling s negative consequences as well as its positive side the division should be explicit about this because the state has tended to ignore the negative side , even as connecticut s dependence on gambling revenue has grown twenty years ago , the state collected more than 257 million from gambling last year , gambling provided the state with just over 718 million the state conducted two studies during the 1990s , but both emphasized the positive , especially gambling s contributions to connecticut s revenue stream and employment , and dodged the downside yet everyone knows that gambling exacts a human toll , though it may be hard to measure the national gambling impact study commission , the last panel to tackle this issue on a national level , said in 1999 that problem gambling doubles within 50 miles of a casino that is no surprise to southeastern connecticut , where several trusted town officials , all middleaged women with no previous criminal records , have been convicted of stealing public money to spend at foxwoods or mohegan sun and the judicial system yields plenty of anecdotal evidence that gambling addicts are tempted to embezzle and commit other crimes to feed their habit gambling also places a heavy burden on social services and exacts a stiff price in terms of human behavior , including increased child neglect and domestic violence these costs , too , need to be calibrated in greater detail , so that the state can better help the minority of people who are being hurt none of this will be easy the money set aside for the study is less than 1 million but connecticut , which has welcomed the revenue that gambling has brought , has a responsibility to measure its darker side
istanbul , dec 1 the turkish military said saturday that it had inflicted significant losses on a group of kurdish guerrillas in , though it offered no evidence for its claim in a terse , vague statement on its web site , the military said that it had identified a group of 50 to 60 fighters just across the border in iraq , and that it had carried out an intensive operation against them reuters cited an unidentified turkish military official as saying that about 100 turkish special forces had entered northern iraq , struck the fighters and returned the official military statement , however , gave no indication that troops had crossed the border iraqi officials denied that any incursion had taken place a turkish member of parliament from the governing justice and development party indicated that the attack was part of a series of artillery strikes against rebel positions along the border that have been going on for months , and not the largescale offensive that the american and iraqi governments had feared it s not an invasion or a war in northern iraq , said the member of parliament , who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the developments this is just a limited operation for the moment turkey has been threatening to send its military into northern iraq to attack fighters from the group , the kurdistan workers' party , or pkk , which is based in both countries the group has fought the turkish military for decades over demands for an autonomous kurdish region there but a major incursion is viewed as unlikely , in part because it would require turkey , a nato member , to rebuff the united states , a strong ally the turkish military said it would use other means in the future , if required the united states military in baghdad said it had no operational reports of a turkish incursion haval zagros , a pkk spokesman , denied that the turks had entered iraqi territory or fired at its positions there have been no clashes between the pkk and the turkish army , he said today , none of our bases has been struck by turkish forces mohammed amidi , a spokesman for the kurdish democratic party , one of the main parties in the kurdish regional government , and col hussein rasheed , the commander of the iraqi border protection forces in dohuk province , both denied news media reports that turkish special forces had crossed the frontier the operation occurred a day after the turkish cabinet granted final permission to the military to make a crossborder strike the authorization was largely a formality , but a turkish government official said it gave the final green light for a fullfledged operation into iraq despite indications that saturday s attack was no different than previous ones , the military characterized it as the first of a series of possible crossborder strikes , and said as much in its web statement the first operation was carried out on dec 1 , 2007 , and the operations will continue depending on intelligence , the military said on nov 13 , iraqi officials said turkish planes had attacked on the iraqi side of the border , but turkey denied it meanwhile , iraqi politics were thrown into further disarray on saturday when the largest sunni arab bloc , the iraqi consensus front , walked out of parliament to protest what it described as a move by iraqi security forces to place its leader , adnan aldulaimi , under house arrest the bloc walked out after iraqi and american forces found a car bomb outside mr dulaimi s compound in baghdad american and iraqi officials said the keys to the vehicle carrying the explosives were found on one of his bodyguards more than 30 people , including the politician s son , were detained mr dulaimi denied that he or his employees had been involved in the car bomb dr saleem abdullah , a spokesman for the iraqi consensus front , known as tawafiq , said the group would boycott parliamentary sessions until mr dulaimi was released ali aldabbagh , a government spokesman , denied that mr dulaimi was under house arrest the united states military in baghdad said friday that iraqi forces had asked mr dulaimi to remain in his residence half a mile from the compound for his own personal safety in diyala , dozens of gunmen belonging to al qaeda in mesopotamia attacked the village of dwelah , burning down houses and killing 13 people , including four children and three women , iraqi army officers said it was the second such attack on the shiite village after its tamimi tribe refused demands earlier this year to swear loyalty , pay tribute and supply fighters for al qaeda in mesopotamia , an iraqi militant group that american intelligence sources say is foreign led
gainesville , fla , march 4 there was no formal passing of the baton sunday , just a warm handshake at midcourt between billy donovan and tubby smith before donovan s florida gators played host to smith s kentucky wildcats donovan got his coaching start in 1989 at kentucky as a lowlevel assistant on a staff that included smith , who became the head coach eight years later smith won a national championship in his first season , in 1998 , by following a blueprint that was as familiar to kentucky fans as bluegrass in recent years , donovan has turned florida into a program that has eclipsed kentucky as the envy of the southeastern conference nearly a year after winning their first national championship , the gators , who had already secured their first outright sec regularseason title under donovan , turned the wildcats into road kill with an 8572 victory at the o'connell center the victory , the sixth in a row for the fifthranked gators against kentucky , gave them momentum heading into this week s sec tournament in atlanta it also gave smith s detractors more to talk about the gators shot 64 percent from the field the highest percentage of any kentucky opponent during smith s tenure and for the first time since 1974 , the wildcats \( 2010 , 97 \) concluded a regular season without a victory against a ranked opponent despite winning five sec titles and making the round of 16 six times in nine seasons at kentucky , smith finds himself on shaky ground six days before sunday s game , kentucky s athletic director , mitch barnhart , delivered a lukewarm endorsement it s important to wait until the most critical part of the season is complete before reviewing the program , he said the wildcats played among the toughest schedules in the country , and they are expected to earn an ncaa tournament bid but to satisfy their restless fans , they will have to show more in the coming week than they did against the gators \( 265 , 133 \) , who needed only six minutes in the second half to demonstrate why they have become the cream of the conference after the wildcats played the gators to a 4343 tie in the first half , they were outscored by 132 in the first six minutes of the second half they turned the ball over four times in that span one possession ended with the gators junior forward al horford wresting a rebound from ramel bradley , the wildcats' junior point guard the gators outmuscled and outhustled the wildcats on the boards , finishing with 35 rebounds to kentucky s 23 asked what he could do to prevent his players from being outworked , smith laughed ruefully there s nothing you can do except maybe go out and get bigger , stronger players , he said it s frustrating with 2 minutes 8 seconds remaining in the game , bradley shot a 3pointer and was fouled by joakim noah , who stomped away in disgust at the call bradley and noah , who have known each other since they were new yorkarea schoolboys on opposing aau teams , exchanged words bradley later expressed frustration that none of his teammates challenged any of the gators the way noah challenged him i feel like we should have some tougher guys , bradley said everybody should be able to step up he added that s the tradition here at kentucky we were the guys making everybody else back down and i feel like if we want to be that team again , that s what we 're going to have to do more than his height or his hair , the 6foot11 ponytailed noah has charisma that separates him from other players on the court in recent weeks , his highwattage personality had dimmed to the point of nearly going dark the extra scrutiny that noah received this season after staying at florida has made him seem , at times , as if he were saddled with four fouls before taking the floor perhaps because he was plugged into a loud , proud home crowd that included his parents and three of his siblings , noah was his old energetic , emotive self on sunday , scoring 13 of his 17 points in the second half i think when you 're a young kid and you have the hype , donovan said , they all want to pump up joakim noah , and then when he does n't play well , tear the kid down the same can be said for kentucky basketball , which has experienced so much success that its recent struggles are magnified it s whoever s sitting in that chair , donovan said when asked about the bull seye on smith s back it has nothing to do with tubby smith as a coach or a man or anything else
with the situation in iraq growing seemingly graver by the day , americans are increasingly reluctant to risk american blood to save iraqi lives so it s a pretty tough sell to ask people to care about a bunch of old rocks with funny writing but what if they understood that the plunder of iraq s 10 , 000 poorly guarded archaeological sites not only deprives future generations of incomparable works of art , but also finances the insurgents \? having led the united states investigation into the looting of the iraq national museum in 2003 , i know that millions of dollars' worth of antiquities flow out of the country each year and it would be na ve to think the insurgents are n't getting a major share of the loot and what if americans understood that our failure to appreciate the importance iraqis place on their history has added to the chaos faced by our troops \? four years after the initial looting and despite having recovered almost 6 , 000 antiquities we cannot keep pace with the artifacts being stolen every day this continued failure to protect an artistic heritage going back to the dawn of civilization has convinced many in iraq and the middle east that we do not care about any culture other than our own it s worth pointing out that the failure to safeguard iraqi antiquities does not rest solely with the united states while the united nations and nato took the lead in providing security for cultural artifacts in postwar situations in bosnia , cyprus and elsewhere , neither seems much interested in rectifying the situation in iraq nato opened a training center for security officers outside baghdad in 2005 , but none of the iraqis trained have been assigned to archaeological sites the united nations says that it has no mandate to train guards and that the level of violence does not permit its involvement so who might act \? in the past , most archaeological digs in iraq have had foreign sponsorship the germans at babylon and uruk , the british at ur and nimrud , the french at kish and lagash , the italians at hatra , and the americans at nippur given that background , it would make sense for each of these countries to adopt the sites its scholars have been studying each of the foreign nations would provide guards around the perimeter and around the clock \( obviously , this would entail getting permission from the iraqi government and help from the american military \) ideally , these foreign forces would also be assigned a group of iraqi recruits to train once the iraqis were missioncapable it should take only six months or so if the baghdad government supplied the manpower the donor nation would recall its forces in this way , mesopotamia s cultural patrimony would be safe , al jazeera would have to find other ways to show tv clips of western indifference to arab culture , and the terrorists would have to find another income source one challenge has been convincing european governments that providing coordinated site security would not be a statement in support of the war but surely they could be persuaded that it would be a humanitarian effort to protect a cultural heritage rich with common ancestry that predates the splits among kurd , sunni arab and shiite the lesson for the united states is that we must never again cede the moral high ground on cultural issues like this one in advance of any future military action , we should assign units the task of protecting cultural property and all troops scheduled to deploy overseas should receive cultural awareness training the archaeological institute of america has already conducted some seminars at camp lejeune in north carolina yes , diverting resources to save cultural artifacts during a time of war may seem like cutting funds for the police and firefighters in order to expand the public library and my decision to expand my team s counterterrorist mission to investigate the looting of the museum was characterized by many as a distraction but some soldiers before us have seen the wisdom of this approach inevitably , in the path of our advance will be found historical monuments and cultural centers which symbolize to the world all that we are fighting to preserve , said dwight eisenhower just before dday it is the responsibility of every commander to protect and respect these symbols whenever possible

the first seven innings went down like iced tea on an august afternoon but no game , at least none that the play , can end without the requisite nailbiting , peptobismolswilling and headshaking that have come to define the first three games of their homestand so it was that last night , in the ninth inning , with the mets clinging to a fourrun lead , the loaded the bases against billy wagner with one out to recall all those notsofond recent memories like , did we expect to lose this one \? wagner said in what counts as progress , only one run scored , and the mets hung on to win , 52 , at shea stadium , end a twogame losing streak and secure an even more important development with the phillies' 143 loss to the padres , the mets were assured of waking up this morning with a sixgame lead in the national league east , their largest of the season if the bullpen had had another meltdown , oliver p rez might have , too he overcame a shaky beginning to hold the dodgers scoreless over seven innings , allowing three hits while striking out six and walking five , as his teammates toppled the ace brad penny for the first time in three tries this season that s a typical game when he s on , manager willie randolph said of p rez scored the mets' first two runs and , aside from playing sensational defense , went 2 for 3 with his 23rd home run of the season and two runs batted in one person not involved in the mets' offense they scored at least five runs for a clubrecord 12th consecutive game was carlos delgado , who was dropped to the no 6 spot in the lineup he went 0 for 3 , extending his hitless streak over his past four games to 16 atbats , including 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position , leaving 18 runners on base delgado returned to the lineup tuesday after missing four games with a hyperextended left knee he said that he felt a little rusty , that his was timing off , and that he was not surprised that randolph dropped him in the order ever practical , delgado responded to the news with a shrug i just go to the plate a minute later , delgado said that s all there was not much else he could say he did not know about the change until reporters told him about it three hours before the game he batted sixth twice in may and said repeatedly that it did not affect his approach or preparation asked if batting a spot lower afforded him the chance to see more pitches and thus get a better read on the pitcher , delgado shook his head if you ca n't figure it out by the second hitter , you 're in trouble anyway , delgado said the mets had won three of p rez s past four starts , but he had failed to impress in any of them , lasting as many as six innings only once as his earned run average swelled to 352 from 284 although p rez discounted any suggestions of fatigue , he has noted that his velocity has dropped a few miles per hour , which has caused him to throw more offspeed pitches p rez , who equaled a career high by notching his 12th victory of the season , said he felt strong last night all the way through his 119th and final pitch , and that the bite on his slider had returned during his rocky first inning , in which he loaded the bases with one out on two walks and a bunt single , p rez managed to catch andre ethier looking at a 91mph fastball for the second out , then induced russell martin to line out to end the inning p rez ran into trouble only once more , in the third , when he got out of a twoon , oneout jam by getting ethier to ground into a double play and he did not allow a hit after a leadoff single by martin in the fourth for him to go through seven innings with a pitch count a little high after the first inning was a blessing for the bullpen , wright said for all of his successes this season around the league \( 143 , 259 earned run average \) and against the mets \( 20 , 270 \) , penny seemed headed for an offkilter night as soon as the series s pitching matchups were released in 10 career starts at shea before last night , penny was 18 with a 675 era , and that does not include the two runs he allowed in relief during game 1 of the division series last season after the last time they faced penny , on july 20 at dodger stadium , several mets remarked how he seemed to get stronger as the game wore on they took it upon themselves last night to attack him early reyes led off with a walk , stole second and scored on a double by rub n gotay , who played because luis castillo s right knee was still feeling sore after he injured it thursday castillo said afterward that he did not expect to play until monday in philadelphia in their next atbats , reyes and gotay again collaborated to score , with reyes ripping a double in the third , advancing on a sacrifice by gotay and scoring on a single by wright when wright batted in the fifth , he fought back from an 02 hole to rip a fullcount fastball over the rightfield fence , extending the mets' lead to 30 jorge sosa loaded the bases with one out an inning before wagner did , but there would be no lateinning comebacks , no bullpen implosions this time if i was real bad , wagner said they would have scored four
washington , june 5 i lewis libby jr , the former chief of staff to the vice president and one of the principal architects of president bush s foreign policy , was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for lying during a cia leak investigation that became part of a fierce debate over the war in iraq the sentence ordered by judge reggie b walton of federal district court and his refusal so far to delay its implementation means that mr libby may have to report to prison in about two months that was expected to prompt mr libby s supporters to accelerate their calls for mr bush to grant him a pardon , although a white house spokeswoman offered a discouraging view of that possibility today mr libby , once one of the most powerful men in government and a principal planner of both iraq wars , stood calmly in the well of the court as judge walton said he appreciated the defendant s long service to the country , the record of which was put forward by his lawyers as an argument for a sentence of probation and no jail time but , the judge said , people who occupy these types of positions , where they have the welfare and security of the nation in their hands , have a special obligation to not do anything that might create a problem judge walton , who presided over the trial that ended in march with mr libby s conviction on four felony counts , said the evidence was overwhelming that mr libby had obstructed justice and lied to a grand jury and fbi agents investigating the disclosure of the identity of a central intelligence agency operative , valerie wilson the sentence was several months longer than the minimum recommended by federal sentencing guidelines , based on what judge walton said was his agreement with prosecutors that mr libby s crimes obscured an investigation into a serious matter and that his lies obliged the government to engage in a long and costly investigation that might have been avoided had he told the truth if mr libby goes to jail , he would be the first senior white house official to do so since the days of watergate in the 1970s when several of president richard m nixon s top aides , including hr haldeman and john erlichman , served prison terms in the second blow to mr libby , judge walton refused a request by defense lawyers to delay the sentence until mr libby s appeals are exhausted unless the judge reverses his position , as mr libby s lawyers will press for in arguments next week , or unless mr bush grants a pardon , the bureau of prisons is expected to order mr libby to report to a federal prison sometime in the next 45 to 60 days mr bush , who learned of the sentence while traveling in europe , expressed sympathy for mr libby and his family through a spokeswoman , dana perino who was accompanying the president on air force one from the czech republic to germany but as to the possibility of a pardon , ms perino said only , the president has not intervened so far in this or any other criminal matter , so he s going to decline to do so now as well several republicans advisers close to the white house , speaking on condition of anonymity , said today that they were perplexed as to why mr bush seemed reluctant to acquiesce in pardoning mr libby mr bush has pardoned more than 100 people so far but none have been prominent an intriguing question for many is what role vice president dick cheney will play in pressing mr bush to grant a pardon to mr libby in a statement , mr cheney noted that mr libby was appealing the verdict , and said he and his wife , lynne , hope that our system will return a final result consistent with what we know of this fine man judge walton issued his sentence after intense arguments by both sides over the significance of mr libby s crimes , and after sifting through scores of letters asking for leniency that were sent to the court by notable figures including former secretary of state henry a kissinger , former defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , and paul wolfowitz , the recently resigned president of the world bank , who is a former professor and government supervisor of mr libby neither mr bush nor mr cheney were among the 150 people who wrote letters of support in addition , mr libby , who did not testify in his own defense at the trial , delivered a brief statement , asking judge walton to consider , along with the jury verdict , my whole life mr libby , who has continued to maintain his innocence , did not offer any words that would have hinted at an acknowledgment of wrongdoing mr libby was not charged with leaking ms wilson s name , which first appeared in a july 14 , 2003 column by robert novak mr novak s sources were later revealed to be richard l armitage , a deputy secretary of state , and karl rove , mr bush s senior political adviser in the white house , neither of whom was charged with violating the law prohibiting disclosure of the identities of cia officers but mr libby was indicted on charges of lying about his conversations with reporters about ms wilson mr libby argued that the three reporters who contradicted his grand jury testimony were incorrect and that , in any event , he was too pressed by other business to remember details about any conversations concerning ms wilson a libby defense lawyer , theodore v wells jr , asked judge walton to sentence mr libby to probation or home confinement he urged the judge to take account of mr libby s long record as a public official , saying that was not an appeal for special treatment but for consideration of how he has lived his life mr wells said mr libby had already been punished through public humiliation , hate mail , the virtually certain loss of his license to practice law and the desire of some people to make him the poster child for all that has gone wrong with the iraq war he has fallen from public grace , mr wells said , his voice dropping to a hush it is a tragic fall , many of the mr libby s supporters have hoped he would remain free on bail for more than a year during any appeals in that view , president bush might find it more palatable to issue a pardon down the road , perhaps just before leaving office at the end of next year a spokeswoman for a legal defense fund on behalf of mr libby would not comment today but several of its organizers have urged that mr libby be pardoned if necessary to avert a jail sentence , including fred thompson , the actor and former senator from tennessee who has made it clear that he is likely to seek the republican nomination for president in court today , the chief prosecutor , patrick j fitzgerald , urged judge walton to issue a stiff sentence that would send a message that the truth matters mr fitzgerald said mr libby s misstatements made it difficult for law enforcement officers to figure out the truth in a hall of mirrors in addition to the prison sentence , judge walton fined mr libby 250 , 000 there is no parole in the federal system but an inmate may be eligible for a reduction of up to 54 days a year for good behavior judge walton , who is generally regarded as a firm bythebook jurist , rejected the request to delay implementing the jail term the judge said there was no issue which mr libby s lawyers could appeal that seemed to present a reasonable chance of succeeding but he relented partly and said they could file briefs next week detailing their arguments that there are two reasonable grounds for appeal that mr fitzgerald s appointment as a special counsel was improper and that judge walton erred in prohibiting the defense team from presenting experts on the fallibility of human memory the only other figure from the bush white house to have been convicted of a serious crime is david safavian , a lowerranking official who has been sentenced to 18 months in connection with the jack abramoff lobbying scandal mr safavian s sentence has been stayed pending his appeal
washington , april 2 s presidential campaign said monday that it had raised 20 million in the first quarter , tapping two distant but rich networks wall street and the mormon church to easily outpace his betterknown republican primary rivals senator john mccain , the arizona lawmaker once considered the frontrunner , brought in 125 million , his campaign said it was an unexpected shortfall that could hamper his momentum , and his campaign acknowledged disappointment former mayor rudolph w giuliani s campaign said it had raised about 15 million both of those figures would have set records in previous years , but on monday , they were dwarfed by the money raised by mr romney and senator hillary rodham clinton , democrat of new york , who brought in 26 million kevin madden , a spokesman for mr romney , said the total was indicative of the extraordinary success he has had reaching out and discussing important issues with the american people mr madden credited an online system called committ that the campaign had set up for volunteer fundraisers to send information and solicitations by email to their friends and associates still , polls show that mr romney remains relatively little known outside massachusetts , where he was elected governor in 2002 the business world , where he delivered hefty returns for investors in bain capital , the private equity firm he founded and utah , where he has played a prominent role in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and helped oversee the 2002 winter olympics although mr romney s membership in the mormon church has often been discussed as a potential political liability , he has taken deliberate steps to turn his affiliation with the church into a fundraising asset he has tapped wealthy mormons including the marriott family , founders of the hotel chain , and jon m huntsman sr , who made a fortune in plastics packaging last year , for example , mr huntsman and his sons gave more than 100 , 000 to political action committees set up to lay the groundwork for mr romney s campaign a handful of other mormons have contributed especially heavily as well they made the contributions through a chain of federal and state committees mr romney set up that allowed donors to contribute more than the 5 , 000 limit on gifts to federal pacs residents of utah , the center of the mormon church , contributed about 15 percent of the total contributions , more per capita than any other state last fall , three officials of the romney campaign met privately with a senior leader of the mormon church in salt lake city about reaching out to the six million mormons around the country the boston globe reported that romney campaign officials also contacted officers of the church s brigham young university , where mr romney attended college two administrators of the university s business school later sent an email message to 150 supporters and alumni soliciting donations for the campaign , the newspaper reported tax laws bar churches and other taxexempt charitable groups from partisan politics the church and the romney campaign both issued statements attesting to church s neutrality as an institution and denying any effort to enlist it in the romney campaign a spokesman for the mormon church said that the meeting was a courtesy visit , and that brigham young had said the two deans acted inappropriately mr madden said mr romney was focusing on building support across the broad spectrum of the american electorate , not just among mormons having said that , mr madden continued , i expect that the way a lot of greekamericans supported michael dukakis or jewish voters supported joe lieberman , there will be support for governor romney among members of the church of latterday saints mr romney s campaign also said monday that he had lent the campaign 235 million out of his own pocket as seed money , demonstrating a willingness to open his wallet for campaign money that none of his 2008 rivals can match mr romney has never disclosed his net worth , but analysts who study compensation at private equity firms say his earnings as the founder of bain capital are likely to amount to several hundred million dollars in 2002 , he spent 6 million of his own money on his 94 million campaign for governor what is more , records of mr romney s political action committees indicate that he also accumulated a

east rutherford , nj , oct 19 jared lorenzen looked more like a fullback than a quarterback as he left the ' locker room on friday with a playbook sandwiched between his right hand and his burly chest , he weaved through a roomful of teammates and reporters , leading with his left hand but when he opened his mouth , he sounded like a coach got to study up , lorenzen said it sounds clich , but i'm just a play away from getting in the game or maybe two a ghastly series of events would have to unfold for lorenzen to play against the san francisco 49ers on sunday he is listed as the giants' thirdstring quarterback behind the starter eli manning and anthony wright but 2007 is shaping up as the year of the backup so why should n't the backup to the backup revisit every play in the book \? when the giants look across the field sunday at giants stadium , they will be reminded of how things can change on one snap alex smith , the 49ers' starter , separated his right shoulder in the first series of a loss to the seattle seahawks three weeks ago he was replaced by trent dilfer , who struggled in a loss to the baltimore ravens the next week and will start against the giants the 49ers are hardly alone eleven teams have started at least one backup in the first six weeks of the season the total will increase sunday , when atlanta will replace joey harrington with byron leftwich in hopes of filling the void created by michael vick s departure some teams are on their second quarterback because of ineffectiveness most teams have made switches because of injuries it s crazy what s going on , said wright , one of 59 quarterbacks to have thrown a pass this season the nature of the game is that it s so physical , most teams are going to have to use their backup at some point in the season so as a consequence of that , the backup has to be ready in case anything happens through it all , the giants have not skipped a beat manning will make his 46th consecutive start on sunday there are only a handful of teams that have enjoyed such durability at quarterback , none more so than the green bay packers , who have had brett favre as their starter for every game since 1992 manning actually looked vulnerable after spraining his throwing shoulder in a seasonopening loss to the dallas cowboys so in week 2 , lorenzen , then the secondstring quarterback , was told to prepare as though he would be the starter against green bay true to form , manning ended up starting but lorenzen was needed after all , when the game became a blowout in the fourth quarter on his second play , lorenzen sprained his left ankle and was replaced by wright seven plays later every time you touch the ball , whether it s in practice or at the end of a game , it s an audition , wright said lorenzen was listed as the no 3 quarterback the next week because of the injury he is healthy now but remains stuck at the back of the line he has not asked coach tom coughlin why perhaps coughlin does not want to tinker with a fourgame winning streak coughlin hinted that wright and lorenzen were essentially interchangeable and could switch places we kind of look at it on a weektoweek basis , and that s the way we are going to stay , coughlin said like many backups , wright was once a starter he was the ravens' thirdstring quarterback in 2003 before becoming the starter and leading them to a 52 record over the final seven games of the regular season and into the playoffs lorenzen lacks experience , having thrown only eight passes all this season since being drafted by the giants in 2005 but he is more familiar with the giants' system than wright and he said that other teams probably would not know what to expect from him , putting them at a disadvantage wright and lorenzen find themselves in an odd position they want to play more , and each believes he could effectively lead the giants' offense but they acknowledged that manning gave the team the best chance to win so for now , they wait lorenzen said that backups generally needed experience to stick with a team but that it was difficult to gain experience when there is so much waiting involved as a backup but then comes a season like this one , where it seems as if any backup is liable to get an opportunity what s happening around the nfl this season is good because it s giving guys a chance , lorenzen said tim hasselbeck is a great example he gets cut from here , sits out a few weeks and all of a sudden he s with arizona all these guys that are starting are getting chances it s good to see lorenzen would like to join the list but unless manning and wright are injured , he will have to continue to study his playbook , hoping the giants continue to roll but ready to step forward on a moment s notice or maybe two

nairobi , kenya the ethiopian government , one of america s top allies in africa , is forcing untrained civilians including doctors , teachers , office clerks and employees of development programs financed by the world bank and united nations to fight rebels in the desolate ogaden region , according to western officials , refugees and ethiopian administrators who recently defected to avoid being conscripted has been struggling with the rebels for years but with tens of thousands of its troops now enmeshed in a bloody insurgency in somalia and many thousands more massing on the border for a possible war with eritrea , the government seems to be relying on civilians to do more of its fighting in the ogaden , a bonedry chunk of territory where ethiopian troops have been accused by human rights groups of widespread abuses in a recent report , government officials in the region called upon elders , traders , women and civil servants to form local security committees and mobilize their clans to destroy the rebels and their bases of support the government says that the rebels are terrorists who have carried out assassinations and bombings , and that civilians have volunteered to fight them but by many accounts , the militias are hardly voluntary one western aid official said soldiers had barged into hospitals to draft recruits and threatened to jail health workers if they did not comply in other cases , lists of names were posted on public bulletin boards , ordering government employees to report for duty , according to a current member of the regional parliament and two ethiopian administrators who have fled the country many of those who refused were fired , jailed and in some cases tortured , the administrators and parliament member said the civilians are serving as guides , porters , translators and foot soldiers , and they are sent into the bush with little or no training to confront hardened guerrilla fighters in the ensuing battles , many civil servants have recently been killed , according to accounts corroborated by western officials and aid workers anybody who works for the government teachers , doctors , clerks , administrators has to join a militia , said hassan abdi hees , who worked as the head accountant in a government office in the ogaden and is now seeking asylum in kenya i left because i did n't want to die several western officials say they are alarmed about this new strategy , especially when the first signs may be emerging of a humanitarian crisis that aid officials predicted over the summer earlier this year , the ethiopian military sealed off large swaths of the ogaden to choke off support for the rebels , preventing much of the commercial traffic and emergency from entering western aid officials warned this could cause a famine the military has since relaxed some restrictions , but a survey by the aid group save the children uk found that child malnutrition rates in some areas have soared past emergency thresholds and are now higher than in darfur or somalia , widely considered the two most pressing crises in africa in late november , john holmes , the most senior humanitarian official at the united nations , came to the ogaden to assess the situation while there , he said , he heard reports of civilian militias being formed , and observed that it was increasingly difficult to find health workers , livestock workers and trained professionals to distribute muchneeded aid in the region , which now faces a drought there is not a catastrophe there , for the moment , mr holmes said but there is a lot of concern the ogaden could become a serious humanitarian crisis ethiopian officials deny this many media and international organizations have been exaggerating the problems , said nur abdi mohammed , a government spokesman there is no food aid problem there is no malnutrition problem as for militias , mr mohammed said , what is happening is that the local tribes are forming to fight against the onlf , the ogaden national liberation front , the main rebel group in the area the people want to protect their livelihood , mr mohammed added according to the recent government report , which was published by regional authorities , rankandfile civil servants are not the only ones called upon to fight the rebels it also lists several employees who work for programs financed by international donors they included a pastoralist development project that receives millions of dollars from the world bank and the ethiopian government s aids prevention office , which is supported , in part , by the united nations and the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria a second government document ordering civil servants to report for duty lists 10 employees from an aids office one government official said that his entire department , including whitecollar professionals , clerks , watchmen and drivers , had been forced to go on reconnaissance patrols to hunt down the rebels the official , who feared government reprisals if he were identified , said that the militia duty interrupted humanitarian programs supported by the united nations and that several colleagues were killed while on patrol we do n't know how to operate guns , but the government sent us to the front lines , the official said other civilians who served in the militias said they were not given camouflage , and even had to buy their own rifles it s terrifying , said ali mahamoud , a koranic teacher who said he was yanked out of arabic class a few months ago and assigned to a militia you ca n't see the rebels when they 're shooting at you and the ethiopians will kill you if you try to run the rebels said the civilians were easy targets they do n't know the bush , said daous , a commander for the ogaden national liberation front some of the region s besttrained professionals have chosen to flee , including sadik mohammed hajinur , a sudanesetrained doctor who used to work at a rural hospital he said that ethiopian soldiers demanded that he recruit militia members from his clan and that when he refused , they beat him with rifle butts i faced so many problems from the army , said dr sadik , who is now seeking asylum in sweden dr sadik and other refugees described the militia program as another example of the extremes to which the ethiopian government will go to control the ogaden region , which lies on the border of somalia and is home to mostly ethnic somalis , who speak a different language and have a different culture than the highland ethiopians who rule the country several united nations officials and western diplomats said they were discussing the militia program in private meetings , but contended they could not comment publicly for fear of provoking the ire of the ethiopian government , resulting in a possible suspension of humanitarian efforts in the region we are walking a very thin line , and we need to concentrate on saving lives right now , a united nations official said ethiopian authorities have already expelled the red cross from the ogaden , accusing aid workers of being spies the bush administration considers ethiopia its no 1 ally in combating terrorism in the horn of africa , and the american government provides it with roughly 500 million in annual aid last winter , american commanders gave ethiopia prized intelligence to oust an islamic movement that had controlled much of somalia but human rights watch says it has documented dozens of cases of severe abuse by ethiopian troops in the ogaden , including gang rapes , burned villages and what it calls demonstration killings , like hangings and beheadings , meant to terrorize the population this is a minidarfur , said steve crawshaw , the united nations advocacy director for human rights watch the ethiopian government s response to such criticism is often one word eritrea ethiopian leaders have accused their tiny neighbor of arming insurgents in somalia and the ogaden eritrea denies this , but a united nations report concluded that the country had indeed shipped planeloads of weapons into somalia ethiopia also blames eritrea for failing to compromise on the border issue , which has led to a major military buildup on both sides as for human rights , ethiopia s prime minister , meles zenawi , said at a recent news conference that there have been no widespread human rights violations in the ogaden , not only because we believe in the respect for human rights , but because we know how to fight the insurgency but several soldiers who have recently defected said they had participated in brutal killings ahmed mohammed , 24 , said he was born in the ogaden and served two years in the national army in august , he said , his platoon was blockading a road and caught a truck trying to sneak through the soldiers dragged the driver out and mr ahmed said he watched his commander saw off the driver s head with a 10inch hunting knife we left the body by the road , said mr ahmed , who is now a refugee in kenya his account could not be independently verified , but was consistent with those of other soldiers who had defected mr mohammed , the government spokesman , dismissed the story , saying there is not a single soldier who is abusing human rights the ethiopian military is very disciplined and would not abuse its own people recent refugees said the military was trying to starve them out and the blockade had been like a noose on some parts of the region , cutting off food supplies in october , save the children uk surveyed more than 600 ogadeni children and found that 21 percent were acutely malnourished , compared with united nations surveys that found malnutrition rates of 19 percent in an area of somalia and 13 percent in darfur , sudan the united nations considers 15 percent the emergency threshold we 've crossed the line into a humanitarian crisis , said one western diplomat who asked not to be identified because he was afraid of reprisals from the government western officials said the ethiopian government has begun to respond by loosening the restrictions on commercial traffic and food and allowing the united nations to open field offices in the ogaden there have been positive developments in the last three weeks , said marc rubin , emergency director for unicef in ethiopia but there is a lot of catching up to do the amount of emergency food that the united nations world food program has dispatched to the ogaden this year is a fraction of what it was last year , 19 , 475 tons compared with 155 , 249 tons several refugees said they had been reduced to eating grass habsa ghaffir , who arrived at a camp in kenya four weeks ago , said that after ethiopian troops burned her fields and shot her husband , her 4yearold son starved to death i remember him saying to me , mom , bring me food , mom , bring me tea , mom bring me water , ' ms habsa said but she had none it is like they are trying to wipe us out , she said , nervously snapping twigs between her fingers as she spoke outside her hut even here , we 're not safe united nations officials said ethiopian intelligence agents had infiltrated kenya , and on nov 2 , there was a mysterious attack that only added to these fears according to kenyan police , masked men burst into an apartment building in a nairobi slum and shot five ethiopian refugees two died , along with a guard outside who was shot in the head nothing was taken witnesses said the killers went straight to the ethiopians' room the ethiopian victims had been student leaders in their country , and the kenyan police said some of them had previously asked for protection kenyan police commander joseph maina migwi said he could not say whether ethiopian security agents were involved but whoever did it , he said , were definitely paid professionals

a national association of lawyers said yesterday that it would bring a classaction lawsuit against the federal immigration agency for refusing to accept thousands of applications for workbased permanent visas from highly skilled immigrants who were encouraged by the government to apply according to accounts yesterday by officials and lawyers , the immigrants were caught in a confrontation between the two federal bodies that control the immigration system , the state department and the citizenship and immigration services the hopes of thousands of foreigners who have been working legally in the united states were unexpectedly raised and then abruptly dashed as a result of the disagreement they had responded last month to an announcement that permanent residency visas would be available , but on monday learned there were none the immigration lawyers said the aboutface by the immigration system had no precedent in at least three decades of legal practice , and said that it violated the immigration agency s regulations the american immigration lawyers association s legal action arm was preparing the lawsuit , said crystal williams , deputy director federal officials said a misunderstanding had arisen from an effort by both agencies to reduce huge backlogs of applications for permanent residence visas , known as green cards immigration officials acknowledged that the effort was poorly handled was there a lack of communication between us and the state department \? said william g wright , a spokesman for the immigration agency certainly the episode started on june 12 , when the state department announced in a monthly bulletin that green cards would be available starting july 2 for applicants across the range of highskilled categories that was a signal to immigrants who have been working in this country on temporary visas that they would be able to apply to become permanent residents thousands of immigrants rushed to obtain certified documents , assemble employer sponsorship papers , take medical examinations and dispatch their applications many canceled travel plans so they could be in the united states when their applications arrived on july 2 , as the law required but on monday , the state department announced that no more green cards were available snared in the turnabout were welleducated , highly skilled , legal immigrants , many of them doctors and medical technicians , with long work experience in this country all had obtained federal certification that no american workers were available for the jobs they hold the episode laid bare conflicting interests between the state department , which manages the offering of visas , and the citizenship and immigration services , a branch of the department of homeland security that processes the visa applications by law , only about 140 , 000 employmentbased visas are available annually , so there are huge backlogs of applications state department officials said their june alert that visas were available was intended to prompt the immigration agency to speed its processing so that no visas would go unused since 2000 , a total of 182 , 694 workbased visas have not been given out because the immigration agency had fallen behind in processing applications , according to the 2007 report of the immigration agency s ombudsman we were determined that every employment number that was available would be used , june kunsman , the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for visa services , said yesterday immigration agency officials said they were surprised by the department s action they said they immediately advised the department that they had already finished approving enough applications to use 60 , 000 visas of those offered department officials did not revise their public notice offering visas we said we already have more than enough applications and we expect to complete them in time to use the visa numbers , said mike aytes , director of domestic policy operations at the immigration agency to complete the applications in time , the immigration agency put employees to work both days last weekend at service centers in texas and nebraska , immigration officials said they said that 25 , 000 applications were processed in the final 48 hours before monday s deadline in some cases , security clearances required by the fbi were not entirely completed , immigration officials said the agency approved some applications when we were certain the process will be completed very shortly , mr aytes said in its bulletin on monday , the state department said that unexpected action by the immigration agency had used up all the visas for the 2007 fiscal year the news was crushing to murtuza bahrainwala , a 38yearold occupational medicine doctor from india who works at decatur memorial hospital in illinois after nearly 12 years working as a physician on temporary visas , dr bahrainwala believed in june that his chance for a green card had finally come apply for citizenship , that s absolutely what we want to do , he said once he has a green card , his wife would also be authorized to work , and he could accept promotions and change jobs , which he cannot do with a temporary visa but because the application he delivered on monday was not accepted , dr bahrainwala may have to wait four or five years to apply again right from complete ecstasy , you go down to the depths of depression , dr bahrainwala said i have never been illegal a single day in this country maybe i should have just crossed the rio grande , he added immigration lawyers said that the situation punished immigrants who were identified as highly desirable by the system and who have always gone by the book they 've played by the rules for years , said daryl buffenstein , cochairman of the global immigration practice at paul hastings , a law firm now the government is not playing by the rules
nusa dua , indonesia the world s faltering effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions got a new lease on life on saturday , as delegates from 187 countries agreed to negotiate a new accord over the next two years pushing the crucial debates about united states participation into the administration of a new american president many officials and environmental campaigners said american negotiators had remained obstructionist until the final hour of the twoweek convention and had changed their stance only after public rebukes that included boos and hisses from other delegates the resulting contains no binding commitments , which european countries had sought and the united states fended off the plan concludes that deep cuts in global emissions will be required and provides a timetable for two years of talks to shape the first formal addendum to the 1992 framework convention on climate change treaty since the kyoto protocol 10 years ago the next presidential election takes place at the halfway point in these treaty talks , david d doniger , who directs climate policy for the natural resources defense council and served in the clinton administration , said on his web log on saturday so the us will field a new team in the second half and there are good odds that the next president will get serious on  but the white house , while calling the negotiating plan quite positive in a printed statement , said the problem lay elsewhere it described serious concerns about the limited steps taken by emerging economic powers without citing china and india by name , it clearly singled them out , saying the negotiations must proceed on the view that the problem of climate change cannot be adequately addressed through commitments for emissions cuts by developed countries alone major developing economies must likewise act in the talks , china and other emerging powers did inch forward , agreeing for the first time to seek ways to make measurable , reportable and verifiable emissions cuts but those countries showed no signs of agreeing to any mandatory restrictions any time soon , saying their priority remained growing out of poverty the finish to the negotiations came after a lastminute standoff in the public plenary at the end of a day of high emotions , with the coorganizer of the conference , yvo de boer , fleeing the podium at one point as he held back tears the standoff started when developing countries demanded that the united states agree that the eventual pact measure not only poorer countries' steps , but also the effectiveness of financial and technological assistance from wealthier ones the united states capitulated in that open session , which many observers and delegates said included more public acrimony than any of the treaty conferences since the 1992 framework the concession , though , came after a more profound shift by the bush administration , which agreed during the twoweek conference to pursue a new pact fulfilling the unmet goals of the original treaty the pact would take effect in 2012 when the kyoto protocol expires while many observers described the united states change as a uturn , it was the culmination of months of movement by the bush administration , which had for years insisted that the 1992 treaty was enough to avoid dangerous human interference with the climate in 2005 talks in montreal , for example , the american negotiating team walked out of one session , rejecting any talk of formal negotiations to improve on that pact since then , the bush administration has been confronted by new scientific data on climate change and by growing political pressure both internationally and domestically still , while accepting on saturday the need for a new agreement , the united states retained the flexibility that it had sought at the outset , fending off european attempts to set binding commitments on emission reductions american negotiators said that was vital to gain global consensus the targets sought by europe and others remain in the action plan including the need for rich countries to cut emissions by 2020 up to 40 percent below 1990 levels , and a 50 percent cut in emissions globally by 2050 but they are now a footnote to the nonbinding preamble , not a main feature of the plan andrew light , an expert on environmental ethics at the university of washington who was in bali , criticized the bush administration for insisting on those targets being sidelined , saying the united states had , in essence , rejected the foreboding climate projections of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which it had repeatedly praised in recent weeks we could have moved on from here with a confident range of future cuts , mr light said instead we have to move on with the same continued uncertainty at the beginning of the week i was really heartened by the public praise the us delegation was giving to the ipcc and now i ca n't help but think , was it all lip service \? some environmental groups criticized europe for not sticking to its guns but it appeared that , in the end , the europeans followed a path recommended in a speech last monday by former vice president al gore , fresh from receiving the nobel peace prize in oslo he advised bali negotiators to look beyond the bush administration , whose tenure ends in one year beyond the histrionics and the politics , there were deeper reasons for the continuing clashes in particular , the huge wave of industrialization and economic growth sweeping asia the united states and europe were largely responsible for taking the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas emitted by the burning of fossil fuels , to its current concentration of 380 parts per million from 280 , a level which , until the industrial revolution , was not exceeded in at least 650 , 000 years but the growth in emissions for decades to come will largely be driven by developing countries , where some two billion people still cook on firewood or dung and crave the comforts and prosperity that come with abundant energy according to a recent analysis led by economists at the electric power research institute , if rich and poor countries do not together divert from business as usual , the concentration by 2040 could exceed 450 parts per million , a threshold that many scientists say could set in motion harmful changes for centuries to come europe prevailed over the united states in one area , insisting that the next two years of talks proceed on two tracks one for those countries , including the united states , not committing to mandatory limits , and a second building on the kyoto procotol , the 1997 update to the original treaty that requires emissions reductions in 36 major industrialized nations , but has been rejected by the united states the united states team in bali had fought against that , demanding that a new agreement encompass the world s major polluters and have sufficient flexibility , and no hard targets , to do that but in the end the united states had to agree to two tracks to avoid a total breakdown of the talks that is important , environmental campaigners said , because it guarantees work toward new mandatory gas restrictions in 2012 , when the limits under the current kyoto accord expire it also sustains a mechanism that , in theory , the united states could join under a new administration if congress becomes less insistent that the biggest developing countries move in lockstep that demand is reflected in some language in the current climate bill moving forward in the senate , which demands comparable action from such countries there were many moments of drama and theater in the negotiations , at a resort complex on the southern tip of bali , involving 11 , 000 officials , environmentalists , industry lobbyists and journalists but nothing else matched the point on saturday , in the final tumultuous plenary , when the american team was booed for trying to block a proposal by india kevin conrad , the negotiator from papua new guinea , rebuked the american delegation if for some reason you are not willing to lead , leave it to the rest of us , he said please , get out of the way he was alluding to remarks made by an american official , james connaughton , chairman of the white house council on environmental quality , last week to a reuters reporter , who quoted him as saying , the us will lead , and we will continue to lead , but leadership also requires others to fall in line and follow that statement had become a sore point to many delegations a few more statements were made , but none of america s traditional allies came to its defense finally , paula dobriansky , the lead american negotiator , spoke we came here to bali because we want to go forward as part of a new framework , said ms dobriansky , the under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs we believe we have a shared vision and we want to move that forward we want a success here in bali we will go forward and join consensus the delegates erupted in lengthy applause , realizing that a deal was finally at hand
east rutherford , nj , jan 8 the day after their firstround exit from the playoffs , players were on the lower level of giants stadium , meeting with their coaches , perhaps for the last time upstairs , in the groundlevel offices , the team s management was addressing issues that would affect the franchise s future the giants made no decision on whether to retain coach and in their quest to fill their vacant generalmanager position , the giants were left one intriguing candidate fewer scott pioli , who helped build the new england patriots into a threetime super bowl champion as the vice president for player personnel , declined to interview with the giants the giants had requested and received permission from the patriots to speak with pioli after careful consideration , and for personal reasons , i am continuing in my current role with the new england patriots , pioli said in a statement released by the patriots the giants are expected to make a decision on coughlin s status in the next couple of days , probably before they hire a general manager to replace ernie accorsi , who is retiring the giants have interviewed the former redskins and texans general manager charley casserly , and other outside candidates will probably be considered they have interviewed four inhouse candidates , including the personnel director , jerry reese , who received accorsi s recommendation if coughlin is retained , the new general manager would inherit him , at least for a season if coughlin is fired , the new general manager would immediately embark on a coaching search the giants considered themselves super bowl contenders until the end , even after they converted a 62 start into an 88 finish and a bythefingernails slot in the playoffs on a rainy sunday night in philadelphia , with a 2320 loss , the giants' collapse was doused in lasting disappointment coughlin did not speak with reporters monday , which he typically does the day after a game the uncertainty of the franchise s direction , and the silence from the team s management and coaches , left the players to dissect the mood none were in a better position to understand the emotions of the players and the embattled coach than chris snee snee plays a rare hybrid position with the giants offensive guard and soninlaw to the head coach snee and the former katie coughlin have two young sons so as snee s teammates talked about coughlin , snee talked about his fatherinlaw , a grandfather to his children it s tough any time you have a coach , and you know how much time he puts in , snee said you know how this is just , like , killing him inside to see such a talented team fall apart it is tough to see , regardless of the relationship many players left giants stadium monday morning without speaking to reporters none who spoke publicly criticized coughlin they gracefully took responsibility for the team s graceless fall , though none could explain why it occurred they mostly blamed a mix of injuries to key players , including defensive end michael strahan , receiver amani toomer and tackle luke petitgout , as well as a difficult schedule and an inexplicable inability to snap out of their doldrums in november and december several players played down reports that coughlin had lost the interest and control of the team while coughlin , 60 , is hardly a revered figure , and his strict rules grew tiresome long before the season began , there was less sniping from players in the second half i do n't know if people are n't saying it because i'm around , but i really have n't heard all this negativity towards him , snee said i do n't know where all those reports are coming from he s a demanding coach , but as far as i 've understood and observed , he was respected for the most part players had not been asked their thoughts on coughlin by the team president , john mara , whose family owns half the team , or steve and jonathan tisch , brothers whose families own the other half i'm going to have a conversation with john mara , i'm sure , in the next few days , said running back tiki barber , who played his last game sunday i 'll have a discussion with jonathan tisch and we 'll see my input is just an opinion this organization has a lot of tough decisions to make barber did not say what he planned to tell the owners about coughlin snee did not expect to be asked , but knew what he would say i would say that we are the ones that go out there and were n't performing in the second half of the season , snee said that s the reason why we 're not playing anymore , the fact that we did n't go out and play the way we expected to play it s on us snee s relationship with coughlin is complex and evolving snee was drafted in the second round of the 2004 draft , about six months after the birth of dylan snee and katie coughlin were not married , and tom coughlin was not happy when it was their turn , the giants viewed snee as the best player available the coachplayer relationship helped force the healing of an uneasy personal one chris had already been through the worst of my husband , coughlin s wife , judy , said in 2004 he had to earn his way into our family snee and katie coughlin soon married , and the family has grown in size and in closeness snee said he had seen no signs that the past few weeks were especially taxing on coughlin you know him he s as tough as they come , he said if it did affect him , he did n't show it snee also said coughlin has offered no indication that he knows his job status in his meeting with the team , coughlin sounded like a man expecting to return there were no ifs involved , snee said he said , take two months off and i 'll see you in march' so i 'll see him in march not until march \? i take a little break after the season , snee said , laughing i take a couple weeks off i 'll see him in february maybe extra points a day after running back tiki barber played his last game , simon spotlight entertainment , a division of simon schuster , announced that it would publish his autobiography it is scheduled for release in september
the team with the thirdbest record may end up seeded fifth and the one with the fourthbest record may be no 3 got that \? once again , the nba s playoff math could leave more than a few people scratching their heads in seeking to make sure teams are rewarded for winning division championships , the league has set up a format in which a better record does not necessarily guarantee a better seeding any seeding system requires you to strike a balance between a number of considerations , said joel litvin , the president of nba league and basketball operations rewarding the division winners , rewarding teams with the best record with home court you 'll never have a setup that is absent of any anomalies the nba s seeding system failed last season , when san antonio and dallas met in the second round of the western conference playoffs , even though they had the best records in the conference because they were both in the southwest division , with dallas finishing second , the mavericks could only be seeded fourth behind the other division winners after the teams delivered a postseason classic , which ended with the mavericks winning game 7 in overtime on the road , the league adjusted its system it now allows a secondplace team to be a no 2 seed , but division winners are guaranteed a topfour seeding if you are going to have an unbalanced schedule with a particular emphasis on the divisions , then you have to give something for the division titles having been won , commissioner david stern said and we do but the format continues to draw criticism because the top three teams in the central division have better records than the toronto raptors or the miami heat , the champions of the other divisions in the east so the cleveland cavaliers or the chicago bulls could fall all the way to no 5 , while the raptors move to third and the heat to no 4 the cavaliers or the bulls would still have homecourt advantage against the heat , but would face a much tougher road going strictly by records , cleveland would be seeded third and open against the no 6 seed if they advanced , they would then probably face the no 2 seed instead , the cavaliers will open against the no 4 seed , then probably meet the topseeded team in the conference semifinals the format , stern said , is n't intended on punishing anybody , and he sees no reason to change if you are going to have the conference transcend the division , then you are going to have to go 1 through 8 , he said and as long as we continue to have the unbalanced schedule through the division , we think that it s better to have the rule to credit the division winner and elevate to keep them in the top four an excellent regular season for the dallas mavericks is giving coach avery johnson a chance to rest some of his star players during the final two weeks of the regular season the mavericks wrapped up the no 1 seed in the western conference with six games to play , and johnson is taking advantage when dallas visited minnesota on wednesday night , it left dirk nowitzki , jerry stackhouse and erick dampier at home devin harris sat out when our big guns , some of them , like dirk and dampier and stackhouse do n't play , everybody has to step up , johnson said some of the lesserused players see this as a chance to wedge themselves into the playoff rotation austin croshere scored 19 points in the 10588 victory over the timberwolves on wednesday and desagana diop had a careerhigh 10 points and 15 rebounds i think a lot of guys who do n't play a lot still have a lot to prove , croshere said my real goal is to show coach that i can contribute in the playoffs assured of the worst record in the nba , the memphis grizzlies have the best chance for the no 1 pick in the draft that does not , however , excite pau gasol he became so frustrated by the losing in memphis this season that he hoped for a trade gasol said he did not think one college star would solve the grizzlies' problems a young kid is not going to make a whole lot of difference , he said it is going to take the right free agents , the right moves , get guys that are ready to compete and prepare for it the grizzlies face plenty of decisions , including who will be making those decisions what to do with the pick and what to do with gasol the questions involving players would normally be addressed by the team president , jerry west , but it is not known if he will remain with the grizzlies after the draft the team s owner , michael heisley , is still looking for someone to buy the team a group headed by the former duke stars christian laettner and brian davis could not come up with the financing before a deadline expired in midjanuary if gasol is still around , he wants things fixed all the ownership stuff needs to be resolved in some sort of way , he said there are too many things the detroit pistons have now won 50 games in six straight seasons and central division titles in five of them they are clearly one of the nba s top franchises , but none of those statistics really matter we do n't get judged by our wins in the regular season , we get judged by our ability to get 16 wins in the postseason , detroit coach flip saunders said the pistons had the league s best record last season , winning 64 games , but the playoffs were a disappointment detroit needed seven games to make it past cleveland in the second round , then lost to miami in the eastern conference finals detroit has already wrapped up the no 1 seed in the east point guard chauncey billups said he was proud of all the pistons' success during the regular season , but he agreed with saunders that it was overshadowed by what comes next when that other season starts , it s all about 16 wins , billups said we look at it like that a lot of other teams that have n't really been in look at it like , we want to get in the first round , or we want to get into the second round we want to get 16 wins
realidade , a brazilian government plan set to go into effect this year will bring largescale logging deep into the heart of the amazon rain forest for the first time , in a calculated gamble that new monitoring efforts can offset any danger of increased devastation the government of president , in an attempt to create brazil s first coherent , effective forest policy , is to begin auctioning off timber rights to large tracts of the rain forest the winning bidders will not have title to the land or the right to exploit resources other than timber , and the government says they will be closely monitored and will pay a royalty on their activities the architects of the plan say it will also help reduce tensions over land ownership in the amazon , the world s largest tropical forest , which loses an area the size of new jersey every year to clearcutting and timbering in theory , 70 percent of the jungle is public land , but miners , ranchers and especially loggers have felt free to establish themselves in unpoliced areas , strip the land of valuable resources and then move on , mostly in the socalled arc of destruction on the eastern and southern fringes of the jungle but the calledfor monitoring of the loggers allowed into the rain forest s largely untouched center will come from a new , untested forest service with only 150 employees and from state and municipal governments that concerns environmental and civic groups because local officials are more vulnerable to the pressures of powerful economic interests and to corruption further , the new system assumes that the world community will also play a part and buy timber only from merchants who are properly licensed and will avoid unscrupulous dealers the plan can be a good idea in places where the situation is already chaotic , said philip fearnside , a researcher at the national institute for amazon research in manaus who recently visited this remote area but it s a different story in areas where hardly any logging or deforestation has taken place , where you are actually going to be encouraging the introduction of predatory forces that do n't exist there now on paper and in principle , said stephan schwartzman , an amazon specialist at environmental defense in washington , i think everyone agrees that this system is an improvement over the current situation , which is totally out of control but in the end , he added , everything is going to depend on how it is done and whether the financial and human resources are there to make it work here in this small settlement called reality , along the rutted highway br319 , those resources do not yet exist , as residents have discovered when outsiders recently appeared to fish out of season , wiping out protected species and killing three manatees , the peasants here went to the authorities looking for help , only to be turned away they told us that we had to be the monitors ourselves , but we do n't have the ability to do that , said antonio marfoni , a settler there s no working phone here , and we do n't have the money or the time to be able to take the bus into town to denounce violations last october , during the final debate of the presidential campaign , the opposition candidate , geraldo alckmin , called the plan irresponsible , accused mr da silva of wanting to privatize the amazon and added , if today there is no supervision , imagine what will happen if you hand it over to the private sector though the environmental movement was one of the founding constituencies of mr da silva s workers' party , he made it clear after being reelected to another four year term that his main goal was to get the brazilian economy growing at 5 percent a year in november , he complained of all the obstacles i have with the environment and with the indian question , which he said were hindering brazil s development but the proposal s supporters dismiss criticisms as unfounded jorge viana , who is a member of mr da silva s party and was governor of the amazon state of acre until jan 1 , contends that this is one of the most important initiatives that brazil has ever adopted in the amazon precisely because you are bringing the forest under state control , not privatizing it this is a battle brazil has to win , he added there s only one way to save the forest , and that is by using it , responsibly and rationally claudio langone , executive secretary of the environment ministry , said in a telephone interview from bras lia brazil today is losing money due to the illegal exploitation of timber with this new dynamic of management , legal deforestation and sustainable development , we want to create barriers to predatory advancement and increase the value of the forest but some here fear that increased value will bring with it the kind of violence that has struck other moredeveloped areas of the amazon ivonete aparecida paes , a roman catholic nun who is the coordinator of the church s justice and peace commission in this area , said , since none of the settlers already here have titles to their tracts , that creates the possibility of greater conflicts over land ownership after much debate , it was decided that the leases would run for 30 years but paulo adario , director of greenpeace s amazon campaign , said that some species need 45 years or more to regenerate , and that loggers might thus lack an economic incentive to care properly for a tract that would no longer be theirs when the trees they replaced reached harvestable size already , there are signs of logging interests establishing themselves here a sawmill opened just down the highway in mid2005 and was operating at full capacity during a recent visit along the highway itself , there is now a clearing in which logs are piled haphazardly , like giant sticks no one has the authorization to cut so much wood , even with a forest management plan , said leila mattos , the director of pacto amaz nico , an environmental group based in humait , the closest town of any size i came by here at the beginning of november , and none of this was here this is more than a year s worth of timber in addition , peasant settlers unable to obtain land of their own in rondonia , a state south of here , have also begun moving up the highway and flocking to the area theirs is a preemptive action , aimed at establishing themselves on land that may go to logging companies later and thus forcing the government to give them other homesteads in return during an interview in humait , francisco araujo , the director of the regional office of the governmental environmental agency , said that no matter who ended up in charge of supervising the timber extraction plan , the task would be hard he complained of a shortage of gasoline and personnel and a lack of police protection for his agents in reality , these conservation areas were created without very precise field studies , mr araujo said only now are the technicians looking at the problems in the area the infrastructure is very precarious there is no equipment or physical base from which to operate , just a shack in which to stay , without a telephone in the absence of the needed resources , he said , government policy envisions a new partnership with society but those who work most closely with the peasant settlers who are being asked to bear that burden remain skeptical to think that they can monitor violations in the absence of the state is a dream , sister paes said the amazon has no tradition of the poor standing up to the powerful people simply do n't know how to do that
well , that was special , wasn t it \? the bagger has not done a word count on the season , but he is guessing there was an entire romance novel s worth , which seems reasonable when you think about it we did a lot about not much , but once disbelief was suspended , it was a simple matter to immerse ourselves in a race that ends in small golden icons and big speeches despite this thirdperson conceit of riding above it all , the bagger was as much of fanboy as anyone , hyperventilating at the slightest oscar doings of course , much of the more significant work happened in comments close readers of the blog will know this is not false modesty jhrussell , crazycris , mark klein \( always with the md , eh , doc \? \) herman scobie , stu freeman , sanfrancinema , zimmergirl and a host of others often drilled deep and came up with their own epiphanies some of you may have recalled that the bagger sent up a flair on oscar day asking for help in coming up with questions for the carpet aeneas whatever on the name took the , ah , hat for a question that combined a certain truthiness with edgy incomprehensibility if alan arkin shows up , ask him if third time s a charm , whether he gives a ! ! , and finally just out of curiosity , whether he has ever raised honeybees as a hobby then tell him , best way to get through the red carpet serpentine ! i want that hat mr , arkin , it turned out , showed little interest in responding to most of the questions asked of him , but you have to admire aeneas for doing the ask on the hat at the end of the question the hat is yours strong runnersup include crazycris , lucie in mn , jen boulden and randall david cook , who suggested that i ask abigail breslin , how much time and rehearsal did it take for her to learn her big superfreak pageant number \? the answer she said it took a while , and then she squeezed her stuffed animal and said , but it was fun by the way , she looked swell in a little beaded number fit for a beauty queen , come to think of it the bagger could pretend that he is leaving the season with regrets , but he has none happy to have played , happy to have met all the people he met and glad it s over he has nothing but admiration for the folks who have the stamina and passion to stay on top of the industry 24 7 365 , but he s thrilled to be resuming his usual seat at the movies aisle seat halfway down , big bucket of popcorn on his lap and his eyes and mouth wide open , expecting the best the competition for oscar news and analysis was more intense than ever and there were plenty of driveby s along the way , but it was all in good fun when the bagger went into the tank early for dreamgirls , he was filled with digital lead thanks for that , nikke and he d complain except that the shooters turned out to be right the bagger always assumed that he would be reflexively repelled in blogland because he takes a check from msm but in fact he was treated like everyone else linked to when he said something smart and ridiculed when he said something stupid it s a selfcleaning oven out here on the interweb best collegial regards to sasha , kris , jeffrey , anne , stu , david , tom , anthony , jessica and a host of other bloggers who flamed , linked , clarified , codified and backchanneled the bagger the bagger required all kinds of remedial education and found any number of people who make , market and promote films to spin him like a prop on a c 130 patiently school him in the nuances of the dark arts of academy campaigning he was less prone to taking the bait this year , in large part because they helped him get it right or realize he had been worked over by others his handicapping was ok , but not great the bagger got slaughtered in the smaller categories , in part because he was unwilling to vote for the awful west bank story and because , for reasons he still can t understand , he picked babel for best score he wound up guessing right in 16 categories wrong in eight \( he miscounted the other day , when he made the count as 177 \) slice the data another way the way that makes the bagger look good and he got seven of the big eight and as long as we re puffing out the chest a bit , not many people nailed the four feature awards best picture , best foreign , best animated and best doc and the bagger can t think of anyone else who got the best picture two years two complicated years in a row maybe there was a bit of luck involved , but still , that s a nice little ledge for a sophomore to take a stand on occasionally , on good days , readers got a glimpse of how power moved behind the ball gowns and shiny statues , something that is a source of professional pride here and we tried to keep the oscar race in perspective nobody at bagger hq is working toward the elimination of cancer a special thanks to those celebrities who went to the trouble of imitating human beings when the bagger interviewed them and a kiss off to all the rest you know who you are , even if you don t the bagger would try to manage up and thank his bosses , but they rarely read the blog , so why waste the pixels \? well , okay just in case you guys are great at that thing you do whatever it is ! keep doing it ! but sit still , please , for a round of collegial recognition jigar took the weight on a lot of the video , especially those cold shoots in sundance , and a bunch of other folks had to perform camera and editing magic so that no one was traumatized watching the bagger s little movies monica made sure the bagger was actually credentialed to get into the oscar michael , the film editor , used the bagger as a hand puppet when he had a good thought daniel and mekado web guys know stuff made sure the blog looked and sounded good manohla and tony schooled the bagger on real , actual films sam flyspecked copy and vetted ideas , and of course trumpets up here the magnificent , the unparalleled , the one and only baguette did all sorts of legwork and setup , making sure the bagger knew where to go next most importantly , we all thank her for deeply reported and beautifully rendered entries everyone on the beat loves the baguette , including her buddy in the bread bag the biggest shoutout has to go to peter , the bagger s brutalized editor yeah , the bagger knows there s no such thing as editors in blogs , except in this case , there is how would you like to boot up your computer in the morning and find a steaming pile of entries awaiting your attention \? peter merrily got out the shovel every time the bagger always laughed whenever a grammar ninny came flying into the blog to complain about a misdemeanor if they saw the bagger s raw copy , they would have turned to red mist on the spot peter woke up everyday at dawn \( well , early , anyway \) to bake some nice , hot blog items so the rest of you had something to go with your morning coffee we all owe him , the bagger most of all so , the bagger will be back or he won t he s done predicting how things will go tomorrow in the media world , let alone next year in the meantime , as robert altman would say , see you in the next reel
report by the department of state s future of project , may 2002 it has become conventional wisdom that the decision to disband s army was a mistake , was contrary to american prewar planning and was a decision i made on my own in fact the policy was carefully considered by top civilian and military members of the american government and it was the right decision by the time baghdad fell on april 9 , 2003 , the iraqi army had simply dissolved on april 17 gen john abizaid , the deputy commander of the army s central command , reported in a video briefing to officials in washington that there are no organized iraqi military units left the disappearance of saddam hussein s old army rendered irrelevant any prewar plans to use that army so the question was whether the coalition provisional authority should try to recall it or to build a new one open to both vetted members of the old army and new recruits general abizaid favored the second approach in the weeks after general abizaid s recommendation , the coalition s national security adviser , walter slocombe , discussed options with top officials in the pentagon , including deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz they recognized that to recall the former army was a practical impossibility because postwar looting had destroyed all the bases moreover , the largely shiite draftees of the army were not going to respond to a recall plea from their former commanders , who were primarily sunnis it was also agreed that recalling the army would be a political disaster because to the vast majority of iraqis it was a symbol of the old baathistled sunni ascendancy on may 8 , 2003 , before i left for iraq , secretary of defense donald rumsfeld gave me a memo titled principles for iraqpolicy guidelines that specified that the coalition will actively oppose saddam hussein s old enforcers the baath party , fedayeen saddam , etc and that we will make clear that the coalition will eliminate the remnants of saddam s regime the next day mr rumsfeld told me that he had sent the principles paper to the national security adviser and the secretary of state meanwhile , walter slocombe s consultations with americans officials in washington and baghdad showed that they understood that the only viable course was to build a new , professional force open to screened members of the old army mr slocombe drafted an order to accomplish these objectives i sent a preliminary draft of this order to the secretary of defense on may 9 the next day i sent the draft to the defense department s general counsel , william j haynes , as well as to mr wolfowitz the under secretary for policy , douglas feith the head of central command , gen tommy franks and to the coalition s top civil administrator at the time , jay garner , asking for comments on may 13 , en route to baghdad , mr slocombe briefed senior british officials in london who told him they recognized that the demobilization of the iraqi military is a fait accompli his report added that if some uk officers or officials think that we should try to rebuild or reassemble the old ra \( republican army \) , they did not give any hint of it in our meetings , and in fact agreed with the need for vigorous debaathification , especially in the security sector over the following week , mr slocombe continued discussions about the planned order with top pentagon officials , including mr feith during that same period , lt gen david mckiernan , the field commander of the coalition forces in iraq , received and cleared the draft order i briefed secretary rumsfeld on the issue several times , and forwarded a final draft of the proposed order for his approval on may 19 walter slocombe subsequently received detailed comments on the draft order incorporating the views of the joint chiefs of staff and the office of the secretary of defense , making clear that the top civilian and military staff in the pentagon , as well as the commanders in the field , had reviewed the proposal another coalition adviser , dan senor , spent the night of may 22 coordinating the text of the announcement with mr rumsfeld s close adviser lawrence di rita apart from minor edits to the order , none of the military or civilian officials raised objections to the proposal to create a new iraqi army or to formally dissolve saddam hussein s security apparatus on may 22 , i sent to president bush , through secretary rumsfeld , my first report since arriving in iraq i reviewed our activities since arrival , including our debaathification policy i then alerted the president that i will parallel this step with an even more robust measure dissolving saddam s military and intelligence structures the same day , i briefed the president on the plan via secure video the president sent me a note on may 23 in which he thanked me for my report and noted that you have my full support and confidence the decision not to recall saddam hussein s army was thoroughly considered by top officials in the american government at the time , this decision was not controversial when mr slocombe held a press conference in baghdad on may 23 to explain the decision , only two reporters showed up neither of them americans the first i heard of doubts about the decision was in the fall of 2003 after the insurgency had picked up speed moreover , we were right to build a new iraqi army despite all the difficulties encountered , iraq s new professional soldiers are the country s most effective and trusted security force by contrast , the baathistera police force , which we did recall to duty , has proven unreliable and is mistrusted by the very iraqi people it is supposed to protect

these are not the best of times , fiscally speaking , in the great state of new jersey years of irresponsible borrowing by legislators and governors of both political parties have confronted the state with billions and billions of dollars of debt unfunded pension costs alone are estimated to be more than 50 billion even so , we urge voters to approve two major bond issues on their election day ballots one would authorize the borrowing of 200 million to save some of what s left of the state s rapidly diminishing open space the other would permit borrowing 450 million for stem cell research that , sadly , president bush has prohibited the federal government from financing of course we have misgivings the state is in a terrible financial bind , which gov jon corzine , if not many of the legislators , freely acknowledges but the open space and stem cells proposals address needs so compelling that they cannot be ignored the open space proposal is urgent the state cannot postpone acquiring open space because in a few years there will be almost none left to buy the stem cell proposal touches a moral issue it is simply unconscionable not to provide money to study the possibility that embryonic stem cells could lead to cures for alzheimer s and parkinson s diseases , spinal injuries and other afflictions with rightwing politics , abortion foes and religious zealots having successfully pressured the bush administration not to underwrite research , states like california and new jersey have no choice but to pick up some of the burden the open space bond issue is a watereddown version of an excellent proposal that would have authorized the state to borrow 175 million a year for the next decade to continue its highly successful and popular program for acquiring undeveloped land mr corzine blocked that plan , not because he did not like it , but because he wanted to straighten out the state s fiscal mess first he decided instead on a oneyear , 200 million borrowing proposal as a stopgap conservation issues aside , there is a sound fiscal reason for voters to approve it because of the housing slump , land prices have sunk many developers are facing cashflow problems and may be willing to sell some of their land to the state at bargain prices that opportunity will evaporate as the housing market rebounds the 450 million stem cell bond issue would be in addition to 270 million in borrowing , authorized by the legislature last year , for new stem cell facilities and work in new brunswick , newark , camden , allendale and belleville the new money would provide 45 million a year for 10 years to support the actual work of the scientists in a perfect world , the legislature would provide this money on a yeartoyear basis , as operating funds should be but the upside of a bond issue is that it ensures that the research will continue , rather than be subject to the whimsy of trenton s politicians voters should also bear in mind that approval of the bond issue is likely to provide a huge shot in the arm for the state s economy a study by professor joseph seneca of the edward j bloustein school of planning and public policy at rutgers estimated that the state could gain more than 2 billion in economic benefits from its investment and 30 , 000 new jobs many of them of the highpaying variety that new jersey has been losing there is one ballot proposal that is manifestly a bad idea last year , voters set aside half the proceeds of the onecent increase in the state s sales tax for local property tax relief this year s proposal would dedicate all of the proceeds to property tax relief this is the sort of thing the politicians in trenton love it looks as if they are doing something to solve a major problem in this case high property taxes when in fact they are doing nothing it does not take a genius to figure out that if the state takes money from its budget to pay for local property tax relief , it is simply robbing peter to pay paul to his credit , governor corzine has already warned that the state could face a budget gap as large as 35 billion next year if approved by voters , this ballot question would only make things worse

washington , july 16 senator was the guest of honor at a dinner at the luxurious mark hopkins hotel in san francisco this spring with a few hundred lawyers , executives and investors the guests drank a boutique beer with mr obama s face on the label and contributed more than 1 million in 2 , 300 checks to support his bid for the democratic presidential nomination just moments before he arrived , mr obama had said goodbye to a less exclusive crowd of 10 , 000 that had gathered to hear him speak across the bay in oakland they paid nothing to hear him , but spent 40 , 000 on obama tshirts , baseball caps , buttons and other knickknacks and the obama campaign registered each of the purchasers as one of the record 258 , 000 contributors it signed up in the first six months of the year since he got into the race , mr obama has hopscotched from bigticket to bigcrowd events across the country , trying to turn the early excitement about his candidacy into campaign cash and a national political organization like other candidates , he has worked hard to cultivate a network of bundlers , who can solicit the checks from individual donors for the legal maximum of 2 , 300 that are the mainstay of any major campaign but to capitalize on his celebrity , mr obama s campaign has also employed novel tactics like counting sales of 5 speech tickets or 450 obama key chains as individual contributions to pump up his numbers and transform grassroots enthusiasm into more useful forms of support no other campaign is known to have listed paraphernalia sales as donations the combination has enabled mr obama to raise more money for his primary campaign in the first six months of the year 584 million than any other candidate in either party just as important , his campaign advisers say , he has built a unique roster of small donors who may give again or volunteer as the race continues , and which enables them to portray his campaign as powered by a vast army of regular people across the country mr obama s early lead in fundraising is by no means a guarantee of success when the voting starts next year but his campaign s ability to harness the energy of its early supporters and outpace even the wellestablished fundraising machine that mrs clinton brought to the race seems to have settled any question of whether mr obama of illinois , after only two years in the senate , could hold his own in a field of candidates with more national experience and exposure of the 33 million mr obama raised in the second quarter , about a third consisted of donations of less than 200 more than the 10 million raised in 2 , 300 checks from big donors mrs clinton , in contrast , raised 23 million in donations of less than 200 contributions of 2 , 300 made up 123 million or more than half of the 215 million that she raised for the primary during the second quarter both candidates now have about the same amount of cash to spend on the primary mr obama s roster of 258 , 000 donors has exceeded the national mailing list that mrs clinton accumulated through her two senate races and bill clinton s two runs for the white house none of the other primary candidates in either party has claimed more than 100 , 000 individual donors in some ways , mr obama s donor base differed from those of his rivals an analysis of his federal election commission filing using census data by zip code found that in the 3 , 210 zip codes with the largest proportion of black residents at least 25 percent mr obama led the other candidates for both parties in money raised in the first half of the year he received 52 million from those zip codes in the first half of the year , while mrs clinton received about 3 million while polls suggest that mr obama at this early stage is running particularly strong among welleducated and affluent people , the analysis found that the contributions he was required to report to the federal election commission those of at least 200 came from areas with an average household income of 102 , 000 a year that was roughly in the middle range for all the leading candidates in both parties , somewhat more affluent than those of former senator john edwards s and somewhat less affluent than mrs clinton s david plouffe , mr obama s campaign manager , said the campaign saw multiple advantages in events like the 25aticket rally that attracted 3 , 500 to hear mr obama speak on june 29 in minneapolis it raised about 87 , 500 , but minnesota is also one of the enlarged cluster of states expected to hold their primary elections on feb 5 although all the candidates will have plenty of staff members on salary in the first states of iowa and new hampshire , mr plouffe said , minnesota is a state where the campaign will have to depend much more heavily on volunteers obviously we raised a good amount of money , and for a lot of these people it wo n't be the last time they give , he said and it is also going to be the foundation of an organization as for the obama merchandise , sold mainly through the campaign s web site , mr plouffe said it had brought it several hundred thousand dollars it has been a real source of revenue for us , he said and obviously you still get people wearing your hats and displaying your bumper stickers tickets and merchandise sales have added at least tens of thousands of names to mr obama s donor rolls mr obama also attracted crowds of 20 , 000 in austin , tex , and atlanta and 10 , 000 in cleveland and los angeles , with similarly brisk sales in obama gear at each of them in 16 other cities , his campaign says , it has sold tickets for 5 to 35 for events that attracted a total of 42 , 500 people about 15 percent of his roster of contributors and the campaign sent each ticket or tshirt buyer an email message inviting him to forward a solicitation to each name in his email address book , capitalizing on contributors' social ties instead of paying for email lists what is more , even while building his database of small donors , mr obama has relied on a relatively conventional network of big donors for a majority of his money even with his public emphasis on small donors , mr obama raised about 29 million about half his total fundraising for the first six months of the year from donors who gave more than 1 , 500 one of his campaign s first recruits around the start of the year was julianna smoot , his finance director , who oversaw recordbreaking fundraising for the democratic senatorial campaign committee in 2006 and senator john edwards s strong early fundraising for the 2004 campaign one of the highestpaid employees on mr obama s campaign payroll , she earned about 34 , 000 a quarter , according to his filings ms smoot brought extensive connections to veteran democratic fundraisers around the country , and by the second quarter the obama campaign had enlisted 134 socalled bundlers adept at collecting 2 , 300 checks from wealthy friends and associates , according to a list disclosed on the campaign s web site mr obama has also collected large sums from the employees of a relatively small number of companies one big employer of mr obama s donors was the investment bank ubs , whose top executive in the united states , robert wolf , is a prominent obama fundraiser ubs employees gave mr obama about 195 , 000 in the first six months of the year i think he is a machine , james torrey , a new york investment fund manager who is another obama bundler , said of mr wolf he just walks into the trading room and glared and they all grab for their checkbooks \( mr wolf said that he did not press anyone but that his close relationship with mr obama may have made it easier for ubs employees to contribute \) still , several of mr obama s fundraisers , who gathered in chicago on monday to celebrate their success , said the image of mr obama s army of small contributors had quickly become an advantage in asking for big checks as well people want to be part of a cause , said john roos , a silicon valley lawyer who helped organize the event at the mark hopkins hotel we all feel that we are part of something much bigger than any individual , and barack makes us feel that way

washington , aug 18 during billy wagner s freeagent autumn of 2005 , he and his wife , sarah , discussed which team could best help him attain his three intertwined career goals aside from winning a world series title , wagner felt that playing in new york would help him record the 116 saves he needed to reach 400 that , and the increased visibility that came from playing with the , would put him in good position to make the hall of fame but at the time , wagner also calculated that he could arrive at the 400save plateau within three years , at which point , he said saturday , he might consider retiring a year before his fouryear , 43 million contract was set to expire it s a possibility , said wagner , repeating comments he made in saturday s editions of the richmond timesdispatch it depends on my family there is good reason to believe him the 36yearold wagner , who has four children , none older than 9 , is looking forward to his retirement plans , which include spending time at his alpaca farm in virginia and fading from public view unlike his affable teammate tom glavine , who has said that he would be interested in a television job , wagner has said several times that reporters should get their fill of him now because he will not be around once his career ends with a guaranteed 105 million and an 8 million team option for 2010 , wagner also said that he would have no problem walking away from the money i only asked for three years , wagner said the fourth year and the option was my agent and the mets that had nothing to do with me like glavine , however , wagner feels a strong pull toward milestones and his place in baseball history only four other relievers trevor hoffman , lee smith , mariano rivera and john franco have 400 saves after saturday s save against the nationals , wagner has 353 in his career , including 29 this season wagner saved 38 in 2005 for philadelphia , 40 last season and is on pace to save about nine more this season that would put him at 362 wagner said it would be difficult not to return in 2009 if he needed only a few saves to reach 400 but asked whether he would retire if he hit that mark but was still searching for the world series ring , wagner shrugged it s such a distant thought , wagner said i ca n't get past today right now the catching tandem of mike difelice and sandy alomar jr , began the season at class aaa new orleans they are teammates again , this time at the major league level , filling in for the injured ram n castro and paul lo duca through at least the next week it s funny , alomar said now you see the reasons why you 've got to have insurance the mets recalled alomar before saturday s game to replace castro , who was placed on the disabled list because of an arthritic back the move was retroactive to aug 13 castro had been steadily improving until friday , when he aggravated the injury while running before the game castro is scheduled to begin his rehabilitation monday in port st lucie , fla for me , it was the right decision , and the team , too , castro said of going on the dl the mets flew alomar to pittsburgh on wednesday in case they placed castro on the disabled list , but sent him back to new orleans when castro had made progress for six or seven days , i was in a holding pattern , alomar said alomar missed a few games earlier this month with a bruised rib , but he said he was fully healed manager willie randolph said difelice , a strong defensive player who has provided an unexpected boost by batting 261 with five runs batted in , would continue to receive the bulk of the playing time carlos delgado , held out of the lineup for a third consecutive game with a hyperextended left knee , took ground balls at first base and hit in the batting cage willie randolph said he would like to start him sunday , as long as delgado did not feel discomfort after his workout lastings milledge \( flulike symptoms \) rejoined the lineup after a twogame absence
john harlin iii was 9 years old when a frayed rope sliced over a rough edge of limestone , sending his father plunging 4 , 000 feet to his death it was the winter of 1966 , and john harlin ii s climbing team was nearing the end of a grueling siege against a new route on perhaps the biggest , most notorious mountain wall in europe the north face of the eiger , in the swiss alps none of the other climbers witnessed the accident they were all above the broken rope but when news of the calamity was radioed through , they decided to complete the new direct route in harlin s memory , battling through a storm to reach the summit on the day of his funeral i thought of the harlins' story when producers for macgillivray freeman films asked me to write the script for the first imax movie on the alps their charge was simple they wanted to capture avalanches , , history , geography , science , skiing , bungee jumping , mountaineering and landscape visuals on a scale never seen before in a 40minute documentary and , on top of all that , they wanted drama , a real human story that tugged at the heart strings when that rope broke on the eiger , it ripped apart a family , shattering the harlins' idyllic life in switzerland john returned to the united states with his mother and sister , but the wilderness legacy never ceased he spent school holidays camping and fishing in the arctic then , as a student in california , he took up rock climbing and loved it he graduated to bigger mountains when a climbing partner was killed in the rockies , john promised his mother that he would give up serious mountaineering , sparing her the possibility of a second devastating bereavement when i got to know john in 1994 , he told me about that promise a promise he knew he might break almost in the same breath , he asked me about the north face of the eiger , which i had climbed myself for me there had been no personal family resonance only the ambition of any keen mountaineer to experience the most famous wall in the alps this concave triangle of striated limestone over a mile high has charisma in abundance at a purely physical level it is mesmerizing but more compelling than that are the sediments of myth and legend that lie on every ledge to climb the eiger is to follow in the steps of climbing legends , to witness the hinterstoisser traverse , where toni kurz hung on a rope , freezing to death just 20 feet from his wouldbe rescuers , in 1936 to sleep at the tiny niche of death bivouac , where the very first eiger candidates perished in a freak storm in 1935 to continue , if you are blessed with luckier weather , up the intricate ramp , the waterfall pitch , the dizzy traverse of the gods , the gloomy icefield of the spider and , finally , the exit cracks , where a brilliant bavarian named anderl heckmair led the first team to success in 1938 he was rewarded by a victory parade with adolf hitler fascist overtones might have soured the first ascent , but most serious alpinists still dreamt of making a pilgrimage on heckmair s path john harlin ii was the first american to succeed , in 1962 , five years before returning to attempt his illfated direct route more than three decades later , john harlin iii , despite that promise to his mother , also wanted to experience the eiger for himself , to climb the face where his father spent his last days bad weather thwarted his first two attempts by the time i was drafting my imax script in 2004 , he had still not succeeded i worked at my script , wondering whether the ace german climber robert jasper and his wife , daniela , might make good partners for john i sent an email to john to ask nervously whether he would consider doing his climb for imax cameras , with the jaspers at that very moment he was in switzerland making another thwarted attempt on the eiger , with none other than robert jasper yes , he said , he was prepared to become a film star as for the producers , they liked the story and they liked john along with his climbing skill , he had inherited his father s good looks but where john harlin ii had been driven , egotistical and , at times , downright pugnacious , john harlin iii was a gentler blend of yin and yang he was more introspective and better suited to voicing current fears about the climateinduced disintegration of the alps my final shooting script was a huge gamble the north face of the eiger is notoriously fickle , frequently rebuffing the world s most experienced climbers with stonefall , storms and avalanches there was a risk that harlin and the jaspers would never succeed in the allotted time frame as for shooting them on a big , unwieldy imax camera , with its intricate film spools that last only 90 seconds , i could not have chosen a more difficult location but the gamble yielded a famous payoff john finally achieved his dream , climbing the wall where his father died 40 years earlier his wife , arlene , and their 8yearold daughter , siena , were at the foot of the wall , watching and waiting their reaction was an integral part of the film and even his mother , realizing how important this climb was to him , allowed her son to break his promise
on grand slam , a singleelimination tournament of gameshow champions that will be broadcast on gsn starting tonight , the questions are often difficult they encompass algebraic equations , geometric proofs and anagrams for irish playwrights but no question is tougher than the one viewers may ask what is dennis miller doing here \? is that cerebral , critically acclaimed , multipleemmywinning comedian \( a \) slumming as a gameshow host , \( b \) in career free fall or \( c \) acting as a sort of metahost in an ironic commentary on the gameshow genre \? the answer becomes clear pretty fast it s \( d \) none of the above mr miller is here to be funny contestants meet for four lightning rounds per halfhour while they race against the clock , mr miller formulates what he calls observations , which he shares between rounds thus grand slam \( with the purse of 100 , 000 \) becomes as entertaining as it is fastpaced we watch the competition to see whether , say , the jeopardy ! winner will beat the world series of pop culture winner , and we watch mr miller to see if he can make up good jokes really quickly sometimes he s on , and sometimes , like the contestants he s analyzing , he blows it after the pop culture winner , a 23yearold named victor lee , loses a round against the jeopardy ! phenomenon ken jennings , partly for missing an astronomy question , mr miller says that this is evidence that it never serves one well to utter the word uranus' that s funny but when mr miller says , i have seen ken jennings in a bathing suit and he makes borat look like giselle b ndchen , his humor seems both forced and mean he loses that round later he makes a sly penis joke , and an even slyer one about the female anatomy mostly , mr miller is clean and straightforward , like a guy doing color commentary at an nfl game he sits at an anchor desk with amanda byram , who has been the host of the fox reality shows the swan and paradise hotel as ms byram plays paula abdul to mr miller s simon cowell , mr miller notes which contestants look like deer in the headlights , and which ones have confidence when a lowerseeded player surprises a top seed , mr miller seems as awed as a genuine fan that s touching , like seeing voldemort pet a kitten mr miller is usually so caustic that it s hard to believe he s not secretly wishing that he could say devastating things about these brilliant but often awkward human search engines that he does n't is partly a tribute to mr miller and partly a comment on the increasingly heartfelt and sincere tenor of our time also , mr miller may truly be impressed that these people know things he does n't
at a recent dinner in a fancy restaurant , my braised lamb shanks were served pulled off the bone and molded into a neat little brick the silken shreds of meat were so soft and succulent that neither knife nor teeth were required technically correct and perfectly executed , it held my interest for all of three bites and then i got bored those supple , homogeneous morsels slid too easily across my tongue with nary a struggle there were no elastic bits of gristle , no chewy tidbits of fat , no bones to nibble and gnaw my companion , however , was in his own private carnivore s heaven spooning up the tender remains from my plate , he sighed with pleasure no gristle , no fat , no bones ! remembering this scene the next time i made my way to the kitchen to braise some lamb , i decided i wanted a dish that was flexible enough to delight both bone pickers and leavers i started with the cut i needed a piece of meat that had some bones , but not too many shanks and legs are too bigboned stew meat and loin , too spineless after a chat with the butcher , i settled on shoulder chops each chop contained a few small gnawable bones , and plenty of velvety meat that would slip right off them after a long , gentle braise \( you could substitute entirely boneless stew meat if all your guests share the same bonefree ideal \) next , i needed to puzzle out the seasonings winter s persistence made me envious of other people s exotic vacations , so i focused on places i would rather be , like morocco it s warmer there , and they braise their lamb with fragrant , bloodheating spices a lamb tagine , infused with aromatics and dried sweet fruit , began to take shape in my mind out came the cookbooks , starting with paul wolfert s classic , couscous and other good food from morocco \( william morrow , 1987 \) as i skimmed the 30 recipes for tagine the name for both a traditional slowcooked stew and the conicalcovered pot it stews in i noticed that while elements of each recipe intrigued , there was none in particular that contained them all so i cherrypicked , stealing ground ginger and cinnamon sticks from a vegetable tagine , mixing in green olives , cumin and paprika from lamb tagine with lemons and olives , and adding saffron because nearly all the recipes called for either that or turmeric , of which i had none i settled on dried apricots as the fruit because their sunny hue had warmer connotations than , say , prunes in terms of tagine technique , recipes varied widely , though all were cooked in their eponymous pot i even briefly considered feeding my kitchenware addiction and running out to buy a tagine \( several manufacturers , including allclad , make them \) but common sense and my sturdy dutch oven prevailed following ms wolfert s directions , i heated the lamb and spices in the pot on the stove just long enough to release the aromas , but not long enough to brown the meat having been schooled in the belief that properly browned meat was an essential building block for any sauce , i was a little dubious but skipping the browning also saved me 20 stovesplattering minutes , so i decided to give it a try after everything came to a simmer , i covered the pot and popped it in the oven and continued reading about tagines some were cooked in enough butter to keep for a month , preserved beneath a coating of honey , spices and fat somewhat like a confit riffing on the butter theme , i decided to garnish the tagine with butterfried almonds when the meat was soft enough to fall away from the bones , the tagine was ready , and i served it over mounds of fluffy couscous , heaping the fleshy lamb chunks on my friend s plate and the bony bits on mine then i drizzled buttered almonds over it all both the butter and almonds had turned golden brown , taking on a nutty , roasted , caramelized flavor , almost like what browned meat would have contributed to the sauce , but gentler and sweeter the spices had mellowed , the onions softened , the olives and apricots melted into the sauce as ms wolfert likes to write , it was really very good but best of all , we each got to eat our meat exactly the way we like it , and all from one pot lamb tagine with apricots , olives and buttered almonds time 2 hours 4 pounds bonein lamb shoulder or neck , or 21 4 pounds boneless lamb stew meat , cut into 2inch chunks 4 garlic cloves , minced 1 1 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 1 teaspoon ground ginger teaspoon ground cumin 2 large spanish onions , peeled and quartered 2 cinnamon sticks , each 2 inches long large pinch crumbled saffron 1 1 4 cups dried apricots , sliced 1 cup cracked green olives , pitted and sliced if desired 2 to 4 tablespoons butter 1 3 cup sliced almonds cooked couscous , for serving chopped parsley or cilantro , for garnish 1 preheat oven to 325 degrees trim excess fat off lamb put meat in a deep dutch oven or castiron pot with the garlic , salt , black pepper , paprika , ginger and cumin rub spices and garlic evenly all over meat 2 thinly slice onions , then mince enough of them to yield 1 2 cup add minced onion to pot with lamb reserve onion slices 3 place pot over high heat and let cook , turning meat on all sides , until spices release their scent , about 3 minutes you need not brown meat add 3 cups water to pot \( it should come 3 4 of the way up lamb \) , along with cinnamon and saffron bring to a simmer , then cover pot and transfer to oven let braise for 45 minutes 4 turn meat , then top with onion slices cover pot and braise for another 45 minutes to an hour , or until lamb is very tender use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a bowl , leaving broth and onions in pot 5 place pot on stove over high heat and add 3 4 cup apricots and the olives simmer broth until it reduces by a third and thickens slightly , about 10 minutes return lamb to pot and keep warm until serving \( tagine can be prepared 4 days ahead chill , then remove fat and reheat before serving \) 6 to serve , chop remaining 1 2 cup apricot slices in a small skillet , melt butter add almonds and cook until well browned and toasted , about 2 minutes put couscous in a serving bowl and top with almonds and butter and chopped apricots pile tagine in center of couscous and garnish with herbs yield 6 servings photo by way of marrakesh lamb

to the editor re , by judea pearl \( oped , jan 17 \) had i space and time , i would rebut all of mr pearl s charges against al jazeera english , but let me engage a few of them here we do not mix news coverage and extremist propagandizing in fact , we present nothing but the highestquality news and documentary material and no extremist propagandizing , except when such content is labeled as such in news coverage suicide attacks have never been called martyrdom operations , commando attacks or , most absurd of all , paradise operations neither the presence nor the ideology of the cleric sheik yusuf alqaradawi has ever appeared on our programming nor do al jazeera english s editors portray a struggle between an evilmeaning western oppressor and its helpless , righteous arab victims for example , our aggressive coverage holding both fatah and hamas responsible for recent gaza violence has drawn criticism and threats from both sides on my own behalf , the suggestion that this wellrespected western anchor has pumped subliminally to my viewers a confusion of information and deception is unsupported by any evidence , because there is none we welcome the scrutiny of news organizations , and even more , the criticisms of viewers all we ask is that they be based on the reality of our work and not some nightmare cartoon of it david marash washington , jan 18 , 2007  to the editor judea pearl writes that it is important for our news organizations to scrutinize al jazeera s content and let its viewers know when antiwestern wishes are subverting objective truth but our news organizations have let western governments mislead them about intelligence on weapons that iraq did not possess , and have lost the respect of many in the arab world for failing to report on the israelipalestinian conflict in an evenhanded manner many news organizations give over their airwaves or printed pages to those calling for more violent attacks on muslim countries like iran it is simply delusional to believe that the western media have a monopoly on objective truth that they can employ to evaluate those with a different perspective steven sherman carrboro , nc , jan 17 , 2007  to the editor judea pearl makes an important point in noting the risk that al jazeera english may simply be a propagandist mouthpiece that speaks impeccable english but he does not mention an equally or perhaps more important point what al jazeera english broadcasts to the west , in our language , is simply not what al jazeera broadcasts to its arabicspeaking viewers yasir arafat was often accused of offering peace in english while simultaneously urging jihad in arabic news stations are certainly not immune to these same tendencies ory sandel berkeley , calif , jan 17 , 2007
atlanta , april 15 when north carolina s attorney general said last week that an overreaching prosecutor lacked the evidence to support charges of rape against three former duke university lacrosse players , some in this neighboring state hoped that tremors from his pronouncement would help free a former star high school football player but as s legislative session neared a close , the odds were against them the former football player , genarlow wilson , is serving 10 years without parole for having consensual oral sex with a 15yearold girl at a new year s eve party , an offense that constituted aggravated child molesting even though he was 17 at the time the mandatory sentence shocked even the jury that convicted him state law has since been changed to make most consensual sex between teenagers a misdemeanor but the courts have ruled that the new law does not apply to mr wilson , and the district attorney in his case , david mcdade of douglas county , has opposed efforts this session to pass a law that would allow judges to review earlier cases and to revise sentences six young men basically gangraped a 17yearold and had repeated sex acts with a 15yearold , mr mcdade , told channel 11 , the local nbc affiliate , in march there s no member of the legislature that i think would condone that behavior but the jury in mr wilson s case disagreed with mr mcdade s depiction after being repeatedly shown a home videotape of sex , drugs and alcohol at the new year s eve party in a hotel room in douglas county , they acquitted mr wilson of rape the five other young men at the party have pleaded guilty to lesser charges none have been convicted of rape this is the same thing that happened in the duke rape case , where some prosecutor exaggerated the facts out of selfinterest , said b j bernstein , mr wilson s lawyer the attorney general in north carolina , roy a cooper , called the prosecutor there , michael b nifong , a rogue ms bernstein has called on georgia s attorney general , thurbert e baker , to review the wilson case and not to oppose a habeas corpus petition she filed last week state senator emanuel d jones , a democrat who sponsored the bill to help mr wilson , now 21 , said that the legislature s intent with the first law had been to help mr wilson although the new bill had been approved by the judiciary committee , it was deliberately put near the end of a list of legislation that had to be taken up by a certain day in order to be considered by the house in this session , mr jones said , a common tactic for avoiding votes on controversial issues the senate adjourned before taking up that bill and one that would have kept employers from forbidding workers to leave guns in their cars at work the judicial review bill was opposed by the senate president pro tem , eric johnson , a republican these predators violated the law , mr johnson wrote in a column in the atlanta journalconstitution police arrested them district attorneys chose to prosecute them juries convicted them the legislature should not secondguess the process mr johnson s column continued a backandforth between the courts and the legislature , with each essentially blaming the other for the young man s continued imprisonment mr wilson , who was also an honor student and homecoming king , has served more than two years mr jones said in a telephone interview on friday that he had been prepared to amend the bill to address some of mr johnson s concerns , including narrowing the number of cases that could be reviewed there are 92 people in georgia serving sentences for child molesting they committed when they and their victims were teenagers , mr jones said , and under the bill it would have been up to judges to determine if the encounters were consensual and merited new sentences mr jones said he was troubled by comments that legislators briefed by mr mcdade had made about the case their comments are selective it s like they 're trying to try this kid all over again , he said the reason he is n't out of prison is because he s black mr mcdade , a regular presence in the capitol as a representative for georgia s prosecutors , did not return a call to his office late friday afternoon but he spoke to the new york times in december , when the georgia supreme court declined to hear mr wilson s appeal he maintained that what happened in the hotel room was worse than supporters of mr wilson had led the public to believe this is n't just a case of consensual teenagers petting each other and their moms found out mr mcdade said that mr wilson had been ill advised by people who have their own agenda , and who had encouraged him not to plead guilty to a lesser crime but he acknowledged that the deals offered would have left mr wilson a registered sex offender he also objected to accusations that race played a role in mr wilson s predicament how can it be racist to prosecute for raping and attacking africanamerican victims \? he said
if you know only one thing about candace parker , it s this she dunks and not infrequently over the past year , parker , the s 6foot4 guard forward center , has singlehandedly eclipsed the total number of dunks in the history of women s basketball \( that s six jams to three , if you 're scoring at home \) parker pulled off her first dunk at age 15 at 17 , she whupped five male contestants including the future denver nuggets starter j r smith in the slam dunk contest at the mcdonald s allamerican high school game and last year , parker became the first woman to throw down in an ncaa tournament game , dunking twice during a win over army of course , none of this was entirely unexpected parker first picked up a basketball when she was still in diapers , she says , and grew up playing against boys , including her older brothers her very good older brothers one of whom , anthony , now plays for the toronto raptors she went on to a high school career , in naperville , ill , that is already legend \( a twotime usa today national player of the year , she signed her college letter of intent live on espn \) now a redshirt sophomore for one of the best teams in america , parker has managed to overcome two knee surgeries to emerge as a southeastern conference star , leading the league in scoring and blocked shots the dunking only begins to hint at candace parker s style , a freeflowing game that defies position and is almost guaranteed to carry her beyond the ncaa and into the professional ranks ever since i started playing basketball , there s been the option to play after college , parker says of the wnba , now in its 10th year that opportunity to get paid to play , parker says , has kept her and other young women like her working on their skills , elevating them , marrying the structure and fundamentals of the organized game with the faster and freer artistry of the schoolyard , once the exclusive province of swaggering males no current female player has merged those styles better than parker as the hall of fame player nancy lieberman says , she is literally changing the game as we know it to keep pace , lieberman says , the best female players play like guys or like candace parker \? \? \? melissa king
those were grim days for race relations in new york city , the early 1990s there were nearly 2 , 000 murders each year , blacks and whites died in highprofile racial killings , and a riot held a divided brooklyn neighborhood in thrall for three dangerous nights on jan 9 , 1994 , another match landed in this tinderbox a caller reported a burglary at a harlem mosque the police ran in , and nation of islam guards threw punches and broke an officer s nose the mosque s minister , accompanied by the rev al sharpton , drove downtown to register their outrage with the police commissioner , a street theater ritual grudgingly tolerated by past mayors except the new mayor , fresh off his november victory over the city s first black mayor , david n dinkins decreed that no one would meet with mr sharpton no more antics , no more provocations i 've taken a golden opportunity to act like a sensible mayor rather than a mayor who will be moved in any direction , he said i'm an observer of the last 10 years of this city , and i hope to god we do n't continue in that direction more than any other republican running for president , mr giuliani has confronted the question of race , that most torturous of american legacies his 1993 mayoral campaign slogan , often repeated , of one city , one standard , emphasized his view that no ethnic or racial group should expect special treatment and he spoke with a stunning bluntness about what he saw as the failings of the city s black leadership his handling of the mosque fracas set the tone in the years to come , mr giuliani would rebuff not just the histrionic mr sharpton but nearly every highranking black official in the city , even those of moderate politics congressmen , a state comptroller , influential ministers but grabbing hold of the race dial proved easier than turning it to his will i never thought rudy giuliani was a racist , said fran reiter , one of mr giuliani s deputy mayors but he was obsessed with the notion there were certain groups he could n't win over and he was n't even going to try black leaders , mr giuliani said in 1994 , had to learn how to discipline themselves in the way in which they speak if they expected to chat with him the city s welfarestate philosophy , he said later , was racist and enslaved black new yorkers we in this city went through years and years of subdividing people , and that became the most important thing , the subdivision people belonged to , mr giuliani said certainly he knew such words resonated with white voters who formed the backbone of his electoral coalition what is less certain is whether a man raised and schooled in a white world understood the force with which his harshest words rained down on black new yorkers new york city is 45 percent white and 27 percent black , according to 2000 census figures he was not patronizing , he was not na ve and i admired that , said michael meyers , president of the new york civil rights coalition , who once advised him but he could play on the edge of old racial antipathies mr giuliani s policies , too , stirred anger his decision to drive down the welfare rolls by cutting benefits and tightening eligibility standards and his deep cuts in social agencies infuriated many black voters applauded the drop in crime , but rough police tactics often inflamed tensions mr giuliani did not respond to repeated requests made in the last few weeks to discuss his views on race mr giuliani , aides say , found a city in the early 1990s where most of the departments affecting the lives of black new yorkers from schools to welfare to public safety were dysfunctional too many citizens expected government to coddle them , and too many black leaders , said peter powers , one of mr giuliani s oldest friends and his first deputy mayor , were afraid to work publicly with a white republican mayor so mr giuliani was intent on marginalizing these critics even if he had to shun much of the black establishment mr powers said you are talking about some of the people who had been around for a while maybe we thought someone else deserved that role perhaps but black leaders say mr giuliani , in declining to talk with them , succeeded in isolating himself he just drew a line and said , anyone who represents the black community , all of the elected officials , are irresponsible and i wo n't meet with you , ' said former state comptroller h carl mccall , a black democrat who had a long record of building alliances with whites if you 're the leader of the city , you really ca n't justify that it is one of the more intriguing what ifs in city politics in 1989 , adviser leaned across a lunch table and put this proposition to bill lynch , a liberal graybeard would mr lynch , who is black , consider working in the mayoral campaign of rudolph w giuliani \? that was not so incongruous an offer as it sounds now many saw the incumbent , mayor edward i koch , then seeking a fourth term , as a racially divisive figure they thought rudy could form a winning blackwhite catholic coalition , mr lynch recalled they figured if they could attract someone like me , they could pull africanamerican voters because koch was anathema to blacks mr lynch instead managed the campaign of mr dinkins , who upset mr koch in the 1989 democratic primary the giuliani of this period was longer on ambition than fixed views he was liberal on homelessness and attacked mr koch for calling mr dinkins a jesse jackson democrat these , he said , were racial code words some nights mr giuliani went to bushwick and brownsville , neighborhoods ravaged by crack , talking to men and women trapped behind triplelocked apartment doors he was trying to learn , in a very linear way , the way that poor people live , recalled one guide , michael gecan , an organizer with east brooklyn congregations , a churchbased community organizing group mr giuliani was born in flatbush , brooklyn , on may 28 , 1944 when he was 7 , his family became part of the postwar migration to long island , eventually settling in north bellmore , which was 997 percent white he would return to the city to attend bishop loughlin high school and manhattan college , schools that were 99 percent white he became a passionate democrat , devoted to john and robert kennedy as the civil rights struggle dominated the news what we saw on television horrified us , mr powers recalled of the battle against jim crow laws when people kind of suggest , you 're a bunch of white guys , ' it s as if we did n't live through america at that time that s ludicrous as a federal prosecutor in the 1980s , mr giuliani worked with black ministers to jail corrupt police officers and invited mr sharpton to talk about the plague of crack he was not an ideologue , and he had no problem meeting , mr sharpton said let me tell you , i was a lot more radical then by early 1989 , new york magazine wrote of mr giuliani , he is perhaps the only white politician in town who draws a positive emotional response hugs and cheers in harlem most of that good will evaporated in the heat of the campaign mr dinkins became the democratic nominee his candidacy was laden with black aspiration and the promise of racial peace mr giuliani steered right and attacked hard when mr dinkins called mr giuliani , who served in the justice department , a reagan republican , he fired back his campaign ran an ad in a jewish newspaper with a photo of mr dinkins and mr jackson , a year after mr jackson made a comment widely seen as antisemitic mr giuliani began calling mr dinkins a jesse jackson democrat mr giuliani lost in 1989 and did not stop running until the next election was over his political task seemed clear he could not count on peeling black votes from a black mayor so he cultivated jews , ethnic whites and the hispanic middle class with new york pitched into deep recession , its descent hastened by crack and racial disturbances , a campaign riven by race seemed inevitable there were people in his camp pushing him hard to tie race to crime , said fred siegel , a historian at cooper union who once advised mr giuliani i do n't know if this was moral or practical , but giuliani was having none of it , mr siegel recalled he was insistent that crime was about behavior , not race still , mr giuliani took a fateful step that would for years prompt questions about his racial sensitivities in september 1992 , he spoke to a rally of police officers protesting mr dinkins s proposal for a civilian board to review police misconduct it was a rowdy , often threatening , crowd hundreds of white offduty officers drank heavily , and a few waved signs like dump the washroom attendant , a reference to mr dinkins a block away from city hall , mr giuliani gave a fiery address , twice calling mr dinkins s proposal bullshit the crowd cheered mr giuliani was jubilant if you 're acculturated to like cops , you do n't necessarily see 10 , 000 white guys who do n't vote in the city , do n't write political checks and love you for the wrong reason , an aide said he spoke on condition of anonymity because he is working with the giuliani presidential campaign mr dinkins has not forgotten that sea of angry cops rudy was out there inciting white cops to riot , mr dinkins said in a recent interview mr giuliani said he never saw racist signs one of the reasons those police officers might have lost control is that we have a mayor who invites riots , he said at the time the giuliani campaign later conducted a vulnerability study to identify their candidate s weaknesses in 1993 this study , obtained by wayne barrett , author of rudy ! an investigative biography offers an unsparing critique giuliani s shrieking performance at the cop rally may be his greatest political liability this year giuliani has yet to admonish those who attacked the mayor with racist code words on signs and banners why not \? determined to assault the liberal trenches , mr giuliani never blanched at giving offense he lopped the welfare rolls by 500 , 000 , laid off thousands of black political appointees seen as too liberal and hired hundreds of more conservative whites seen as loyal to his political agenda and he sent two schools chancellors one black , one hispanic spinning out of town in 1995 , he proposed cutting welfare benefits , and suggested that many of the poor might profitably leave town a natural consequence of a reduction in benefits might very well be that that would happen , mr giuliani said , adding , that would be a good thing mr giuliani has written in his book leadership about his belief in the cleansing power of confrontational words nor is he enamored of compromise asked in 2000 about reaching out to black leaders , he shook his head and said , what happens when you engage in the dialogue is , you compromise yet at first , he made inroads into the black community he endorsed democratic gov mario m cuomo in 1994 , which won him applause in black churches he tackled the sensitive business of removing from 125th street , harlem s shopping strip , the street peddlers who drove many black merchants to distraction izakel m pasha , the imam of the malcolm shabazz mosque , ignored other black leaders and helped the mayor with the peddlers church leaders tried to tell me man , you ca n't be meeting with giuliani ! ' said mr pasha , who struck up a friendship with the mayor i did n't care if you 're not willing to accept he has a strong personality , you have a problem a record plunge in homicides earned the mayor a larger measure of good will black new yorkers appreciated safer neighborhoods and applauded that thousands more of their young men remained alive rudy s gift is that he could identify with people who felt trapped by crime , mr meyers said by 1997 , mr giuliani s job approval rating in the black community stood at 42 percent , according to a new york times poll but within these victories lay the seed of a problem even as crime dropped by 60 percent , officers with the street crime unit stopped and frisked 16 black males for every one who was arrested , according to a report by the state attorney general then came three terrible episodes that raised a pointed question for black new yorkers was crime reduction worth any cost \? one hot night in august 1997 , police officers grabbed abner louima , a black security guard , during a tussle in flatbush mr louima exited a precinct house bleeding after officers jammed a broken broomstick into his rectum and his mouth mr giuliani , who was running for reelection , was eloquent in his disgust these charges are shocking to any decent human being , he said he created a task force to examine policecommunity relations , and invited adversaries to join but mr giuliani swamped his democratic opponent that november when his task force released a report the next march , mr giuliani belittled its findings as making very little sense he endorsed just one suggestion , to change a deputy commissioner s title we can change it from affairs' to relations , ' mr giuliani said two police shootings of unarmed black men followed , one death upon another in february 1999 , the police fired 41 bullets at amadou diallo , an african immigrant they said they thought he was reaching for a gun he was trying to pull out his wallet a year later , an undercover officer sidled up to patrick dorismond , an offduty security guard , and asked to buy marijuana mr dorismond took offense punches flew another undercover officer shot him mayor giuliani released the dead man s juvenile arrest record mr dorismond , he said , was no altar boy in fact , he had been an altar boy at a brooklyn church there were marches and a civil disobedience campaign mr dinkins and representative charles b rangel were arrested mr powers , the mayor s friend , said mr giuliani fell victim to racial provocateurs and an amnesiac city a lot of the people in the minority community forgot all the good he did in lowering crime , he said rudy got demonized with the city perched on edge , the mayor asked to meet with the rev johnny ray youngblood of st paul community baptist church once they had talked often mr youngblood , who is black , accompanied mr giuliani on those longago trips to bushwick apartments but mr giuliani had not taken his calls in years mr youngblood is a leader in east brooklyn congregations , an organizing group that prides itself on a cooleyed view of power unhappy with mr giuliani but willing to talk , a halfdozen ministers trooped to city hall , where they found an angry but chastened mayor we said we do n't do photo ops , ' mr youngblood recalled you must apologize to the dorismond family' mr giuliani turned sharply you do n't understand , two ministers recall mr giuliani saying i have to visit the families of police officers who are shot a minister replied yes , mr mayor , but we have to funeralize the people they shoot you are not alone , ok \? mr giuliani later expressed regret without precisely apologizing his approval rating among blacks had fallen to 7 percent by april 2000 , according to a new york times cbs news poll the question lingers in conversation with black officials did mr giuliani have a black problem , or did blacks just not get him \? he dueled with no end of white officials senator alfonse m d'amato , a fellow republican \? he s running a protection racket gov george e pataki \? needs his head examined the manhattan borough president , ruth w messinger \? she has really jerky ideas but ms reiter , the former deputy mayor , said a mayor could not assume words register the same for every group one city , one standard is fine but unrealistic , she said there are groups , for reasons of history , treated differently , and it happens every day ignore that , she says , and a leader risks tonedeafness in the summer of 1999 , mr giuliani attended an urban league fundraiser at the sheraton in manhattan he strode through the ballroom as though leaning into a strong wind i want to apologize for leaving early , he said it s very , very hard for me to get a cab the ballroom fell silent then he went fishing for laughs , and found none you think i'm kidding \? have you ever tried to hail a cab in new york \? he seemed unaware that many in this audience knew perfectly well what it was to hail a taxi that would not stop the city did not boil over on mr giuliani s watch neither did it unite behind him but mr sharpton , whose hand was behind most antigiuliani demonstrations , boycotts and attempted embarrassments , said mr giuliani damaged his own agenda by failing to cultivate black allies rudy wanted to send a message that he was n't going to talk with the bad guys , he said , referring to himself well , guess what \? the good guys could n't emerge because he would n't talk to them either save for , mr giuliani rarely fields questions about race on the campaign trail republican voters , who are overwhelmingly white , have clamored to hear about 9 11 and terror a few of mr giuliani s supporters discuss mr sharpton , mainly as a punch line but in a general election , mr giuliani might have to answer questions about his ability to work with black leaders his old racial rhetoric could turn off suburban voters , notes henry sheinkopf , a democratic consultant mr giuliani asserts that black people are not mysterious to him , even if they find him a puzzle in the case of the africanamerican community , i understand it really well , he told a black editorial writer at the daily news in 1999 there s no point trying to educate people that i'm not a racist any more than i'm not a criminal if people ca n't figure me out , he added , that s their problem
daytona beach , fla , feb 17 the good ol' boys in the garage had an expression for why they played fast and loose with the rules of stockcar racing if you ai n't cheatin' , you ai n't tryin' , they would say , and the scandals of the day were met with a wink and a knowing nod stockcar racing , a sport that began with moonshiners , is filled with oldtimers who still chuckle over the stories from the days when they would try to pull a fast one on nascar but nobody is laughing now not after nascar suspended five crew chiefs and a team vice president , and assessed fines and subtracted valuable race points from five drivers and teams before sunday s seasonopening daytona 500 nascar could have slapped wrists and played down the infractions found on the racecars of the drivers michael waltrip , matt kenseth , kasey kahne , elliott sadler and scott riggs instead , it has made an unprecedented public display of enforcement you 've got to conduct yourself properly if you 're going to play on the big stage , said eddie gossage , the president of texas motor speedway and a longtime race promoter in nascar we 're competing now with the nfl , and i think ahead of most other sports the nba , major league baseball , nhl , we 're the equivalent or better so we 've got to conduct ourselves with integrity that s what they 're doing nascar has spent years trying to expand beyond its southeastern roots it now has racetracks across the country , a multibilliondollar network television deal with fox and abc espn and ratings that outperform or rival that of every sport except professional football nascar is building an international footprint as well , with the secondtier busch series racing in mexico city and now montreal toyota has joined ford , chevrolet and dodge on the racetrack , the first foreign manufacturer to compete in the cup series since jaguar in the 1950s and the colombian driver juan pablo montoya , who brings an international fan base after years of racing in formula one , will compete in the nextel cup this year the world is watching on friday morning , nascar s president , mike helton , said there is a need for nascar to have that same confidence with the fan , with the tv audience , with the car sponsors , with nascar sponsors , with the racetracks and all the constituents of the sport to have confidence in nascar s way that it handles its sport series officials have been working to even the playing field for years as teams searched for any edge they could find in a sport in which a tenth of a second of extra speed can determine the outcome of a race teams were told in chicago last season that the penalties would escalate if infractions continued another warning came weeks before the teams arrived at daytona this year for the start of speedweeks nascar had a meeting three weeks ago , said tony eury sr , crew chief for the rookie paul menard and once dale earnhardt jr s crew chief they just told us right there in the meeting that they were n't tolerating people going over the line and that the fines were getting bigger , the suspensions getting bigger , so everybody knew what to expect when they got here which makes the events of this week all the more stunning inspections last sunday before and after qualifying for the daytona 500 nabbed no fewer than 5 of the 61 teams trying to make the race kenseth s crew chief , robbie reiser , and kahne s team director , kenny francis , were suspended for four races for failing to cover holes in a wheel well , which was seen as giving the teams an unfair aerodynamic advantage they were also fined 50 , 000 and assessed a 50point penalty for the driver and team owner the violations by sadler s crew chief , josh browne , and riggs s crew chief , rodney childers , were more subtle it was found that the bolts used on the rear spoiler of their racecars had holes drilled through the center , allowing air from the trunk to bleed out browne and childers were suspended for two races , fined 25 , 000 and penalized 25 driver and teamowner points none of those infractions compared with the violations by michael waltrip s team , making its debut with the new toyota camry an additive in the fuel was discovered , crossing a line that nascar has drawn for years when it came to flagrant cheating the crew chief , david hyder , and michael waltrip racing s vice president for competition , bobby kennedy , were ejected from the racetrack and suspended indefinitely hyder was fined 100 , 000 , and 100point driver and teamowner penalties were assessed asked what he hoped to achieve by assessing such harsh penalties , helton said , to not have another stretch like this some in the garage believe nascar should have taken it a step further to tell you the truth , i think he got off easy , the driver joe nemechek said of waltrip , who will start 15th sunday i think it gave the sport a black eye we 've got to recover from that the event did little to promote toyota s controversial debut the team owner jack roush had railed against toyota , complaining that it raised the cost of competing by luring talent from other teams fans have flocked to internet message boards to post bigoted attacks against the japanese company nascar officials did not publicly condemn the criticism toyota faced they do not police the garage or the stands but it was nascar s nod to toyota and the other manufacturers that have spent millions on the sport that led to the decision not to eject waltrip nascar runs on sponsorship dollars , after all generally speaking , we 've not run into an infraction big enough that warrants leaving the car owner at home , helton said it would be very difficult for the relationship a car owner has with a fortune 500 sponsor if that fortune 500 sponsor was embarrassed but it does n't mean we would n't do that even without ejecting waltrip , the scandal drew headlines across the country as racing suddenly became a nonissue in the days before the most celebrated race of the nascar season even the veteran driver jeff gordon found himself riveted for much of the last week i 've been glued to the tv as much as anybody else , waiting to see what s going to happen , he said after winning a qualifying race thursday and between that and anna nicole smith , i just ca n't seem to get myself away from the tv gordon s tongueincheek commentary quickly changed when it was discovered during the middle of the news conference that his no 24 chevrolet had failed an inspection it was later determined that a small part had failed , causing his racecar to be an inch too low to the ground gordon , who was to start in the second row sunday , was instead sent back to 42nd in the 43car field i 've just been happy through qualifying that we have n't been a part of it , gordon said friday , referring to the scandal it just crushed me when i found out that we were going to be right in the middle of it all nascar has sent a message that credibility now counts in a sport known for its wilder past there s no question it s harmed credibility in a time of excitement with all of the attention around the season in front of them , said david m carter , executive director of the university of southern california sports business institute with all the bright lights shining on nascar this week , how they resolved this scandal abruptly , and fairly quickly , sends just as important a message because people are paying attention to how they handle it at least for one week after all , this is nascar old habits are hard to break somebody will cheat again , said gossage , the texas track president and somebody will get busted again that s just the nature of things just because the nfl calls a penalty for holding does n't mean that nobody s going to hold ever again it s just the nature of competition , sadly
his are staring at one of the largest deficits of a secondplace team and seem headed toward having homecourt advantage in the playoffs for only one round that did not stop gregg popovich from sending what sounded like a warning earlier in the week we 're turning a corner , he said with dallas running away with the southwest division and phoenix playing nearly as well , it has been easy to forget about the spurs at times this season but they have healthy allstars in tim duncan and tony parker , championship experience and veteran depth on the bench the spurs have a lot of guys like horry and barry , toronto coach sam mitchell said after a 10791 loss to the spurs last monday , referring to robert horry and brent barry you do n't stay in this league for 12 or 13 years for no good reason they understand what they are up against as veteran players in this league the spurs ended february by winning their final six games and beat orlando on friday the sevengame streak is their longest this season they did it with outstanding defensive play , lowering their average points allowed to an nbalow 906 even the spurs seemed to be questioning themselves after they were 97 in january that included some unusual struggles at home , where san antonio has already lost more times than it did while going 347 last season they still have work to do in the remaining weeks of the season the spurs were barely ahead of utah for the thirdbest record in the west , and falling to fourth brings the likelihood of opening the conference semifinals at leagueleading dallas but the spurs seem ready for it now , with their strong finish to february reminding people that general managers , in a preseason poll , picked them to win the nba title i think guys just paying attention to detail , forward bruce bowen said of the spurs' recent success i think we understand that if you 're going to win on the road , it s very important that your defense is solid , and what better place to start than at home , because we have n't played this well at home so we 're trying to make adjustments as far as the mindset , being physical , paying attention to detail so we can have an opportunity come playoff time forget the two legal actions he brought against the nba this season , or the possibility of another he mentioned earlier this week billy hunter , director of the players union , said last week that his relationship with commissioner david stern and the league was fine we have a very cordial , professional relationship , hunter said david and i have to work together in order to maintain and ensure the success of the game , but each of us has our respective duties and obligations hunter joined stern on the podium at the opening of the commissioner s annual allstar weekend remarks to the news media , where they introduced a new pension plan for pre1965 nba players there were times this season when it seemed as if the only place they would be seen together was in a courtroom in december , the union filed unfairlaborpractice charges with the national labor relations board over issues with the ball the nba had switched to , and over the league s crackdown on player complaints that led to an increase in technical fouls hunter said last week that he could bring another legal action over the nba s plans to have allstar weekend in new orleans next year if he was concerned his players would not be safe there but he said none of that indicated any trouble with the league i 've got an obligation to protect the players' interests , to ensure that those aspects and provisions of the collective bargaining agreement that benefit the players are in fact enforced , hunter said and so in any instance where i think there has been a breach or an attempt to circumvent the collective bargaining agreement , then i'm going to be pretty adversarial on behalf of the players but otherwise the commissioner and i have a very good working relationship , one that is mutually beneficial and that we each show each other respect when seattle s owner , clay bennett , confirmed last week that he had no intention of filing potential relocation papers with the nba office , it came as a relief to sonics fans , knowing the team would remain for at least one more season it also eased the concerns of his players with a proposal for a new arena gaining little support in the state legislature , some players were starting to wonder about their future in seattle it means a lot to us as players that at least going into next year we have certainty of where we 're going to be , the allstar ray allen said you know for another year you 're going to be comfortable bennett has maintained that the sonics intend to honor their lease at keyarena , which runs through the 2010 season but his 350 million purchase agreement of the sonics and wnba storm allows him to move the teams if plans for a new arena in the suburb of renton , wash , are not approved by oct 31 bennett remained optimistic last week when he talked to the oklahoman newspaper there has been talk the team would move to oklahoma city we intend to be successful in washington , bennett said i still think we 've got a lot of life left in this deal and though players are aware they can be moved at any time , at least most of the sonics now know where they can expect to be if you can dunk like shaq or dance like him the nba wants to see it the league earlier last week announced the creation of the nba channel on youtube , where fans can submit videos performing their best basketball moves the best videos will be compiled into a weekly highlight reel for the remainder of the season one video already posted shows a fan who would make steve nash , a former soccer player , proud , delivering a series of alleyoop passes with his feet fans can also view nba content on the channel the video of shaquille o'neal breaking into a dance routine with lebron james and dwight howard after the eastern conference s practice at allstar weekend has been viewed more than 500 , 000 times march madness means it is time for a few nba teams to hit the road college basketball s top conferences have their tournaments this week , some of them in nba buildings the pacific10 tournament is at staples center , which sends the los angeles lakers on a fourgame trip that begins today at phoenix the chicago bulls are also on the road for four games while the big ten takes over the united center , and the hornets get out of oklahoma city for three games while the big 12 plays at the ford center the

it is not that hard to make the big east men s basketball tournament twelve of the conference s 16 teams qualify , but st john s has not been there since 2003 , which pretty much sums up how far the red storm s oncestoried program has fallen but , in another sign that it is inching its way back to respectability , st john s \( 1511 \) all but wrapped up a spot in the conference tournament at madison square garden with a 6055 victory last night against rutgers at carnesecca arena st john s improved to 67 in the big east , good for 10th place more significant , it is being chased in the standings by four teams with three conference victories or fewer , and none among that group appear to have a chance of catching the red storm , which has three big east regularseason games left it s big , seeing what st john s has been through , the junior guard eugene lawrence said about his team s potentially making the tournament next month it shows how coach roberts and his staff have us going in the right direction each year , we are progressing norm roberts took over as the coach at st john s in 2004 , inheriting a team that was troubled on the court by its inability to beat anyone in the big east and troubled off the court by incidents involving some players roberts still has a lot of work to do before the program can once again be declared topflight , but he said the best may be yet to come i'm excited about this , roberts said of a probable appearance in the big east tournament i'm also excited because i know that if our guys go in there and compete and play the way they are capable of playing , that we 've got a chance to beat anyone lawrence and qa'rraan calhoun led the red storm with 13 points each , but avery patterson was the star in a game that had gone back and forth , he broke a 5252 tie with 504 seconds remaining with a 3pointer after j r inman missed a 3point attempt for rutgers , lawrence all but sealed the outcome by making two free throws with 297 seconds left the kid stepped up and made a big shot , coach fred hill said of patterson that s what wins and loses games after struggling in the early part of the season , st john s has won three of its past four the defeat was a 2point loss at syracuse inman led rutgers \( 1016 , 310 \) with 16 points with both teams struggling to make shots , the score was tied , 2121 , at halftime after marquis webb hit a 3pointer for rutgers with 5 minutes 54 seconds left in the half , the teams combined to score 3 more points before the intermission st john s shot 286 percent in the half and did not have a field goal in the final seven minutes lamont hamilton , the leading scorer for st john s this season , missed all seven of his fieldgoal attempts in the half he shot 5 for 15 for the game and finished with 11 points the scarlet knights took a 5point lead with 11 14 left in the second half , but the red storm did n't go away hamilton scored on a putback with 1 42 left to give st john s a 5250 lead after adrian hill tied the score with a layup , patterson hit the decisive basket st john s shot 542 percent from the field in the second half the red storm made nine 3pointers over all , six more than rutgers last night s game was the first meeting between the two teams since the scarlet knights defeated the red storm , 8270 , last season at carnesecca arena in the final regularseason game to beat out st john s for a spot in the conference tournament this game was definitely one we did n't want to let slip out of our hands , especially after they beat us last year , hamilton said
illinois , one of the worst teams among the major conferences in college football in recent seasons , has astounded experts and enraged rivals by putting together one of the nation s best recruiting classes when recruits make their final commitments on national signing day today , illinois coach ron zook is expected to have collected one of the strongest groups in the big ten and among the country s top 15 in several cases , the illini won headtohead recruiting battles against traditional powers like notre dame , michigan and ohio state among those likely to sign with illinois are martez wilson , a defensive end from chicago who is seen as the country s top prospect at the position , and arrelious benn , a wide receiver from washington who is considered among the three best players at his position benn is already enrolled and taking classes on campus in champaign both players had suitors like notre dame , southern california and ohio state the success at illinois has left the world of college football abuzz with a question how did a program that went 419 the past two seasons , including 115 in its conference , persuade so many top players to sign \? john l smith , who was recently dismissed as the head coach at michigan state , expressed a view shared privately by many rival coaches and recruiters if they had a winning program and all of that , it would be a different deal if they had the greatest facilities in the world , then maybe they could sell them but what are they selling \? he added , where there s smoke , there s probably fire but jim delany , the commissioner of the big ten , made an unsolicited call to a reporter for the new york times to say that blogosphere smoke was the reason for any suspicion surrounding the illinois class around signing day , he said , smoke does not equal fire tom lemming , a longtime recruiting expert now with cstv , said a recruiting class this good at a university like illinois , with little recent tradition , was virtually unprecedented i 've never seen anything like it in 28 years , he said neither have the assistant coaches who recruit in chicago , the center of big ten recruiting and a city where the illini have done well if something is going on , they 'll get theirs , said the wisconsin assistant coach randall mccray , who recruits in chicago for the badgers but if nothing is going on , it s just jealous people that are getting beat in recruiting i do n't know illinois has a long history of national collegiate athletic association violations in basketball and football predating the arrival of zook and his staff before the 2005 season university officials dismissed complaints about this year s class as the product of envy , and they said illini coaches had thrived with a pitch of playing time and potential illinois is a pretty darn good place , said ron guenther , the university s athletic director and we 're going to roll up our sleeves and battle with the heavyweights in a telephone interview monday , guenther said the university hired an outside law firm to investigate anonymous tips and complaints about suspected recruiting improprieties , and to determine the source of rumors about the program he said the investigation had cost the university thousands of dollars guenther also said he and illinois coaches were convinced that another university s coaching staff had leaked unflattering personal information about recruits to a web site he would not name the web site or the university , other than to say it was not a big ten program i take this stuff so seriously , he said i have an interest in the coach s and the program s reputation it s defamation of character , and it s got to be challenged illinois knew it was getting a strong recruiter , if not a top football strategist and disciplinarian , when it hired zook while he was the coach at florida , he signed 20 of the 22 players who would become starters on the gators' recent national championship team zook declined interview requests , saying he would not comment until after signing day but with only three big ten titles since 1964 , illinois does not have nearly the recent tradition or the builtin fan support that the gators enjoy nor does it have nearly the same fertile recruiting ground still , zook is once again showing how adept he is at navigating the murky world of attracting high school prospects for every blockbuster signing at illinois , there is a logical link benn , for instance , is from washington , where the illini s offensive coordinator , mike locksley , has strong ties locksley recruited the same area for maryland , including as its recruiting coordinator from 1998 through february 2003 \( locksley was still the recruiting coordinator at maryland when an assistant coach was caught giving cash to a high school prospect , victor abiamiri , who ended up going to notre dame locksley was not accused of wrongdoing \) benn s decision to join illinois was considered a huge surprise outside champaign he had talked eagerly throughout his recruitment about playing at notre dame with the country s topranked quarterback prospect , jimmy clausen instead , he chose to play in the big ten s worst pass offense with isiah williams , who completed less than 40 percent of his passes last season and was statistically one of the country s worst passing quarterbacks in the case of wilson and other chicagoarea prospects , zook landed him partly because of the strong local connections of the assistant coach reggie mitchell when zook was hired , he lured mitchell from smith s staff at michigan state the illini also landed a player who originally committed to florida , d'angleo mccray , from jacksonville the illini assistant coach dan disch was a high school coach in that city for years in attracting mccray and benn , the illinois staff first received commitments from high school teammates who were not nearly as highly regarded as a way to help show their interest there s no real formula outside of just plain , hard work , guenther said he gets in early , and the staff has contacts in different areas and he s just so darn competitive on the field , however , zook s teams have not been so competitive he was fired halfway through his third season at florida after a loss at mississippi state in october 2004 along the way , he lost twice to the university of mississippi and finished with a 2314 record perhaps his defining moment was when he had a verbal altercation with members of a florida fraternity in september of his final season that year , seven of his players had brushes with the law of the 70 players zook recruited at florida , 32 left the program , transferred , or were kicked off the team that does not include players who left for the nfl florida s coach , urban meyer , stressed offthefield discipline from the moment he stepped on campus the most highly regarded player in the illini s recruiting class from last season , defensive lineman melvin alaeze , left the university for personal reasons in the fall alaeze was charged with attempted murder in december in his native maryland illinois took alaeze after maryland rescinded his scholarship offer following a marijuanarelated arrest and his struggles to qualify academically guenther said allowing alaeze a scholarship was a character risk kevin johns , an assistant coach at northwestern , said we 're recruiting two different types of character , two different types of kids they can get in almost any kid that they want we have to go through academic admissions to recruits who have committed to , visited and considered illinois , much of the appeal comes down to the opportunity to play right away and to the allure of turning around a losing program none of the eight recruits interviewed for this article said they had been offered anything illegal by illinois coaches or staff members a lot of people think just because they 're getting bigname recruits in that there s got to be something dirty going on , said josh brent , a defensive tackle from bloomington , ill , who picked illinois over ohio state , michigan and wisconsin me , speaking personally from going through the recruiting process at illinois , i have never been offered anything i have never seen anything of that sort marvin austin , a defensive tackle from washington considered among the best at his position , visited illinois but has since narrowed his list to north carolina and florida state austin said numerous recruits from the washington area had taken an interest in illinois because of locksley austin said that the illini had done a good job of recruiting in urban areas and that recruits were realizing they could go to less successful programs , where they could earn playing time early and more exposure people are scared of what they do n't understand , austin said and i do n't think they understand why kids are going to illinois
des moines , dec 4 if there is one issue that has perplexed presidential candidates from both parties in iowa this year , it is the democratic presidential contenders were confronted with it an unusual way at a debate here this afternoon should an american citizen turn in someone they know to be an illegal immigrant \? the answer , for most of the candidates , in the end , was no but the question , presented in various forms during a twohour national public radio debate , produced strained conversation as the candidates sought to balance conflicting emotions and political forces on an issue that looms both in the coming caucuses and primaries and in the general election we are not going to deputize a whole bunch of american citizens to start grabbing people or turning them in , said senator barack obama of illinois , who was the first to answer the question at the debate , the first this year staged without a television camera in the room the ordinary american citizen may not know whether or not this person is illegal or not mr obama , followed by other democrats , argued , that tracking down illegal immigrants was the job of the government but the moderators sometimes playing taped questions from listeners pressed the candidates on what they suggested were inconsistencies during a debate that promised an extended discussion on just three topics immigration , iran and china if a citizen witnessed some other kind of crime , would n't you want them to report it \? steve inskeep of npr asked senator hillary rodham clinton of new york after she said that did not think that citizens should be enforcing the broken laws of our federal immigration system it s a very clever question , steve , but i think it really begs the question , mrs clinton responded what we 're looking at here is 12 to 14 million people they live in our neighborhoods , they take care of our elderly , they probably made the beds in the hotels that some of us stayed in last night they are embedded in our society if we want to listen to the demagogues and the calls for us to being to round up people and turn every american into a suspicious vigilante , i think we will do graver harm to the fabric of our nation than any kind of personbyperson reporting of someone who might be here illegally representative dennis kucinich of ohio said , we do n't encourage vigilantism in this country as the conversation continued , mr inskeep repeatedly asked john edwards , the former north carolina senator , whether workers who were in the country illegally were driving down wages well , i think what the studies show is there are a lot of things driving down wages in the united states of america , mr edwards said a few minutes later , mr obama offered a clearer response i believe that there are circumstances where , in fact , illegal immigrants are driving down wages the question is how do we fix it \? he asked because , often times , when it s posed that way , then the thinking is that somehow we have to pit lowwage american workers versus lowwage immigrant workers and senator christopher j dodd of connecticut suggested , in response to a question , that americans should face penalties for knowingly hiring nannies or other domestic workers who are in the country illegally people who knowingly hire undocumented workers i think need to be held accountable to a far higher degree of penalties civil and possibly criminal , mr dodd said the democratic candidates all assailed president bush for saying he still considered iran a threat , even though a new national intelligence assessment that asserted that iran stopped pursuing nuclear weapons in 2003 mrs clinton came under attack for voting for a congressional resolution that declared the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization , a position that she alone embraced among the democratic candidates mrs clinton stood by the vote , arguing it was a tough diplomatic approach that had already lead to changes in behavior by iran none of us is advocating a rush to war , she said i think we have two different ways of approaching this our goals are the same diplomatic engagement with iran her opponents said the vote empowered mr bush to take the country to war , and expressed incredulity at her position declaring a military group sponsored by the state of iran a terrorist organization , that s supposed to be diplomacy \? mr edwards said this has to be considered in the context that senator clinton has said she agrees with george bush terminology that we 're in a global war on terror
jackson , miss , july 13 a federal court ruling in june that forces voters to register by party could return to the days of racially polarized politics , as many white democrats warn that thousands of white voters will now opt definitively for the republican party republicanleaning voters in mississippi have long been able to cross party lines in primaries , voting for centrist democrats in state and local races while staying loyal to republican candidates in national races but political experts here say that by limiting these voters almost all of whom are white to republican primaries , the ruling will push centrist democratic candidates to the other party , simply in order to survive most black voters in mississippi are democrats , and black political leaders have been pushing for years to prevent crossover voting in democratic primaries black leaders say they want to end precisely what white democrats here seek to preserve , a strong moderatetoconservative voice in the democratic party , and in the process to pick up more state and local posts the ruling last month by judge w allen pepper jr of federal district court allowed the legal remedy sought by black leaders judge pepper said the democratic party in mississippi had a right to disassociate itself from voters who were not genuine democrats most other southern states also have open primaries as a result of the ruling , which was handed down june 8 and barring an appeal will go into effect next year , few whites are likely to remain in the democratic party , experts here say , a prospect that republicans regard with glee , white democrats with horror and black leaders with indifference not for the first time in the south , republicans and blacks have achieved a de facto unspoken alliance of common interests that has been particularly evident in the drawing of congressional districts , where blacks are packed into majorityblack districts , leaving little space for moderate white democrats to be elected if white voters go republican in these districts , so too , will white candidates and officeholders , ending a persistent anomaly in a state that easily went twice for president bush but where hundreds of local officeholders remain democrats as elsewhere in the south , grassroots leaders tend to be moderate democrats with roots in the new deal the governor is a republican , and republicans narrowly control the senate but the house is heavily democratic , and in races this year for local offices like sheriff , supervisor and circuit clerk , about 2 , 500 of 3 , 000 candidates were democrats , said w martin wiseman , director of the john c stennis institute of government at mississippi state university the democrats' dominance at the local level may now be threatened by judge pepper s ruling if they are required to reregister , the democratic party will be a shell of its former self because i just do n't think you 'll see those conservative whites reregister as democratic , said jere nash , who is white and a veteran consultant and onetime chief of staff to former gov ray mabus , a democrat r andrew taggart , a white lawyer who succeeded mr nash when kirk fordice , a republican , was elected governor , agreed the ruling was very farreaching , mr taggart said he has essentially ruled our entire primary structure must be changed if forced to make a decision , mr taggart added , a plurality of mississippi voters will identify themselves as republican black democrats who pushed the lawsuit that led to the ruling seemed to view the potential hemorrhaging of white voters with equanimity one of their leaders is ike brown , a state democratic executive committee member who was recently found by another federal judge to have systematically violated voting rights of whites , through intimidation and other means , as party boss in his home county , noxubee , in the eastern part of the state welcoming judge pepper s ruling , mr brown said in an interview we are tired of being abused by the white democrats in mississippi we have just had enough we want the republicans out of our party democrats here have recently made other efforts to rid their party of republican leanings , trying , for instance , to force the state s conservative insurance commissioner , george dale , off their primary ballot because he voted for mr bush a judge put mr dale back on but none of these efforts have much chance at being as successful as the lawsuit ellis turnage , the lawyer who filed it , said he was not worried about whites' quitting the party if they want to leave , let them leave , mr turnage said when they integrated the schools , look what happened that s not for me to deal with yet if that happens , the racial polarization of politics here could be complete until now , an important bridge across the race divide in mississippi has occurred , for instance , in the legislature , where for three decades blacks and centrist white democrats have formed coalitions to finance public education , or to push back against conservative republican governors who sought cuts in social programs the beauty of what i 've witnessed over the last 28 years is we 've worked together , said thomas u reynolds , who is white and the state representative from the quiet courthouse town of charleston in the north mississippi hills mr brown , by contrast , said mr reynolds s district and others like it would be more properly represented by a black , another motive cited for pursuing closed primaries a stooped country lawyer with a populist bent , mr reynolds has traversed much of mississippi s fourdecade emergence from segregation in the state legislature , preoccupied with what he sees as democratic causes like better education and health care to get past the ruling , mr reynolds said he was counting on the voters he greets by first name in the courthouse square to support him , regardless of party or race these folks , black and white , are my friends , he said such support , however , cannot be taken for granted in a state where 85 percent of whites voted for mr bush in 2004 calling judge pepper s ruling a tragedy , mr reynolds said voters should be allowed to vote for the candidate of their choice , regardless of party of all the things that could have happened , this does n't help us , he said it would further racially polarize mississippi , and that s one thing we do n't want judge pepper ordered the legislature to put a new system in place by aug 31 , 2008 he also said photo identification for voters should be instituted , a requirement that is meeting resistance from some who welcome his other findings among those opponents is mr turnage , the plaintiffs' lawyer others oldline white democrats are hoping against hope that the ruling will simply prove a fleeting nightmare if it is muddied by the legislature or overturned on appeal though none have been announced if this thing comes to pass , it s the end of the democratic party in the state of mississippi , said hob bryan , a longtime centrist state senator from the northeastern part of the state i do n't want to exclude anyone from the democratic party , mr bryan said i want to include more people
washington , nov 10 as the insurgency in escalated in the spring of 2004 , american officials entrusted an iraqi businessman with issuing weapons to iraqi police cadets training to help quell the violence by all accounts , the businessman , kassim alsaffar , a veteran of the iraniraq war , did well at distributing the pentagonsupplied weapons from the baghdad police academy armory he managed for a military contractor but , coworkers say , he also turned the armory into his own private arms bazaar with the seeming approval of some american officials and executives , selling ak47 assault rifles , glock pistols and heavy machine guns to anyone with cash in hand iraqi militias , south african security guards and even american contractors this was the craziest thing in the world , said john tisdale , a retired air force master sergeant who managed an adjacent warehouse they were taking weapons away by the truckload activities at that armory and other warehouses help explain how the american military lost track of some 190 , 000 pistols and automatic rifles supplied by the united states to iraq s security forces in 2004 and 2005 , as auditors discovered in the past year these discoveries prompted criminal inquiries by the pentagon and the justice department , and stoked fears that the arms could fall into enemy hands and be used against american troops so far , no missing weapons have been linked to any american deaths , but investigators say that in a country awash with weapons , it may be impossible to trace where some ended up while the pentagon has yet to offer its own accounting of how the weapons channel broke down , it is clear from interviews with two dozen military and civilian investigators , contracting officers , warehouse managers and others that military expediency sometimes ran amok , the lines between legal and illegal were blurred and billions of dollars in arms were handed over to shoestring commands without significant oversight in the armory that mr saffar presided over , for example , his dealings were murky mr tisdale , who recalled seeing a briefcase stuffed with stacks of 20 bills under mr saffar s desk , said he thought mr saffar enriched himself selling american stocks along with guns he acquired from the streets mr tisdale was supposed to sign off on any transactions by mr saffar , but he said many shipments left the armory without his approval and without the required records ted nordgaarden , an alaska state trooper who worked as the police academy s supply chief , said most of the weapons he saw leaving the armory went with a military escort for his part , mr saffar denies any wrongdoing , including any arms dealings nearly a halfdozen american and iraqi workers say his gun business was an open secret at the armory elsewhere , american officers shortcircuited the chain of custody by rushing to baghdad s airport to claim crates of newly arrived weapons without filing the necessary paperwork and iraqis regularly sold or stole the americansupplied weapons , american officers and contractors said a shipment of 3 , 000 glocks issued to police cadets disappeared within a week when they were sold on the black market , said an american official involved in distributing weapons other military sources said the weapons would fetch between five and seven times more than the 200 a police cadet would earn in a month american military commanders say iraqi security guards are suspected of stealing hundreds of weapons last year in about 10 major thefts at arms depots at taji and abu ghraib the investigations into missing weapons are among the most serious in the widening federal inquiries into billions of dollars in military contracts for the purchase and delivery of weapons , supplies and other mat riel to iraqi and american forces already there is evidence that some americansupplied weapons fell into the hands of guerrillas responsible for attacks against turkey , an important united states ally some investigators said that because military suppliers to the war zone were not required to record serial numbers , it was unlikely that the authorities would ever be able to tell where the weapons went many of those weapons were issued when gen david h petraeus , now the top american commander in iraq , was responsible for training and equipping iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005 general petraeus has said that he opted to arm the iraqi forces as quickly as possible , before tracking systems were fully in place the pentagon says it has since tightened its record keeping for the weapons , but government auditors said in interviews that they were not yet convinced that an effective system was in place the problem goes well beyond bookkeeping , said joseph a christoff , the director of international affairs and trade for the government accountability office another gao official said , there were inquiries from soldiers finding enemy weapons caches , finding ak47s , and they would ask , did we give these to them \? ' some military officials involved in supplying the iraqis describe the sense of urgency they felt and the need to cut through what they saw as a cumbersome military bureaucracy a few miles from mr saffar s armory , maj john isgrigg iii and maj timmy w cox were assigned to issue weapons to the iraqi military and national guard from early 2004 to 2005 as soon as they heard that a new shipment was arriving , the officers said , they put together a convoy to be the first to claim it , barreling onto the tarmac at baghdad international airport and loading the crates of glocks and ak47s in several telephone interviews and email exchanges , majors cox and isgrigg described a race between themselves and the system they acknowledged that they did not do everything by the book they did not always call ahead to the airport to say they were coming they signed receipts but did not always wait around to fill out inspection reports , known as dd250s and they told only certain superior officers about their plans for where the weapons would be delivered major isgrigg , 46 , described the chain of custody as a maze of red tape once weapons went into it , it took days for them to be released , he said sometimes , he said , a competing unit distributing weapons to the iraqi police would get to a shipment first , so he and major cox would have to wait for the next one he said that warehouse crews had been infiltrated by iraqis sympathetic to insurgents , and that sometimes weapons would disappear we had folks getting killed because equipment was n't moving , said col randy hinton , the majors' superior officer were there times when all the right forms were not signed \? probably but we had a mission to do , and we were going to do it the best way we could at that time in a phone interview from bangkok , john hess , who worked as the assistant director of operations for an americanowned company that helped manage supplies for iraq , said payments to the companies that supplied arms to iraq were often delayed because of missing dd250s he said he believed that the officers had the right motives but used dangerous methods once those weapons left normal channels , mr hess said , none of us were ever sure where they were really going several coworkers complained about the unorthodox tactics of the two officers , including an accusation that major cox , 38 , was stealing weapons , major isgrigg said however , federal officials said the officers were not the targets of an investigation even when they managed to get weapons to the iraqi military , major isgrigg said , it was hard for him and major cox to feel triumphant the iraqi commanders could barely keep track of their troops , much less stocks of new weapons , he said he estimated that 30 percent of the equipment he and major cox delivered went to iraqi soldiers who showed up for duty one day , and disappeared the next there were times we would issue a batch of weapons and within 10 days they would show up at the enemy weapons purchase program , major cox , who is on his second tour in baghdad , wrote by email , referring to a military effort to buy guns from the streets we did n't always think we were going about things the right way , said major isgrigg , who left iraq in july but he said he believed that his actions were necessary , saying of his commanders they rushed it their goal was to get those units standing as fast as possible , and then to get out of there there was no planning for the long term as the american military hurried to train and equip iraqi security forces in the spring of 2004 , the pentagon turned to contractors to operate warehouses to store equipment and weapons mr saffar managed an armory on the grounds of the baghdad police academy , which along with a nearby warehouse was operated by an americanowned company based in kuwait in july , the company , american logistics services , which later became lee dynamics international , was suspended by the army from doing future business with the government amid accusations that the company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to military contracting officers the company had won 11 million in contracts to manage five warehouses with arms and other equipment in iraq the company s armory , a long concrete building divided into two sections in the back , was a logistics hub for the new iraqi police crates of ak47s and glock pistols purchased by the pentagon were trucked to the armory by armed convoys from a large warehouse at abu ghraib , and mr saffar issued them to cadets it was also from this 1 , 800squarefoot building and six adjacent 40footlong metal shipping containers that mr saffar plied his personal arms trade , coworkers said he sold guns from the black market and from captured stocks there was n't anybody there who did n't know what he was doing , said mr nordgaarden , the alaska state trooper mr tisdale said mr saffar had a steady stream of customers , from iraqis to south african private security contractors there were truckloads of stuff moving out of that armory without my authorization , mr tisdale said mr tisdale said that he complained repeatedly to two top american logistics executives , but they assured him that mr saffar s dealings were proper the company has not responded to requests for comment mr tisdale and other coworkers said they believed that an american military official , lt col levonda joey selph , an army officer who oversaw the warehouse contract and whose activities have been part of the investigation into american logistics , also must have known about the arms dealings mr tisdale said the colonel regularly visited the armory and met with mr saffar mr nordgaarden recalled seeing colonel selph at the warehouse 8 to 10 times over a year in an brief encounter outside her northern virginia home , colonel selph would say only that she was not guilty of any wrongdoing , and that she was under orders not to speak to the press she would not say whose orders mr saffar , who said he left iraq in august 2005 when his contract to manage the armory ended , denied that he had run a private arms business my work was to issue weapons and ammunition to the iraqi police , he said in an email message from bahrain mr hess , who was the assistant director of operations for american logistics , defended colonel selph as the one person trying to establish order in the chaos that characterized the early months of the reconstruction effort and he said that though mr saffar s arms business might look bad from a distance , it hardly raised an eyebrow in baghdad you 're talking about a war zone , mr hess said in iraq , weapons are everywhere
london , sept 11 , the crusading entrepreneur who used the body shop chain of cosmetics stores she founded to promote causes like ending animal testing and supporting the environment , died in chichester , england , on monday she was 64 the cause was a brain hemorrhage , her family said a woman of fierce passions , boundless energy , unconventional idealism and sometimes divalike temperament , ms roddick was one of britain s most visible business executives , and not just because of the ubiquitous and instantly recognizable body shop franchises working on behalf of numerous causes the rain forest , debt relief for developing countries , indigenous farmers in impoverished nations , whales , voting rights , antisexism and antiageism , to name a few ms roddick believed that businesses could be run ethically , with what she called moral leadership , and still turn a profit at times , her antiestablishment philosophy seemed to clash with her stature as a successful businesswoman she joined the front lines of protesters at the world trade organization talks in seattle in 1999 , for instance anita did more than run a successful ethical business she was a pioneer of the whole concept of ethical and green consumerism , tony juniper , director of friends of the earth , wrote in the evening standard on tuesday there are quite a few business people today who claim green credentials , but none came anywhere near anita in terms of commitment and credibility anita lucia perilli was born in littlehampton , england , in 1942 , to italian immigrants who ran a cafe and who put their four children to work there after school and on weekends her parents divorced when she was a child , and her mother married her husband s cousin henry , who died of tuberculosis several years later when anita was 18 , her mother told her that henry was , in fact , her father she had been the product of a passionate extramarital affair ms roddick said later that she had always felt closer to henry than to the man she had thought was her father , and that the news made her feel as if an enormous weight of guilt had been lifted from my shoulders after her application to drama school was turned down , ms roddick worked for a time as a secondary school teacher and then quit to travel to tahiti , australia and south africa , among other places , where she absorbed customs and ideas she would later apply to the body shop when you 've lived for six months with a group that is rubbing their bodies with cocoa butter , and those bodies are magnificent , or if you wash your hair with mud , and it works , you go on to break all sorts of conventions , from personal ethics to body care , she once said she married gordon roddick , a scottish poet , in 1970 , when she was pregnant with their second daughter when her husband later announced that he wanted to fulfill his dream of traveling on horseback from buenos aires to new york \( and that , by the way , it might take a couple of years \) , ms roddick took out a modest loan and in 1976 opened the body shop , her first , in brighton the shop sold just a handful of creams and haircare products its walls were painted green , to cover the damp spots but it proved an unexpected success and the business began to grow , helped , too , by mr roddick , when he came back from his trip he s the doer , i'm the dreamer , she once said within 15 years , body shop stores had blanketed britain and moved beyond , eventually numbering more than 2 , 000 in about 50 countries ms roddick , who rejected conventional marketing , was so recognizable with her wild hair , wild public pronouncements and unbusinesslike demeanor that she was probably her own best advertisement she used her stores to spread her philosophy and promote causes , and urged franchise owners and customers to join in in 1990 , she helped establish the magazine the big issue , produced and sold by homeless people she also set up children on the edge , a charity for children in europe and asia , and said she planned to give away most of her fortune more recently , she had been campaigning to raise awareness of hepatitis c , which she contracted from a blood transfusion while giving birth to her younger daughter the body shop went public in the mid1990s , and the company was sold to the french cosmetics giant l'or al for about 114 billion last year although the roddicks had stepped down from managing the company in 2002 , they remained on as nonexecutive directors and reportedly made about 237 million from their 18 percent stake the sale drew criticism from environmentalists who said that , among other things , l'or al had yet to ban animal testing but ms roddick said she hoped that the body shop would spur l'or al to behave more ethically in 2003 , she was made a dame of the british empire she is survived by her husband and their two daughters , samantha and justine among the great contradictions in a woman whose life was full of them was her tendency to scoff at the kinds of products her company sold i have never felt that beauty products are the body and blood of jesus christ , she once said nothing the body shop sells pretends to do anything other than it says moisturizers moisturize , fresheners freshen and cleansers cleanse end of story
this was the week in which americans hoped they would get straight talk and clear thinking on iraq what they got was two exhausting days of congressional testimony by the american military commander , hours of news conferences and interviews , clouds of cuttoorder statistics and a speech from the oval office and none of it either straight or clear the white house insisted that president bush had consulted intensively with his generals and adapted to changing circumstances but no amount of smoke could obscure the truth mr bush has no strategy to end his disastrous war and no strategy for containing the chaos he unleashed last night s speech could have been given any day in the last four years and was delivered a halfdozen times already despite mr bush s claim that he was offering a way for all americans to come together on iraq , he offered the same divisive policies repackaged this time with the orwellian slogan return on success mr bush s claim that things were going so well in iraq that he could accept his generals' recommendation for a drawdown of forces was a carnival barker s comeon the army cannot sustain the 30 , 000 extra troops mr bush sent to iraq beyond mid2008 without serious damage to its fighting ability from the start , the president said that the increase would be temporary that s why he called it a surge before he spoke , iraq s brutal reality had debunked the claims of political and military success made by gen david petraeus , the top american commander in iraq , and ryan crocker , the ambassador in baghdad first , the times reported that the only sliver of political progress a tortuous compromise on sharing oil revenues was evaporating then came news of the assassination of the anbar tribal leader whose decision to fight alongside the americans was cited by mr bush as proof that the war s tide was turning even though it had nothing to do with the increase in forces mr bush s claims last night about how well the war is going are believable only if you use pentagon numbers so obviously cooked that they call to mind the way americans were duped into first supporting this war there will be a lot said in coming days about mr bush s new strategy , just as there was after each of his previous major addresses on the war if there was a new strategy , it would be easy to recognize mr bush would drop the meaningless talk of victory and stop trying to sell americans the fiction that the war keeps them safe from terrorism \( to his credit , general petraeus declined to adopt that bit of propaganda \) instead , mr bush would do what the vast majority of americans want plan an orderly withdrawal while doing what he can to mitigate the consequences of the war mr bush was right when he said last night that the aftermath of withdrawal would be bloody and frightening , but that is a product of his invasion and his gross mismanagement of the aftermath mr bush s endless insistence on staying the course will only make iraq more bloody and frightening if mr bush had a new strategy , he would have talked to the american people last night about what he would do to draw iraq s neighbors into a solution last january , when he announced the troop increase , mr bush promised to use america s full diplomatic resources to rally support for iraq from nations throughout the middle east the world is still waiting a strategy for ending the war would include real efforts to hold iraq s government to verifiable measures of political conciliation and make clear to iraq s leaders that they cannot count on america s indefinite and unquestioning protection a real shift in strategy would have included an effort to deal with the massive problem of refugees nine months after the surge began , ever more iraqis are being driven from their homes and mr bush never even mentioned them last night if mr bush were serious about ending the war , rather than threatening iran and syria , he would make a serious effort to persuade them that they too have a lot to lose from a disintegrating iraq and he would enlist the help of the leaders of britain , france and germany for serious negotiations then , perhaps , mr bush s promise from january to stanch the flow of men and weapons into iraq from iran and syria would not have sounded so hollow once again , it is clear that mr bush refuses to recognize the truth of his failure in iraq and envisions a military commitment that has no end congress must use its powers to expose the truth and demand a real change in strategy democratic leaders , forever parsing polls , are backing away from proposals to impose a deadline for withdrawal and tinkering with small ideas that mostly sound like ways to enable the president s strategy of delay the presidential candidates , as well , have a duty to take iraq headon some democrats have started to talk in some detail about how they would end the war , but the burden is not just on the war critics republicans like rudolph giuliani and john mccain , who love to proclaim their support for the president and hide behind the troops , need to explain their vision as well what do they think would constitute victory in iraq , and how , precisely , do they intend to achieve it \? after all , it seems the burden of ending the war will fall to the next president mr bush was clear last night as he was when he addressed the nation in january , september of last year , the december before that and in april 2004 that his only real plan is to confuse enough americans and cow enough members of congress to let him muddle along and saddle his successor with this war that should never have been started
los angeles , dec 8 each year television viewers emerge in january from the traditional december blizzard of holiday specials and college football bowl games seeking new comforts from their favorite comedies and dramas , shows like grey s anatomy , two and a half men and house come january , however , they are more likely to be left to joust with the reallife american gladiators as a result of the now monthlong strike by the , almost none of the most popular shows on prime time television will be offering new episodes to viewers after the first of the year , or for the foreseeable future in their place on the networks' schedules will be repeats or reality programs , some of them returning but many of them new shows like the moment of truth , a fox offering in which contestants are strapped to a lie detector and asked about their most intimate secrets on a national stage the flood of reality programming will be the first repercussion that many americans will see in prime time from the writers' strike , an event that has drawn relatively little concern beyond hollywood and manhattan but the strike looks likely to continue talks between the writers and hollywood studios collapsed friday , with the sides still deeply divided while latenight talk shows were almost immediately forced into reruns because of the strike , those shows draw a small fraction of the 40 million viewers who tune in to the primetime offerings of the four major networks each weeknight the strikefueled growth in reality programming also has the potential to change the face of primetime television for years to come reality programs generally do not employ unionrepresented writers while the most popular dramas and comedies will resume production of new episodes once the strike ends , the strike could mean the end for several new series , like bionic woman on nbc or kville on fox , that have struggled to gain a regular audience this fall just as the last writers' strike , in 1988 , helped to spawn a new form of v rit entertainment epitomized by programs like cops and america s most wanted , the current writers' strike will witness the debut of a number of new reality concepts the moment of truth is but one of as many as 27 hours a week of reality programming that the broadcast networks are planning for the first quarter of 2008 , according to schedules released in recent weeks and interviews with network officials that appears to be the most ever for the relatively young reality genre and represents roughly a 50 percent increase from the 18 to 19 hours of reality programming that the networks have scheduled in recent seasons vince manze , president of program planning , scheduling and strategy at nbc , said the volume of reality on the schedule next year would be greater than usual certainly some of it is strikerelated , mr manze said but part of it is not we always put reality on in the first quarter , when shows like heroes go on a brief hiatus , although he acknowledged that the volume of reality on the schedule for early next year was greater than usual among the new reality offerings is oprah s big give , a contest on abc sponsored by oprah winfrey to see who can give away large sums of money to society s greatest benefit abc has long planned to have the series premiere in early 2008 , but its potential effect on the network s ratings is now more important than ever , given that the network s most successful shows will be appearing in reruns at the other end of the spectrum is american gladiators on nbc , a revival of a late1980s competition that pits contestants against professional athletes in feats of strength , and when women rule the world , a fox series that features male contestants trying to survive in an environment ruled by women not all of the comedies and dramas in prime time will be repeats some returning series have long been scheduled to resume their run after the first of the year , including lost on abc and medium on nbc some new series also had been set for premieres in january , including eli stone on abc and terminator the sarah connor chronicles on fox in addition , some continuing series have one or more individual episodes remaining , including most of the police dramas on cbs the deluge of new reality programming has become necessary because , in the weeks since the members of the writers guild of america stopped working on nov 5 , nearly all comedy and drama series have shut down production for lack of new scripts the writers are seeking a deal that will give them a share of the profits derived from the use of their material on the internet and in other electronic media the networks are now using the strike as an opportunity to fill their schedules with lessexpensive reality programming leslie moonves , the chief executive of cbs , said as much at an investor conference last tuesday we have added a number of reality programs to february , mr moonves said we have a lot of terrific plans , and ratings probably will not be as high without the influx of all of our great original programming but by the same token , costs will be down considerably laurie ouellette , an associate professor of communications studies at the university of minnesota , said that after growing steadily in the first half of the decade , the amount of primetime programming devoted to reality shows had remained relatively flat since 2005 that was thanks in part to the emergence of a new crop of popular dramas , including house , desperate housewives and criminal minds but many of those programs are going to be in hiatus because of the strike , ms ouellette said and the networks are responding to the need to come up with shows that are a costeffective solution to that problem reality shows , which generally cost 1 million per hour to produce , are far less expensive than most primetime dramas , which can cost 2 million to 3 million per episode cbs is in many ways responsible for the recent growth of reality programming after the initial success in 2000 of survivor , the network s groundbreaking castaway competition , the amount of reality programming in prime time grew steadily , from about 4 hours in 2000 to roughly 18 hours in 2005 after the first of the year , cbs will double , at least , the amount of reality programming on its schedule , to four hours from two this fall , including another installment of survivor , the game show power of 10 and three hours of big brother nbc will nearly double its amount of reality programming , to seven hours from four the network has scheduled one of two hourlong installments of deal or no deal in the monday hour formerly devoted to heroes and given over the slot normally filled by the office and scrubs to a celebrity version of the apprentice and abc , which has yet to announce formally details of its schedule for the new year , could significantly increase its reality programming from the five to six hours it has run this fall the network is expected to bring back wife swap and supernanny , schedule new editions of dancing with the stars and the bachelor beginning in march , and add new series , including two more dance competitions the abc shows could account for as much as 11 hours of weekly programming , although it is unlikely that the network will schedule all of those shows concurrently fox , which schedules only 15 hours of primetime programming per week , compared with 22 hours each for the other three networks , is keeping its total level of reality programming about steady at seven hours the biggest part of that will go to american idol , the mostwatched series on television , which accounts for two hours a week of fox s schedule
when oliver p rez is pitching , it is easy to tell if the mets are winning or losing without peeking at the scoreboard just look at the way he leaves the field after recording a third out if the mets are winning , p rez will race toward the firstbase line and vault over it with the aplomb of an olympic decathlete if they are losing , p rez takes an entirely different approach when the top of the third inning ended yesterday , p rez turned toward the mets' dugout and looked at the white chalk he lethargically hopped over it , putting about six inches of air underneath his cleats his body language was unmistakable the mets liked their chances when they sized up their threegame series against the atlanta braves , which began last night at shea stadium p rez has been at his best this season against them but he never found his groove , digging an early hole that sealed a 73 defeat we just have to forget this one and learn from what happened today , p rez said the mets \( 6349 \) saw their lead in the national league east trimmed to three and a half games over the braves \( 6053 \) at this point last season , the mets had a doubledigit lead over them beating atlanta this season has been a precarious proposition for the mets , as it was for most of 1995 to 2005 , when the braves won 11 consecutive division titles the mets are 37 against atlanta this season the teams have completed three threegame series , with the mets winning only one game each time p rez got all three victories p rez \( 108 \) has pitched well in big games although it is only early august , this qualifies as a big series for the mets of course , manager willie randolph said , this is a huge series but p rez pitched as if it were spring training he was rattled as the braves raced to an early lead they scored one run in the first inning , two in the second and three in the third the first 7 of the braves' 15 hits were by different players it s a great lineup , outfielder shawn green said of the braves' roster , which got even better when they signed first baseman mark teixeira at the nonwaiver trade deadline it seems like most of them hit over 300 the game s second batter , matt diaz , hit a solo homer in the second inning , brian mccann hit a runscoring single and yunel escobar knocked in a run with a double with one out and runners at first and second in the third inning , jeff francoeur hit a fastball that was down and in , drilling it for a threerun homer and giving atlanta a 60 lead francoeur tied a career high with four hits many of the 52 , 177 fans at shea stadium began to boo p rez got the next two outs , then made the lackluster retreat into the dugout he allowed 6 runs and 10 hits in five innings you have to keep down on the pitches , p rez said today i was missing a lot of balls up in the zone there were some bright spots for p rez he struck out three batters in the fourth inning , five over all , and walked none and he held teixeira hitless in three atbats but those small victories seemed to go unnoticed the mets finally scored in the fourth inning david wright scored when moises alou grounded into a double play in the next inning , david newhan pinchhit for p rez and hit a runscoring triple off braves starter buddy carlyle newhan scored on a groundout by jos reyes , cutting the braves' lead to 63 the mets were unable to stage another rally but the braves did , scoring a run in the seventh off aaron sele the mets also grounded into three double plays and did not always look sharp in the field reyes backed away from a foul ball in the second inning for no apparent reason it all amounted to an ugly game for the mets , and another victory for the braves they 're a good team , wright said there s a reason that they 've been beating up on us all year inside pitch carlos beltr n hit , ran and played catch yesterday for the first time since he strained his left oblique muscle july 25 he said he was feeling better , but not well enough to play in a game beltr n , who is eligible to come off the disabled list tomorrow , said he had no problem running , catching or hitting from the left side of the plate but he said he was about 50 percent from the right side my goal is to try to come back thursday , but feeling good from both sides , he said the mets will honor tom glavine , who earned his 300th career victory sunday in chicago , during a ceremony before this sunday s home game against the florida marlins catcher mike difelice cleared waivers yesterday and was sent outright to class aaa new orleans

after becoming the first major college quarterback to reach 20 passing touchdowns and 20 rushing touchdowns in a season , florida s tim tebow became the first sophomore to win the heisman trophy last night tebow earned 1 , 957 points and 462 firstplace votes the arkansas junior running back darren mcfadden was the runnerup for the second year in a row , collecting 1 , 703 points and 291 firstpace votes , the most firstplace votes a runnerup has received the hawaii senior quarterback colt brennan placed third with 632 points , and the missouri junior quarterback chase daniel was fourth with 425 with his right hand in a cast , tebow , 20 , accepted the 25pound bronze trophy and gave an emotional acceptance speech in which he thanked everyone from his strength and conditioning coach to his offensive linemen to jesus his nervousness was apparent when three times he repeated , i love being a gator , and i love gator nation if tebow had been an upperclassman , the victory might have been a landslide but his status as a sophomore had many of the traditionalists among the voters wondering if the award should take into account a more complete college career there are a lot of great freshmen and sophomores out there , tebow said and i'm just glad that i get to be the first one to win this in each of his 12 games this season , tebow had at least one rushing touchdown he amassed 838 yards on 194 carries and scored 22 times but that was only half his game he also passed for 3 , 132 yards with 29 touchdowns and completed 685 percent of his throws earlier in the week , tebow won the davey o'brien award as the best quarterback in the country and the maxwell award , a prize separate from the heisman for the nation s best player in recent years , however , the maxwell has seemed somewhat ominous for heisman hopefuls no player has won both awards in the same season since ron dayne in 1999 instead , tebow became the second florida quarterback in the last 11 years to win the heisman , following danny wuerffel , one of tebow s childhood heroes but wuerffel did not play in the kind of spread offense that has made 2007 the highestscoring season in college football history the moment that stood out for many voters was tebow s 23yard touchdown run against florida state when he ducked out of a crunching tackle from a lineman and eluded two more defensive backs as he sprinted to the goal line that was after he had avoided a sack and rushed for 16 yards on thirdand14 to keep the drive rolling using his legs under pressure might have helped carry him to the heisman , and it is also what first put him in the spotlight as a freshman playing behind chris leak , the 6foot3 , 235pound tebow was florida coach urban meyer s choice in shortyardage situations in his first southeastern conference game , against tennessee , tebow came in on a fourthand1 in the fourth quarter and pounded his way to a critical first down to set up the goahead touchdown in a 2120 victory he finished his freshman season with 469 yards rushing and a teamhigh 8 touchdown runs on 89 carries he threw for only 358 yards , but none meant more than the 358th a 1yard touchdown pass on thirdandgoal in the national championship game victory against ohio state for mcfadden , sitting at the ceremony only to hear someone else s name called was an alltoo familiar experience last year , he made the trip to new york only to watch ohio state quarterback troy smith claim the trophy by the secondlargest margin in history mcfadden , a twotime sec offensive player of the year and the walter camp player of the year , made his strongest case for the heisman with his performance in arkansas s 5048 tripleovertime victory at louisiana state he rushed for 206 yards , including a 73yard touchdown sprint in the third quarter , and threw a 24yard pass for a touchdown in the fourth the final heisman picture did not come into focus until the last month or so , with several other names being mentioned throughout the season after rushing for a touchdown in each of his first eight games , oregon quarterback dennis dixon seemed like a top candidate but after a knee injury in a loss to arizona cut his season short , his 20 touchdowns and 2 , 106 passing yards were not enough to earn him an invitation to new york west virginia quarterback pat white , who threw for 12 touchdowns and rushed for 14 , might have also been considered as he led the mountaineers to the brink of the national title game before the mountaineers lost to pittsburgh it was that same weekend that brennan played his way into contention with hawaii putting the only perfect football bowl subdivision record on the line against washington last saturday , he completed 42 of 50 passes to close a 21point deficit and win the game with a 5yard slant pass with 44 seconds to play but brennan s critics are quick to point out that he faced a weak schedule hawaii did not play a team in the top 25 until

these days a night at the museum is one of the hottest tickets in new york but do n't be misled this is not the hit movie in which ben stiller plays a security guard at a fictionalized american museum of natural history , only to discover that the fossils and specimens come to life at dusk , racing and rampaging through the galleries this is a real overnight at the actual museum , and the racers and rampagers are not tyrannosaurus rex skeletons and bloodthirsty barbarians , but kids on saturday the museum began its night at the museum for children 8 to 12 \( and their required accompanying adults \) , a camping experience well suited to urbanites you get a cot for your sleeping bag , the snoozing is indoors in the milstein hall of ocean life and the wild creatures , while plentiful , are mostly stuffed the sleepover , said ellen v futter , the museum s president , is a longedfor revival of a program abandoned years ago \( she is n't sure why \) it s really a coincidence with the movie , she said of course the movie made it eminently ripe in a nod to the film , which features exterior shots of the museum but none of its interiors , the goodie bag for campers has a sheet describing which objects seen in the movie can actually be found in the galleries \( an easter island head and a crosssection of a giant sequoia , for example \) and which cannot \( sacagawea and attila the hun , for starters \) but as a visit on saturday proved , the night at the museum sleepover is n't really about the movie the experience starts with a 5 45 checkin and a brief orientation lights go out at 12 15 am in between is a mix of activities and free exploration one of the favorite scheduled stops is the butterfly conservatory , where some of the 500 or so residents often alight on guests at 9 30 campers go on the flashlight fossil exploration , investigating the darkened dinosaur galleries a few strobe lights give the place a bit of a dinodisco atmosphere something like a scavenger hunt , this activity includes booklets with clues and questions a typical entry just past the t rex is an allosaurus what skeleton is this large meateater standing over \? it s cool , said sophia berenato , 9 , of manhattan , even though she had n't found any of the species described but she and her newfound 8yearold friends , raina shoen thomas and ashley beere , made their own adventures we started playing this time game where we pretended we were going back millions of years ago , sophia said the exploratory phase of the sleepover ends with a bang , a big one a visit to the rose center for earth and space to watch cosmic collisions , a multimedia show about the formation of the universe the museum counters the astral chaos with bedtime stories and its own version of the late show back at milstein hall a film about dolphins just one promised commodity may prove elusive sleep lightsout science the museum of natural history is n't the only museum to offer sleepover programs all are popular campers are advised to book early american museum of natural history the night at the museum program , for ages 8 to 12 , is monthly \( occasionally semimonthly \) , from 5 45 pm to 9 am , 79th street and central park west , \( 212 \) 7695200 , amnhorg sleepovers 79 a person 75 for groups 70 for members \( includes an evening snack and breakfast \) accommodates about 350 the program is currently sold out through may new york hall of science science sleepovers include science demonstrations and a make it and take it activity for boy and girl scout troops , community organizations and private groups \( minimum of 200 \) monthly or semimonthly , most often in the winter and spring 6 pm to 9 am at 4701 111th street , flushing meadowscorona park , queens , \( 718 \) 6990005 , ext 343 , nyscienceorg nyhseducation edscoutprogramhtml 35 a person \( includes an evening snack and breakfast \) accommodates about 500 \( one adult required for every five children \) rubin museum of art expedition rma a peak experience , for ages 11 to 14 , featuring a mountaineer and an overnight simulated climb of mount everest \( up the museum s spiral staircase \) , was held for the first time last year program runs from 7 30 pm to 8 am , at 150 west 17th street , flatiron district , \( 212 \) 6205000 , rmanycorg 108 \( includes dinner , snacks and breakfast \) children are dropped off accommodates 40 a similar event is planned for this summer and annually thereafter photos above , the flashlight fossil exploration in a darkened dinosaur gallery in the milstein hall of ocean life , above right , the whale takes the place of a canopy of stars \( photographs by joe fornabaio for the new york times \)

the shocks just keep on coming hillary clinton leads the democratic field with 51 percent of the vote she beats barack obama by 24 percentage points among black democrats she is projected now to beat giuliani or at the very least to be in a statistical dead heat with him in the general election this wasn t supposed to happen according to the received wisdom of those intheknow here in washington , hillary was supposed to be divisive , unelectable , radioactive it was the fault of bill and monica , and the fact that you never knew when there was going to be another bill and monica it was the fault of hillary for not taking the hard line on bill and monica the way a woman of her stature and standing was supposed to do and it was the fault of voters those people out there who would never , ever elect another clinton why \? because everyone said so \( i think the one thing we know about hillary , the one thing we absolutely know , bottom line , is she can`t win , right \? is how msnbc host tucker carlson once put it to new republic editoratlarge peter beinart she is unelectable \) the we world of tucker carlson knew what they knew about hillary clinton right up until about this week , i think because they spend an awful lot of time talking to , socializing with and interviewing one another what they don t do all that much is venture outside of a certain set of zip codes to get a feel for the way most people are actually living they don t sign up for adjustable rate mortgages , visit emergency rooms to get their primary health care , leave their children in unlicensed day care or lose their jobs because they have to drive their mothers home from the hospital after hip replacement surgery hillary clinton s supporters , it turns out , do alongside the newest set of poll results showing clinton s surprising levels of popularity among lower and middleclass women , white moderate women , even black voters , was another story this week , based on a new set of data from the irs it showed that america s most wealthy earn an even greater share of the nation s income than they did in 2000 , at the peak of the tech boom the wealthiest 1 percent of americans , the wall street journal reported , earned 212 percent of all income in 2005 \( the latest date for which these data are available \) , up from the high of 208 percent they d reached in the bull market of 2000 the bottom 50 percent of people earned 128 percent of all income , compared with 13 percent in 2000 and the median tax filer s income fell 2 percent when adjusted for inflation \( to about 31 , 000 \) between 2000 and 2005 more and more people are being priced out of a middle class existence because of housing prices , because of health care costs , because of tax policy , because of the cost of child care , the good life a life of relative comfort and financial security is now , in many parts of the country , an uppermiddleclass luxury given all this , you would think that clinton s big policy announcement this week on improving life for working families would have been big news after all , it contained a number of huge new middle class entitlements paid family leave and sick leave , most notably there were a number of triedandtrue triggers for outrage from the right wing and the business community like government standards and quality controls for child care there could have been debate stoked among the many childless workers who now feel parents are getting too much special treatment in the workplace \( clinton supports legislation to protect parents and pregnant women from job discrimination \) at the very least , someone could have accused clinton of trying to bring back welfare \( she supports subsidies for lowincome parents who wish to stay home to raise their children \) or someone could have questioned how realistic it really is to pay for all that to the tune of 175 billion per year simply by cracking down on the abusive use of tax shelters , as clinton proposes to do but there was none of this clinton s family policy speech in new hampshire all but sank like a stone if it was covered at all , it was often packaged as part of a feature on her attempts to curry favor with female voters \( clinton shows femininity , read a boston globe headline \) it was as though the opinionmakers and agendasetters , waiting with bated breath for bill to slip up , just one more time , couldn t see or hear the message to middleclass voters \( i do see you and i do hear you , clinton said in a speech on rebuilding the middle class earlier this month you re not invisible to me \) in contemplating the disconnect , as i often have done , between hillary and her uppermiddleclass peers , i find myself thinking of psychologist abraham maslow s hierarchy of needs in maslow s theory of human motivation , needs were mapped out in a pyramid form the broad array of physiological needs was at the bottom , followed by the almost equally wide range of safety needs things like bodily and financial security , secure physical health and work , and property ownership transcendent needs , like truth , justice , wisdom and selfactualization , were in the tiniest triangle up at the top as their lowerlevel needs were met , maslow theorized , people moved up the pyramid they did not unless the material circumstances of their lives changed dramatically move back the american middle class , it seems to me , is looking to politicians now to satisfy a pretty basic and urgent level of need yet people in the upper middle class with their excellent health benefits , schools , salaries , retirement plans , nannies and private afterschool programs have journeyed so far from that level of need that , it often seems to me , they literally cannot hear what resonates with the middle class that creates a problematic blind spot for those who write , edit or produce what comes to be known about our politicians and their policies having used that maslow pyramid analogy , i want to make clear that i do not mean to impute to upper middle class people a higher \( in the sense of better \) form of political reasoning i am merely trying to say that the wealth gap has brought an experience gap that is in turn producing a gap in perception one that , i predict , will yield a wealth of surprises in this election period hopefully , they ll be good ones
international air travel is an example of an industry where arcane , outofdate rules have held back growth and investment for too long the deal between the european union and the united states to modernize and rationalize the governance of the 18 billion transatlantic aviation market is a welcome one for consumers but it would have been even better if the bush administration and congress could have gone further and opened up the american market to more competition , and the superior service and lower prices that come with it we hope that politicians will embrace the freemarket principles they so frequently tout in the next round of negotiations , and not let protectionist and nationalist sentiments harm consumer choice before the socalled open skies pact , the united states had separate agreements with individual european countries , or in some cases , none at all as a result , a german airline like lufthansa could not operate flights from paris to new york in the new environment , that kind of intraeuropean competition will soon be possible and should lead to vigorous new entrants in oncesheltered markets it is the consumer , cheaper ticket in hand , who benefits the european union transport commissioner says he expects that over the next five years the number of passengers flying between europe and the united states will grow to 75 million annually an increase of 26 million even a fraction of that would be an enormous gain in business but while americans like to think of europeans as the stodgy ones with ossified markets , the united states did not go nearly as far in pulling down artificial barriers to competition as europe did american airlines will be allowed to operate flights between eu cities , say from london to amsterdam , but european airlines will still be prohibited from flying , say , from boston to chicago and the united states still limits a foreign company to owning 25 percent of voting shares in an airline operating here embedded in these rules is a pessimistic assumption that american airlines would suffer in a competition with foreign ones the united states has been at the forefront of aviation since the wright brothers flew at kitty hawk on the manufacturing side , boeing has enjoyed considerable success against its european rival airbus the industry should go back to thinking like the freemarketeers this country has always encouraged and valued
in february 2003 , secretary of state colin powell , addressing the united nations security council , claimed to have proof that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction he did not , in fact , present any actual evidence , just pictures of buildings with big arrows pointing at them saying things like chemical munitions bunker but many people in the political and media establishments swooned they admired mr powell , and because he said it , they believed it mr powell s masters got the war they wanted , and it soon became apparent that none of his assertions had been true until recently i assumed that the failure to find wmd , followed by years of false claims of progress in iraq , would make a repeat of the snow job that sold the war impossible but i was wrong the administration , this time relying on gen david petraeus to play the colin powell role , has had remarkable success creating the perception that the surge is succeeding , even though there s not a shred of verifiable evidence to suggest that it is thus kenneth pollack of the brookings institution the author of the threatening storm the case for invading iraq and his colleague michael o'hanlon , another longtime war booster , returned from a pentagonguided tour of iraq and declared that the surge was working they received enormous media coverage most of that coverage accepted their ludicrous selfdescription as critics of the war who have been convinced by new evidence a third participant in the same tour , anthony cordesman of the center for strategic and international studies , reported that unlike his traveling companions , he saw little change in the iraq situation and did not see success for the strategy that president bush announced in january but neither his dissent nor a courageous rebuttal of mr o'hanlon and mr pollack by seven soldiers actually serving in iraq , published in the new york times , received much media attention meanwhile , many news organizations have come out with misleading reports suggesting a sharp drop in us casualties the reality is that this year , as in previous years , there have been monthtomonth fluctuations that tell us little for example , july 2006 was a lowcasualty month , with only 43 us military fatalities , but it was also a month in which the iraqi situation continued to deteriorate and so far , every month of 2007 has seen more us military fatalities than the same month in 2006 what about civilian casualties \? the pentagon says they 're down , but it has neither released its numbers nor explained how they 're calculated according to a draft report from the government accountability office , which was leaked to the press because officials were afraid the office would be pressured into changing the report s conclusions , us government agencies differ on whether sectarian violence has been reduced and independent attempts by news agencies to estimate civilian deaths from news reports , hospital records and other sources have not found any significant decline now , there are parts of baghdad where civilian deaths probably have fallen but that s not necessarily good news some military officers , reports leila fadel of mcclatchy , believe that it may be an indication that ethnic cleansing has been completed in many neighborhoods and that there are n't as many people to kill above all , we should remember that the whole point of the surge was to create space for political progress in iraq and neither that leaked gao report nor the recent national intelligence estimate found any political progress worth mentioning there has been no hint of sectarian reconciliation , and the iraqi government , according to yet another leaked us government report , is completely riddled with corruption but , say the usual suspects , general petraeus is a fine , upstanding officer who would n't participate in a campaign of deception apparently forgetting that they said the same thing about mr powell first of all , general petraeus is now identified with the surge if it fails , he fails he has every incentive to find a way to keep it going , in the hope that somehow he can pull off something he can call success and general petraeus s history also suggests that he is much more of a political , and indeed partisan , animal than his press would have you believe in particular , six weeks before the 2004 presidential election , general petraeus published an oped article in the washington post in which he claimed wrongly , of course that there had been tangible progress in iraq , and that momentum has gathered in recent months is it normal for serving military officers to publish articles just before an election that clearly help an incumbent s campaign \? i do n't think so so here we go again it appears that many influential people in this country have learned nothing from the last five years and those who cannot learn from history are , indeed , doomed to repeat it
where have all the elves gone \? that s the question gamers and the people who love them are bound to ask this fall as they take in the latest crop of bigbudget video games since the 1970s , dragons , orcs , wizards and dwarfs have been staples of interactive entertainment , yet this holiday season there are hardly any top new games in the traditional fantasy mode instead 2007 has been dominated by perhaps the deepest lineup of science fiction games ever it started in august with the sleeper hit bioshock , which can best be described as intelligent scifi noir \( genetic engineering in 1940s bigband style \) then last month came the pop culture juggernaut , the epitome of mainstream action scifi \( men with huge guns saving the galaxy from an interstellar menace \) between now and thanksgiving gamers will see gothic scifi in hellgate london \( demons invade postapocalyptic london \) the first major sciencefiction online game in years in richard garriott s tabula rasa and the magnum opuscumspace opera mass effect not floating in space yet \? in a mashup of gaming trends , the most anticipated pc shooter this fall , crysis , lets players take aim at both aliens and north koreans even many of the fall s top childfriendly console games , like the latest metroid , the new ratchet clank and the coming super mario galaxy , are set in a fanciful future the most obvious question is , why the shift \? but it may be more salient to ask why most video games are set in so few genres to begin with , and whether that s changing after all , most forms of entertainment draw consumers into an experience they could not actually have in life that is as true of days of our lives , the national football league or the godfather as it is of any video game the difference is that books , films and television shows are more often set in some approximation of the real , contemporary world yet many of the best video games take place in fantasy and sciencefiction worlds meant to have as little in common with reality as possible that may reflect games' strengths and weaknesses as a storytelling medium the one thing that makes electronic games unique among entertainment media is choice , or agency in a game the star of the show is the consumer , not a celebrity on a screen , stage or playing field a gamer does not have merely to identify with the protagonist of someone s else story the gamer actually gets to become that alternative identity , if just for a while so , the thinking goes , that identity ought to be as alternative as possible when you 're making a video game , you 're trying to give the player special experiences and abilities that go beyond the everyday as much as possible , said casey hudson , project director for mass effect , a new sciencefiction roleplaying game to be released next month you want to be able to give somebody an experience where they can leave behind their everyday life or as put by bill roper , chief executive of flagship studios , which plans to release hellgate london later this month , no one wants to play a game where they are a cpa trying to figure out a deduction mr roper added as a john grisham novel , the cpa thing could work his novels are intriguing , they 're great but i do n't know if a john grisham story could be a fun game and that , quite neatly , is what video games have been so bad at all the snazzy technology that has done so much to make gamers feel as if they are somewhere else has also done little to populate those fantastic virtual realities with the believable , nuanced story lines and characters that have been the lifeblood of linear drama since homer in that sense , outlandish settings have long distracted players from noticing a dearth of oldfashioned storytelling what we have not really gotten in games , mr hudson said , which you do get when you watch a great television drama , is that as exciting as the setting may be , what s really interesting are the people , the personal , human stories naturally , mr hudson and the rest of his team at bioware hope to change that with mass effect game makers have been employing more writers recently , hoping to improve storytelling but perhaps even more interesting is how technology can allow stories to emerge where a game s makers wrote none consider the sims , the family simulation series that has become wildly popular among elementary school and middle school girls in the sims , as with traditional dolls like barbie , girls \( mostly \) create a virtual household and populate and furnish it to their liking then , using a combination of visual props and imagination , millions of simsplaying girls , like their dollplaying mothers and grandmothers , set their own story on the family they have created as for the wave of sciencefiction games this year , that is probably just cyclical it generally takes at least three years to make a topnotch game look back at 2004 elves were everywhere the lord of the rings film trilogy had just concluded , and in gaming the very popular world of warcraft fantasy was sweeping away the competition there are a lot of ways in which world of warcraft has influenced the gamemaking community , not just the gameplaying community , said mr roper , who was formerly a senior developer at the company behind that game , blizzard entertainment it s suicide to try to go head to head with world of warcraft so now instead of a gaggle of goblins , gamers this fall are being confronted with an army of aliens thanks to the latest graphics technology , almost all of those spacelings will be ready for their closeups some may even come armed with more sophisticated , compelling stories than their ancestors and if you really love elves , do n't despair with the way the game industry works , they will surely be back soon

the beautiful and deeply religious madame de tourvel is so distraught after cheating on her husband in the 1782 novel les liaisons dangereuses that she blacks out the betrayal altogether , arriving at a convent with no idea of what had brought her there soon the horror of the infidelity rushes back , in all its incriminating force more than two centuries later , she has become part of a longstanding debate about whether the brain can block access to painful memories , like betrayals and childhood sexual abuse , and suddenly release them later on in a paper posted online in the current issue of the journal psychological medicine , a team of psychiatrists and literary scholars reports that it could not find a single account of repressed memory , fictional or not , before the year 1800 the researchers offered a 1 , 000 reward last march to anyone who could document such a case in a healthy , lucid person they posted the challenge in newspapers and on 30 web sites where the topic might be discussed none of the responses were convincing , the authors wrote , suggesting that repressed memory is a culturebound syndrome and not a natural process of human memory madame de tourvel is the closest we got to a winner , said dr harrison pope , a professor of psychiatry at harvard and the lead author of the paper but her amnesia , he said , was too brief to qualify the researchers hypothesized that if a natural ability to repress memories were hardwired into the human brain , then such a thing would surely have occurred in medical or fictional literature before the 19th century , when novelists began using it as a plot device this is such a graphic phenomenon that you would expect to find many allusions to it , and not merely oblique ones , dr pope said the finding , while adding a literary dimension to a mostly scientific debate , may only inflame both sides dr pope and a coauthor , dr james i hudson of harvard , have long been skeptical of repressed memory , while others argue that it is real , at least in some cases it looks to me like they had an answer in mind before they did the study and found what they were looking for , said dr david spiegel , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the stanford university school of medicine dr spiegel has submitted a rebuttal to the journal , citing links between trauma and forgetfulness in greek literature the socalled memory wars peaked in the 1980s , when some patients in therapy described longlost scenes of abuse , often at the hands of their parents books and news articles dramatized the experience , and some charges turned into high profile court cases the debate died down in the 1990s , after experts raised questions about many claims , but it has revived in recent years , largely because of the sexual abuse scandal in the roman catholic church the authors of the new paper report that they received more than 100 responses to their challenge euripides' heracles , in a fit of madness , murders his wife and children , but forgets the incident after suffering an injury in shakespeare , king lear at first does not recognize his daughter cordelia when he awakens disoriented in the french camp in some versions of the sanskrit epic ramayana , the immortal monkey hanuman forgets that he possesses supernatural powers but none of these adventures fit the authors' strict criteria a healthy person blacks out a specific traumatic event , only to retrieve it a year or more later madame de tourvel s experience submitted by richard j mcnally , a harvard psychologist and a repressedmemory skeptic may offer the first glimmering of a concept that arose during the romantic era in the 1800s , later took hold in the writings of freud and eventually provided a staple in hollywood movies , dr pope said david bromwich , a professor of english at yale and author of disowned by memory wordsworth s poetry in the 1790s \( university of chicago press \) , disavowed any special expertise on the memory debate but he said the romantic period was full of poets and others saying that the mind works by a combination of invention and recreation of material from halfforgotten memories the scientific dispute is over what constitutes normal forgetting studies show that healthy people usually remember frightening or dangerous incidents more vividly than other experiences the brain preserves these impressions because they are important for survival but those who believe in the brain s ability actively to repress say this system may break down if the memory is too upsetting dr pope is famous for saying trauma is memorable , but when he is presented with cases of forgetting trauma as in the 101 cases in my web site his answer is that they are normal forgetting , ross e cheit , a political scientist at brown university who runs the site , said in an email message dr mcnally replied that even if a once vivid memory has not surfaced in years , that does not mean it has been actively repressed for example , he said , a child might initially be more confused than upset upon receiving sexual advances from a relative the brain stores the memory , stuffed into a neural drawer with a thousand other mysteries of childhood , until years later , when the repulsiveness of the act suddenly hits the person , now an adult it s not repression it s just that the person has n't thought about it in many years , has n't appreciated how reprehensible it was , dr mcnally said the notion of repressed memory , he went on , is a culturally provided narrative to account for the fact that the memory is now retrospectively reappraised as traumatic the researchers said they were still fielding suggestions at

in the great traditions of the old west , deputizes bounty hunters to help enforce its environmental laws but these deputies , who get to keep a quarter of any penalties they recover for the state , carry briefcases rather than pistols , and their critics say their tactics amount to legalized extortion all it takes to win a settlement from a private company is a little research to identify even a trace amount of a toxin in , say , office supplies or a parking lot and some threatening legal boilerplate extracting settlements in these cases , an appeals court judge wrote last year , is absurdly easy jerry brown , the state s former governor and now its attorney general , intends to bring some order to the situation he started by picking a fight last month with the state s leading bounty hunter , clifford a chanler he takes advantage of small companies , edward g weil , a lawyer in mr brown s office , said of mr chanler he pummels small , basically defenseless companies for small amounts of money individually for cases that should not have been brought in the first place in the past seven years , mr chanler has sent over 600 notices and filed more than 200 lawsuits on behalf of a few clients , none of whom even claimed to have been injured , and collected 15 million in settlements in return over coffee the other day , mr chanler said he did not much care for the term bounty hunter i prefer to use the phrase of citizen enforcer , ' he said but i do n't shy away from the fact that there is a civil bounty incentive structure built into the statute mr chanler made a persuasive case that he is doing precisely what the law means for him to do , working relatively efficiently on authentic public health issues , notably that of lead in and on glasses , mugs and bottles but that leaves the question of why california has chosen to outsource the regulation of public safety in 1986 , california voters passed the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act , usually referred to as proposition 65 its goal could hardly be less objectionable the law requires manufacturers , retailers and others to tell people when they are exposed to certain carcinogens a state agency publishes the list , which now contains over 600 substances , many quite common failure to warn consumers about the presence of those substances can result in penalties of 2 , 500 a day the law encourages private lawyers to jump into the enforcement game by offering their clients a quarter of any penalty , plus their legal fees some lawyers have responded by blanketing small businesses with notices of violations and extracting quick settlements it is a good business the law generates 100 to 150 settlements for a total of about 10 million every year , mr weil said there is a group of about a dozen law firms out there who do nearly all of the private litigation , he said the lawyers visit stores and do research on the internet , matching products to substances on the list even a few molecules will do , the frustrated appeals court judge , presiding justice david g sills of the california court of appeal in santa ana , wrote last year in rejecting a proposed settlement , one not involving mr chanler the products need not be exotic dried paint , justice sills wrote furniture parking lots wiring really the public often gains almost nothing from such litigations the businesses that settle are required to post notices , as the quotable justice sills put it , telling people that things like dried paint may be slowly emitting lead molecules or that parking lots are places where there might be auto exhaust mr weil said the suits sometimes resulted in silly warnings spray paint has 10 warnings on it , he said is an 11th warning going to make a difference \? if you 're talking about food and personal care items , he added , it might make a difference mr chanler said his efforts had led to the reformulation of products and meaningful warnings civil enforcement should not be left to public officials , he said , because of the influence of money on politics and just the resource level available to the government just last week , a state court judge in oakland approved the settlement of a case mr chanler had brought against the restaurant chain fuddruckers , which agreed to pay 160 , 000 in penalties and to stop using glass soda bottles with artwork or designs containing lead the state will get 120 , 000 of that fuddruckers , which denied wrongdoing , will also pay 890 , 000 for mr chanler s firm s fees and expenses in a critical letter to mr chanler last month , the attorney general conceded that lead on the outside of glassware could represent a real hazard and crowed about his own similar suits but he criticized mr chanler s approach , saying it does not appear to be in the public interest mr brown said mr chanler s clients have collected significant sums of money from businesses that have little or no liability for past violations , and an amount of attorney fees that appears to exceed a reasonable amount but the fault does not seem to lie with the entrepreneurial mr chanler if you deputize bounty hunters , you should not be surprised when they go out and hunt

chicago last august , a prison inmate in jackson , mich someone the authorities described as floridly psychotic died in his segregation cell , naked , shackled to a concrete slab , lying in his own urine , scheduled for a mental health transfer that never happened last month in florida , the head of the state s social services department resigned abruptly after having been fined 80 , 000 and is facing criminal contempt charges for failing to transfer severely mentally ill jail inmates to state hospitals ten days ago , the supreme court agreed to determine when mentally ill death row inmates should be considered so deranged that their execution would be constitutionally impermissible the case involves a 48yearold navy veteran who is a diagnosed schizophrenic in the decade leading up to the crime he was hospitalized 14 times for severe mental illness according to a study released by the justice department in september , 56 percent of jail inmates in state prisons and 64 percent of inmates across the country reported mental health problems within the past year though troubling , none of this should come as a surprise over the past 40 years , the united states dismantled a colossal mental health complex and rebuilt bed by bed an enormous prison during the 20th century we exhibited a schizophrenic relationship to deviance after more than 50 years of stability , federal and state prison populations skyrocketed from under 200 , 000 persons in 1970 to more than 13 million in 2002 that year , our imprisonment rate rose above 600 inmates per 100 , 000 adults with the inclusion of an additional 700 , 000 inmates in jail , we now incarcerate more than two million people resulting in the highest incarceration number and rate in the world , five times that of britain and 12 times that of japan what few people realize , though , is that in the 1940s and '50s we institutionalized people at even higher rates only it was in mental hospitals and asylums simply put , when the data on state and county mental hospitalization rates are combined with the data on prison rates for 1928 through 2000 , the imprisonment revolution of the late 20th century barely reaches the level we experienced at midcentury our current culture of control is by no means new the graph on the left based on statistics from the federal census bureau , department of health and human services and bureau of justice statistics shows the aggregate rate of institutionalization per 100 , 000 adults in the united states from 1928 to 2000 , as well as the disaggregated trend lines for mental hospitalization on the one hand and state and federal prisons on the other the numbers include only state and county mental hospitals there were many more kinds of mental institutions at midcentury , ones for mental defectives and epileptics and the mentally retarded , psychiatric wards in veterans hospitals , as well as psychopathic and private mental hospitals if we include residents of those facilities , from 1935 to 1963 the united states consistently institutionalized at rates well above 700 per 100 , 000 adults with highs of 778 in 1939 and 786 in 1955 it should be clear why there is such a large proportion of mentally ill persons in our prisons individuals who used to be tracked for mental health treatment are now getting a oneway ticket to jail of course , there are important demographic differences between the two populations in 1937 , women represented 48 percent of residents in state mental hospitals in contrast , new prison admissions have consistently been 95 percent male also , the mental health patients from the 1930s to the 1960s were older and whiter than prison inmates of the 1990s but the graph poses a number of troubling questions why did we diagnose deviance in such radically different ways over the course of the 20th century \? do we need to be imprisoning at such high rates , or were we right , 50 years ago , to hospitalize instead \? why were so many women hospitalized \? why have they been replaced by young black men \? have both prisons and mental hospitals included large numbers of unnecessarily incarcerated individuals \? whatever the answers , the pendulum has swung too far possibly off its hinges it would be na ve , today , to address any of these questions without also considering the impact of imprisonment on crime one of the most reliable studies estimates that the increased prison population over the 1990s accounted for about a third of the overall drop in crime that decade however , prisons are not the only institutions that seem to have this effect in a recent study , i demonstrated that the rate of institutionalization including mental hospitals was a far better predictor of serious violent crime from 1926 to 2000 than just prison populations the data reveal a robust negative relationship between overall institutionalization \( prisons and asylums \) and homicide preliminary findings based on statelevel panel data confirm these results the effect on crime may not depend on whether the institution is a mental hospital or a prison even from a crimefighting perspective , then , it is time to rethink our prison and mental health policies a lot more work must be done before proposing answers to those troubling questions but the first step is to realize that we have been wildly erratic in our approach to deviance , mental health and the prison
hillary clinton has been a much better senator than barack obama she has been a serious , substantive lawmaker who has worked effectively across party lines obama has some accomplishments under his belt , but many of his colleagues believe that he has not bothered to master the intricacies of legislation or the maze of senate rules he talks about independence , but he has never quite bucked liberal orthodoxy or party discipline if clinton were running against obama for senate , it would be easy to choose between them but they are running for president , and the presidency requires a different set of qualities presidents are buffeted by sycophancy , criticism and betrayal they must improvise amid a thousand fluid crises they 're isolated and also exposed , puffed up on the outside and hollowed out within with the presidency , character and selfknowledge matter more than even experience there are reasons to think that , among democrats , obama is better prepared for this madness many of the best presidents in us history had their character forged before they entered politics and carried to it a degree of selfpossession and tranquillity that was impervious to the sturm und drang of white house life obama is an innerdirected man in a profession filled with insecure outerdirected ones he was forged by the process of discovering his own identity from the scattered facts of his childhood , a process that is described in finely observed detail in dreams from my father once he completed that process , he has been astonishingly constant like most of the rival campaigns , i 've been poring over press clippings from obama s past , looking for inconsistencies and flipflops there are virtually none the unity speech he gives on the stump today is essentially the same speech that he gave at the democratic convention in 2004 , and it s the same sort of speech he gave to illinois legislators and harvard law students in the decades before that he has a core , and was able to maintain his equipoise , for example , even as his campaign stagnated through the summer and fall moreover , he has a worldview that precedes political positions some americans \( republican or democrat \) believe that the country s future can only be shaped through a remorseless civil war between the children of light and the children of darkness though tom delay could n't deliver much for republicans and nancy pelosi , so far , has n't been able to deliver much for democrats , these warriors believe that what s needed is more partisanship , more toughness and eventual conquest for their side but obama does not ratchet up hostilities he restrains them he does not lash out at perceived enemies , but is aloof from them in the course of this struggle to discover who he is , obama clearly learned from the strain of pessimistic optimism that stretches back from martin luther king jr to abraham lincoln this is a worldview that detests anger as a motivating force , that distrusts easy dichotomies between the parties of good and evil , believing instead that the crucial dichotomy runs between the good and bad within each individual obama did not respond to his fatherlessness or his racial predicament with anger and rage , but as questions for investigation , conversation and synthesis he approaches politics the same way in her outstanding new yorker profile , larissa macfarquhar notes that obama does not perceive politics as a series of battles but as a series of systemic problems to be addressed he pursues liberal ends in gradualist , temperamentally conservative ways obama also has powers of observation that may mitigate his own inexperience and the isolating pressures of the white house in his famous essay , political judgment , isaiah berlin writes that wise leaders do n't think abstractly they use powers of close observation to integrate the vast shifting amalgam of data that constitute their own particular situation their own and no other obama demonstrated those powers in dreams from my father and still reveals glimpses of the ability to step outside his own ego and look at reality in uninhibited and honest ways he still retains the capacity , also rare in presidents , of being able to sympathize with and grasp the motivations of his rivals even in his political memoir , the audacity of hope , he astutely observes that candidates are driven less by the desire for victory than by the raw fear of loss and humiliation what bill clinton said on the charlie rose show is right picking obama is a roll of the dice sometimes he seems more concerned with process than results but for democrats , there s a roll of the dice either way the presidency is a bacterium it finds the open wounds in the people who hold it it infects them , and the resulting scandals infect the presidency and the country the person with the fewest wounds usually does best in the white house , and is best for the country
nairobi , kenya , april 10 ethiopian officials acknowledged tuesday for the first time that they had detained 41 terrorism suspects from 17 countries who had been fighting for somalia s islamist movement suspected international terrorists have been and are still being captured by the joint forces of the transitional federal government of somalia and , said a statement from the ethiopian foreign ministry for weeks now , human rights groups have been urging ethiopia , which has a nettlesome human rights record , to shed some light on the detainees many were captured in kenya , sent to somalia and then secretly taken to prisons in ethiopia the acknowledgment by ethiopia of its role in detaining terrorism suspects prompted officials in washington to speak more candidly about american interrogations of the captives those officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly , said tuesday that american intelligence agents had questioned several of the detainees in ethiopian jails over the past several months but they denied that the united states had played any part in transferring or detaining the prisoners , and denied that the prisoners were part of a covert rendition program in which suspects are captured by american forces and flown to another country to be interrogated in the past , many rendition suspects have been taken to countries where torture is routine it was unclear whether the ethiopians acted unilaterally in detaining the suspects , or with encouragement from american officials the washington officials said that the ethiopian military had been anxious to get islamic fighters off the battlefield in somalia because they had successfully attacked ethiopian troops , and that the government in addis ababa had rarely hesitated in the past to begin operations in the horn of africa without american approval several ethiopian opposition groups had been using somalia as a base for attacks on ethiopia , and another american official said it was suspects from those outfits that most interested ethiopian intelligence agents also , eritrea , ethiopia s neighbor and bitter enemy , is widely suspected by ethiopian intelligence agents of supporting islamists in somalia although ethiopia has a long and storied christian history , its population today is about half muslim some ethiopians worry that the conditions are ripe for a radical islamist movement in their own country the united states and ethiopia have grown closer over the past year as their interests in combating islamic extremism in the region have aligned last december , ethiopian forces , with clandestine american help , overthrew an islamist movement that briefly ruled somalia thousands of ethiopian soldiers remain in that country and many somalis say that if they leave , somalia s weak transitional government will collapse at the time of the invasion , the united states provided the ethiopians with detailed intelligence about the fighting positions of islamic fighters the pentagon has also used a secret airstrip in ethiopia for special operations raids into somalia the significance of the detainees in ethiopian custody was unclear american officials have said that none of the top operatives in al qaeda who have been active in the horn of africa have been killed or captured since the ethiopian invasion began in december human rights groups have accused the ethiopian government of running a secret detention program and breaking international law they have also accused ethiopia of committing war crimes during recent fighting in mogadishu , somalia s capital they cited the bombing of several neighborhoods by ethiopian forces that caused hundreds of civilian deaths ethiopian officials have said their troops did not intentionally single out civilians as for accusations of illegality , the statement from the ethiopian foreign ministry said , all legal procedures are being followed , and the suspected terrorists have been allowed to appear before the relevant court of law five suspects have already been freed , the statement said , and 29 others have been cleared by a military court it said that the five were from denmark , sweden , tanzania , sudan and the united arab emirates the statement added that foreign investigators had questioned some of the suspects but it did not specify the nationalities of the investigators american special operations forces have been working closely with ethiopian forces for several months to hunt terrorism suspects believed to have played a role in attacks during the past decade , including the bombings of the american embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 american intelligence agencies believe that qaeda operatives responsible for those and other largescale attacks have been hiding in somalia , which has been mired in anarchy since the central government imploded in 1991 early this year , fbi agents in kenya questioned several militia fighters who escaped over somalia s southern border into kenya , including two americans , amir mohamed meshal and daniel joseph maldonado mr meshal was deported to somalia and wound up in an ethiopian jail mr maldonado was later flown to houston , where he faces terrorismrelated charges one american intelligence official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter , said that the interviews in ethiopia had produced valuable information it would have been irresponsible for the united states to give up the opportunity to interrogate suspects who could have information about al qaeda in the horn of africa , the official added paul gimigliano , a cia spokesman , declined to give details about the agency s activities in the region , but said that the cia acts boldly yet legally , alone and with partners , just as our government and people expect us to
the latest campaign advertising tallies show that bill richardson , the new mexico governor turned presidential contender , is also the biggest spender on the democrats side so far he has spent 2 million in television advertising in iowa and new hampshire , for a total of 3 , 780 spots , said evan tracey , the chief operating officer of the campaign media analysis group , which tracks political advertising barack obama was close behind , spending nearly 2 million on ads , almost entirely in iowa that is more than senator hillary rodham clinton and former senator john edwards combined , mr tracey said mrs clinton has spent 940 , 000 on ads in iowa , and mr edwards only 13 , 000 senator christopher dodd ran just as many spots as mrs clinton , but spent only 450 , 000 , saving money by running more ads in the summer and during offpeak hours , when rates are lower none of the democrats came close to the advertising purchased by mitt romney , the republican candidate since february , he has spent almost 8 million on nearly 10 , 000 spots
two presidential elections ago , the conventional wisdom said that george w bush was a likable , honest fellow but those of us who actually analyzed what he was saying about policy came to a different conclusion namely , that he was irresponsible and deeply dishonest his numbers did n't add up , and in his speeches he simply lied about the content of his own proposals in the fifth year of the disastrous war mr bush started on false pretenses , it s clear who was right what a candidate says about policy , not the supposedly revealing personal anecdotes political reporters love to dwell on , is the best way to judge his or her character so what are the current presidential candidates saying about policy , and what does it tell us about them \? well , none of the leading republican candidates have said anything substantive about policy go through their speeches and campaign materials and you 'll see a lot of posturing , especially about how tough they are on terrorists but nothing at all about what they actually plan to do in fact , i suspect that the real reason most of the republicans are ducking a youtube debate is that they 're afraid they would be asked questions about policy , rather than being invited to compare themselves to ronald reagan but did n't rudy giuliani just announce a health care plan \? no , he vaguely described a tax cut proposal that he says would do something good for health care \( most experts disagree \) but he offered no specifics about how the plan would work , how much it would cost or how he would pay for it as ezra klein of the american prospect has pointed out , in the speech announcing his plan and since no policy document has been released , the speech is all we have to go on mr giuliani never uttered the word uninsured he did , however , repeatedly denounce socialized medicine or some variant thereof the entire gop field , then , fails the substance test there is , by contrast , a lot of substance on the democratic side , with john edwards forcing the pace most notably , in february , mr edwards transformed the whole health care debate with a plan that offers a politically and fiscally plausible path to universal health insurance whatever the fate of the edwards candidacy , mr edwards will deserve a lot of the credit if and when we do get universal care in this country mr edwards has also offered a detailed , sensible plan for tax reform , and some serious antipoverty initiatives four months after the edwards health care plan was announced , barack obama followed with a broadly similar but somewhat less comprehensive plan like mr edwards , mr obama has also announced a serious plan to fight poverty hillary clinton , however , has been evasive she conveys the impression that there s not much difference between her policy positions and those of the other candidates but she s offered few specifics in particular , unlike mr edwards or mr obama , she has n't announced a specific universal care plan , or explicitly committed herself to paying for health reform by letting some of the bush tax cuts expire for those who believe that the time for universal care has come , this lack of specifics is disturbing in fact , what mrs clinton said about health care in february s democratic debate suggested a notable lack of urgency well , i want to have universal health care coverage by the end of my second term on saturday , at the yearlykos convention in chicago , she sounded more forceful universal health care will be my highest domestic priority as president but does this represent a real change in position \? it s hard to know , since she has said nothing about how she would cover the uninsured and even if you believe mrs clinton s contention that her positions could never be influenced by lobbyists' money a remark that drew boos and hisses from the chicago crowd there s reason to worry about the big contributions she receives from the insurance and drug industries are they simply betting on the frontrunner , or are they also backing the democratic candidate least likely to hurt their profits \? all of the leading democratic candidates are articulate and impressive it s easy to imagine any of them as president but after what happened in 2000 , it worries me that mrs clinton is showing an almost republican aversion to talking about substance
by charles delafuente even though the brooklyn dodgers broke my heart when they abandoned brooklyn \( i was 12 \) , i have no quibble with walter o malley s admission to the hall of fame this week if the criterion is impact on the game , then o malley , the team owner who led the dodgers west , certainly qualifies i won t picket or protest but his admission is not a cleansing it does not mean that he is no longer evil incarnate the two can exist side by side there remains no reason to stop hating o malley what he did to brooklyn is unforgivable after a mere half century someone else could have opened the west to major league baseball , and o malley could have stayed in brooklyn i recall the thrust , if not the exact words , of the opening of a column written by one of brooklyn s most famous sons , pete hamill , when o malley died it started like this my mother taught me that if you had nothing good to say about the dead , shut up today , i break that rule \( the los angeles times s obituary , in contrast , portrayed o malley as the visionary owner who brought baseball to california it all depends on whose ox is being gored \) but pete had it right some old villains never die i recall an article in the times in 1990 about a suit brought by the dodgers to get a bar that had named itself brooklyn dodger to cease and desist the article recalled a conversation between o malley and his son , peter , on or about moving day in 1957 dad , what are we going to do \? asked mr o malley s 24yearold son , peter the things in the paper are terrible they are , peter , but they will pass , the father replied perhaps some day they will but it has been only 32 years , and brooklynites are still vilifying the o malleys \( by the way , the bar won \) there were other villains beside o malley , to be sure the mayor , robert f wagner , who apparently did not grasp that the advent of the passenger jet made a getaway to the west coast possible , and robert moses , the commissioner and master builder , who did not care \( and got off lightly in history \) moses , according to historical accounts , tried to interest o malley in the site where shea stadium was later built but o malley wanted to build a new stadium over the long island rail road station on flatbush avenue in brooklyn so he would have been a visionary had he stayed put the first to build above a transit hub , as madison square garden did a decade later over penn station , as the city recently tried to do for a football and olympics stadium on the far west side , and as the nets are now doing over none other than the long island rail road station on flatbush avenue in brooklyn had he stayed , o malley would perhaps not have gotten quite as rich , but he probably would have gotten his new stadium sooner or later that he chose not to cements his place in brooklyn history more forcefully than any honor belatedly bestowed on him by cooperstown
ponte vedra beach , fla \( ap \) , may 7 what some consider the fifthbest golf tournament looked more like an open house monday one by one , players drove their courtesy cars to the front of the 77 , 000squarefoot clubhouse at the players championship and were pointed in every direction volunteers guided them to the locker room , to a playersonly dining room and to the tunnel of champions that led out a back door to the refurbished players stadium course on the tpc sawgrass most of them did not know where they were i'm a little lost , geoff ogilvy said it s such a big building but despite a new look at the players championship , one thing has not changed no one is quite sure what it is the fifth major \? that will not get too many arguments because the golf course is superb , the field is the strongest and deepest of the year and the purse for this year s tournament will be 9 million , the richest of any tournament in the world but there are only four majors , which is why jeff sluman s remark four years ago still holds true when you go to denny s and order the grand slam breakfast , they do n't give you five things , do they \? he had said one reason the tournament was moved to may from march was to give golf a major event every month but even with a new clubhouse and a refurbished golf course meant to play firm and fast in any weather , there is still enough evidence to suggest that one of these events is not like the other four , coming off a twoshot victory at the wachovia championship , will not arrive until tuesday woods arrives no later than monday for a major major championships attract fans from all over the world the players largely remains a local event , drawing most of the galleries from the county , and a lot of them come to be seen the pga tour is starting a campaign to attract more fans from outside florida , although this will take time and it probably does not help that the players is held a week after the wachovia championship , which drew numerous comparisons to a major championship , especially after woods said that he was ecstatic to have won considering the quality of the golf course against the strength of the field in such difficult conditions several golfers were asked what the difference was between the wachovia and the players in every case , there was a pause for contemplation before they rated the players championship superior this adds up to a broader problem at pga tour headquarters the players is its showcase event , but the conversation always seems to be what the tournament is not , rather than what it is i think enough fun has been made of their place in the golf kingdom , sluman said over the weekend there are still only four majors , but it is an unbelievable golf course with , bar none , the best field in golf tour commissioner tim finchem has said that he wanted the players championship to be the best it can be , and he has stopped at nothing to accomplish that the tour wants the tournament to be known as the players , similar to the television coverage will include only four minutes of commercials every hour , like the masters the winner of the players will receive as many fedex cup points as the winner of a major in the world golf hall of fame ballots , the players is listed in bold print alongside the four majors nobody likes being forcefed , sluman said i think everybody associated with the tournament needs to let it take its course it will find its spot wherever that ends up in 5 , 10 , 15 or 50 years but just let it happen ogilvy called the players the fifthbest tournament in the world , which probably is what the players championship is but what inevitably followed were more examples of what it s not it s not a careerdefining win , he said is this a major \? jim furyk said is it not a major \? my answer was simply , does it matter \? it s a good , strong field i would say it s by far the strongest field in golf , year in and year out and it s probably the best way to market it carl petterson offered the best answer when asked his definition of the players it s our championship , he said

the original press box at the 16yearold us cellular field was a fine place to cover a white sox game from their nest behind home plate , reporters could easily discern the spin of a curveball or hear the thwack of bat on ball but this year , the white sox gutted it and remade it into the jim beam club , with 200 theater seats and barstools that cost 260 to 315 each when sold out , the club could generate 4 million or more in revenue we were giving the press the best real estate in the building , slightly elevated behind home plate , which they do n't need , said jerry reinsdorf , the real estate investor who is chairman of the white sox when asked why he moved the press to a much worse vista two levels up and along the firstbase and rightfield line , reinsdorf unhesitatingly said , financial reinsdorf is far from unique among team owners looking at the extra money that can be made in arranging , or rearranging , their home facilities to accommodate more luxury suites or club seats at the same time , baseball reporters \( usually print and radio \) have been shifted to higher spots , as in pnc park in pittsburgh , or inferior aeries like the one at the yearold busch stadium in st louis the cardinals improved the habitability of the press box before this season as part of renovations needed to play host to the 2009 allstar game the press box is higher than it was in the old busch stadium , a design that gives preference to luxury boxes last year , it was a gulag , said joe strauss of the st louis postdispatch after years of resisting his owners' cries to expand their inventory of courtside seating , nba commissioner david stern relented this season , permitting teams to move reporters into the lower bowl of arenas nfl reporters are used to inconvenient press boxes they have been relocated to the corners of , or behind , end zones as they are in the renovated soldier field in chicago , fedex field in landover , md , and gillette stadium in foxboro , mass or to higher altitudes , as they are in giants stadium john mara , a coowner of the giants , said the press box problem would be rectified in the stadium to be built with the jets pampering the press used to be more important than taking care of your highestpaid customers , said marc ganis , a sports consultant now it comes down to the old real estate maxim location , location , location in the jim beam club during the yankeeswhite sox game wednesday night , the privileged packed the tables in the club s indoor restaurant to dine on smoked turkey with apricot and pineapple chutney , and bay scallops with orzo pres harris sat with his two sons in the front row outside , marveling at his good fortune because someone had given him three tickets to the club while he was standing in line at the ballpark to buy reserved seats it s fantastic , he said of the view from the front row , which last year was the domain of reporters becky roppolo , who works for a local steel company , came dressed in a paul konerko replica jersey , and was elated that her boss had given her his tickets for the second time the sweet seat , she said , kind of spoils you joe varan , a real estate investor from hinsdale , ill , was in one of the four frontrow , centeroftheclub seats that he splits with a friend there s nothing like this , said varan , who then compared the club to the scout seats on the field level behind home plate they cost 220 to 285 each you can call the balls and strikes and see the outfield plays develop none of the fans said they much cared that they had displaced reporters who now depend more on tv monitors than they once did it is a sentiment they share with reinsdorf it does n't matter if dave van dyck can see how much the ball breaks , he said , referring to the chicago tribune s national baseball writer van dyck said his former view mattered greatly now he cannot see plays developing or the full scan of the field it s like watching tv from the side , he added , still irate that the team did not consult reporters about the change joe cowley , who covers the white sox for the chicago suntimes , said he did not mind the view , and he was not surprised about the white sox' move they sold out the start time to 7eleven , he said , referring to a sponsorship deal with the chain of convenience stores to shift the starting time of night games to 7 11 in nba arenas , reporters in some cities have been moved out of earshot of the repartee among players , coaches and referees you could tell what jerry sloan was thinking by hearing how much he was swearing , said phil miller , who until recently covered the utah jazz for the salt lake tribune , referring to the team s longtime head coach his reactions really guided your knowledge of what was going on on the floor the denver nuggets , for example , added eight new courtside seats at 750 apiece by moving the press elsewhere at quicken loans arena , the cleveland cavaliers added 16 courtside seats \( at 1 , 600 each \) that flank the scorer s table by moving reporters to comparatively distant locations similar changes have been made by the los angeles clippers at staples center , and by the jazz and the golden state warriors for next season , the los angeles lakers have sold 15 new courtside seats , at 2 , 300 each , at staples center , moving reporters 20 rows back , said john black , a team spokesman paul andrews , executive vice president for kroenke sports enterprises , the nuggets' parent company , said the team tried to balance its goal of raising revenue with respecting the news media , even as it moved reporters to a low corner at the pepsi center some of the nuggets' new courtside seats , which are similar to others in the league , allow fans to sit behind the scorer s table as the press once did , beside the team bench , with a television monitor and waiter service to augment their experience this season the knicks moved the last of the reporters who were still working courtside at madison square garden to a press area behind a basket that let the team sell 20 new seats , some of which cost 2 , 000 or more fans will pay a premium to experience the game in a way they have n't before , and to separate themselves from joe average , said dan migala , the publisher of a sportsmarketing newsletter , the migala report the nba has left it to the teams to determine whether they would move reporters and where they would put them , while keeping tv broadcasters at scorer s tables brian mcintyre , a league spokesman , said the change was not made because of the weakening influence of newspapers it was strictly a way to get revenue , he said , and some people closer to the game but in doing so , said brian windhorst , who covers the cavaliers for the akron beacon journal , the presence of nearby reporters working on deadline has upset a lot of fans , and there 've been some , and caused some nasty incidents he added , we 're trying to do our job , and they 're trying to have fun at us cellular field , the relocated press box prompted a demand by the baseball writers' association of america to meet with commissioner bud selig to receive assurances that a similarly drastic change would not occur at other ballparks \( the kansas city royals are moving their press box up a level , but still behind home plate , next season \) we 're paid to do the job to the best of our ability , mark gonzales of the chicago tribune said as he watched wednesday s game from high above first base his new sightline hindered his ability to best describe , with his own eyes , mark buehrle s nohitter on april 18 i just feel hopeless , he said photo the chicago white sox are hoping that the prime space behind home plate formerly occupied by the old press box will generate more than 4 million a year as the new jim beam club at us cellular field the new press box now two levels higher and down the first base line the old press box slightly elevated behind home plate , the new jim beam club boasts great views and 200 theater seats and barstools fans are charged 260 to 315 each \( photo by peter wynn thompson for the new york

a quick hike through the sunday \( and a few nonsunday \) book review sections the independent \( uk \) paul rogers is professor of peace at bradford university nice work if you can get it and he was

now comes a response to that book the great big glorious book for girls , by rosemary davidson and sarah vine in the times of london , lynne truss , the author of eats , shoots , and leaves , reviews the book , and describes it as a prescriptive manual indicating how to recreate every facet of a 1950s girlhood , down to picnic tips , clapping games and baffling references to coco the clown \( died 1974 \) truess likes the great big glorious book for girls , but writes this is an incredibly perplexing book masquerading as a simple one here s truss on the earlier eras this book recalls to be honest , being a girl had started to look like bloody hard work girls were apparently expected not only to organise their own parties , but to make up the party bags \( don t go over the top a paper

\) , and devise and produce occasional musical evenings \( at which they would not only perform sonatas , but also bake the refreshments and handprint the programmes \) in short , one started to think of the consumer of the glorious book as a perpetually bustling prepubescent who , if you popped a broom up her bottom , would cheerfully sweep the floor as well  you can tell that the authors are wellmeaning people who yearn for a nicer childhood for our deprived modern youth i still prefer the boys book , though , because i d rather know the rules of poker than how to make a chocolate fridge

of it , now that it s done \? from the point of view of the english canon , it s hardly great literature but if rowling is neither cs lewis nor tolkien , nor philip pullman , hers has been , none the

same book karen abbott s sin in the second city and comes to exactly the same conclusion  the problem with the book is not that it is not a diverting , gregarious and edifying read it decidedly is all

canberra , australia this summer , australia feels like a war zone cities and towns across the country are enveloped in a perpetual smoke haze , and the braying of fire sirens is as commonplace as birdsong every evening television commentators deliver grimfaced reports from the front lines tired farmers look dazedly into the camera firemen with sootsmeared clothes and chilired eyes shake their heads and mumble that they have never known anything like it as with every modern war report , helicopters make a ubiquitous backdrop they dip down in front of shrinking reservoirs , then stagger toward the fire front , their water pouches swaying marsupiallike underneath their bellies why \? why , kamarrang \? asks a tall , slightly stooped aboriginal man from western arnhem land in the far north of australia he is bardayal nadjamerrek , an elder of the mok clan , and he is talking to a grizzled white fellah named peter cook , an ecological scientist they are discussing the disappearance of whole groups of animals from the plateau of mr nadjamerrek s youth he repeats the question , this time looking upward to address the old people his everpresent ancestors with whom he habitually discusses such issues this scene opens a nearly completed film , fire in the land of honey , of which i'm a producer the work of the filmmaker kim mckenzie , it is one of a trilogy of documentaries about mr nadjamerrek and his native land , which his people call ankung djang collectively , the films will tell how some 50 years ago the aboriginal people left this vast plateau , the size of belgium , drawn by the lure of money , tobacco and other novelties offered by distant buffalo camps , mines , stock stations and missions today it is a lost world , emptied of people but filled with rock paintings so intricate , ancient and beautiful they take your breath away he is among the last people to grow up on the plateau , to know its lore and habitat , and to speak its languages he has returned to ankung djang with his wife , kalkiwarra , because he has a task it is to show his own grandchildren , as well as peter cook and other scientists , how his people used to look after the country long ago he is also telling mr mckenzie , the filmmaker , all that he remembers of the history and culture of this ancient place they are recording his knowledge because otherwise ankung djang will cease to have a history mr nadjamerrek is over 80 and his memory is getting shaky names and places are starting to fade like the old trails he traveled as a young man to gather spearmaking materials but his most urgent quest is to find out why his country is out of kilter since his people left half a century ago , fire a staple tool of aboriginal life has turned into an uncontrollable monster , careering across the landscape , devouring the plateau s trees , plants , birds , animals and insects \( including mr nadjamerrek s beloved native bees \) in truth , none of us can really answer his question why \? we do know the controlledfire regimens that aboriginal people practiced for millenniums to nurture the land must be reinstated but , like mr nadjamerrek , we also suspect something larger is going on we fear that australia s soaring heat , vanishing water and rampant fires are connected to larger global patterns of climate change thankfully , we australians at least have bardayal nadjamerrek and the old people to advise us the rest of the globe is not so lucky

no one seems to know two major kentucky derby preps the blue grass at keeneland and the lane s stakes at turfway park were run this year on polytrack , a synthetic racing surface that includes polypropylene fibers , recycled rubber and sand covered in a wax coating there are substantial differences between conventional and synthetic tracks and some horses seem to have a preference for one over the other , while others seem to handle both equally well but most theories concerning polytrack are nothing more than guesses polytrack has not been around long enough for anyone to solve the many handicapping mysteries it presents handicappers are in the same boat as jockeys and trainers , said randy moss , a horseracing analyst for abc and espn nobody knows what to make of polytrack and the results over polytrack typically , a horse that wins the blue grass stakes is considered among the major contenders for the kentucky derby , but some believe that this year s winner , dominican , will flounder on a traditional surface in seven starts , he is 3 for 3 on polytrack but is 0 for 4 on dirt i know these questions come up a lot when people handicap the race , but i do n't think it s a factor , the trainer darrin miller said of dominican s perceived preference for polytrack obviously , the synthetic surface allows a lot of these horses to move up and allows them to spring across the track easier it does enhance his stride , but he has an outstanding stride anyway it has benefited him , but i think all horses benefit on the synthetic surfaces miller believes that extenuating circumstances contributed to dominican s losses on dirt tracks , including the fact that he had an undescended testicle that was causing discomfort that problem was solved in january , when dominican was gelded since then , he has been an improved horse for reasons also relating to polytrack , the blue grass was one of the stranger derby preps ever run horses that run near the front in the early part of races on keeneland s polytrack rarely win as a result , many jockeys restrain their horses in the opening furlongs , which results in a slow pace followed by a mad dash to the wire the blue grass , essentially , turned into a quartermile sprint in which the top four finishers were less than a halflength apart at the wire some handicappers believe it became a meaningless race in terms of evaluating derby contenders miller will also start a longshot named sedgefield in saturday s derby with five starts on the grass and three on polytrack , he has never even run on conventional dirt then there is the lane s end , which was won by hard spun though he has won four times on conventional dirt tracks , the polytrack effort was his best race that , too , might cause some handicappers to discount his lane s end performance the polytrack was n't the reason he ran so well in the lane s end , trainer larry jones said if you look , he s gotten better with every race and that happened to be his last race hard spun backed up jones s prediction that he would like the track at churchill downs when he worked five furlongs in a blazing 5753 seconds on monday polytrack made its north american debut in september 2005 at turfway park the surface appears to have many advantages over conventional dirt because of its waterresistant nature , it is not affected by inclement weather and never becomes muddy it also has resulted in fewer serious injuries , a major plus for a sport in which the horses seem to have become more brittle synthetic surfaces are already in place at keeneland , turfway , hollywood park and woodbine arlington park , which is owned by churchill downs , will open friday with a new polytrack surface and the california horse racing board has mandated that all major tracks in that state convert to a synthetic surface before the end of this year for now , management at churchill downs is taking a waitandsee attitude concerning polytrack we are very interested in monitoring the performance of synthetic surfaces to see how they perform over time , steve sexton , the churchill downs president , said we recently installed a synthetic surface at arlington park in chicago we will be watching how the surface performs over that extended race meet , which runs through midseptember dominican , sedgefield and hard spun are now at churchill , training daily for the most important race of their lives their trainers say their horses are handling the track there just fine but will they do the same saturday \? it s anybody s guess notes xchanger and the merv griffinowned cobalt blue will not run in the kentucky derby , their trainers said tuesday teuflesberg and imawildandcrazy have enough earnings to get into the field , which is limited to 20 starters street sense , the 2yearold champion , worked five furlongs in 1 01 at churchill downs
my recent columns on misspellings , iran coverage and the potential damage to reputation caused by search engine optimization sparked many thoughtful and interesting reactions from readers , only a fraction of which can make it into the print edition here is a much larger collection , including the full text of a letter by michael gordon , the times military correspondent , in response to my aug 19 column , when the issue is war , take nothing for granted re when bad news follows you \( aug 26 \) i m an old former newspaper editor myself i was at the new york herald tribune for that paper s final nine years of life , and was its last editorial page editor your column got me thinking about our morgue my recollection is that those who maintained it called it the library and were called librarians it was a single room of modest size , with drawers of paper clippings , very precisely clipped , dated , sorted and so on some were new , some were old , but i rather doubt that any dated back to the paper s founding \( by horace greeley \) in 1841 if everything that had ever appeared in the trib were there , i m sure that the one room would have had to be a lot larger and sorting through the clips by hand might also have been somewhat more challenging of course , all that was before the age of computers \( the trib s last issue was april 24 , 1966 \) we wrote on manual typewriters \( remember those \? \) , and our type was set in hot lead by linotype machines \( and because the unions wouldn t let us get the more modern equipment we needed , we even still had some of the original mergenthaler machines \) and therefore , it was also before the age of online searches , and of the expectations those searches aroused i don t think it would ever have occurred to any of us that if the trib s report of an event wasn t among those clips in the morgue , the event hadn t taken place or even that it might have taken place , but wasn t of great importance it just wasn t in our clipping file it would seem to me that if the times is determined to elbow its way to the head of the searchengine line in order to increase its online ad revenues , it at least ought to do the users of those search engines the elementary favor of removing those items it has determined to be false and defamatory oh , and by the way , this would also be a better way to treat those who had been defamed this may shock some times editors , but the history that matters is not the history of the times , or as reported by the times , but the true history and that , after all , is what most users of search engines are searching for i see no reason why such items couldn t be simply cut from the publicly available database and pasted into a separate , private database , where they would still be available in case of any legitimate need , preferably twinned with the corrections and those selfstyled ethicists who fret that this would somehow shock the muse of history should calm down removing an item from the times s publicly available electronic archive does not remove it from history there is , after all , a big world out there even beyond , i was going to say , 43rd street , but now even the times itself has moved times do change ray price new york , aug 26 , 2007  there s a simple solution to incorrect articles in archives online write the correction \( if one was published \) at the top of the article in italics or bold maybe something like topics of the times jan 13 , 1920 a correction on jan 13 , 1920 , topics of the times , an editorial page feature of the new york times , dismissed the notion that a rocket could function in vacuum and commented on the ideas of robert h goddard , the rocket pioneer , as follows that professor goddard , with his chair in clark college and the countenancing of the smithsonian institution , does not know the relation of action to reaction , and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react to say that would be absurd of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of isaac newton in the 17th century , and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere the times regrets the error then include the original article karthik balakrishnan rockville , md , aug 26 , 2007  i was surprised that the only question you engaged was whether or not newspapers ought to fiddle with their archives editors are forcing the victims of the times s inaccuracies to prove the errors but meanwhile , the newspaper , in its desire for eyeballs \( and ad revenue \) , is using a business strategy that pushes its content to the top of internet searches regardless of its importance or accuracy why aren t you questioning the business strategy itself \? why doesn t the times stick to the business strategy of producing a reliable , relevant source of news and analysis instead of trying to hijack peoples google searches \? rosemary graham berkeley , calif , aug 27 , 2007  the problem with the search engine optimization you refer to is that by inference , the times is suggesting that the information it publishes is the definitive information of record about an individual or an event but when the times published the original article , it was never meant to be that rather , it was simply a report written in contemporary terms the times has never represented itself as an encyclopedia , but through this optimization initiative , that s what it is now suggesting to web surfers with that comes an expectation that the published information is accurate if the times can t meet that responsibility , it shouldn t play around with search engine optimization chris gidez new york , aug 28 , 2007  if an article s accuracy or factual basis has been reliably queried or superseded , surely the times has an ethical obligation to announce this fact prominently in the article itself \( preferably at the beginning of the article \) and to link to the relevant follow up , explanation , discussion , correction and so on within the article itself this should be a trivial matter with today s technology , and given that the times potentially makes money from serving up inaccurate or damaging articles , it seems the very least the times could do hamish reid oakland , calif , aug 26 , 2007  when someone feels that something in the times s internet historical record is harmful or simply wrong , permit that person to write a correction , with appropriate brief documentation , and post that as the first thing to appear each such correction would have an editorial note explaining the times s policy relating to such placements fred e hahn golden valley , minn , aug 26 , 2007  more and more webbased information sources are accepting user commentary that does not alter the original article , but which is crossindexed to it in such a way that accessing the article also comes with a pointer to the commentary a newspaper like the times that is concerned about the historical record should add this capability to its archives an editor could , in certain cases , weigh in as to the support or lack of support for the comments and the original article , all as part of the commentary thread comments violating standards of decency or intelligibility could be edited or deleted one can see this process very clearly in the wikipedia project although it is unlikely that old articles buried in the times archives are likely to excite quite as much controversy as is sometimes seen in wikipedia , perhaps there are one or two cases where they might adding user comments would also increase the traffic \( and disk usage \) of the times archives , i ll bet , although i don t know whether this would be good or bad greg shenaut davis , calif , aug 26 , 2007  there are simple solutions that would preserve journalistic integrity in the online archives append the followup stories and retractions that the times prints or the factual corrections it verifies to the original article when necessary , append a note from the times saying that the paper prints as news accusations , arrests , statements and so on that may later prove to be false , incorrect , misleading or inflammatory then append the verified evidence or follow up provided by the aggrieved party it is moderated wikipediazing \( a new word for william safire \) of the morgue barry gloger forest hills , queens , aug 27 , 2007  as a librarian , i agree with craig whitney , the times s standards editor , as far as trotskyite airbrushing goes the historical record , the archives of the times and any other credible , or not so credible , newspaper should never be screened , tweaked , censored , culled or altered in any way greg brock , the times s senior editor , and mr whitney can continue the established procedure for corrections online as it has always been done in print the historical archives the first draft of history should be preserved in this era of multigigabyte drives , there should no longer be any reason for any paper to have culled its clipping files of old items that no longer seemed useful archives attempt to be the accurate and complete memory of a civilization imperfect as it may also have been at the time , i say the times s archive stands the historians and subsequent journalists are the ones to kick it around and get to any missed truth in their followup books and articles deborah clark cunningham greenlawn , ny , aug 26 , 2007  how about this \? if people named in an article that is more than five years old believe the article is inaccurate or incomplete , give them the option of asking that a notation be included with the electronic version of the article stating , one of the individuals named in this article disputes some of its content then include a link to their blogs or web sites , where they can explain their concern the times would have the option to refuse to do this if the editors believe the notation is not warranted disputes about articles less than five years old should continue to be handled as they are now the times could identify issues where a reporter should do a follow up craig kenworthy bozeman , mont , aug 27 , 2007  not too long ago i heard a mistake made in a report on npr s morning edition and emailed the program about it i got a nice reply from someone there who said he could find no record of the error after a further email in which i told him i was sure i heard what i heard , he revealed the fact that they correct the record that is , expunge it that s wrong if a million people hear something and act on what they heard , it is simply wrong to expunge from the record what it was that they heard same with the times you print it it stays a person s reputation is made or wrecked whether the report that caused the change in reputation is incorrect is no longer relevant , as the inaccuracy is as much a part of the historical record as the truth would be peter meyer hudson , ny , aug 28 , 2007  there is a solution that will go a long way toward resolving the issues you raised provide a set of url links with each retrieved article to other articles in the times that deal with the same issue this is now done in many online scientific journals as citation indexing , and is even used by tenure committees to assess the impact of publications in the cases cited in your column , this would help rectify the onesided first article it would also allow linking to any corrections that may have been published by the times about factual errors dan prober new haven , aug 28 , 2007  a relatively simply solution would be to add to the top of any article \( not the bottom , as is the practice \) any corrections that were ever printed about that article that way the clarification would be there for all to see it should contain the link , the date corrected and so on andrew ludasi east windsor , nj , aug 26 , 2007  during the watergate era , when every reporter was searching for dirt on richard m nixon , an article appeared in major papers that one of his daughters was suspected of participating in a fraud it seemed ludicrous on its face , and of course nothing came of it if there ever was a retraction printed , i knew it would be buried near the end of the paper today , i am truly amazed at the size of the times s corrections section on page 2 can the paper s reporters and editors really get that much wrong each day \? having an upfront correction is nice , but who reads it \? the problem you discussed is one that simply should not exist today every time the paper prints a correction \( or discovers that a browser has highlighted a misleading article \) , that correction should be prepended to the archived copy of the original article , so they both travel together , always and forever don t change the original , just make sure the reader knows up front that it was faulty monnie anderson austin , tex , aug 26 , 2007  the way newspapers are slipping out of the pubic consciousness , the loss of a few erroneous file items , which should be corrected immediately , presents very little risk the solution is , as for any other business that damages someone if you cause harm , when you could have corrected or mitigated that harm , you become liable for damages the article error and fabrication rate is skyrocketing , even at the times that s one of the reasons the older legacy media have pretty much lost public confidence if a paper affirmatively decides to not correct the record , it should be held responsible jim lukaszewski danbury , conn , aug 26 , 2007  isn t the fix selfevident \? and simple \? append updates to old stories that need fixing , as is the common practice on blogs steven e macintyre beaver dam , ariz , aug 27 , 2007  with today s form of instant communication , it is easier than ever to keep readers aware of changes to a story without altering the original in case of error or confusion , place a corrections and clarification box beneath the headline , linking out to any appropriate details as required for subsequent developments that pertain to the story , have a followup box the story of record remains intact , but readers can easily find the appropriate corrections and additional information isaac lin ottawa , ontario , aug 27 , 2007  i do not understand how the suggestion by prof viktor mayersch nberger , of harvard s john f kennedy school of government , to bury mistakes in a hierarchy devised by the very same creators of the inaccuracies satisfies any sort of ethical journalistic obligation newspapers should report on history , not create a collective sense of it if the times finds a verifiable error in the archives , or if one is brought to your or the paper s attention , an addendum that updates the information should be appended to the article practical constraints limit the ability to research the accuracy of every complaint i would suggest establishing rigorous criteria that would include submission of supporting resources for consideration of the correction and , in those cases where verification proves to be too difficult or time consuming , a statement to that effect the words the times prints should neither disappear nor change , but i see no harm in adding to them perhaps adapting some of the wikipedia concept of democratic fact finding will spare us from stephen colbert s subjective truthiness laurence e schiffman stow , ohio , aug 26 , 2007  when the paper makes a formal correction to a story , an editor should go to the original story in the archives and put an editor s note at the top of the document stating the correct information clearly this new text would show up in the subtext under the headline in the google search the times could do the same thing with old documents as it becomes aware of issues like those you describe this would protect the integrity of the archive , without limiting access the beauty of the process is that the bad news would be linked to those who make the errors , not the people who might suffer the consequences bambi nicklen las vegas , aug 26 , 2007  craig whitney s comparison of removing erroneous stories from the times online archives to airbrushing trotsky out of the kremlin picture is an erroneous analogy unlike the errors in times reporting that you cite , trotsky was actually at the kremlin incomplete or inaccurate stories should not be removed or altered from the archives but if the times really does care about accuracy in reporting and serving the historical record , those stories need to be amended with a brief note explaining errors , omissions and later developments the print version of the times does this every day on page 2 charles taylor brooklyn , aug 26 , 2007  if the times prints a follow up or retraction , at the top of the online news article put in a line that says there was a follow up or correction or retraction to this news story that was subsequently published click here for the details oh , i ve had several dozen letters published in the times , but when you google me my web site comes up first , along with several other sites and the times is farther down if allen kraus s web site isn t coming up first when he s googled , he really needs to fire his web master shaun eli breidbart pelham , ny , aug 26 , 2007  you address a real problem , but discuss some terrible solutions if the times is to continue as the news source of record , it cannot forget its archives rather than make them less accessible , it needs to make them more accessible a simple solution exists for the problem of stale news simply put a hyperlink in the old article to the new one that should be part of every followup article anyway if the change is significant , the link should be in a prominent location at the head of the old article if it is merely a follow up , it might be put at the end in order to maintain a clear history of the article , any such changes or additions should carry date information with it ideally , it should be possible to retrieve an article in the form it had at any date in the past commonly available wiki software has these features if the times intends to be a player in the internet news arena it will have to start thinking nonlinearly kenneth lerman newtown , conn , aug 27 , 2007  i appreciate your concern about the wellbeing of people who are being damaged by inaccurate and outdated information from the new york times health care professionals face a similar issue when there is inaccurate information in a patient s chart the chart should not be changed , as it is a contemporaneous historical document as in all human endeavors , however , inaccuracies do creep in in health care , we put an addendum on the original note the addendum leaves the original unchanged , but is linked to the original and clarifies the accuracy in such a way that anyone reviewing the chart will be able to see and correct the error in her own mind similarly , the times could put an addendum on these old articles if factual errors are present , these could be corrected in an addendum amended to the bottom of the original article on the web \( and perhaps also noted at the top of the page , so it is not missed \) if later information came to light in another later article that contradicted the original reporting , a small note could be added to the original article noting this , along with a link to the more updated information if the times reported something that inaccurately damaged a person s reputation , and never did correct it in the paper , i believe that an addendum to the original article should be available on the times web site jan willer chicago , ill , aug 26 , 2007  what s your own conclusion about this question \? it s not clear from your column \( at least to me \) are published corrections \( and , ideally , corrective articles , as in the kraus case \) appended to stories as they re called up through google \? if they were , wouldn t that solve a lot of this \? dick tofel riverdale , ny , aug 26 , 2007   re when the issue is war , take nothing for granted \( aug 19 \) in an aug 19 commentary , clark hoyt discussed an article i wrote from iraq on a type of weapon known as an explosively formed penetrator my aug 8 article disclosed that attacks with this type of roadside bomb in iraq reached an all time high in july this was an important news development for several reasons first , efp strikes accounted for a third of the americanled coalition troops who were killed in action in july those casualty statistics were included in the story second , the july figures were not a onemonth statistical blip but the culmination of a disturbing trend the article noted that efp attacks in july were 50 percent higher than the number of strikes in april and roughly double the number in january in contrast , when i previously reported on this issue in march , american military officials expressed the hope that efp attacks were on the decline third , efp attacks are a concrete indicator of shiite militia activity as the weapon has been used almost exclusively by shiite militant groups , a point i made in the article fourth , the attacks are a measure of iranian support for shiite militant groups as american intelligence reports indicate that key efp components have been supplied by iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force scott shane and i prepared a detailed 2 , 644 word article outlining the intelligence on the quds force role , which was published on march 27 the evidence and critics concerns in that article were accurately summarized in my 904 word aug 8 news report mr hoyt believes that the first and second points were not sufficient reason to have played the story on page 1 i disagree the article underscored the military significance of the weapon and the substantial number of american casualties efp s have unfortunately caused is an important and newsworthy development space limitations preclude me from addressing other points in mr hoyt s column it is worth noting , however , that the fact that shiite militants account for a preponderance of the attacks against american forces in baghdad , which i reported in the article , does not mean that al qaeda in mesopotamia has not played an important role in stoking sectarian violence by conducting car bomb and suicide attacks in the iraqi capital and other parts of iraq a main reason the american military has focused on al qaeda militants is because of its population security mission michael r gordon military correspondent the new york times washington , aug 29 , 2007  with due respect to bill keller and michael gordon and the times editorial staff , i cannot accept what i consider to be the vacillation by the times as far as the situation in iran is concerned yes , the iranian government is building to a nuclear arms capacity , and it is undoubtedly supplying shiite militias in iraq with explosively formed penetrators , or efp s , as a proving ground for the efficacy of the efps in combat the question remains why \? on the one hand you have a totalitarian regime in iran using the american presence in iraq as an excuse to arm itself for possible selfish future expansionist activities against its neighbors this is a problem for the united nations and iran s neighbors on the other hand you have president bush , vice president dick cheney and the neocons aching for an excuse to attack iran if this is the case , does iran or any small nation have the right to build weapons to defend itself against an attack by a superpower \? which country is the biggest threat to the world s survival , the united states or iran \? please address that question russell ayers los altos , calif , aug 20 , 2007  i m a supporter , for the most part , of president bush s policies concerning afghanistan and iraq and a longtime daily reader of the times and a number of other newspapers your column confirms once again about the eye of the beholder i recall that as i got further into the article to which you refer , i thought to myself , this is pretty good for the times , but wondered when the but , there are those who question was going to come sure enough , it came with the some critics accuse wording you mention to me , that wording was fair and sufficient , but to those who emailed you complaining about the article , it wasn t after faulting michael gordon s approach in his article , how can you say you would have started his article by saying flat out that the efp s were supplied by iran i realize you can say you would later get into the some critics part of the story , but i doubt seriously you ve made the original complainers feel better robert ferrara sea girt , nj , aug 20 , 2007  contrary to what you assume , most readers , and definitely this one , have a good memory none of the stories written in the times investigated properly , even less demonstrated , the veracity of the assertion that the efp s are produced in iran the times writers keep repeating uncritically what they have been fed by the military and by the administration , as they did before the war and you , who should be their critic , go out of the way trying to absolve them paolo secondo new york , aug 19 , 2007  with stories like the aug 8 frontpage article , the times maddeningly continues to play patsy for the administration if the editors believed the point of the article was the increased role of shiites in attacks on american troops , why did they give it the administration s talkingpoint headline us says iransupplied bomb is killing more troops in iraq \? really , they need to ask themselves this question jim liljenwall santa fe , nm , aug 19 , 2007  it is na ve of the reporter michael gordon , and suspiciously puzzling of bill keller , the executive editor , to believe that pointing fingers at iran would be perceived as anything other than lockstep administration propaganda of course iran is supplying technology to iraqi insurgents everyone with an ounce of sense knows that the question is not whether they are doing it but how to convince them to stop , short of another military intervention executed by an already demoralized fighting force , representing a woefully underinvested nation and facing a mission that cannot be achieved militarily iran is not the problem , just one part of a puzzle with some pieces forever lost , through our own incompetence , and others yet to be uncovered lori miller germantown , tenn , aug 20 , 2007   re so many names , so many corrections \( aug 12 \) the new york times must approach the problem of misspelled names as a quality control problem as such , it requires a systems approach that will prevent a recognized name being misspelled multiple times neither a name like madeleine albright or alberto gonzales would encounter the fate you cite if the times used a version of microsoft word s autocorrect option it could program the feature to put in the correct spelling with a short code , for example , alb for alberto gonzales or gon for just gonzales a list could be distributed to reporters and editors of the codes used abe guler glendale , calif , aug 12 , 2007  your concern with spelling details is worthy your proposed solution is not punishment is far more likely to create resentment than encourage diligence a far better approach would be sound teaching the times should instruct its writers and editors in good habits of detail checking and quality assurance there are plenty of ways to go about this , using both technology and common sense when i m editing my web log , i refer to a continually updated list that i keep that features common titles , names and places that i ve seen misspelled on the web or by one of my writers another approach that works well is humor some spelling errors are very funny a writer once sent me an article on the iraq war and religious fundamentalism titled you reap what you sew i asked him if he was reifying the tapestry of lies or simply misspelling sow he was quick enough to offer the defense that he didn t want to seem to be calling the bush war planners pigs we had a good laugh over it , and i d be amazed if i ever see that same error from him again brian donohue new york , aug 12 , 2007  do reporters ever run their articles through a spell checker , or would they consider such a thing an insult to their professionalism \? and could not the new york times use a spell checker for names \? yes , it would be a large database of people s names \( famous names , obscure names , names of the dead in their obituaries , and so on \) , but once writers and editors had it , they d wonder how they ever did without it frank desmond london , aug 12 , 2007  as a copy boy at the washington bureau of the times in the late 1960s and early 70s , i remember the lengths editors and reporters would go to in order to make sure a name or middle initial was correct back in those preinternet \( make that precomputer ! \) days , the easiest way to check a name or minor fact was to order a copy boy to make a call , go to the library or whatever i ve been a writer ever since , and i ve tried diligently never to misspell anyone s name , especially given that my own is almost always rendered without the c , or worse once , i was asked to contribute a memo that would feed into a national story about the sudden emergence of black characters in comic strips i was told to call ben bradlee at the washington post for a comment i did , and i wrote the memo , spelling his name bradley throughout that , i trust , is the last time i jumped to a conclusion about how a name must be spelled properly chastised by the desk , i learned a lesson for life scott brinckerhoff haddam , conn , aug 13 , 2007  i was shocked when i read the corrections recently on the times s corrections page about all the misspelled names of famous people , and i m glad you wrote a column about it i am a reporter where i live , i know many portuguese or hispanic names like gonzales may end in z or s , so i am careful about that it seems very basic it is just laziness to not look them up or ask when you are interviewing people if they are misspelled in the times s archives , they may come up misspelled when the writer does a search i was also surprised recently when i saw the word supercede in a column on the oped page it should be supersede that seems so basic to me i know that i make mistakes , too , but i expect newspapers to have editors who spot those things it makes me wonder if schools are dropping the ball somewhere along the line , and parents , too peggy aulisio south dartmouth , mass , aug 12 , 2007  i appreciated your observations about the misspelling of names and what could be done about it do you suppose some attention could also be paid to bad syntax and usage , not to mention typos and word omissions \? at least when a famous name is misspelled , the reader usually has some idea of who is being referred to but when a sentence is in the wrong tense , or a noun or verb is inappropriately plural or singular , sometimes the meaning is pretty much lost , or even subverted you probably don t need specific examples i m sure there are plenty of loyal readers who obsess about the problem and routinely report their observations it s just a bit demoralizing that every sunday our west coast edition of the best newspaper in the world usually contains at least a dozen or so instances this is probably something that humans can still actually do better than computers perhaps the times should just bite the bullet and finally admit it needs a staff member who actually reads the paper before it s sent

to the editor lifesaving opportunities missed , before and after stroke \( front page , may 28 \) discusses a number of reasons that stroke patients may not receive tpa as treatment in the emergency department but there is another reason the significant controversy in the field of emergency medicine about the use of tissue plasminogen activator , or tpa while the benefits of tpa in treating heart attacks have been definitively established , the benefits are not as clearcut for stroke the studies that established the use of tpa in stroke were less than gold standard studies in fact , the efficacy in stroke was determined only through datamining , as the authors went back in after their original study was completed to salvage some useful information the study , as originally designed , did n't establish any benefit from the use to tpa the authors then came up with a threehour window of treatment , which provides some benefit for some patients but poses significant risks for others for this emergency doctor , and for many of my colleagues , the use of tpa to treat stroke is a choice that is reluctantly , if ever , made , and none of the major emergency medicine associations in north america have endorsed it as standard of care arman afagh , md riverside , calif , may 30 , 2007 to the editor your article about stroke treatment highlights an important opportunity for the medical community to close the gap between what should happen and what does happen for patients , families and society at large , the opportunity is captured in two words blood pressure aggressive , sustained treatment of high blood pressure is the best thing patients and their doctors can do to prevent stroke and its complications it would have more bang for the buck at the societal level than any other intervention lewis g sandy , md senior vice president clinical advancement unitedhealth group minnetonka , minn , may 29 , 2007 to the editor lifesaving opportunities missed , before and after stroke says that tpa could help half of all stroke patients , but that only 3 percent to 4 percent receive it this is true despite advances in imaging and treatment delivery the statistic remains a source of frustration for the medical community and should be a point of concern for all of us the first part of the solution lies in federal research money though stroke ranks first in causing disability and third in causing death , it ranks 71st out of 215 disease categories for national institutes of health financing also , because of misinterpreted symptoms and denial , patients commonly arrive at the emergency room after the threehour window when tpa works stroke education is imperative for patients , family members and the community that each hospital serves such efforts are under way at columbia university and other academic institutions without engagement of the public , the promise of better treatment may be deliverable to only a small percentage of those who need it randolph marshall , md acting director , stroke division columbia university medical center new york , may 29 , 2007 to the editor as a vascular neurologist and chairman of the stroke council of the american heart association , i am aware of the significant gaps in stroke treatment because time lost is brain lost , systems need to be put in place to assure that all patients get appropriate treatment as quickly as possible the federal stroke treatment and ongoing prevention act , which has been passed by the house and is pending in the senate , would help achieve this goal it calls for educating the public about stroke symptoms and supports coordinated , statewide stroke care systems this bill would help the medical community provide the best available care larry b goldstein , md director , duke stroke center durham , nc , may 30 , 2007 to the editor i am an emergency room doctor , and almost every stroke patient i see has a preexisting condition like high blood pressure , diabetes , tobacco abuse and high cholesterol that has n't been properly addressed while tpa clotbusting treatment and mri scans are valuable , the emphasis always seems to be on the new and hightech that s where the money is , not only for doctors , but also for hospitals and makers of drugs and medical equipment spending 30 minutes with a patient to work on reducing risk factors is not rewarded , recognized or reimbursed our payment system perversely discourages prevention treating strokes with modern technology and medicines is important , but the real payoff is in fully supporting prevention we now spend too much too late with too little to show for it dan morhaim , md owings mills , md , may 28 , 2007 to the editor the reason hospitals do not consider strokes to be moneymakers is that the real cost comes not in the catastrophic event but in the hours of physical therapy required later insurers pay for a limited number of these visits because of the conventional medical view that after a year , stroke victims rarely achieve more gains yet neurologists and neurophysiologists have recently discovered that stroke patients can continue to make significant recovery even several years after an incident my wife suffered a severe stroke at 53 , almost four years ago , and she is still gaining movement on her left side the medical treatment community is lagging behind

it is almost certainly true that no person , regardless of religious commitment , has ever taken to the freeways with a bumper sticker that reads , who took christ out of the christmas special \? episodic television has always celebrated christmas the way secular humanists and the neglectfully faithful have with overcooked turkey , undercooked turkey , too much bourbon , not enough bourbon ,

young lust as a fair or even righteous contest you see the torment of lyla s resistance to tim in the exasperated looks that mask the anguish she seems to feel whenever he comes around one kind of

washington , feb 5 proposed a detailed plan on monday to provide health care coverage to the 47 million americans who now go without , becoming the first major presidential candidate to do so mr edwards s plan is ambitious and expensive , adding as much as 120 billion a year to the nation s health care bill money for the proposal would come from increased taxes on welltodo families , from new fees to be paid by companies that refuse to provide health insurance for their workers and through steps to streamline the delivery of health services mr edwards , a former senator from north carolina , was the democrats' vicepresidential nominee in 2004 the edwards plan is a pastiche of ideas that have been introduced at the state and federal levels , including some that have been derailed by opposition from business groups , doctors and health insurers mr edwards , in an interview on monday , described the american health care delivery system as dysfunctional and said that incremental steps would not cure it this proposal embraces the concept of shared responsibility to provide universal health care , he said the plan would be partly financed by eliminating tax cuts for households earning more than 200 , 000 a year , cuts that congress approved in the bush administration mr edwards said he would also offset the program s cost by using the estimated 15 billion in capital gains taxes that go uncollected each year by requiring brokerage houses to report capital gains from taxpayers' stock sales to the internal revenue service , just as interest and dividend income is reported now mr edwards also said that billions of dollars could be saved by making the health system more efficient and investing more in preventive care the edwards plan would provide tax credits or subsidies to lowincome families who cannot afford health insurance , expand medicare and the federal program of health care for children , and create a federal health insurance agency that could become the basis for a singlepayer system that would eventually do away with private health insurance drew altman , president of the kaiser family foundation , which studies the american health care system , praised mr edwards , saying he was the first candidate in the 2008 presidential race to offer a credible and comprehensive plan to cover the uninsured but mr altman also said the plan faced high practical and political hurdles this is a plan that borrows from different approaches in an attempt to cut through the paralysis in washington between left and right for many years , he said none of these plans are easy or without issues that others can attack you on senators hillary rodham clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois , mr edwards s two most prominent rivals for the democratic presidential nomination , have not yet released detailed health care plans and declined to comment on the edwards proposal one provision of the edwards proposal certain to draw fire is a requirement that companies provide health insurance for all workers or pay 6 percent of their payrolls into a government fund to buy insurance for them this type of play or pay program was an element of former president bill clinton s failed 1994 health care plan that was shaped in large part by mrs clinton gov arnold schwarzenegger included a similar mandate for employers in his universal health care proposal for california residents the plan by mr schwarzenegger , a republican , calls for employers who do not provide health coverage to pay 4 percent of their payrolls into a government health insurance fund the national federation of independent business , a powerful lobby that represents smallbusiness owners , said such mandates amounted to a jobkilling tax on small companies health care mandates are a nonstarter for our members , said stephanie cathcart , a spokeswoman for the federation mr edwards also proposed creation of regional health insurance markets , to use the purchasing power of millions of consumers to drive down health insurance premiums the concept is similar to that in mrs clinton s 1994 plan to create health insurance purchasing alliances mr edwards s proposal would also strengthen the food and drug administration s ability to monitor new drugs after they reach the market , a provision generally welcomed by experts but it also includes restrictions on drug companies' advertising directly to consumers , which is vigorously opposed by the pharmaceutical industry
none of them wear a headset or pore over game film their defensive schemes are better suited for an abacus than a computer las vegas oddsmakers , however , have done something that none of the nfl s brightest offensive and defensive coordinators have done this season beat the  while the patriots are 140 , they are a mere mortal 104 against the point spread and , believe it or not , are in a slump new england has failed to cover the spread in four of their last six games of course , oddsmakers have had to put up points a lot of them to slow down , and the universe of gamblers who have made perhaps tens of millions of dollars betting on the patriots to cover the spread this sunday , new england is a 21 point favorite to defeat visiting miami \( 113 \) , which won its first game last week if the weather is good 40 degrees , 510 mph winds then new england could easily win by 30 points , said mike seba , a senior oddsmaker for las vegas sports consultants , which sets the line for 90 percent of nevada s sports books but you have to be defensive with the season these guys are having the patriots have not only run away from most of their opponents , winning by an average margin of 207 points , but they have also rolled over oddsmakers who are often the difference on whether a casino sports book makes a profit the possibility of the patriots' becoming the nfl s second unbeaten champion has captured the nation s fascination at the same time , they seem to have rewritten the rule book when it comes to sports gambling not only are the patriots close to setting several nfl records , including most points and touchdowns , but their march to perfection has also set bankbreaking numbers that have astounded the sportsgambling culture we try to come up with a line that at least gives the perception that either team has an equal chance to cover , and for his backer to win , said jeff sherman , assistant race and sports book manager at the las vegas hilton we just want to split the action it sounds like it s pretty simple but this year with the patriots , things are way out of whack when new england blasted off to a 91 start against the point spread , the oddsmakers finally realized they had to get aggressive and install an eyepopping number last month , against the eagles , the patriots were 25point favorites , the biggest spread since 1976 , when pittsburgh was a 24point favorite over the expansion tampa bay buccaneers , according to seba while the steelers prevailed over the bucs , 420 , the patriots struggled to hold off the eagles , 3128 we knew there was a number that would catch up with them , and we needed to find it , robert walker , the director of the sports book at mgm mirage , said we had people coming in here early in the season and betting new england blindly , and we do n't like that they have really come down to earth since then the patriots failed to cover the spread twice since that eagles game against the ravens and the jets they could n't keep playing at that pace , seba said they needed to take a breather , and then you add the cold , bitter weather of the northeast and swirling winds now , these guys just want to win and go home still , the oddsmakers expect much more from a new england team that is trying to eclipse the unbeaten record set by the miami dolphins in 1972 , when they finished the season 170 and won the super bowl the oddsmakers attribute new england s dominance on the field and in the sports books to the team s passion for playing hard for four quarters this season , new england has outscored its opponents by 13772 in the fourth there s been teams before like the 1985 bears and the old san francisco teams that were just as dominant , seba said but when they got to the fourth quarter , they played far more conservative but bill belichick makes sure they run the offense and look to score throughout the end of the game so what does the betting public think the chances are that new england will march to its fourth super bowl championship \? you 'd have to go back to michael jordan s chicago bulls teams to find such a prohibitive and deserving favorite , sherman said before the season started , the patriots' odds to win the super bowl at the mgm mirage were 81 now , they are 1 to 8 , which means you would have to bet 8 to make 1 the guys who make the lines , and have actually beaten new england , agree with the betting public they even believe the patriots can go 190 there s no doubt the patriots have gotten the better of me and guys like me and that money s long gone , walker said i think the enthusiasm for betting on them among the public is less than it was in the beginning of the season , but it has been replaced by the fact that people here are rooting for what possibly can be one of the nfl s alltime great teams let s see if they are
mitt romney may be having a rough couple of weeks , but today he received a good piece of news , in the form of an endorsement from the national review , which has these words for him romney is a fullspectrum conservative a supporter of freemarket economics and limited government , moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage , and a foreign policy based on the national interest while he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization none of the major candidates has he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty the endorsement also has warnings about the giuliani and huckabee candidacies rudolph giuliani did extraordinary work as mayor of new york and was inspirational on 9 11 but he and mike huckabee would pull apart the coalition from opposite ends giuliani alienating the social conservatives , and huckabee the economic \( and foreignpolicy \) conservatives a republican party that abandoned either limited government or moral standards would be much diminished in the service it could give the country

larchmont , ny michael w burten , a 24yearold former marine , is sipping a glass of crisp white wine at an outdoor cafe here , trying to explain how strange and wonderful it is to be home from the war in iraq there is this the profoundly relaxing luxury of a fine meal in a safe place , where a spring breeze occasionally rustles the white tablecloth after four years in the military , and two tours in iraq during which he received two purple hearts , mr burten is back home with his mother and friends in larchmont , a prosperous westchester county village on long island sound with impossibly lush lawns and charming shops but there are also the dissonances that arise from the uneasy transition between war and peace the united states military refers to the move from combat to civilian life as readjustment by every outward measure , mr burten s readjustment seems to be going fine he recently learned that he had been accepted by columbia university s school of general studies for the fall he is reconnecting with old friends apart from some hearing loss , he is healthy and intact in a number of subtle ways , however , life is not at all the same his heart starts to thump when he spies a mound of recycling left by a curb , which , for an instant , he mistakes for an ied , or improvised explosive device there is the awkwardness at bars and parties when acquaintances dance around his war experience , avoiding the topic as if he had cancer mostly , there is the painful disconnect between the very real war in which he fought and the one americans read about or glimpse while channel surfing for the record , mr burten , who said he decided to join the marines after 9 11 in a fit of idealism , said he opposed the war almost from the beginning , believing it was misrepresented and mishandled nonetheless , he feels a profound bond with the marine corps and finds himself wishing that the american public displayed more support for the military as an example , he recalls a typical phone conversation with a friend in which mr burten mentions that he heard on the news that a dozen soldiers were killed in iraq that day they 'll say , 'oh , man , that sucks , ' he said and then , 'what are we going to do later \? ' it hurts a little bit it makes me think back to my 14 months in iraq , getting shot at or blown up how many times were people in the states thinking about me \? he added there s no sacrifice being demanded of the american people mr burten tall , fine featured and easygoing was the first member of his family to have served the son of psychiatrists , he grew up in a capacious colonial a short walk from the sound he had never given any thought to the military at mamaroneck high school , mr burten was , in his words , pretty below the radar he did not go out for sports or join clubs but he played guitar in a funk band and wrote for the school s poetry magazine and he earned good enough grades to get into skidmore college in upstate new york soon he was adrift he left skidmore after only one semester , the result of too much partying and a lack of academic focus less than a year later , while taking classes at westchester community college , sept 11 happened less than a year after that , his father died of a heart attack i was very much just looking for something , anything , he said of his decision to join the marines it was partly to avenge 9 11 i felt a calling , a sense of purpose i think i romanticized the idea , but i had a feeling that if i did n't go and do it , i would regret it in the future another strong influence was the book making the corps , by thomas e ricks \( scribner \) , which mr burten read shortly before enlisting that sealed the deal for me , he said he described the marine corps in contrast to the decadence of my generation his friends and family were incredulous young men from grittier towns and cities in westchester went off to iraq the youth of larchmont went off to college , the culmination of a clearly defined arc marked by karate lessons , sleepaway camps and sat prep courses it was dumbfounding , to say the least , said rob dolan , 25 , a close friend of mr burten s who also grew up in larchmont people from our neighborhood were n't doing that , and we were all giving him a hard time for it but once he actually went , i felt proud of him his mother , dr katharine burten , declined to be interviewed for this article , but relayed a single quote through her son , it is excruciating to a have a family member in iraq mr burten officially joined the marines on march 9 , 2003 , just days before the united states invaded iraq he was n't too worried about having to fight because he assumed the conflict would end as quickly as the first gulf war after surviving boot camp on parris island , sc , he went to camp geiger school of infantry in north carolina he then reported to the second battalion , second marine regiment at camp lejeune , n c in march 2004 , with the war continuing , his battalion was deployed to iraq in late summer , while his platoon was providing security in al anbar province , an explosive device struck his vehicle mr burten , then a lance corporal , was given his first purple heart after suffering a concussion and getting shrapnel in his chin
michael chertoff , president bush s fallback choice for secretary of homeland security after , is best remembered for his tragicomic performance during hurricane katrina he gave his underling , the woeful brownie , a run for the gold it was mr chertoff who announced that the even as the other half of the split screen offered graphic evidence otherwise it was mr chertoff who told npr that he had not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center who do not have food and water , even after his fellow citizens had been inundated with such reports all day long with brownie as the designated fall guy , mr chertoff kept his job since then he has attracted notice only when lavishing pork on while reducing grants to new york city though mr chertoff may be the man standing between us and armageddon , he is seen as a leader of stature only when standing next to his cabinet mate gonzo but even a stopped clock is right twice a day last week , as the bush administration frantically , mr chertoff alone departed from the administration s script to talk about the enemy that actually did attack america on 9 11 , al qaeda , rather than al qaeda in mesopotamia , the jihadcomelately gang instead in this white house , the occasional official who strays off script is in all likelihood inadvertently coughing up the truth mr chertoff was promptly hammered for it his that america might be vulnerable to a terrorist attack this summer was universally ridiculed as a gaffe he then , but as he did so , his dire prognosis was confirmed by an intelligence leak the draft of a new classified threat assessment found that and is stronger than at any time since 2001 its operational base is the same ungoverned pakistan wilderness where we 've repeatedly failed to capture osama bin laden dead or alive for six years so give mr chertoff credit for keeping his eye on the enemy while everyone else in the capital is debating nevertoberealized benchmarks for an iraqi government that exists in name only just as president bush ignored that august 2001 brief so washington , some of its press corps included , is poised to shrug off the august 2007 update al qaeda better positioned to strike the west the capital has been suckerpunched by the administration s latest pr offensive to prop up the fiasco in iraq the white house s game is to create a new fictional story line to keep the war going until president bush can dump it on his successor bizarrely , some of the new scenario echoes the bogus narrative used to sell the war in 2002 an imaginary connection between iraq and the attacks of 9 11 you 'd think the bush administration might think twice before recycling old lies , but things have gotten so bad in the bunker that even karl rove is repeating himself fittingly , one of the first in washington to notice the rollout of the latest propaganda offensive was one of the very few journalists who uncovered the administration s manipulation of wmd intelligence in 2002 this time around , he was ahead of the pack in catching the sudden uptick in references to al qaeda in the 27 in a and an equal decline in references to the sunnishiite sectarian violence at the heart of the iraqi civil war america is powerless to stop even more incriminating was mr landay s discovery that the military was following mr bush s script verbatim there were 33 citations of al qaeda in a single week s worth of military news releases in late june , up from only 9 such mentions in may none of this is accidental the administration knows that its last stated mission for the war an iraq that can govern itself , sustain itself and defend itself is as doomed as the iraqi army that would stand up so we could stand down so now there s a new mission or at least new boilerplate tony snow said last week , because al qaeda continues to be the chief organizer of mayhem within iraq what s more , its members are , in mr bush s words , this is hooey , of course not only did al qaeda in mesopotamia not exist before we invaded iraq in 2003 , but it is n't even the chief organizer of the war s mayhem today this month that this group may be responsible for no more than 15 percent of the attacks in iraq in the washington post on thursday that michael hayden , the cia director , told mr bush last november that al qaeda was only the fifth most pressing threat in iraq , after the insurgency , sectarian strife , criminality and general anarchy so what if the qaeda that s operating with impunity out of pakistan , north africa and other noniraq havens actually is the most pressing threat to america \? this president is never one to let facts get in the way of a political agenda that agenda is to avoid taking responsibility for losing a war , no matter how many more americans are tossed into its carnage from here on in , you can be sure that whomever we 're fighting in iraq on any given day will be no more than one degree of separation from bin laden nor do the latest fictionalizations end there to further prop up the war , mr bush had to find some way to forestall verdicts on the surge , which commanders had predicted he also had to neutralize last week s downbeat on the iraqi government s progress toward its 18 benchmarks the latter task was easy the \( and even then must settle for a cminus average and a couple of incompletes \) deflecting gloom about the surge is trickier it s hard to argue that we 're on our way to securing baghdad , the stated goal , when attacks on our own safe haven , more than doubling from march to may , according to the united nations but you can never underestimate this white house s ingenuity it turns out that the surge , which most americans thought began shortly after the is brandnew ! we 're just at the starting line , tony snow told the network morning news shows last week , as he pounded in the message that mr snow s television hosts were not so rude as to point out that the pentagon had previously and had also said that its should be used as the baseline from which to measure future progress that was then , and this is now the baghdad clock has been reset july is the new february as we slouch toward the sixth anniversary of 9 11 , the war against al qaeda has only just begun swamped with such fiction , washington is unable to cope network newscasts are still failing to distinguish the qaeda mr bush talks about from the 9 11 terrorists the iraq deadenders in congress and the neocon punditocracy have now defined victory down to defeating mr bush s miniqaeda in a single iraqi province , anbar meanwhile , our ally pervez musharraf s shaky regime in pakistan lets al qaeda plot its next mass murder the capital s entire political debate over iraq staythesurge versus precipitous withdrawal is itself pure hot air even though felons and the obese are now being signed up to meet we still ca n't extend the surge when troops for iraq run out unless mr bush extends their tours yet again precipitous withdrawal \( which no withdrawal bill in congress calls for \) is a non sequitur , since rather than have the real debate about how to manage the exit , politically panicked republicans hope to cast symbolic votes that will allow them to tell voters they were for ending the war before they prolonged it that leaves mr chertoff , whose in a quarter of its top leadership positions , as the de facto general in charge of defending us from the enemy he had that gut feeling about , the qaeda in iraq last week we learned from a sting operation conducted by congressional investigators that this enemy needs only a mail boxes etc account , a phone and a fax machine to buy radioactive material from american suppliers and for all washington s hyperventilating about the it s our own government s vacation from reality this summer that should make us very afraid
washington let s say a word about the girls the young women with the musical names kia and epiphanny and matee and essence katie and dee dee and rashidat and myia and brittany and heather the scarlet knights of rutgers university had an improbable season , dropping four of their first seven games , yet ending up in the ncaa women s basketball championship game none of them were seniors five were freshmen in the end , they were stopped only by tennessee s lady vols , who clinched their seventh national championship by ending rutgers' cinderella run last week , 5946 that s the kind of story we love , right \? a bunch of teenagers from newark , cincinnati , brooklyn and , yes , ogden , utah , defying expectations it s what explodes so many march madness office pools but not , apparently , for the girls for all their grit , hard work and courage , the rutgers girls got branded nappyheaded ho s a shockingly concise sexual and racial insult , tossed out in a volley of male camaraderie by a group of amused , middleaged white men the joke as delivered and later recanted by the radio and television personality don imus failed one big test it was not funny the serial apologies of mr imus , who was suspended yesterday by both nbc news and cbs radio for his remarks , have failed another test the sincerity seems forced and suspect because he s done some version of this several times before i know , because he apparently did it to me i was covering the white house for this newspaper in 1993 , when mr imus s producer began calling to invite me on his radio program i did n't return his calls i had my hands plenty full covering bill clinton soon enough , the phone calls stopped then quizzical colleagues began asking me why don imus seemed to have a problem with me i had no idea what they were talking about because i never listened to the program it was not until five years later , when mr imus and i were both working under the nbc news umbrella his show was being simulcast on msnbc i was a capitol hill correspondent for the network that i discovered why people were asking those questions it took larserik nelson , a columnist for the new york daily news , to finally explain what no one else had wanted to repeat is n't the times wonderful , mr nelson quoted mr imus as saying on the radio it lets the cleaning lady cover the white house i was taken aback but not outraged i 'd certainly been called worse and indeed jumped at the chance to use the old insult to explain to my nbc bosses why i did not want to appear on the imus show i have n't talked about this much i'm a big girl i have a platform i have a voice i 've been working in journalism long enough that there is little danger that a radio dj s juvenile slap will define or scar me yesterday , he began telling people he never actually called me a cleaning lady whatever this is not about me it is about the rutgers scarlet knights that game had to be the biggest moment of their lives , and the outcome the biggest disappointment they are not old enough , or established enough , to have built up the sort of carapace many women i know black women in particular develop to guard themselves against casual insult why do my journalistic colleagues appear on mr imus s program \? that s for them to defend , and others to argue about i certainly do n't know any black journalists who will to his credit , mr imus told the rev al sharpton yesterday he realizes that , this time , he went way too far yes , he did every time a young black girl shyly approaches me for an autograph or writes or calls or stops me on the street to ask how she can become a journalist , i feel an enormous responsibility it s more than simply being a role model i know i have to be a voice for them as well so here s what this voice has to say for people who cannot grasp the notion of picking on people their own size this country will only flourish once we consistently learn to applaud and encourage the young people who have to work harder just to achieve balance on the unequal playing field let s see if we can manage to build them up and reward them , rather than opting for the cheapest , easiest , most despicable shots
paris , june 10 president nicolas sarkozy s centerright camp was on course to win a landslide victory in parliament today after the first round of france s legislative elections , cementing his power to implement reforms in europe s thirdlargest economy the union for a popular movement obtained 413 percent of the vote , according to preliminary estimates by the csa polling institute , a score that is expected to give the party between 360 and 470 seats in the 577seat national assembly after the second round of voting june 17 , three pollsters said the main opposition camp , the socialist party , received an estimated 272 percent , putting it on course for 60 to 170 seats , pollsters said , reinforcing the sense of disarray that has reigned on the left ever since s gol ne royal lost to mr sarkozy in last month s presidential race mr sarkozy s party , which has set itself the unofficial goal of winning 400 seats , has been widely expected to obtain a comfortable majority , but the preliminary results today exceeded even optimistic forecasts it is the first time since 1978 that an outgoing parliamentary majority has been reelected , a result favored by a recent change to synchronize the presidential and parliamentary terms but with the gaullist camp set to expand its dominance in parliament from the current 359 seats , commentators said the result was also a sign that french voters trusted mr sarkozy to jolt their country out of a collective sense of decline minutes after the first exit polls , jeanpierre raffarin , head of mr sarkozy s popular movement , hailed the result as a strong endorsement of the president and his platform it is a success , mr raffarin said in an election broadcast on the tf1 network the drive nicolas sarkozy gave to french politics was confirmed by the french people they have confirmed their choice en masse mr sarkozy has been eager to maximize his mandate , reminding voters repeatedly in recent weeks of his intention to implement an ambitious agenda of change eleven ministers of his 15 are running in the election , including prime minister fran ois fillon , in a bid to maximize their legitimacy none of them will actually take up their seats , but if any of them were to lose , they would be asked to leave the government tonight only one of them , the minister of sustainable development , alain jupp , faced a risk of defeat if the presidential campaign was a roller coaster of suspense and passion that culminated in a turnout of 84 percent on may 6 , the parliamentary election has failed to spark nearly as much interest among voters only 604 percent turned out to cast their ballots , according to an early estimate by csa that would be a record low under france s fifth republic and an illustration that this election has come to be seen as a mere vote of confirmation or , as newspapers here described it , the third round of the presidential election a victory of the gaullist movement has been so widely predicted that the opposition has merely urged voters not to hand the new head of state too large a majority the socialists sought to put on a brave face tonight there is a second round in which the results can be improved , said laurent fabius , a senior member of the party if the socialist party suffered in the first round of the legislative ballot , smaller parties received an even harder blow a new centrist party , led by fran ois bayrou , who finished third in the presidential election , came nowhere close to the nearly 19 percent its leader received last month , getting only an estimated 74 percent of the national vote the centrists , like their green counterparts , have little hope of winning the 20 seats necessary to constitute a parliamentary group and get access to the financing that comes with that status the communist party risks losing its parliamentary group , while the farright front national , who have no lawmakers in the outgoing assembly , are not expected to win any this time either a majority in parliament makes mr sarkozy the most powerful leader in europe and one of the most powerful presidents in france s recent history elected for five years , the french head of state is commanderinchief of the armed forces and has the right to dissolve the national assembly to be sure , a parliamentary majority is no guarantee for swift change prime minister tony blair of britain , who 10 years ago won a landslide on a platform of pragmatism and personal drive not unlike that of mr sarkozy , shied away from overhauling britain s health and education systems in his first term in former president jacques chirac s second term , the centerright controlled nearly twothirds of the seats in the national assembly but the government was deeply unpopular and unable to break a sense of stagnation permeating the country s elite , particularly after the french rejected one of mr chirac s pet projects , a european constitution , in may 2005 last year , lawmakers swiftly abrogated legislation creating a more flexible work contract for young people after two months of street protests in his first four weeks in office , mr sarkozy has signaled that he is determined to use his powers to implement his election promises and , unlike his predecessors , get personally involved in the process i want to be a president who governs , he vowed after his election two bills one proposing a number of tax cuts and the other tightening sentencing rules for repeat offenders are ready to be submitted to the newly elected assembly in an extraordinary session over the summer if these measures are the most popular in mr sarkozy s reform package , a more revolutionary catalogue of measures , all at one point tried and abandoned by previous administrations under pressure from labor unions , are to follow over the next year , the new president plans to make it easier to hire and fire allow universities to select students and charge fees and overhaul generous public sector pensions according to commentators , the larger the parliamentary majority , the slimmer the legitimacy for unions to paralyze the country with strikes and demonstrations strong parliamentary backing is a decisive factor in transforming the country , an editorial in the rightleaning figaro said in its weekend edition given what awaits him , sarkozy will need it
with several of the republican contestants in the ames , iowa straw poll set to appear on the talk shows , you can expect that there will be a lot of sunday morning quarterbacking of the event and its significance mitt romney will be joined by his wife ann on fox news sunday with chris wallace mike huckabee , the former arkansas governor , is set to appear on cbs s face the nation abc s this week with george stephanopolous has mr huckabee s rival for disaffected religious conservatives , senator sam brownback of kansas , as well as representative dennis kucinich , the ohio democrat who received a gushing reception during the human rights campaign candidate forum on gay issues on thursday representative duncan hunter , a straw poll candidate and ranking republican on the house armed services committee , faces off with representative joe sestak , a freshman democrat and iraq veteran , on cnn s late edition with wolf blitzer transportation secretary mary peters is also set to talk about the minnesota bridge collapse and travel safety , and mr blitzer will talk foreign policy with ambassador mahmud ali durrani of pakistan representative david drier and jim talent , a missouri republican who was ousted from his senate seat in 2006 , will discuss gop politics harold ford jr , a congressman who lost the tennessee senate race last year , is scheduled to be on nbc s meet the press though mr ford was defeated by bob corker , a republican , mr ford stayed in washington as the chairman of the democratic leadership council , a moderate group and though one of their members was once president \( bill clinton \) , liberal blogs have crusaded against its influence and , given that none of the democratic candidates agreed to speak at its recent conference , its influence seems to be waning the netrootscentrist feud among the democrats broke into the mainstream media this week with dueling opeds in the washington post on tuesday , mr ford and gov martin o malley of maryland wrote  the temptation to ignore the vital center is nothing new every four years , in the heat of the nominating process , liberals and conservatives alike dream of a world in which swing voters don t exist some on the left would love to pretend that groups such as the democratic leadership council , the party s leading centrist voice , aren t needed anymore but for democrats , taking the center for granted next year would be a greater mistake than ever before george w bush is handing us democrats our hoover moment independents , swing voters and even some republicans who haven t voted our way in more than a decade are willing to hear us out with an ambitious commonsense agenda , the progressive center has a onceinalifetime opportunity to win back the white house , expand its margins in congress and build a political and governing majority that could last a generation markos moulitsas and susan gardner of dailykos , an influential liberal blog , offered their rebuttal in the post this morning in fact , we pushed the party so far left that we positioned it squarely in the american mainstream and last year won a historic , sweeping congressional victory , something the centrist groups had been unable to accomplish for decades not even in the dlc s glory days of the 1990s by early 2006 , socalled centrism had offered up iraq , a tax regime that puts the burden on the middle class , bankruptcy reform that gave away the farm to irresponsible credit card companies , an outdated physical infrastructure , legalized torture and a crippled disasterresponse effort in new orleans the american people , infinitely smarter than washington insiders , had had enough unapologetic , muscular democrats swept into office in dramatic numbers in state and local races nationwide remember that it s primary time , and the democratic primary base may be far more attuned to the liberal left once voters are into the general election cycle , the dlc and the centrist democrats may have more sway anyway , if none of those topics appeal to you , you can catch the rerun of political capital with al hunt at 10 30 am on bloomberg television , where he talks to senator christopher j dodd , a democratic candidate and chairman of the banking committee , about the subprime lending crisis
in my left hand i am holding the throat of maria sharapova s tennis racket a confection of titanium and graphite strung with some durable synthetic fiber my right hand closes loosely on the grip this is still a surprise to me having a racket in my hands , standing on a tennis court , waiting for the ball i have been taking lessons for the past couple of months because tennis is so californian , because the world will soon be nothing but asphalt , and because i have not spent enough of my life using the handeye reflexes that are such a pleasure to use the physical aspects of the game are hard enough the footwork , the strokes but the hardest part here it comes , just crossing the net , a phosphorescent green moon is watching the ball in the next court is a young player , a girl who is perhaps 9 years old her coach is hitting balls to her my coach is hitting balls to me the girl next door has been playing tennis for a couple of years , it looks like , and her potential is a matter of physical gifts and good coaching , and how hard she wants to work i have begun at 54 and am now 10 weeks into it what could i do at 9 as well as this girl hits a tennis ball \? i could read , hours a day i try to remember this when the world seems to be full of 9yearolds mastering everything i wonder whether she has trouble watching the ball not that the ball is hard to see it is a cautionary chartreuse it stands out sharply against the court , the windscreen , the grassy slope , the shade of the pines and eucalyptus , the mountains that rise in the distance the ball is soundless coming at me , though i can hear the hollow pop of balls being struck in the courts nearby this time i am going to watch it all the way but i try to remember to shift my weight and so , having a general sense of where the ball is , i stop watching the ball i replay in my mind the sight of rafael nadal practicing on a side court at indian wells last month and how the ball sizzled in the air i watched another pro , andy murray , bouncing the ball on the edge of his racket in an idle moment i try to imagine what it is like to have spent most of one s life in communion with a tennis ball i hope someday to watch the ball the way these players do i do n't mean see or understand or know the ball i mean keep my head pointed at it , eyes focused on it , watching the ball the ball has always eluded me partly it is a matter of doubting what happens if you keep your face pointed at an incoming object a grounder that may take a bad hop and bruise the very eye that is watching it but partly it is a matter of thinking , falsely , that athletic grace lies somehow in the realm of the peripheral witnessing how the name comes back ! graig nettles in flight at third base or tiger woods with a long iron , you can see only the fluid lines of motion described by arms and body and legs what you can never see is how closely they watch the ball , the distinction they enforce between the ball and the everything else that is not the ball until now , i never understood that all the grace there is flows from watching the ball when i do so my coach says my body stays down and balanced , coiled when i do , i strike the ball cleanly , and it flies true it reminds me of the story john mcphee tells about arthur ashe , about how he was taught to hit tennis balls with a broom handle as a way to narrow his gaze this , of course , was somewhere around age 9 better if i play with sharapova s midsize racket and just keep trying to watch the ball i have every incentive to keep my eyes on the ball this entire practice session , i tell myself , i am going to think only about watching the ball , which , i soon realize , is different from watching the ball but i am watching the ball now and here it comes and it is not a metaphor and i am actually watching it , all of my awareness on the ball , and none left over to be aware of watching it , and when i hit the ball it has some zip , and it dives into a corner of the court just in , and it is a fine thing no one is there to hit it back
you have three chances this month to see essential balanchine , one of 11 thematic programs newly created by the as a way of packaging its extensive repertory but none will include what audiences got tuesday a funny , touching tribute to the great ballerina melissa hayden by her former partner jacques d'amboise he described her insistence on finishing a ballet after falling so hard she knocked herself out her mischievous promise to kiss him every day from his 16th to his 17th birthday , only to tire of the game in a week and how , when he saw her last , she removed her oxygen mask to say , oh , jacques , you came for my last dance hayden , who died of cancer last year at 83 , is now one of the many ghosts that mr d'amboise , like anyone long connected to dance , sees in the theater but surely even ballet neophytes felt the ghosts circling in liebeslieder walzer , which followed his speech the lush , multilayered dance for four couples takes its name from brahms s haunting vocal works like the music , performed onstage by two pianists and four singers , it is sumptuous , romantic and especially on tuesday ineffably sad as the couples whirl through david mitchell s lavish ballroom , a host of stories are suggested yet balanchine s choreography needs no narratives , not as interpreted by the likes of kyra nichols and miranda weese , both nearing the end of their city ballet careers it was an embarrassment of riches , particularly when wendy whelan \( in the role originated by ms hayden \) and nikolaj h bbe held the floor their dancing was both celebration and elegy it can take a bit to sink into liebeslieder , but once you 're in , you never want out stars and stripes , on the other hand , offers scant sustenance , despite the irresistible ashley bouder as liberty bell it s not that the ballet is empty fun , but that it s not really much fun at all all those flagdraped dancers grinning and spinning to sousa like mad tops just because you can adapt ballet to the marching band does n't mean you should by night s end the ballet that began it three hours earlier had receded to a distant but still shimmering island , chiefly populated by megan fairchild and s bastien marcovici of the program s three works square dance offers perhaps the fullest union of disparate movement traditions corelli and vivaldi show up for a toeshoe hoedown , and something new is born everything is pared to its surprising but inevitable core , and the result is sublime no essential
there is , conveniently , no official count but there are an estimated 160 , 000 private contractors working in iraq , and some 50 , 000 of them are private security operatives that is , fighters the dangers of this privatized approach to war became frighteningly clear last month , after guards from blackwater usa , assigned to protect american diplomats , were accused of killing at least eight iraqis , including an infant iraqis whose hearts and minds the bush administration insists it is finally winning were infuriated by the killings , telling tales of arrogant and triggerhappy operatives terrorizing ordinary citizens the incident provides an irrefutable argument for bringing these missioncritical jobs , which should be performed by soldiers , back into government hands as quickly as possible , and for placing any remaining private contractors under the jurisdiction of american military law blackwater s 850 operatives in iraq are not the only problem the fact that american diplomatic activity in iraq nearly came to a halt when blackwater was grounded for a few days shows how much american operations have come to depend on mercenaries the armed forces have relied on private contractors since the united states opted for an allvolunteer military after the end of the vietnam war mostly for noncritical tasks such as building or cooking the bush administration took it to a whole new level when it decided to fight a big war with a far too small force requiring the pentagon and other agencies to turn to private security contractors like blackwater to help make up some of the difference contractors have been in a legal limbo in iraq since 2004 , when the american authorities there granted them immunity from prosecution under iraqi law some of the interrogators involved in the abuse of prisoners at the infamous abu ghraib prison were private contractors , yet none of them have been punished indeed , no private contractor has been prosecuted or convicted for any crime involving an iraqi victim last november , an amendment was included in the defense authorization bill that put private contractors under the uniform code of military justice , exposing the contractors to a court martial just like any other american soldiers the bush administration has been none too eager to enforce this new law , and the pentagon has not yet issued guidelines to commanders about its application the lesson here is that such essential jobs cannot be outsourced war is not a private business
a coordination problem \( a term of art in economics and management \) occurs when you have a task to perform , the task has multiple and shifting components , the time for completion is limited , and your performance is affected by the order and sequence of the actions you take the trick is to manage it so that the components do n't bump into each other in ways that produce confusion , frustration and inefficiency you will face a coordination problem if you are a general deploying troops , tanks , helicopters , food , tents and medical supplies , or if you are the ceo of a large company juggling the demands of design , personnel , inventory and production and these days , you will face a coordination problem if you want to get a cup of coffee it used to be that when you wanted a cup of coffee you went into a nondescript place fitted out largely in linoleum , formica and neon , sat down at a counter , and , in response to a brisk what 'll you have , dear \? said , coffee and a cheese danish twenty seconds later , tops , they arrived , just as you were settling into the sports page now it s all wood or concrete floors , lots of earth tones , soft , highstyle lighting , open barrels of coffee beans , folkrock and indie music , photographs of urban landscapes , and copies of the onion as you walk in , everything is saying , this is very sophisticated , and you 'd better be up to it it turns out to be hard first you have to get in line , and you may have one or two people in front of you who are ordering a drink with more parts than an internal combustion engine , something about double shot , skinny , breve , grande , au lait and a lot of other words that never pass my lips if you are patient and stay in line \( no bathroom breaks \) , you get to put in your order , but then you have to find a place to stand while you wait for it there is no such place so you shift your body , first here and then there , trying not to get in the way of those you ca n't help get in the way of finally , the coffee arrives but then your real problems begin when you turn , holding your prize , and make your way to where the accessories things you put in , on and around your coffee are to be found there is a staggering array of them , and the order of their placement seems random in relation to the order of your needs there is no right place to start , so you lunge after one thing and then after another with awkward reaches unfortunately , two or three other people are doing the same thing , and each is doing it in a different sequence so there is an endless round of excuse me , no , excuse me , as if you were in an old steve martin routine but no amount of politeness and care is enough after all , there are so many items to reach for lids , cup jackets , straws , napkins , stirrers , milk , half and half , water , sugar , splenda , the wastepaper basket , spoons you and your companions may strive for a ballet of courtesy , but what you end up performing is more like bumper cars it s just a question of what will happen first getting what you want or spilling the coffee you are trying to balance in one hand on the guy reaching over you i wo n't even talk about the problem of finding a seat and two things add to your pain and trouble first , it costs a lot , 3 and up and worst of all , what you 're paying for is the privilege of doing the work that should be done by those who take your money the coffee shop experience is just one instance of the growing practice of shifting the burden of labor to the consumer gas stations , grocery and drug stores , bagel shops \( why should i put on my own cream cheese \? \) , airline checkins , parking lots it s insert this , swipe that , choose credit or debit , enter your pin , push the red button , error , start again at least when you go on a vacation that involves working on a ranch , the work is something you 've chosen but none of us has chosen to take over the jobs of those we pay to serve us well , it s sunday morning , and you 're probably reading this with a cup of coffee i hope it was easy to get

hanoi , it was midnight here in hanoi , or already 2 am back in seoul , but after a fivehour flight on a recent sunday , kim wansu was driven straight from the airport to the lucky star karaoke bar here , where 23 young vietnamese women seeking korean husbands sat waiting in two dimly lighted rooms do i have to look at them and decide now \? mr kim asked , as the marriage brokers gave a brief description of each of the women sitting around a ushaped sofa thus , mr kim , a 39yearold auto parts worker from a suburb of seoul , began the mildly chaotic , twohour process of choosing a spouse in a day or two , if his fiveday marriage tour went according to plan , he would be wed and enjoying his honeymoon at the famed perfume pagoda on the huong tich mountain southwest of here more and more south korean men are finding wives outside of south korea , where a surplus of bachelors , a lack of marriageable korean partners and the rising social status of women have combined to shrink the domestic market for the marriageminded male bachelors in china , india and other asian nations , where the traditional preference for sons has created a disproportionate number of men now fighting over a smaller pool of women , are facing the same problem the rising status of women in the united states sent american men who were searching for more traditional wives to russia in the 1990s but the united states' more balanced population has not led to the shortage of potential brides and the thriving international marriage industry found in south korea now , that industry is seizing on an increasingly globalized marriage market and sending comparatively affluent korean bachelors searching for brides in the poorer corners of china and southeast and central asia the marriage tours are fueling an explosive growth in marriages to foreigners in south korea , a country whose ethnic homogeneity lies at the core of its selfidentity in 2005 , marriages to foreigners accounted for 14 percent of all marriages in south korea , up from 4 percent in 2000 south korean news organizations have reported that many of the foreign brides were initially lied to by their husbands , and suffered isolation and sometimes abuse in south korea partly in response , the ministry of health and welfare is now moving to regulate the international marriage industry , which emerged so suddenly that the consumer protection board can only estimate that there are 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 such agencies nationwide after an initial setback his first three choices found various reasons to decline his offer mr kim narrowed his field to a 22yearold college student and an 18yearold high school graduate what s your personality like \? mr kim asked the college student i'm an extrovert , she said the 18yearold asked why he wanted to marry a vietnamese woman i have two colleagues who married vietnamese women , he said , adding , the women seem devoted and familyoriented one korean broker said the 22yearold , who seemed bright and assertive , would adapt well to south korea another suggested flipping a coin well , since i'm quiet , i 'll choose the extrovert , mr kim said finally , adding quickly , is it ok if i hold her hand now \? she went over to sit next to him , though neither dared to hold hands she spelled out her name in her left palm vien her name was to thi vien in south korea , billboards advertising marriages to foreigners dot the countryside , and fliers are scattered on the seoul subway many rural governments , faced with declining populations , subsidize the marriage tours , which typically cost 10 , 000 the business began in the late 1990s by matching south korean farmers or the physically disabled mostly to ethnic koreans in china , according to brokers and the consumer protection board but by 2003 , the majority of customers were urban bachelors , and the foreign brides came from a host of countries the widespread availability of sexscreening technology for pregnant women since the 1980s has resulted in the birth of a disproportionate number of south korean males what is more , south korea s growing wealth has increased women s educational and employment opportunities , even as it has led to rising divorce rates and plummeting birthrates nowadays , korean women have higher standards , said lee euntae , the owner of interwedding , an agency that last year matched 400 korean bachelors with brides from vietnam , china , the philippines , mongolia , thailand , cambodia , uzbekistan and indonesia if a man has only a high school degree , or lives with his mother , or works only at a small or mediumsize company , or is short or older , or lives in the countryside , he 'll find it very difficult to marry in korea critics say the business demeans and takes advantage of poor women but brokers say they are merely matching the needs of korean men and foreign women seeking better lives but this business will get more difficult as those countries get richer , said won hyunjae , the owner of ibombit , another agency now , even a disabled korean man can find a vietnamese bride but eventually vietnamese women will ask why they have to go marry a korean man when life in vietnam is good for now , vietnam remains a popular source of brides , second only to china marriages with vietnamese women are considered so successful that the local government of at least one city , yeongcheon , in south korea s rural southeast , subsidizes marriage tours only to vietnam at incheon international airport to the west of seoul , an increasingly familiar scene unfolds in front of the arrival gates in the mornings korean men , holding telltale bouquets and often accompanied by relatives , greet their vietnamese brides as they arrive on overnight flights from hanoi or ho chi minh city it was also at the airport that a tenselooking mr kim and another client began their marriage tours three brokers for interwedding and ibombit arrived mr kim , urged on by an older sister , decided to go to vietnam after a lastditch effort to meet a korean woman in december failed a high school graduate , he lives with his mother and his sister , and he works on the assembly line of a small manufacturer of car keys though he lives in one of the world s most wired societies , mr kim does not use the internet the other client was kim taegoo , 51 , who grows ginseng and apples on the 25 acres of land he owns in yeongju , a town southeast of seoul mr kim had recently divorced a chinese woman he married after the death of his first wife , a korean woman he lives with his 16yearold daughter and his elderly mother his 21yearold has left home ahn jaewon , a korean broker who has long been based in hanoi and is married to a vietnamese woman , began the women have come out looking their best for you but do n't expect them to look as pretty as korean women there is a big gap in our gdp s do n't be condescending do n't lie if you lie , they 'll find out eventually and feel betrayed and run away the parents know that their daughters will marry a korean man the authorities know this is happening , but there 'll be trouble if we do it in front of them so i seek your understanding once we land in hanoi , even though it 'll be very late , we 'll go meet the women right away it s safer to do this at night one last thing other companies allow you to sleep with the women on the first night we do n't only on the bridal night we must , after all , keep our decorum as korean men is that ok with you \? the two nodded and so , at the lucky star karaoke bar here , the older mr kim addressed the vietnamese women , most in their early 20s my 16yearold daughter lives with me , and i'm a farmer , he said , after informing the women through the brokers that he would also send 100 a month to their parents in vietnam is that ok with you \? i know how to farm , said bui thi thuy , 22 , one of the two women mr kim eventually focused on asked whether she had any questions , ms thuy said she had none but the other woman , an earnest 28yearold in a lightgreen jacket , asked , if i marry you , will you love me and take care of me forever \? of course , mr kim answered , then quickly settled on ms thuy after a few hours' sleep , the new couples and the brokers squeezed into a small van for the fourhour ride to the women s home province , quang ninh , about four hours east of hanoi there , the couples would be interviewed by the local authorities before registering for their marriages the road out of hanoi , a wide highway flanked by new factories owned by multinationals like canon , eventually narrowed to two lanes crisscrossed frequently by cows farther out , farmers could be seen working the soil by hand , and signs of vietnam s booming economy grew fewer most of the vietnamese women marrying korean men came from the rural areas around hanoi and ho chi minh city both ms vien and ms thuy had friends who had married korean men and lived , happily it seemed , in south korea like many vietnamese , they were also avid fans of korean television shows and movies , the socalled korean wave of pop culture that has swept all of asia since the late 1990s the korean wave has transformed south korea s image in the region , presenting the country as having successfully balanced tradition and modernity , a place that produces coveted samsung cellphones and cherishes family ties the week the two women met their future husbands , vietnamese television was showing in prime time a south korean television series called successful story of a bright girl the story of a simple country girl who goes to seoul and captures the heart of a tycoon to be honest , i do n't know much about korea except what i 've seen on television , ms vien said but the korean landscape is beautiful korean men look sophisticated and affectionate they seem responsible , and they live in harmony with their family members and their colleagues a soccer fan able to rattle off the jersey numbers of david beckham and zinedine zidane , she had registered two years earlier with a broker for marriages with koreans her father , a construction worker for a local firm , was able to send his two children ms vien and her older brother to college by contrast , ms thuy was one of five children of rice farmers she had registered with the agency soon after graduating from high school a friend of mine married a korean man and now lives in seoul , ms thuy said we talk on the phone sometimes she s very happy she says there are so many people and tall buildings in seoul at age 22 , she said , half of her peers had already married as she waited to marry , she helped with household chores , forbidden by her parents to engage in the farm work that might blemish her looks the couples registered for their marriages and underwent medical checkups , running into other vietnamesekorean couples along the way the younger mr kim wrote a letter in korean to his bride trying to allay the anxieties he saw on her face , promising to protect her and surmount the inevitable problems but found no way to relay its meaning the couples bought korean and vietnamese dictionaries , pointing to words or using broken english about 40 hours after landing here in hanoi , the korean men married their vietnamese brides in a double ceremony the brides' relatives waited at a large restaurant here with expectant looks today is the union not only of two people , but of two countries , said ms vien s father , to minh seu , 55 vietnam and korea share many similarities we are both confucian societies standing next to her daughter and her new soninlaw , ms thuy s mother , nguyen thi nguyet , 56 , said this is a poor country , but conditions are much better in korea i hope my daughter will have a better life there but ms thuy s father , bui van vui , 52 , was displeased that his daughter was marrying a man just one year younger than he was the night before , he had telephoned mr ahn to complain about the age gap between his daughter and mr kim i'm still very worried because of the age gap , he said as his soninlaw listened to mr ahn s interpretation i'm slightly relieved now that i see my soninlaw for the first time but i ca n't stop worrying do n't worry , do n't worry about a thing , mr kim said still , the father looked grim throughout the ceremony let s tell him about the compensation , mr kim told mr ahn , referring to the 100 he would send every month later , later , mr ahn said as he left the restaurant after the ceremony , the father turned around at the entrance to take a final look at his daughter he pressed two fingers against his lips and kissed her goodbye later , ms thuy said i was my father s favorite he really adores me and is worried she , too , was worried i know korea only from television , but it must be very , very different from reality i do n't know whether my new family will like me , and i do n't know how i 'll adapt i'm overwhelmed with worries two days later , it was time for the korean men to return home , with their wives staying behind to complete the paperwork to join them at the airport here , ms thuy announced that she had something to tell her husband and asked mr ahn to interpret please extend my greetings to your mother and children , she said mr kim reached out for a handshake , but the brokers pressed him to give his wife a hug do n't worry about me , she said i 'll study korean very hard , and by the time you see me i 'll be good at it we had only a short time together but i felt affection between us and started to feel love for you when you 're in korea , please call me i 'll call you in two days , he said the two women would leave hanoi in three months , the same way half a dozen other vietnamese brides , visas in hand , did on a recent night the extended families of these brides had come from the countryside to bid them farewell , some still wearing car sickness patches behind their ears for the long drive here many , it seemed , were visiting the airport for the first time some kept riding an escalator up and down , their faces showing the thrill of a new experience then , with the boarding time approaching , they clustered in front of a window looking into the office , noses pressed against the glass , and waved at the brides as they were stamped out of vietnam and went off to catch the redeye to south korea

los angeles , may 15 a knockdown , dragout trial over the failed bigbudget movie sahara mercifully ended on tuesday after three and a half months but it had an unsatisfying hollywood ending neither side truly won a split decision reflected the debate among the legal set here , which had for weeks wondered who looked worse was it clive cussler , 75 , a bestselling author of pulpy adventure novels who complained that sahara \( 2005 \) , based on one of his novels , was a boxoffice bomb because he did not have final approval on the screenplay \? or was it philip anschutz , a reclusive entertainment billionaire whose company produced sahara and who fought the suit by arguing that he overpaid mr cussler by millions because the writer had overstated his book sales \? the jury , in effect , sided with neither , ordering mr cussler to pay 5 million to mr anschutz s company , crusader entertainment , for his misdeeds , while confirming that crusader owed mr cussler 85 million for the rights to a second novel , according to lawyers for both sides as the decision made clear , the jury in superior court for los angeles county , which deliberated for nearly two weeks , had its hands full but not with just the usual arcana i 'd say the sahara' trial is more about hollywood egos than law or money , said pierce o 'donnell , a leading lawyer in business and mediarelated cases the case may have been much ado about less than nothing 105 million less than nothing that is the sum of money that sahara , with a 160 million budget and starring matthew mcconaughey and pen lope cruz , has lost for its investors , principally crusader entertainment along the way , jurors and the public have learned that hollywood studios and bestselling authors sometimes exaggerate or lie you heard the lies , marvin s putnam , the lead lawyer for mr anschutz , said in his closing argument nearly two weeks ago what they really wanted was 10 million bucks per book , and they lied to do it bert fields , the lawyer for mr cussler , appeared outraged , too mr cussler s rights as an author were breached , mr fields said they say he would only consider his own writing , the lawyer said to the jury hogwash they claim he took back his approvals more hogwash longtime entertainment lawyers said cussler v anschutz was a gardenvariety business dispute that was meant to be settled quietly in carpeted suites it seems ridiculous to me , said linda lichter , a leading hollywood lawyer does the whole case ride on whether this guy gave an accurate representation of what the book sales were \? what producer enters into a deal based on what someone tells them about book sales \? alan schwartz , another prominent entertainment lawyer , said the other side was grasping at straws the whole idea is he s saying he had final approval over the screenplay , mr schwartz said but most of us feel it s not a very strong case he took the stand , and he was not a very attractive witness questioned on the stand for seven days , mr cussler contradicted himself and at times seem confused he admitted that he had frequently referred to having sold a total of 100 million books , even though his literary agent had told him that the figure was inaccurate , but that he had forgot the lawyers marked their territory mr putnam , 42 , of o'melveny myers , was the upstart , arguing against mr fields , 78 , a legend who has represented a who s who of hollywood luminaries , including tom cruise and jeffrey katzenberg mr fields , who arrived every day at the courthouse in his chauffeured bentley , is best known for aggressive negotiation rather than litigation for more than three years , he has been a subject of a lengthy federal investigation into his relationship with anthony pellicano , a jailed private investigator who is awaiting trail on charges of wiretapping and racketeering the lawyers were not the only people grandstanding early last month , robert mckee , a screenwriting master , testified for mr anschutz , giving his opinion of mr cussler s sahara screenplay from 2002 how bad \? mr mckee asked i have thought of phrases like seriously flawed , ' fatally flawed' but it is beyond all of that , because when something is flawed there is an implication that something else about it is good on crossexamination , mr fields had mr mckee acknowledge that he found citizen kane to be heartless , emotionally empty and cold none of this added up to sympathetic arguments for either side , said people who watched the trial from afar in such cases , it is quite possible that both sides might lose , which seems to have occurred in this case the jury awarded mr anschutz a sum to compensate for misstated book sales , even as it gave mr cussler , who ended up ahead , an award because crusader did not turn his second book in the adventure series into a film lawyers for each side declared victory , even as they said they would ask the judge to set aside the sums ordered by the jury average jurors are turned off about cases involving the rich cheating the rich , mr o 'donnell said often the outcome is a pox on both your bank accounts
guangzhou , china every night , columns of hulking blue and red freight trucks invade china s major cities with a reverberating roar of engines and dark clouds of diesel exhaust so thick it dims headlights by daybreak in this sprawling metropolis in southeastern china , residents near thoroughfares who leave their windows open overnight find their faces stiff with a dark layer of diesel soot after mary leung opens her tiny openair shop along a major road soon after dawn , she must wipe the soot off her countertops and tables the tiny yellowandolive bird that has kept her company is harder to clean trucks are the mules of this country s spectacularly expanding economy ubiquitous and essential , yet highly noxious trucks here burn diesel fuel contaminated with more than 130 times the pollutioncausing sulfur that the united states allows in most diesel while car sales in china are now growing even faster than truck sales , trucks are by far the largest source of streetlevel pollution tiny particles of sulfurladen soot penetrate deep into residents' lungs , interfering with the absorption of oxygen nitrogen oxides from truck exhaust , which build all night because cities limit truck traffic by day , bind each morning with gasoline fumes from china s growing car fleet to form dense smog that inflames lungs and can cause severe coughing and asthma the 10 million trucks on chinese roads , more than a quarter of all vehicles in this country , are a major reason that china accounts for half the world s annual increase in oil consumption sating their thirst helped push the price of oil to nearly 100 a barrel this year , before a recent decline , and has propelled china past the united states as the world s largest emitter of globalwarming gases yet cleaning up truck pollution presents complex problems for china s leaders for instance , regulators have begun raising emissions standards for new trucks , but have left millions of older ones belching black smoke forcing businesses and farmers to buy more expensive vehicles could put a drag on the economy , which already faces inflationary pressure from rising food prices and other costs that fear of inflation not to mention political and social unrest has led beijing to prevent the country s mostly stateowned oil companies from increasing diesel prices at the pump in pace with global oil prices raising fuel prices for farmers , whose incomes have lagged behind those of city dwellers and who need diesel for their tractors , is one concern lower diesel prices also essentially subsidize every manufacturer in china s elaborate export machine but price controls create a vicious circle oil giants like sinopec , losing money on every gallon of diesel they refine because of the low sales prices , upgrade refineries slowly , if at all and they seek out cheap crude , which has high levels of sulfur , to make diesel , negating the effects of higher emissions standards for new vehicles sinopec is trying our best to purchase lowquality crudes much heavier and more sulfur content , said evan jia , a sinopec spokesman we buy those kinds of crudes to lower the purchasing cost low diesel prices frequently make trucks more costeffective than trains , which pollute less sales of large freight trucks in china outpace those in the united states by a wide margin demand for diesel at service stations is so great , and supplies are so tight , that rationing and shortages have become common truck drivers idle for hours only to be allowed to buy as little as five gallons of fuel since 2000 , sales of heavyduty trucks have risen sixfold while car sales have risen eightfold this has created myriad problems , from gridlock that chokes china s cities to pollution that chokes its citizens , contributing each year to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths from heart and lung problems , according to the world bank ms leung , the shopkeeper , is a slender , tidy , 44yearold woman with a cheery disposition she used to keep her little bird in a wooden cage over the entrance to the two battered plastic tables where she serves soft drinks and fresh waffles for less than 40 cents each all day , trucks , buses and cars grind past while large trucks are banned in guangzhou from 7 am to 9 pm , some obtain special permits for daytime access and many mediumsize trucks with diesel engines are allowed in the city during the day if they carry local license plates we had to put out bowls of water in the cage , ms leung said , so the bird could constantly wash itself she finally moved the bird , a pekin robin , to her home on a quieter street she tries not to think about what the exhaust fumes are doing to her own health my throat hurts all the time , she said i suck on throat lozenges for it it s unbearable international experts say that hundreds of millions of chinese are exposed every day to the potentially lethal mix of soot particles and smog american regulators have labeled diesel soot a likely carcinogen a growing body of academic literature blames tiny airborne particles from diesel exhaust , coalfired power plants and other sources for up to 90 percent of all deaths from outdoor air pollution , because the particles penetrate so deeply into lungs diesel engines also emit large quantities of nitrogen oxides , which react with gasoline fumes to produce photochemical smog when hit by sunlight mainland chinese atmospheric scientists concluded in an analysis this year in the journal of environmental sciences that , here in guangzhou , particles were the pollutant farthest out of line with airquality norms 226 days a year sulfur dioxide , which comes mainly from burning coal , was the pollutant that exceeded norms by the widest margin 45 days a year , while nitrogen oxides were the most prominent pollutant 23 days a year the air was relatively clean on the remaining 71 days a year new tests by chinese and american researchers in tianjin , in northeastern china , found that diesel engines in trucks and buses accounted for 93 percent of all nitrogen oxides from vehicles in china and 97 percent of particles a separate academic study of diesel exhaust here in guangzhou found that chinese trucks put out particles in unusually large quantities and sizes , as engines with often inadequate or damaged emissions equipment were forced to pull overweight loads ms leung said she had little choice but to stick it out she and her husband had a shop on a lessbusy street , but the building was torn down and the local government gave her the current lease as a substitute they are not allowed to sell the lease or apply for a different one , and the shop is their sole means of support for two daughters , the elder one the first in the family to go to college the only option , ms leung said , is to hope that her building will be condemned so the city will issue her a lease in a more healthful location i'm dreaming of it , she said in nearby shenzhen , chan kinfun also faces economic realities a salesman shows mr chan , the operations manager of a hong kong trucking company , around the towering tractor cabs at a sinotruk dealership even the most modern cabs have engines that emit at least three times the levels of nitrogen oxides of new american trucks and at least seven times the particles even with clean , lowsulfur diesel building a truck that meets top emissions standards is not just a question of spending a little extra on pollutioncontrol equipment it usually requires radical engine redesigns , which can add thousands of dollars to the price a truck meeting the european union s existing euro 4 pollution standard , which beijing s municipal government will adopt in january , would have to be ordered specially from the factory , the salesman said and it would cost 35 , 000 , compared with 27 , 000 for a truck meeting the more lenient euro 3 standard now in effect for guangzhou and shenzhen trucks conforming to the euro 2 standard , still legally sold in much of china , would cost only 23 , 000 , and a special fee of 950 , the sinotruk salesman said , to conceal the truck s origin in an area where only euro 3 trucks are supposed to be sold but none of this helps mr chan hong kong already requires him to buy euro 4 trucks , and this puts him at a disadvantage against mainland trucking companies that use cheaper vehicles i do n't know how much longer i 'll be able to stay in business , he said one reason china has severe air pollution is that officials have been slow to impose that extra cost trucks in the united states , which has the stiffest diesel emissions standards in the world , typically cost at least twice as much as a euro 3 truck of similar power in china , partly because of higher labor costs , but also because their engines emit less pollution the chinese government has lagged about eight years behind the european union in imposing new emissions standards only as air pollution has started to become a national issue has china begun to accelerate the pace euro 4 standards will take effect nationwide in 2010 , five years after they took effect in the european union but the opportunities for further improvements in emissions per vehicle are limited by poor fuel quality the united states allows maximum sulfur concentrations of just 15 parts per million for most diesel fuels , while china allows up to 2 , 000 parts per million the average sulfur in american gasoline is limited to 30 parts per million china allows up to 800 parts per million sulfur clogs emissions control equipment , and the more advanced the equipment , the more vulnerable it is to sulfur damage and china lacks an effective inspection system to enforce even its more lenient standards the cleaner fuel available in cities like guangzhou and beijing helps limit car pollution but truck drivers tend to fill up in rural areas with less expensive highsulfur fuel western refineries pay extra for lowsulfur crude because removing sulfur is difficult but in a bid to control inflation , the chinese government orders service stations to sell gasoline and diesel at prices so low that they frequently fall below refiners' costs that gives refiners like sinopec a strong incentive to buy the cheapest possible crude mr jia , the spokesman , said the company then refined the crude to meet china s standards low diesel prices also leave oil company refinery divisions with little money to invest in modernization the chinese government raised regulated prices of gasoline and diesel by nearly 10 percent on nov 1 , to the yuan equivalent of 265 a gallon but that still roughly equals the wholesale price of diesel on international markets and is slightly higher than the wholesale price of gasoline , leaving nothing to cover the cost of distributing fuel to service stations , not to mention profit so refineries and service stations have been cutting back on sales , to the dismay of truckers after four years of coping with diesel shortages every few months , zhang yanchao , a 33yearold trucker , thought he had become inured to lining up for fuel but that was before he waited 10 hours on a recent night outside guangzhou and was then allowed to buy just a quartertank of diesel it s the worst i 've ever seen , he said i could n't get any sleep since i had to keep moving forward in the line of trucks all night long two dozen truckers said in interviews here in guangzhou and in shenzhen that fuel shortages had become chronic the shortages also contribute to air pollution , with trucks idling for hours as they wait in line rapid highway construction has reduced travel time in much of china a halfdozen truckers who regularly drive from shandong province , 1 , 000 miles northeast of guangzhou , said that what had been a threeday trip five years ago took only two days this past summer , thanks to the new expressways but they said long waits for fuel had since lengthened the trip to four days the journeys are tough on drivers' health , as they breathe the exhaust of the trucks ahead of them when a truck driver is not eating rice , he s eating diesel , said mr zhang over a dinner of rice and vegetables at a grimy cafe here as his brakes were repaired wearing blue jeans and a dark pullover and chainsmoking cigarettes , like many of the truck drivers here , mr zhang was frank about both the problems truckers face and the problems their vehicles create overweight trucks damage roads and emit extra pollution but mr zhang said he frequently exceeded weight limits on his blue fivemonthold chunlan truck but of course i put more on it , he said otherwise , how could i make a living \? with his pay based on how much cargo he hauls , he estimated that he typically carried two to three times his truck s legal limit time on the road is hard on relationships , too mr zhang has a wife and a yearold daughter but he takes another woman with him on many of his trips as a second wife , he said , insisting that his legal wife accepted the arrangement he acknowledged that the diesel exhaust was probably not good for him , and said many truck drivers developed coughs coughing comes with old age , but driving a truck makes it worse , he said but coughing can come from these cigarettes as well oil industry experts suggest that china should raise diesel prices by at least 20 percent to eliminate subsidies and fuel lines and to foster refinery investment mr zhang , who pays the equivalent of 680 a month on his truck loan , vehemently opposes an increase in diesel prices he is convinced that he would not be able to pass on the extra cost to the manufacturers who hire him that would be too much for me , he said i would be put out of business i might as well stay home one response to china s truckpollution problem would be to ban older trucks but the government has resisted such a radical step , fearing the costs not just to the economy , but to the truckers and to members of their extended families , who typically pool their savings to finance a truck another obstacle to change may be the lack of public criticism of truck pollution while environmental groups are rapidly multiplying in china , vehicle pollution has attracted little attention and much resignation among truckers and residents alike mr zhang typified that reaction when he said , surveying the dingy truck stop , if you do n't like pollution , go live in the mountains
according to a washington post abc news poll published earlier this week , hillary rodham clinton s most consistent and enthusiastic female support is now coming from high school graduates with incomes of less than 50 , 000 a year young women like her best over age 45 , collegeeducated , higherearning women like her least in fact , asked who they found most honest , trustworthy and inspiring , these women clinton s peers expressed more of a kinship with barack obama in a sense , none of this should really come as a surprise back in 2000 , clinton bonded like glue with middle class women in upstate new york they liked the way she came to speak with them and learned about their lives but was a hard sell in the wealthy suburbs downstate noncollegeeducated women really like that she s smart , that she s a woman who has worked for what she has , supported her family , kept her family life private and handled her marriage the way that she has they ve often made similar choices in their own lives , says celinda lake , who has done extensive polling on women s attitudes toward clinton since the time of hillary s first senate race uppermiddleclass women are more judgmental they see her as polarizing they secondguess how she handled her personal issues noncollege women react to this argument with they always say this about women they always try to drag the woman down melinda henneberger , political editor of the huffington post , found similar hillaryhostility among the senator s besteducated and most successful peers around the country as she traveled , talking to women about politics , before and after the publication of her recent book , if they only listened to us what women voters want politicians to hear she rubs a lot of women who are like her the wrong way , henneberger says there s a feeling that she s too polltested that she s too willing to say what s required obama , hennebeger says , strikes these women as authentic hillary does not all of this isn t overly disturbing to the hillary for president campaign after all , clinton is the undeniable democratic frontrunner with overwhelming support from women \( fiftyone percent of women in the washington post abc poll said they d give her their vote in the democratic primaries , and women at all income levels chose her as the candidate they would trust most to handle a major crisis \) and it goes without saying that there are a lot more women who aren t just like her uppermiddleclass by birth , yalelawschooleducated , a multimillionaire than who are , although the latter group consistently receives disproportionate attention in the media ann lewis , senior advisor to the campaign , sighed yesterday as she recalled to me the multitude of i hate hillary press coverage that preceded clinton s landslide victory in the 2000 senate campaign , when she ended up garnering the support of 60 percent of female voters we ve been through all this before , she said whether or not uppermiddleclass female discontent ends up being an important force in the democratic primaries \( and if the past is any guide , it won t \) , the disconnect between the senator and the women who should , on the face of things , be her most natural supporters is troublesome not , to my mind , for what it does or doesn t say about hillary but rather for what it conveys about the women ostensibly most like her i wonder if it s precisely the things that make noncollegeeducated women feel an affinity with hillary her toughness , her independence and her sometime status as an underdog that alienate the elite i worry that there may be among some elite women a certain disregard for , even a certain distaste for , the bread and butter middle class family issues that hillary has placed front and center take her it takes a village mentality the idea that as mothers we re all interrelated and need a helping hand \( from government , among others \) to keep our boats afloat this resonates among women who struggle to pay for health care , who labor to find safe and affordable child care , who have to fight for sick days and for time off for school visits who struggle to make ends meet , generally , as most people do but i ve repeatedly found that betteroff women , who have decent health care , child care , education and , to a greater degree , job flexibility , tend to often be hostile to this sort of communitarian notion of shared responsibility \( do you want the government raising your children \? is the frequent riposte \) they re big believers in the american ethos of individual choice and personal responsibility after all , being the winners in our society , it has worked out well for them and they rightly perceive that they re bound to be the losers , taxwise , if their own gated community of family comfort is opened up to the larger village but that s political what rankles about hillary so uniquely among betteroff women is much more personal at base is it possible , now that stayathome momdom has become a fixture of the suburbs and when wealthy women have bailed out of the workforce in the face of family pressures , that the image of one who toughed it out uninterruptedly , and with little or no publicly expressed angst is less than welcome \? \( michelle obama , barack made sure to share at a momsrisingorg advocacy event last fall , scaled back her career for a while to accommodate his , and still struggles , juggling big things juggling small things and everything in between \) could hillary , the first woman to make partner at an old boy southern law firm , a working mother who kept it all together with a lot of household help feel like a reproach to those who just couldn t hack it \? does this explain , in part , some of the whodoesshethinksheis rumblings that run through the hillaryhate \? clinton made a point , throughout her married life , to keep herself financially viable unlike a rather decent portion of our current female elite close to 20 years ago , she hesitated to leave bill , according to carl bernstein s new bio , because she feared she wouldn t be able to adequately support herself and chelsea this may or may not be true , and may well strike those of us who aren t corporate lawyers as farfetched , but it s also all too typical a fear shared by many unhappily married women except , of course , the most wealthy and successful clearly hillary feels authentic to a whole lot of women who , on the surface of things , have little in common with her but among those who do , there is a sense that she s less than real which raises the issue is being real for a political candidate , in the eyes of the public actually a matter of being true to him or herself \? or is it a matter of properly mirroring us to ourselves \? do we judge as authentic those who reflect us as we actually are \? or rather , do we celebrate as real the ones who make us feel we re who we want to be \?
for some four decades , william d walsh browsed auction catalogs in search of the ancient artifacts that would gratify his passion for classical antiquity from greek terra cotta vases to roman marble heads to etruscan urns , he gradually assembled a private gallery of more than 200 pieces of varying shapes , sizes and materials at his home in menlo park , calif today nearly all of those antiquities are to go on view at in the bronx as a permanent gift from mr walsh , a financier and philanthropist mr walsh said he decided a year ago that it was simply time to give them away i'm 77 , my wife is 78 , he said in a telephone interview who knows how long you 've got to go \? to house the antiquities and make them accessible to its students and the general public , the university has established the fordham museum of greek , etruscan and roman art , which opens today the collection amounts to the largest of its kind held by a university in the new york area , said jennifer udell , fordham s curator of university art the antiquities collections at princeton , yale and the university of pennsylvania come the closest to it , representing institutions that have been collecting for a very long time , ms udell said having studied latin and greek at fordham , mr walsh said he believed that the university s curriculum could benefit from his antiquities collection , whose value he estimated at 5 million to 6 million one of the things i felt was missing at fordham was a recognition of the actual usage of things in roman and greek times , he said it might not seem a propitious moment to open an antiquities collection to public view , given recent claims by italy and greece that some artifacts in american collections were looted from their soil \( the princeton university art museum agreed last month to turn over eight objects to italy , and several museums have brokered similar transfers after long talks \) richard hodges , the director of the university of pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology , said that fordham s new museum was problematic it s a slightly imprudent act on the part of the university , because a lot of it is not provenanced , he said the message that it sends is there is nothing wrong with looting and buying illegal objects fordham needs to be very careful about this but mr walsh said he acquired every piece at public auctions not through a private dealer and therefore hopes that the provenance of his artifacts is clean and accounted for i 've always focused on keeping the auction house between myself and the seller , he said told of mr hodges s comments , ms udell said she hoped that anyone who had a claim to or concerns about any of the pieces would come forward we 're not trying to hide anything and we 're happy to work with anyone who has a legitimate claim , she said while fordham cares deeply about provenance questions , she added , it also wants to share mr walsh s treasures with the public they 're not going to do anybody any good sitting in a private collection , ms udell said the new 4 , 000squarefoot gallery is located in the william d walsh family library on the rose hill campus of fordham in 1997 mr walsh and his family donated more than 10 million toward the construction of the 54 million library and established an endowment for its upkeep mr walsh , who graduated from fordham in 1951 , is the founding chairman of sequoia associates , a private investment firm in menlo park he also holds a harvard law degree and was an assistant united states attorney in new york city in the 1950s , overseeing drug and organized crime investigations ms udell , who began her curatorial work on the museum in june , said the breadth of mr walsh s collection , dating from the 10th century bc to the third century ad , made it an ideal teaching tool she said she hoped that fordham s art history and classics departments would integrate the objects into their courses it spans several periods , ms udell said of the collection , mycenaean , villanovan , classical greece , geometrical , archaic roman , imperial roman , republican , etruscan , south italian there are redfigure and redandblackfigure ceramics , and the shiny black etruscan pottery known as bucchero there is an array of sculpture and terra cotta heads while ms udell said that some of the pieces had been published in academic journals , none have ever been lent for an exhibition this is the first time people will be able to see the extensive collection that mr walsh has built over the years it s really becoming public , she said students will be able to visit the museum from 8 30 am to midnight seven days a week for now , members of the general public must schedule an appointment , but regular hours are expected in january among ms udell s favorite pieces are three greek lebes gamikos , or ceremonial wedding vessels , including a vase with a dish that fits inside it , and an oinochoe , or wine jug , that sits on top the black glaze ware , from around 325 bc , was made as a set it s one of these types of things that gets lost among the splashy south italian vases , ms udell said she also pointed out the neck fragment of a volute krater from around 340 bc that features a rosette motif and a painted woman s face that is somewhat botticellian in its excerpted state , you really get to appreciate the draftsmanship of the painter , ms udell said there is a series of etruscan votive heads , used as offerings to the gods by people hoping to alleviate their suffering or express gratitude for their recovery there is also a series of votive feet in the collection a hydria water jar , from about 510 bc , depicts heracles battling the nemea lion at the top , and , on the bottom , reclining after his heroic efforts in the company of athena and hermes the largest piece in the collection is a funerary statue of a man dating from the late republican period late first century bc that stands about eight feet tall he was a man of some importance , given the scale , ms udell said , and the fact that he s wearing a greekstyle himation , as opposed to a romanstyle toga \( a himation is an ancient greek draped cloak \) there is also a childsize sarcophagus from the second or third century ad , with a lid , which is rare the inscription indicates that the coffin belonged to a 2 1 2 yearold boy named publius livius maximus whose father , of the same name , was a member of a military police unit in ancient rome the father used the child s sarcophagus to tell about himself , ms udell said the only pieces that mr walsh held onto were those that could not be easily removed , like a roman mosaic from pompeii embedded in the wall of his home while he has given a few of his artifacts to friends and family members , he said he was happy that most were at last going to an educational institution this is just a natural evolution , he said you do n't live forever

through it all , almost every red sox fan i ve ever met has just wanted to be normal i m not talking about the bandwagon jumpers of the last few years , the socalled pink hat fans who think luis tiant is the name of an ocean liner , treat yawkey way merely as a place to meet particularly inebriated coeds and totally understand how jimmy fallon feels , man i m talking about the lifers , the ones who have surrendered their summer new england nights to the rhythms of troy o leary and lou merloni these are not fans who ever believed in the stupid curse of the bambino or held the fatalistic notion that their team was some sort of doomed stepsister of history they were not interested in dopey , staged promotions like president of red sox nation they grimaced when ben affleck , tim russert and renee zellweger started showing up at games and giving betweeninnings interviews none of that ever meant anything to them they just wanted to watch their team win , because that s what fans do the history of the boston red sox has always been so fraught with highminded , scholarly dissertations on what the red sox mean that the pure joy of being a fan of the best team in baseball has almost been lost i suspect last night s game 7 victory over the indians , clinching the red sox second world series trip in four years , will help change that red sox fans have taken to calling the 2007 season the possible dream , as opposed to the unofficial impossible dream moniker of 1967 this is telling the red sox are no longer the scrappy underdogs attempting to overcome the evil empire of the yankees they are no longer measured by their relation to a rival , or to history they are simply the most wellrun , successful franchise in baseball right now , a team that wins through heart , determination and relentless talent the truest fans do not care about anything but their team winning another world series victory wouldn t erase the memories of 2004 \( not that anyone would want it to \) , but it will be one final step to finally burying that overblown classification of a condemned franchise the red sox will simply be champions , and that will be more than enough red sox fans don t have to be participants in some sort of greek tragedy anymore being a fan is not a threeact play to win via magic is glorious to win via sustained , lasting dominance is sublime the red sox might win the world series , and they might not , but now they re just another outstanding baseball team , rather than epic heroes in some sort of sisyphean quest they re a great baseball team this is what real red sox fans have wanted all along
all political campaigns start with a script , brace for it to be rewritten by unforeseen events and then adapt , for better or worse but few , if any , presidential candidates have faced a situation quite like s as he responds to audiences consumed with curiosity and compassion about his wife s recurrent cancer while still trying to push his agenda a case in point was a speech last week in washington before the communication workers of america mr edwards deviated from the script at the beginning and end of his appearance , first telling a story , to wild applause , about his wife s reaction to her current celebrity and later accepting a getwell card for her from the delegates but in between , with the audience politely attentive but far less engaged , mr edwards returned to his normal stump speech a living wage for all americans universal health care reductions in greenhouse emissions a timetable for withdrawal from iraq it was a deft balancing act as he tried to highlight his positions on the issues while capturing the attention of an audience fixated by elizabeth edwards s recurrent and incurable breast cancer as campaign events of the last week showed , mrs edwards s situation has the potential to overshadow his candidacy in a period when the voters are forming first impressions that can be hard to shake as the campaign unfolds for a oneterm senator who has battled perceptions among some voters that he lacks experience and policy heft , especially on national security , being defined by his wife s cancer and his response to it is not guaranteed to be a good thing in political terms but neither is it guaranteed to hurt a candidate whose signature issue is health care and who until now has been campaigning in the shadow of two flashier rivals , senators hillary rodham clinton and barack obama what grabbed crowds as the couple moved about the country this week were not mr edwards s proposals , like banning new coalfired power plants that do not incorporate emerging technology for carbon capture rather , voters , union members and the news media were far more interested in mr edwards s yellow livestrong wristband that signifies lance armstrong s determined return from cancer as grave as mrs edwards s or her inspiring pep talk from mr armstrong , the seventime tour de france champion this is how it s going to be for at least a little while longer , one of mr edwards s senior advisers said right now , people rightly want to know about this other thing , and the edwardses want to explain the decision they made there s nothing wrong with that at the moment but then we will get back to why he s running and his vision for change even now , what we want to do is show that he is continuing to focus on policy democratic consultants outside the edwards campaign see the effort as futile and even counterproductive mrs edwards s illness is more than a mere issue to be dealt with on the campaign trail , like rudolph w giuliani s three marriages , these political experts say her condition could pose major logistical problems for a national campaign , while strengthening his candidacy by giving voters an intimate look at a man and a marriage at a trying time bill carrick , a democratic strategist in california , said mr edwards seemed to appreciate that demonstrating how he handles a real crisis is at least as important as any formal position paper on foreign policy or who makes the best speech to the cwa but , mr carrick said , the professionals who run campaigns crave control , and this situation is uncontrollable and outside their ability to influence , which will drive them crazy mr carrick and other consultants unaffiliated with the edwards campaign doubted that things would ever return to normal unless it was a new normal at no point will this not be a very big part of their campaign , he said this is not one of those stories of the day where you deal with it and it goes away , especially because mrs edwards s condition could worsen or her treatment could be debilitating mr edwards s aides are insistent that they have not altered course , expect for the first few hectic days after mrs edwards learned her cancer had returned when the campaign schedule was modified accordingly the couple held an emotional news conference in north carolina they made mrs edwards s oncologist available for interviews they did a turn on 60 minutes the campaign web site reflects a desire to wall off the personal and the political the home page features a photograph of the couple at the news conference and offers links to send good wishes to mrs edwards but video from some of mr edwards s campaign events has been edited to include only his policy proposals , with none of the questions or comments about his wife and voters appear to be compelled by mrs edwards s battle at a luncheon in cleveland last week , many questions from the audience were more like prayers or paeans one woman , bald from six months of chemotherapy and 30 days of radiation , told mrs edwards , i came to feel the inspiration you exude another , who lost a year of teaching to cancer treatment , called her , my angel , my idol , my everything a third , the healthy mother of triplets , said , this is all anyone is talking about at kitchen tables and around water coolers life , health , balance a candidate with a personal narrative tends to have more appeal than one with a vast , though bloodless , collection of position papers , said paul e begala , part of the team of advisers who turned bill clinton from a policy wonk into the man from hope mr begala , now a professor at the georgetown public policy institute , added that one of the enduring problems of the democrats in the last two elections was leading from the head and not the heart mr and mrs edwards s situation , mr begala said , will animate the health care proposal that was already central to mr edwards s candidacy and widely praised for its specificity that proposal , mr begala added , was driven in part by mrs edwards s original diagnosis and treatment , and says to 2008 voters that his focus on health care is as personal as it gets all of these political consultants cited the current yearning among american voters for authenticity and character in a candidate and agreed that mr edwards , without exploiting his family situation , has a singular opportunity in a crowded field mr and mrs edwards understand the power of narrative from his days as a plaintiffs' lawyer who could move a jury to award an enormous judgment with the tale of a child maimed because of a defective 1 widget that human connection was missing from the kerry edwards campaign in 2004 , mrs edwards said at the cleveland luncheon when one voter asked how the democratic ticket managed to lose ohio and thus the election she said every lost job in the state and every unsecured chemical plant should have been translated into a story about a real

it is a short argument , and pat walsh dares anyone to disagree with him the new york yankees' pinstripe uniform is the best in all of sports , and it was worn by the greatest baseball player that ever lived , babe ruth the disagreements are few , especially each feb 6 when walsh dons that famous no 3 and gives a birthday party in honor of the bambino at the tavern his family has owned for 29 years what makes the whole affair so unusual is that walsh s corner cocktail is a long , long way from the five boroughs in fact , it is in a strip mall in south kansas city , mo , and a vast majority of his customers count themselves as royals fans none of that matters to walsh , 54 , because he is a purist rather than a yankees fan last tuesday , as he has done for 23 of the babe s birthdays , he draped the bunting throughout a joint whose ambience is lovingly described by regulars as 1970s rec room he tossed the bags of peanuts , popped the popcorn and rolled the hot dogs and bratwurst on a grill set up in the parking lot with a ruthian cigar clamped between his lips , walsh pointed out how weeks of freezing weather had given way to sunshine and 60degree temperatures then , he proclaimed the obvious , god loves baseball and the babe he pays for the party himself but asks for donations that are sent to the johnny robinson boys home in monroe , la ever since walsh s corner cocktail opened perhaps fittingly , on april fool s day in 1978 the bar has sent thousands to the home founded and run by robinson , a former safety who is in the kansas city chiefs' hall of fame walsh takes his baseball seriously he will tell you the most significant moment in the sport s history was branch rickey s signing jackie robinson for the brooklyn dodgers he confesses to tearing up last summer when he attended a game at yankee stadium for the first time there are no swimming pools or ferris wheels , walsh said you have those pinstripes with no names on the back i admire the yankees' history and tradition it is everything baseball should be the corner , as the tavern is known , has succeeded in becoming what a neighborhood tavern should be multigenerational , comfortable and welcoming to all kinds its library sits atop the cigarette machine and is updated annually with the latest sports encyclopedias and world almanacs they are consulted often to determine the winner of bar bets you always got guys coming in and making stuff up , said david geier , a coowner , who along with walsh adopts the right amount of gruffness to discourage inanity and affectation i 've seen thousands won in here , but i 've probably seen thousands more never paid off we have an eclectic bunch to say the least , everything from doctors and lawyers to contractors and sewer workers if i 've learned anything here , it is that apparently you do not have to be smart to make money the bar also has a fair amount of famous lore the kingston trio once played an impromptu set near the shuffleboard george brett , the hall of fame royals third baseman , headlines a roll call of local athletes the oddest episode occurred in the 1980s , when stanley livingston and barry livingston who played chip and ernie in the television show my three sons were in town performing summer stock somehow , they were persuaded to duplicate the footwork that was part of the show s opening credits as a full house hummed the signature theme song it is the celebration of babe ruth s birthday , however , that walsh regards with equal parts reverence and warmth how can you not like it \? he said it turns what s usually a cold february day into a party for the greatest player who played the greatest game we raise some money for some kids who need it , and it reminds us that spring training is a week or two away

when the national football league s freeagent signing period begins , todd france has a basic rule never stray far from a cellphone france is an agent for nfl players , and one of his clients , cornerback nate clements , is expected to be heavily pursued from the start of free agency , which officially began at 12 01 am today clements , 27 , has made the pro bowl twice in his six seasons with the buffalo bills , he has never missed a game and he has returned 5 of his 23 interceptions for touchdowns this is an opportune year for clements or any coveted free agent to cash in the league s salary cap is at a high of 109 million , 27 percent higher than it was two years ago teams like san francisco , new england , green bay and minnesota have at least 24 million under the salary cap to spend for a player as good as clements , who is expected to seek a signing bonus of at least 18 million , being a free agent this year is like having a royal flush in a highstakes poker game , with millions on the table just waiting to be raked in for an agent , this is the time when you get your rush the phone ringing , deals to be made , all the homework you 've done paying off , france said in a telephone interview wednesday from his office in atlanta things move quickly , and anything can happen the back and forth with teams can get crazy , but that s what free agency is all about france did not make clements available to comment but among possible suitors for clements are the jets , the giants , cleveland , new england , tennessee and washington with so many teams in the mix , clements has leverage , but he also has decisions to make an ohio native , would clements chose the browns over a super bowl contender like the patriots \? if france hears a blockbuster offer right away , will he advise clements to sign it \? or will they wait , and risk ignoring a good deal for a sweeter one that may never materialize \? that is part of the freeagency game , as teams , players and agents try to outmaneuver each other although free agency will officially start today , in reality , it began months ago with teams studying their rosters , their salarycap situations and potential free agents different teams take different approaches some will make aggressive opening bids , hoping to quickly land the players they want others will wait to gauge the market clements and france will have to decide which team to visit first when a free agent visits , teams offer the redcarpet treatment , hoping to persuade a player to sign before he leaves every team wants to get the first visit , france said that can be an advantage right there , making your pitch face to face before anyone else teams that single out the most prominent free agents do not always get the best results last season , three highprofile players guard steve hutchinson of the minnesota vikings , running back edgerrin james of the arizona cardinals and wide receiver antwaan randle el of the washington redskins signed with new teams as free agents none of those teams made the playoffs the 49ers insist their capfriendly position will not necessarily make them lavish spenders on the open market free agency is about getting better players , not the money , 49ers coach mike nolan said last week during the league s scouting combine we do n't have a quickfix mindset we wo n't but when the bidding starts , the 49ers could find it difficult to ignore a proven player like linebacker adalius thomas , who had 11 sacks for the baltimore ravens last season still in his prime at age 29 , thomas could add a passrushing dimension to san francisco s defense , and he already played for nolan when he was an assistant coach in baltimore the freeagent market includes few impact defensive players , which should increase the market value of clements and thomas defensive end dwight freeney of the indianapolis colts and linebacker lance briggs of the chicago bears , who would have been coveted free agents , instead were given the franchise tag by their teams that means clements could become this year s highestpaid free agent for france and clements , it could be difficult to know when they have received their best offer france recalled another year , when a team told him it was no longer interested in one of his clients days later , the same team called back with a better offer sometimes , another player that they thought they were going to get slips away , france said then they come back to you that s the kind of thing that happens asked to name the hardest part of free agency , france laughed probably the phone ringing , he said gives me a headache sometimes but when it rings , it could be good news moments later , france ended the conversation got to go , he said one of my phones is ringing photo bills' cornerback nate clements \( 22 \) has never missed a game during his career , he has returned 5 of his 23 interceptions for touchdowns \( photo by david duprey associated press \)
kabul , , july 7 amid a continuing flurry of reports about civilian casualties in afghanistan , the leader of a tribal council in farah province said saturday that 108 noncombatants had been killed friday in a airstrike the report was denied by a nato spokesman and could not immediately be confirmed from other sources nato soldiers , along with the afghan national army and people from the national police , came to shewan village and told us they needed to search three or four houses , the tribal chief , hajji khudai rahm , said in a telephone interview as we talked , a firefight began and 20 houses were destroyed when the planes dropped bombs we counted 108 bodies , including women and children , he said fourteen local policemen were among the dead right now , things are calm , but people are digging through the rubble to find more bodies also , reuters reported that residents and officials in kunar province said 36 civilians had been killed in recent airstrikes , 11 of them on thursday during a bombardment , and 25 more on friday as they attended a funeral for the deceased hajji shalizai didar , the governor of kunar , said saturday via telephone that he had heard the reports about the deaths , in watapoor district , but had been unable to confirm them because the fighting continued maj john thomas , a spokesman for nato , said the alliance had ordered airstrikes in both farah and kunar during the times in question we 're aware of the reports of civilian casualties but none of it tracks with the information we have , which is pretty extensive , he said in both cases , we had good reconnaissance before and after american and nato forces in afghanistan have relied on airstrikes to help fight resurgent taliban fighters in many parts of the country but the rising number of civilian casualties in the bombardments has brought criticism from afghan officials , who have accused foreign forces in the country of being cavalier with civilian lives they have also accused the taliban of using civilians as human shields

cleveland he does n't swing for the cameras anymore , yet alex rodriguez is still posing even when he s not trying to be a poser he does n't separate himself from his teammates now , and yet rodriguez is singularly greater than he ever was as a solo act in the clubhouse only arod could turn being contrived into a virtue only arod could orchestrate an unplanned redemption do you like the new arod who does n't care if he is liked \? i actually dig this version even though i'm absolutely sure i 've fallen into a pr plan hatched by overbearing handlers to humanize rodriguez in an effort to free his talent from the burden of being perfect see alex laugh at himself and then inwardly cackle all the way around the bases see alex hang out with his teammates and then create a season so far removed from others it should be encased in glass it s not a new alex , just a new formula but in the process of being less processed , is he better suited to handle postseason pressure \? and in his eharmony search for a relationship with the fans that works , has he developed an identity that will help him pull the parachute on his postseason free falls \? the success or failure of this strategy or is it the unstrategy \? started to unfold last night at jacobs field in game 1 of the american league division series against the cleveland indians arod was irrelevant to the ' 123 collapse he simply hit two infield popups and walked twice , once intentionally we did n't swing the bats like we 'd like to , rodriguez said one game but it was n't just one game , not just a quiet night without meaning , because rodriguez needed a hit any hit to keep up the pretense of his newfound looseness for four months , the yankees have been the ones to rev up their muscle cars and drag race over opposing pitching they have been the ones stealing the milk money and rodriguez has been atop the bully pulpit a tight game 1 for arod can be dismissed a nervous game 2 could peel off the mask of the new arod and reveal the old fragile psyche we still feel good about ourselves , johnny damon said unfortunately , when you get down , 10 , in a series , it raises eyebrows but we believe rodriguez is critical to the yankees' survival in the postseason , just as he was essential to the team s revival this season and the yankees' playoff success is pivotal to rodriguez s legacy arod s plan to make this postseason special began during the spring it all started when he showed up in tampa , fla , with a catharsis on the subject that had always left his pinstriped pants on fire the issue of how many times he really and truly has roasted marshmallows with derek jeter , which , truth told , is none let s make a contract , rodriguez told reporters in february you do n't ask about derek anymore and i promise i 'll stop lying to you deal that moment of jeter liberation ended the days of the needy alex , the obsequious alex it did n't mean arod would always escape controversy the tabloids ensured his megacelebrity would expand when they splashed his dalliances with a stripper on the back pages his wife s response \? cynthia rodriguez wore a profane tshirt to a game that told everyone to back off her hubby and they have amazing what a support system arod has assembled the yankees and the manager who abandoned him last year are there for him this season a year ago , in a september issue of sports illustrated , rodriguez was portrayed as radioactive , with this offered by jason giambi alex does n't know who he is a year ago , he was spiraling downward into a 1for14 effort against detroit in the playoffs and facing the indignity of being dropped to eighth in the batting order everything changed this year , with nothing but adoration for arod , for the person and the player he has become whoever that is when your mind is right and your body is right , you feel like you 're going to do it , rodriguez said earlier this season i'm just in a real calm place can you contrive inner peace \? maybe arod has whipped up a false identity but do n't feel manipulated feel part of the scheme fall for him if only to give arod credit for the spirit of reinvention the old formula the posing , the manipulating certainly was n't working for alex in the postseason he needed a different strategy so he went through the season with a freer mind , and entered the playoffs with a looser look alex has changed the veneer , but is his psyche still the same \? did game 1 mark a return of the new misadventures of the old alex \?
the times s gardiner harris reported this morning that former surgeon general richard h carmona told a congressional panel tuesday that top bush administration officials repeatedly tried to weaken or suppress important public health reports because of political considerations explosive stuff , and it led to some expected responses in the blogosphere , as well as a few that might not have occurred to us spectators michael jw stickings at the reaction exemplifies the horrified amusement of the left finally a presidency in full antienlightenment mode i m surprised they haven t taken the logical next steps and come out against , say , gravity an apple fell on newton s head \? no , we can t talk about that while nick anthis , the scientific activist , is in predictably high dudgeon there s no reason why we should be particularly surprised about all of this , but carmona s testimony is particularly shocking , he writes without a doubt , this administration has been the most hostile to science \( and anything else that counters its narrow , extreme , shortsighted , and destructive rightwing agenda \) of any that i know about this will be the bush legacy , and thank god \( for the sake of scientific progress \) it s almost over steve benen at the carpetbagger report is more amused by the bush administration s response bill hall , a spokesman for the department of health and human services , added , it has always been this administration s position that public health policy should be rooted in sound science reports benen it looks like hall made the comment over the phone so reporters wouldn t have to see him struggle to keep a straight face i do have one question , though after years of heavyhanded politicization , why didn t carmona resign as soon as he realized how pathetic the white house is \? still , some feel the white house was only following precedent carmona says he was told to shaddup about stem cell research and the morningafter pill plan b , writes nick gillespie at reason he was talking to a committee convened by rep henry waxman \( dcalif \) and joined by two other exsurgeons general , david satcher , who served under \( cough , cough \) bill clinton , and c everett koop satcher told a tale of political buttinskyism too gillespie cites a washington post article , which noted that satcher was told he could not release a report on sexuality and public health , in part because of sensitivities triggered by the monica lewinsky scandal , and that clinton also forced out joycelyn elders as surgeon general in 1994 after her controversial remarks that public schools should consider teaching about masturbation on that last point , notes gillespie , just think what would have happened had schools actually started teaching masturbation talk about federal overreach ! if there s one thing you don t even need vouchers for , much less a centralized curriculum , it s probably masturbation i imagine that within a few years , american students standing in international rankings would have dropped through the floor dick polman acknowledges the clinton precedent , but sees a more disturbing pattern  indeed , everything carmona said yesterday merely confirms what john diiulio was the first to say , five long years ago diiulio , a university of pennsylvania professor and domestic policy expert , lasted barely a year as director of the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives his parting shot looks more prescient with each passing day there is no precedent in any modern white house for what is going on in this one a complete lack of a policy apparatus what you ve got is everything and i mean everything being run by the political arm it s the reign of the mayberry machiavellis now , those of us who have watched far too many reruns know that mayberry had a physician of its own , dr peterson , whose practice struggled because none of andy griffith s townsfolk wanted to see him they questioned his expertize and were scared of what he might have to say perhaps diiulio s clever line held a bit more truth than even he realized
the achievement of the strenuously lionized british realist painter has not so much been to break new ground as to dig incessantly deeper into the old by doing so he has intensified our understanding of figurative painting s familiar landmarks to the point of discomfort among these landmarks are the figure and its interior life , the artistmodel relationship , the nude isolated on the private stage that is the studio , the arduous process of seeing and painting reality and , finally , the place of the viewer in it all in mr freud s work they all become macabre , even scary mr freud , who turned 85 last week , has managed this in no small measure by painting only people he knows and cares about , while equating flesh with oil paint his strenuously worked surfaces portray bodies and faces in ways that convey a punishing sense of life lived of too , too solid flesh weighed down by experience , indulgence and cowardice his canvases never let us lose sight of the effort required to get the painting painted the rough , slathered expanses offer unstinting views of flesh , thick and folded , or stretched thin over alltoovisible bones , of faces sad or pensive or blank the portrayals are physical but not sensuous , harsh yet intensely engaged the painterly equivalent of tough love again and again they grant the model enormous respect , but no place to hide it would be simplifying things to say that the density , plasticity and color of oil paint provide mr freud a place to hide yet this impression may come to mind in lucian freud the painter s etchings , a riveting exhibition at the museum of modern art moving through its galleries , you may conclude that tough as mr freud s paintings are , his etchings are somehow even starker , more raw and brutal they bring the violence of his rendering style closer to the surface compared with the loamy explorations of mr freud s paintings , the etchings might almost be xrays the best show us sides of the image , like scaffoldings that have been partly draped with nets often hallucinatory patches of lines , gouges , hatching and crosshatching the frenetic marks lead lives of their own while somehow also coalescing to imply flesh , features and expression , in varying degrees sometimes this happens with breathtaking minimalism , as it does in mr freud s images of a nude blond woman he depicted several times between 1985 and 1990 in both paintings and etchings in the etchings all signs of furniture have been left out , and the body floats in space sometimes the coalescence is a thoroughly considered architecture of lines , as it is in the great lord goodman in his yellow pyjamas , from 1987 , in which an astoundingly homely face looms like a small , heaving mountain both images might almost be constructed from fine wire we remain completely aware of the thinness of the image and the white paper just behind it this show of nearly 100 works , organized by starr figura , the museum s assistant curator of prints and illustrated books , is not the first large survey of mr freud s etchings in the united states this one , though , is about onefourth paintings , and the mingling is a good ratio the 66 etchings here only 16 short of the artist s total output are pitted against 21 paintings the paintings offer respite from the etchings without forming a permanent means of escape the wildness of line that etching offers is hinted at early in the exhibition in a couple \( 1982 \) , a tiny work of a cackling pair , seemingly in a photo booth it becomes overt on the next wall , where three etchings of mr freud s mother from 1982 are grouped with two paintings of her from the early 1970s , when the artist s thickly painted realism was just beginning to gel contrasting noticeably with the relative composure and selfcontainment of the painted portraits , the etched ones are a tumult of scowls and unruly hair the most extreme describes the subject s face as a series of ravines and terraces culminating in a rutted upper lip that seems almost cleft mr freud s 1982 etchings were the first he had made in 24 years the show begins with a few etchings from 1947 and 1948 , early works by the artist , who was born in berlin in 1922 and whose family emigrated to london in 1932 because of the nazis' rise his sealedoff , exquisitely controlled , linear manner implied a need for order and a preference for emotional tension satisfied by small , oddly angled , tightly framed images that worked better in paintings than in prints but incipient signs of his obsession with texture and strangeness can be found in man with a thistle \( selfportrait \) , a painting from 1946 in which the artist s steely blue eyes haughtily size up his own reflection the intarsialike stiffness of his thick brown hair foretells the roiling surfaces of mr freud s mature work it took his full attention and more than a decade to bring his painting even close to a genuinely active roil it helped that the painter francis bacon , a close friend , persuaded him to trade his small , stiff sable brushes for ones of bristle that were softer , less controllable and better carriers of paint by the late 1950s mr freud was rendering figures in juicy helterskelters of strokes reminiscent of the work of frank auerbach he then gradually bore in on paint and sitter alike , recapturing some of the detail of the earlier work while making the surfaces more tormented mr freud s 1982 return to etching came casually , when he agreed to make prints to be inserted in 100 copies of lawrence gowing s monograph on his work \( to help meet the costs of publication \) he picked up where he had left off , with closeups of women s faces , but with a new , more physical grasp of line in head on a pillow lines slalom across the paper , defining pillow , hair and shirt , but bunch around the features , casting dark shadows and defining the tip of the nose as a stack of textured discs by 1987 , as the portrait of lord goodman attests , he was hitting his stride you can retrace his progress by following the several portraits of his daughter bella freud , starting with her first appearance here , in a small , beautiful painting from 1981 a series of etchings culminate in a hardwon 1987 portrait where the topographical grandeur of her face yields none of its delicately thoughtful expression in many ways mr freud s etchings gained power from the cruelty of light when rendered in the black and white of etching you can imagine this fact dawning on him while depicting the obese , dozing figure in woman with an arm tattoo , another print from 1987 here the eye speeds past the woman s immense blemished bicep and the halter top that resembles a plowed field to struggle with her nose , a crumpled form not unlike a squashed soda can this show has its dead spots , including three states of a large seated portrait of bella from 1995 that seem to be little more than empty , technical grandstanding manipulations of light reach an extreme in the 1990s with portraits like kai , david dawson and head of ali , whose male subjects might almost be wearing war paint three portraits of men made since 2005 suggest that something both softer and grander is creeping into mr freud s etchings along with two searing selfportraits , they bring the onslaught of his printed art to a suitable

east rutherford , nj , nov 9 behind the chuckle , the smirk and the wink is the old no matter which disguise he uses , he cannot fully hide some measure of discontent over his role with the  the old shockey was the flamboyant , headlinestirring tight end who let words flow unfiltered he spoke the way he played , creating a ruckus and leaving his targets bruised it is that shockey who interrupted a postgame interview after a loss at seattle last season to utter the memorable and biting analysis that the giants were outplayed and outcoached but this jeremy shockey does not do that he admitted last month that he would prefer to catch passes and not serve as a blocker at all but he only hints that he feels underutilized in the giants' passing game his words , uttered with care , dish out none of the punishment that his body doles out on sundays shockey , 27 and in his sixth year , is having a quiet season , and that is not counting his onfield performances nfl rules require players to be available to reporters during the week between games , and shockey performs the minimum a subdued and unannounced few minutes in front of his locker , often on fridays , when the news media contingent is the thinnest this week he was asked , as he usually is , about his role with the giants his statistics have been remarkably consistent from one year to the next with 31 catches and 358 yards , he is on pace to have between 61 and 66 catches for the fourth season in a row but heading into sunday s game against the cowboys , shockey has only two touchdowns , and seems to have increasingly become more of a cog in the system than a face of the franchise just like every year , it s not about me it s about the whole team , shockey said he chuckled , as if acknowledging how incongruous such coachspeak sounded in his voice i'm going to say all the right things in this interview here , he continued sometimes he will wink to send the same message more teamfirst clich s followed and , like that , a potentially combustive episode was extinguished his fire is still there , the tight ends coach mike pope said last week i just think he has gotten a little bit more aware that impulsive things do get attention if they are n't necessarily in the best interest of him or the team he added that shockey had maybe taken a few patience pills along the way shockey can no longer be counted on to be an engaging interview , which is bad for reporters and , perhaps , his own stature as a player but he can be trusted , it seems , to stay free of controversy , which is how the giants prefer it he is more cognizant of the things that he says just do n't stay right in this environment , pope said if they are bawdy enough , they get passed out pretty far in the sports world so i am proud that he has made that progress and some of the things that in the past were just impulsive things i think he is thinking a little bit more before he acts now coach tom coughlin fumed last season after shockey s outcoached comment shockey has been subdued , and largely silent , since but he feels he could do far more on the field statistically , at least , he has not kept up with tight ends like kansas city s tony gonzalez and san diego s antonio gates instead , his career averages are close to those of his cowboys counterpart , jason witten last season , witten made the pro bowl his third in four years as an injury replacement for shockey witten has 45 receptions and 5 touchdowns this season when his helmet popped off after a catch against the eagles on sunday and he ran downfield bareheaded , it was the type of toughguy highlight shockey has been known to create shockey was asked if he was jealous of witten s expanded role with the cowboys this season not at all , shockey said , adding that he was used that way at one time in my career he chuckled his signal for holding his tongue and continued and i'm sure other people were jealous , he said that s just the way the league goes there s only a couple of people that can do it year in and year out , like tony gonzalez and antonio gates i'm not jealous at all there s no reason to be jealous during training camp , giants players were given tshirts that read talk is cheap play the game shockey , of all people , has taken those words to heart it is not the same old shockey just an older one , wishing that his play could create the amount of buzz that his words used to extra points the giants extended the contract of the blocking fullback madison hedgecock through 2012 he was signed after he was waived by the rams in september running back derrick ward \( ankle groin \) and receiver steve smith \( hamstring \) will not play for the giants receiver terry glenn \( knee \) will not play for the cowboys
the first deadline for north korea to shut down and seal its main facility for manufacturing nuclear weapons fuel expired saturday , with no apparent move by the north to fulfill its commitments , while china asked angry officials in the bush administration to show patience the inaction leaves president bush vulnerable to attacks from hawks in his own party , who have argued that it was a mistake to return 25 million in frozen funds to the north koreans much of it believed to be from illicit sales of missiles and counterfeit currency and who doubt that the north koreans will stop producing bomb fuel and give up their existing weapons sean mccormack , the state department spokesman , called on north korea in a statement on saturday to realize fully its commitments under the feb 13 agreement by inviting back inspectors from the international atomic energy agency and beginning to close down its yongbyon nuclear facility and the chief american negotiator dealing with the north , christopher r hill , told reporters in beijing we do n't have a lot of momentum right now that is for sure mr hill has traveled over the past week to japan , south korea and china , where officials urged him to allow the north koreans a little time but in washington , officials said they did not know if the chinese had any indications that compliance was forthcoming a senior state department official said in a telephone interview that it was prudent to give this thing a few more days north korean officials told a visiting american delegation earlier in the week that they would begin shutting down the reactor at yongbyon , where for years they have produced plutonium from spent nuclear fuel , as soon as the 25 million frozen at a bank in macao was returned the process has taken far longer than american officials expected , in part because the legal mechanisms for returning the money turned out to be enormously complicated , leading the bush administration to give up its demand that all illicit funds had to be used for humanitarian purposes but the agreement that mr hill signed with north korea on feb 13 in talks that also included china , russia , japan and south korea gave the north 60 days to deactivate and seal its main plant at yongbyon , invite back international inspectors and provide a preliminary accounting of how much plutonium it had produced as of saturday , the country had apparently taken none of those steps the visiting delegation was led by gov bill richardson of new mexico , who is seeking the democratic nomination for president officials in pyongyang told the americans that they would fulfill their obligations within 30 days of receiving the funds investigators from the united states treasury and american intelligence agencies had spent months poring through records of the frozen accounts , and mapped the banking activities of stateowned companies , arms traders and the leaders surrounding president kim jongil this was the first thing we ever did that got the north koreans' attention , a senior white house official said in an interview this week some administration officials acknowledge that they have few good options to enforce the deadline with the money cleared for return , the macao accounts no longer provide diplomatic leverage that leaves the administration more dependent than ever on pressure from china , the north s main supplier of energy and aid , to force north korea to live up to the agreement nicholas eberstadt , a scholar at the american enterprise institute , said that turning over the money complicates the logic of the proliferation security initiative , the administration s plan to stop countries from illicit shipments of weapons , because it allows the north to retrieve profits from those activities it also goes contrary to the security council resolution passed at washington s urging after north korea s nuclear test on oct 9 , he said the test was something of a fizzle , a subkiloton explosion , but it was enough to win unanimous passage of a resolution that imposed new economic sanctions now , mr eberstadt said , the north koreans can force the bush administration into continuing , humiliating reversals of its policy but administration officials argue that mr bush never reversed policy they contend that he simply waited for the right moment to strike the deal , after the nuclear test angered china s leaders enough to move them from a neutral arbiter to a source of pressure on the north north korea reached the deal , they argue , because china and south korea had cut aid in public statements , both secretary of state condoleezza rice and the national security adviser , stephen j hadley , have defended the accord as far more effective than an agreement signed between north korea and president bill clinton in 1994 to freeze the yongbyon plant what you are hearing , one senior official said , are the complaints of a lot of people who simply do n't think we should be dealing with the north koreans at all among those who have objected are former bush administration officials who believe that the president has been so eager for a diplomatic coup that he has given up his principles and is perpetuating mr kim s rule mr bush s former ambassador to the united nations , john r bolton , recently expressed the hope that the north would violate the feb 13 agreement because it would give mr bush an excuse to renounce the deal anticipating that the north would miss the deadline , mr bolton said recently , one sign of whether we are in trouble is whether the administration will call this a 'violation' or use words like 'noncompliance' assuming that the north admits international inspectors and seals the yongbyon plant and the nearby nuclear reprocessing facility , it would have to move on to disable the nuclear facilities , a term that the agreement does not define ultimately , it would have to account for and surrender all its nuclear weapons , an arsenal that american intelligence agencies believe has grown from enough fuel for one or two weapons when mr bush took office , to fuel for somewhere between a halfdozen and a dozen weapons photo christopher r hill , the american envoy , spoke with reporters in beijing yesterday we do n't have a lot of momentum right now , he said \( photo by elizabeth dalziel associated press

day after day , children are riding to school on aging buses , breathing what some activists say is a dangerous brew of pollutants state officials around the country are struggling to find the money to carry out initiatives to reduce emissions on school buses and congress has yet to deliver on the 1 billion over five years it promised in 2005 to help states clean up diesel fleets , including school buses breathing high concentrations of diesel emissions known as particulates can cause minor ailments like headaches , wheezing and dizziness but studies have also found that the contaminants can do more serious damage recent studies by the and other groups link the emissions to asthma and lung cancer two types of filters are available to reduce the most dangerous emissions on older buses diesel particulate filters , which are installed in place of mufflers at about 700 each , can reduce tailpipe emissions by 85 percent closed crankcase filtration systems , which go under the hood and cost 7 , 500 , can reduce engine soot by 90 percent a bus can be fitted with one or both filters an estimated 390 , 000 diesel school buses are on the road , according to the epa most newer buses meet stricter emissions guidelines and do not need filters but more than 100 , 000 diesel buses were manufactured before 1990 and are big polluters , according to the agency researchers say emissions enter through doors and windows on older buses the longer the ride , the more harmful it is to children , they say clean bus advocates say california is the leader on the issue voters there approved a 200 million measure last year to clean up its school bus fleet but in many other states , money to help schools retrofit buses has been nonexistent in texas , lawmakers created a grant program two years ago to help schools pay for the filters but they never financed the effort congress passed the diesel emissions reduction act in 2005 , a bipartisan initiative that authorized 1 billion to help states clean up diesel fleets but states have seen none of that money the bush administration proposed modest financing for the initiative in its last two budgets , but congress has not acted experts say children are particularly vulnerable because soot particles can disrupt development of their respiratory systems also , children breathe more quickly than adults and take in more air per pound not everyone is convinced that the air in school buses is a threat state representative warren chisum of texas , chairman of the appropriations committee , said it did not make sense to spend huge sums on a cleanup because the science is not very good

baghdad , dec 4 the reduced violence in in recent months stems from three significant developments , but the clock is running on all of them , iraqi officials and analysts warn it s more a ceasefire than a peace , said deputy prime minister barham salih , a kurd , in words that were repeated by qassim daoud , a shiite member of parliament officials attribute the relative calm to a huge increase in the number of sunni arab rebels who have turned their guns on jihadists instead of american troops a sixmonth halt to military action by the militia of a top shiite leader , moktada alsadr and the increased number of american troops on the streets here they stress that all of these changes can be reversed , and on relatively short notice the americans have already started to reduce troop levels and mr sadr , who has only three months to go on his pledge , has issued increasingly bellicose pronouncements recently the sunni insurgents who turned against the jihadists are now expecting to be rewarded with government jobs yet , so far , barely 5 percent of the 77 , 000 sunni volunteers have been given jobs in the iraqi security forces , and the bureaucratic wheels have moved excruciatingly slowly despite government pledges to bring more sunnis in we are in a holding pattern , said joost hiltermann , an iraq analyst at the international crisis group , a brusselsbased research organization the military solution has gained enough peace to last through the us election , but we have a situation that is extremely fragile none of the violent actors have either been defeated or prevailed , and the political roots of the conflict have not been addressed , much less resolved american military leaders have said similarly that their military gains can only go so far without a political solution the primary issues remain how to keep sunnis from turning again to the insurgency , and how to stop a resurgence in violence from the shiite militias mr sadr was able to pull his militias back in large part because his community of poor shiites was no longer under attack by sunni militants but if the broader sunni population is not integrated into the new shiitedominated power structure , it is likely that the old divisions will rapidly resurface as the united states reduces its troop levels if that happens , extremist sunnis will renew their assaults on shiites and mr sadr s mahdi army militia will respond in kind the government has a limited amount of time to integrate these formerly renegade sunnis , said tariq alhashimi , a sunni and one of iraq s two vice presidents the men want jobs , respect , and above all a guarantee that they will not be prosecuted for their past activities with the insurgency , he said , a concession that the shiite majority government has given little indication it will make but mr hashimi asserts that the sunni groups' fight against al qaeda in mesopotamia , the mostly homegrown insurgent group that the united states believes is foreign led , has brought a new level of stability that the government could never have achieved without them , and it is making a dangerous miscalculation to withhold credit there was four years of fighting al qaeda with traditional troops , iraqi and american , and they failed to control these hot areas , mr hashimi said now these areas are under control but this unique experience , somebody is trying to abort i am really afraid what will happen if these local troops are frustrated and are not paid by the government and brought into the security forces , he said i am really afraid they might change their attitude you should expect anything but with the memory of the sunni insurgents' ferocious assaults on the shiites still fresh , the shiiteled government has resisted bringing the sunni volunteer groups into the security forces , where they would have access to more powerful weapons and to vulnerable shiite communities already , a walk through neighborhoods where the volunteer groups are active is an unsettling experience small groups of young armed men guard street corners , while others ride in open trucks in many areas they wear camouflage uniforms that resemble military ones , making it hard to tell whom they work for leaders of local sunni groups , often known as awakening councils , are circumspect when asked what they will do if they are not given government jobs these groups must have some support , said abu abed , the leader of the awakening council in amiriya , a southwest baghdad neighborhood that six months ago was so dangerous that american military commanders were reluctant to conduct foot patrols there now they wander the streets as if they lived there , and there has not been a bomb since august we need support from the government and not just financial support , he said we have made our applications to the police and to the army it has been six months since the government said they would accept us most members of these groups are paid 10 a day by the american military , with the expectation that the iraqi government will eventually accept them into the security forces and other government jobs but that looks unlikely to happen anytime soon the situation with mr sadr has a different dynamic he has long had two roles on the iraqi street he has fought sunnis who he believed were attacking his community , and in the process fueled the cycle of sectarian brutality but he and his militia have also fought the rival shiite political force in iraq , the supreme islamic iraqi council , many of whose members are in the government security forces the silence of mr sadr s militia has quieted both struggles , but ended neither the sadrists have not been in an aggressive posture since early this year , said mr hiltermann , the analyst they have taken the position , we will only fight if we are attacked' but that does n't mean they are gone in the last two weeks there have been several violent outbreaks in areas of the city where mr sadr s militia has traditionally been active despite his militia s pause , mr sadr s two main projects remain unfinished consolidating baghdad as a shiite city and gaining power over the supreme council the real struggle in the longer term will be between moktada sadr s mass movement and the supreme council , which is extremely well equipped , well financed and well trained , mr hiltermann said this fight is still shaping up the government of prime minister nuri kamal almaliki blames others for the failure to reach political accommodation , but does acknowledge the problem and the country s underlying instability sadiq alrikabi , mr maliki s political adviser , said the experience of saddam hussein s government left a poisonous legacy in which the kurds and many shiites still harbor suspicions of a central government the hussein government persecuted both groups and killed many people now the sunnis feel cheated because they have lost control of the levers of power , which they had under mr hussein on the shia side , they inherited a history of suffering so now they are not sure , mr rikabi said should they strengthen the central government , which hurt them in the past \? or should they try to have a strong regional government \? the sunnis feel they should dominate everything in the state it is not easy for them to be just a partner and not the strongest partner it is not easy to get rid of this history , he said maybe after 10 years , maybe after a generation
the republican presidential candidates waged verbal combat last night in the congressional battle over a proposed immigration overhaul , with senator john mccain , an author of a pending compromise plan , defending the controversial proposals in a republican debate in goffstown , nh , and demanding that his competitors offer a better idea mr mccain found himself at odds with former mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york and former gov mitt romney of massachusetts , who each criticized the senate plan as woefully lacking in border security and immigration enforcement measures , including a uniform method to identify immigrants and limits on certain types of visas it s a typical washington mess , mr giuliani said in his first heated faceoff of the campaign with his past political ally , mr mccain everybody compromises , four or five compromises , and the compromises leave you with the following conclusion the litmus test you should have for legislation is , is it going to make things better \? and when you look at these compromises , it is quite possible it will make things worse mr romney , who has been accused by mr mccain of pandering to voters by criticizing the immigration proposal , passed up an invitation by the moderator of the debate , wolf blitzer of cnn , to hit back well , he s my friend , mr romney said of mr mccain , downplaying their recent feud he campaigned for me two times then mr romney pivoted to criticize the plan s z visas as a hole that would allow many illegal immigrants to stay in the united states for the rest of their lives under the zvisa provision , if immigrants paid fines and passed background checks , they could obtain a visa that would be valid for four years and could be repeatedly renewed but mr romney was not completely correct in saying illegal immigrants would be put ahead of all people who have been waiting to come to this country legally if they wanted permanentresidence visas , or green cards , they would have to wait in line behind people who have already applied mr mccain forcefully defended the plan , citing its employmentverification system and its strict citizenship rules for illegal immigrants and he pointedly took on mr giuliani rudy , you just described our legislation , so i 'd be glad to have a further conversation with you , mr mccain said after months of introducing themselves to voters , the leading candidates came into their third televised debate , at st anselm collge , with increasingly wellformed political identities , though polls suggest that none yet have captivated wide swaths of the republican electorate mr giuliani again portrayed himself as the toughminded , bluntspeaking protector of a nation in danger , saying it would have been unthinkable for the united states not to have invaded iraq to remove saddam hussein from power mr mccain again showed himself willing to buck party orthodoxy , not just on immigration but , to some degree , on whether english should be the national language \( he noted that navajos in arizona have a proud culture and use their own language \) and mr romney again portrayed himself as a taxcutter and a conservative , despite his moderate positions on social issues in the past not on the stage here but creating his own mighty buzz because of his relatively clear conservative positions , was a republican preparing to enter the race , former senator fred d thompson of tennessee mr thompson appeared on fox news immediately after the debate , and was asked about criticism he is already facing as a potential candidate it s a badge of honor to get attacked by some of these bozos , he said more so than in previous appearances , the candidates were willing to criticize president bush and his administration representative duncan hunter of california ripped the immigration legislation , calling it the the bushmccainkennedy plan representative tom tancredo of colorado said mr bush would never darken the doorstep of the white house if mr tancredo were elected president because of the candidate s anger over white house immigration and education policies and the medicare prescription drug benefit but the republicans appeared downright eager to focus their collective attention on the democrats and in particular senator hillary rodham clinton former gov mike huckabee of arkansas even introduced himself by tweaking former president bill clinton , saying i'm from the small town of hope you may have heard of it all i ask you is , give us one more chance mr mccain , meanwhile , questioned mrs clinton as a potential commander in chief by challenging her statement , in the democratic debate sunday night , that the iraq war was the responsibility of the bush administration when senator clinton says this is mr bush s war , that this is president bush s war when president clinton was in power , i did n't say that bosnia , our intervention there was president clinton s war , he said when we intervened in kosovo , i did n't say it was president clinton s war
ghoramara island , shyamal mandal lives at the edge of ruin in front of his small mud house lies the wreckage of what was once his village on this fragile delta island near the bay of bengal half of it has sunk into the river only a handful of families still hang on so close to the water , and those that do are surrounded by reminders of inexorable destruction an abandoned halfbroken canoe , a coconut palm teetering on a cliff , the gougedout remnants of a family s fish pond all that stands between mr mandal s home and the water is a rudimentary mud embankment , and there is no telling , he confessed , when it , too , may fall away what will happen next , we do n't know , he said , summing up his only certainty the sinking of ghoramara can be attributed to a confluence of disasters , natural and human , not least the rising sea the rivers that pour down from the himalayas and empty into the bay have swelled and shifted in recent decades , placing this and the rest of the delicate islands known as the sundarbans in the mouth of daily danger certainly nature would have forced these islands to shift size and shape , drowning some , giving rise to others but there is little doubt , scientists say , that humaninduced has made them particularly vulnerable a recent study by sugata hazra , an oceanographer at jadavpur university in nearby calcutta , found that in the last 30 years , nearly 31 square miles of the sundarbans have vanished entirely more than 600 families have been displaced , according to local government authorities fields and ponds have been submerged ghoramara alone has shrunk to less than two square miles , about half of its size in 1969 , mr hazra s study concluded two other islands have vanished entirely the sundarbans are among the world s largest collection of river delta islands in geological terms they are young and still under formation , cut by an intricate network of streams and tributaries that straddle the border between india and bangladesh ever since the british settled them 150 years ago in pursuit of timber , the mangroves have been steadily depleted half of the islands have lost their forest cover and the population has grown today the rising sea and destruction of forests threaten the sundarbans' most storied inhabitant , the royal bengal tiger , which drinks these salty waters and has an appetite for human flesh environmental degradation also threatens the unsung human residents four million people live here on the indian side of the border alone the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicts that global warming , spurred by the buildup of heattrapping gases in the atmosphere , could raise the ocean s surface as much as 23 inches by 2100 according to the panel s latest report , released in early april , the ecology and people of this river delta system are among the most vulnerable in the world it hardly seems to matter that mr mandal and his neighbors farmers and fishermen are far too poor to produce much in the way of carbon emissions they feel the assault already mr mandal stood in his yard and pointed to the water in his mind s eye , he could still see the two islands that have already sunk into the sea and there , he said , on what was then the outer edge of ghoramara , was his old house , and the paddies and the vegetable patch he had cultivated with his own hands now there is only water over the years , as the earth cracked and fell into the water , people on ghoramara began moving farther inland mr mandal was among them he built himself a new house in what was then the safe midsection of the island he wonders where he will move now hundreds of families have already been forced into a displaced people s camp on sagar , a neighboring island , which itself has shrunk by one and a half square miles in the last five years , according to the jadavpur university study even as india prospers , the sundarbans have been left with little to no protection , and certainly none of the measures that wealthy lowlying countries like the netherlands have undertaken to deal with the ravages of the sea every year at least two cyclones pound the islands scientists say the storms have grown increasingly intense , though less frequent the mud embankments built over the years around these young , fragile islands are too feeble to keep away the tide one storm , and one breach , can destroy a lifetime s labor on the land nature did n't create this place for humans to cut the forests and chase out the tigers and wildlife , said tushar kanjilal , founder of the tagore society for rural development we are killing the sundarbans our government , the people themselves , we are all together killing it after 50 years , will they exist \? yudisthir bhuiyan fled to sagar one day during the equinoctial high tide , when the river surged and broke through the mud embankment that was expected to shield his village his house collapsed cows and chickens were washed away the family had no time to gather its belongings for a time they lived like refugees on the roadside , until the government settled them on a small patch of land on sagar , far from the water his island has since vanished entirely he makes his living now as a day laborer at low tide it is possible to see the mud flats that represent ghoramara s vanishing past at one tip of the island is a palm tree that drowns during high tide there are embankments behind embankments , the futile efforts of islanders to hold the water back where once there was mr bhuiyan s bustling island , lohachara , there is only water , with a ship passing by a new mud flat is visible now , just ahead of mr mandal s house , where mangroves are beginning to sprout mr mandal regards it as his only possible salvation , a wouldbe buffer against the tide to nurse hope like this is also to know despair sheikh suleman , now nearing 60 , remembers when life was good he was a young man then , and the labor of his greatgrandfather , who settled in the sundarbans , bore a life of bounty for the family there was fish , he said there was land we lacked for nothing he was a young man when he noticed people beginning to leave the shores of ghoramara the water had begun to eat the land , he said in a matter of two years , several dozen mud houses collapsed and washed away mr suleman stared at the water each day he looked for cracks in his land , the first sign of breakage he built a new boundary wall then , when danger seemed imminent with only 25 feet of land left in front of his doorstep , he decided to move one day it can just wash away , he said on sagar , the government gave him enough land for a oneroom hut and a fish pond he survives largely on the earnings of two sons , who work in nearby calcutta there was a time , he recalled , when his own harvest of coconuts was so plentiful that his wife would give them freely to their neighbors now , he said , she has to beg for a coconut his eyes welled up with tears
baghdad , march 7 for the second straight day , insurgents struck at shiite pilgrims and other civilians across central on wednesday , apparently seeking to reignite a cycle of sectarian retribution as hundreds of thousands of shiites made their pilgrimage to karbala to commemorate the martyrdom of imam hussein in baghdad , a movement to form a crosssectarian political front appeared to be gaining ground , with a major shiite party declaring that it would leave the main shiite bloc and was open to joining discussions over a possible unification coalition at least 70 people were reported killed across iraq on wednesday , victims of bombs , driveby shootings and assassination , according to hospitals and local police officials the worst single incident was a suicide bomb near baquba at dusk that killed 30 at a cafe in a shiite area where young men gather to play games and drink tea baquba , the capital of diyala province , northeast of baghdad , has become a sectarian battleground and one of the most violent places in iraq , even as baghdad has been calmer attacks against shiite pilgrims making their way to karbala for the arbaeen holiday coming this weekend continued on wednesday , though none were as bad as the coordinated bombings that killed at least 113 people on tuesday at a false aid station for pilgrims in hilla shiite leaders counseled restraint among their followers , and mainstream sunni arab groups condemned the recent attacks a neighborhood commander of the mahdi army , the unruly shiite militia blamed for countless sectarian crimes , said the militia s fighters were respecting an order from their leader , the militant cleric moktada alsadr , to keep calm regardless of the level of provocation we would suck the blood of the sunnis , said nazar sharif , 34 , a leader of the mahdi army in the sadriya neighborhood of central baghdad , in an interview on wednesday but we ca n't because moktada asked us to avoid clashes with the military and with the sunnis in hilla , however , local residents denounced the police for stopping them from guarding the roads more closely and expressed anger that the mahdi army had been told to stand down the apparent lack of security on the roads did not seem to diminish shiites' willingness to make the karbala pilgrimage typically , pilgrims carry only the clothes on their back , relying on people along the route to provide food and a bed for the night their vulnerability and willingness to face adversity and even death is part of the religious ritual in which shiites reenact the last journey of the prophet muhammad s grandson , hussein , and lament that the faithful failed to flock to his aid in his hour of need northwest of baghdad , three american soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb on wednesday while trying to clear the route of improvised explosive devices on the political front , a growing number of politicians publicly declared that they had embraced the idea of a crosssectarian political movement that has been gaining strength this week it was not yet clear the form the front would take , but if successful it would have broad implications for parliamentary divisions and the way government ministries are apportioned they currently are handed out to parties , most of which have clear sectarian sympathies most significantly , the fadhila party , a faction of the united shiite bloc , the largest group in the iraqi parliament , announced it was leaving the bloc , and its members indicated they were open to joining discussions to form a crosssectarian front a spokesman for fadhila suggested there is frustration with sectarian politics we want to try to build a new politics that is not sectarian that will include all of iraqi society , said bassim sharif , a leader of the fadhila party but he stopped short of saying that fadhila members would join the new bloc for now we will try to work alone to prove there is a shiite party that can work in a nonsectarian way but , he added , this is the first step to save iraq from this crisis deputy prime minister barham salih cautioned against drawing the conclusion that the latest developments signal the breakup of the governing coalition this is iraq , this is the new iraq , he said there are a lot of parliamentary initiatives but mr sharif said his group was already in conversations with the crosssectarian bloc , which is made up of the secular iraqiya coalition that includes ayad allawi , the former interim prime minister adnan pachachi , a former foreign minister and a coalition of sunni parties some of the key players have returned to baghdad , including mr allawi and mr pachachi , who generally spend much of their time abroad the group is reaching out to try to bring in new members , and at least for now there seems to be momentum discussions about the front s formation have been going on for months earlier discussions involving a somewhat different set of players fell apart after the senior shiite cleric in iraq , grand ayatollah ali alsistani , refused to support any political coalition that would fracture the united iraqi alliance , the governing shiite coalition if , as expected , the crosssectarian front includes the iraqiya coalition and the sunni tawafaq party , it would have 69 members not enough to challenge the united iraqi alliance but still a substantial group that could change the tone of the debate but if fadhila joined the front along with other independent shiites , then it could have closer to 100 members , which would put it roughly on a par with the remains of the main shiite bloc the idea is to increase the sense on the street that we oppose sectarian politics if things remain as they are , iraq will fragment , partition , said maysoon dumluji , a member of parliament from mosul who is close to mr pachachi and is involved in the talks mr dumluji and others said it would probably take another few weeks before the groups would know whether the crosssectarian front is viable fadhila s departure from the largest bloc in the parliament took many in the shiite bloc by surprise qassim daoud , an independent member of the bloc , said he did not expect it , but added that the next two weeks would be a period of maneuvering and realignment he said he and other independents in the shiite bloc would consider joining the crosssectarian front if it forms
mexico city in the 1990s to be an alternative rocker in mexico city usually meant a few specific things you made music about the unchecked chaos of your home megalopolis you threw the occasional lyrically coded stone at corrupt politicians and corporate media clowns you embraced traditional mexican music but then turned it inside out using ska or hiphop or your favorite goth moments from the cure and most important of all you sang in spanish you made music that had its ears open to the world but that could have come only from mexico city a decade later the city s musical ethos could n't be more different thanks mostly to the downloadable avalanche of globalization and the rise of myspace the current independent rock scene is full of artists who may be from mexico city but sound as if they could be from new york , stockholm or paris there were bands that lived by a checklist of what it meant to be a mexican rock band , said armando david of chikita violenta now everyone is throwing that checklist out the window the shift speaks volumes about how digital technologies and social networking sites are altering the character of independent music scenes across the world once defined by the builtin limits of nationally based industries , indie bands everywhere now have unprecedented access to global influences and global exposure for the campy mexico city dancepop duo maria daniela y su sonido lasser , it means the chance to enjoy cult status in a trendy neighborhood like williamsburg in brooklyn , where the band was brought to perform last fall by the brooklyn party promoters fresa salvaje mexico city has one of the most cuttingedge scenes right now , said dulce pinz n , a founder of fresa salvaje when mexico gets its own version of myspace later this spring myspace m xico the internationalism and stylistic diversity of the mexico city scene are bound to push artists even further from the more locally skewed altrock blueprints of the recent past take the members of los dynamite , one of the city s leading indie acts they sing in english , idolize the new york city band interpol and embrace a version of mexican identity that is tied more to their myspace page than to local culture or national tradition the top 24 of the band s 14 , 000 or so friends has been home to a smattering of mexico city alternative bands \( zoe , bengala \) and also indie bands from denmark \( wolfkin \) and sweden \( dungen \) los dynamite s debut album of jerky postpunk , brashly titled greatest hits , may still be available only in local shops via mexico city s top indie label , noiselab , but because of myspace , its music is now accessible to fans all over the world we released our first single through myspace , said diego sol rzano , 22 , the band s lead singer , who was wearing vintage sunglasses , a retro leather jacket and the perfect amount of morningafter scruff during a recent interview at noiselab s offices we got so many gigs from our page , and that was all before we had a label mr sol rzano and his bandmates are typical of this city s new wave of indie musicians middleclass 20somethings who grew up surfing web pages , watching mtv in their bedrooms and thinking about music as a vehicle for instant albeit virtual global connection and for these young bands whose sound may not easily fit within the suffocating commercial confines of the mexican music industry , the rise of myspace has been an invaluable career alternative though myspace m xico is still only in its beta stage , there has already been a myspace m xico band compilation cd , and last week the site was an official sponsor of this year s edition of mexico city s biggest alternative music festival , vive latino as soon as we started talking to people in mexico about launching here , everyone in the music scene told us that we already had a huge presence , said travis katz , the senior vice present of international operations for myspace that s where all the traction first came from the bands were the earliest adaptors they all have a site it s pretty incredible the debut of myspace in 2003 could n't have come at a better time for the mexico city indie scene in the 1990s major labels could still afford to be interested in a diverse swath of rock and alternative acts , but by 2003 they were no longer signing bands whose sales were n't projected to reach gold in their first month or who were n't easy matches for telenovela soundtracks in response a string of indie labels emerged to fill the void , and suddenly it seemed that there were more bands than ever there were more young people making music on home computers , more places to play \( galleries and storefronts as much as clubs \) and more international acts like the white stripes , which made mexico city a heralded early stop on a 2005 tour coming to town most in the scene agree that the watershed moment came in 2004 with the appearance of reactor , a tastemaking , statesupported radio station unlike previous mexico city alternative rock radio ventures , reactor made breaking independent and underground bands from mexico as central to its mission as playing the latest from franz ferdinand if a band has a strong following , we take notice , said ra l david \( rulo \) v zquez , the station s lead programmer everything , then , was in place for an indie explosion myspace just struck the match there s always what we call the mexico city lag , said luis arce , a member of chikita violenta , whose debut album , the stars and suns sessions , was recently released on noiselab in the us there was the college rock boom pavement , sebadoh , even nirvana and now in mexico city we have our own version of that this is our own '90s indie boom , just a decade or so late when it was time for mr arce and his bandmates to hire a producer , they followed the trail of their internetspawned influences they sent an unsolicited email message with a few demos to the canadian producer david newfeld , whom they admired for his work with the toronto collective broken social scene mr newfeld invited them up north , and soon they had an album of muddy lowfi rock that includes appearances by members of broken social scene in previous generations the goal was to present yourself as part of the city , to define the city and express the city , said jorge hipolito , a veteran of the mexico city scene who works at noiselab now that does n't matter so much mr sol rzano could n't agree more when he talks about his influences , he seems almost proud that they do not include any pioneering mexican alternative rock bands of the '80s and '90s when i was young , i wanted to listen to nirvana and guns n' roses , he said , also namechecking the french groups air and daft punk and the british bands primal scream and inspiral carpets i knew mexican rock existed , but it never really caught my attention many here attribute this shift in consciousness as much to the arrival of the internet as to the passage of the north american free trade agreement in 1994 , which thrust mexico into the promises and pitfalls of the global market nafta led an unprecedented influx of foreign , but especially american , popular culture the aftershocks are particularly strong in the ultrahip neighborhood of condesa , which serves as the indie scene s unofficial epicenter you can eat at the 50 friends pizza parlor , buy limited edition nike sneakers at shelter and then stop at starbucks for a latte we live in a different country now , said camilo lara , the head of emi mexico , who also records for noiselab as the kitschy digitalcollagist mexican institute of sound his 2006 debut , m jico m xico , became a cult favorite in american electronic music circles last year the followup , pi ata , is due this spring from the los angelesbased indie nacional and includes a guest appearance by chris frantz , the former talking heads drummer one particularly controversial result of nafta has been the growing number of young bands choosing to sing in english , even if the members do n't speak it particularly well most of these bands claim that it s not a bid for crossover success , but a direct reflection of their musical upbringing we 're more comfortable singing and writing in english , said mr david of chikita violenta we 're proud of being from mexico , but this is the way we like to do music it would be dishonest for us to sing in spanish while singing in english was commonplace for mexican rock bands in the '60s and '70s , it became taboo in the '80s and '90s back then even if the members were middle class \( as most were \) , streetlevel populism was still a primary goal why sing in english if few people in your audience could understand you \? i did n't grow up like these new bands , said joselo rangel of caf tacuba , avantrock innovators who started playing in 1989 we did n't have the internet back then very few international bands ever played here this new generation has grown up with so much information all around them that i guess they think singing in english makes sense for them mr rangel , 39 , experienced the generational divide firsthand last fall when he was asked by noiselab s founder , hector mijangos , to be one of the judges for rockampeonato , a major battle of the bands groups submitted mp3s , the contest was run through a myspace page , and it was judged online we 're talking about 20 , 000 kids making independent music , mr mijangos said , munching on a scone in his noiselab office in his signature black fedora and black overcoat , he is the scene s fasttalking , largerthanlife svengali the noiselab offices are on a prime piece of real estate , a corner lot smack in the middle of condesa and perched just above the shady oasis of parque espa a a former art gallery , the loftlike space is now laid out in textbook coolerthancool minimalism , complete with concrete floors , white plastic chairs and neat stacks of international music magazines we only put out albums that we like , albums that fit with our taste and our image , said mr mijangos , who also licenses albums by handpicked international indie acts like cat power and arcade fire the same attitude fuels the city s other main indie enterprise , nuevos ricos , spanish for nouveau riche the label s cofounder , julian lede , looking appropriately kitschy with his bushy mustache and chemistrylab eyeglasses , plays guitar in tit n , a mostly instrumental band that on its new selftitled album blends grungy zz top blues with electronically minced progrock \( the group was once signed to the beastie boys' now defunct label , grand royal \) when he dons his alterego , silverio , he switches into provocateur mode , taunting audiences over noisy beats , often wearing a '70s perm wig and little more than very revealing underwear he started the label in 2004 with carlos amorales , the mexico city visual artist we were tired of all these timid and bland rock bands who were just selling clothes without even realizing it , mr lede said one of his artists , miki guadamur , frequently performs dressed as captain america , complete with an american flag draped over his back , a gesture that usually ends with him being pelted with beer bottles none of us takes ourselves very seriously , said emilio acevedo , a member of maria daniela y su sonido lasser \( he s also a member of tit n \) that was certainly clear on a freezing night in november when tit n played as part of a localmeetsinternational bill \( including soulwax from belgium \) at a swanky twolevel nightclub in polanco , the city s version of beverly hills mr lede , mr acevedo and the bassist jay de la cueva took the stage in a cloud of spinal tap smoke , then plunged into a tornado of futuristic roadhouse blues that could have been the score to a '70s mexican scifi film a night like that never would have happened 10 years ago , mr lede said the next morning now we all just have to figure out what to do next

raleigh , nc , june 14 the state bar s expert witness on prosecutorial conduct testified thursday that , the durham county district attorney , repeatedly violated professional standards in his handling of evidence in the case of the stripper who accused lacrosse players of sexual assault , and in many of his public statements related to that case mr nifong should have interviewed the accuser , taken evidence from defense lawyers , disclosed dna results that would have been favorable to the defendants , done more to seek the truth and kept his opinions out of the media , the expert witness , marsha l goodenow , said in the third day of the hearing of mr nifong on ethics charges brought by the north carolina state bar , a state agency ms goodenow , an assistant district attorney in charlotte , nc , said mr nifong s actions and tactics during the duke case had harmed the justice system there is a perception that justice might depend on who your lawyer is , it might depend on how much money you have , it may depend on whether you 're white or black , she said , echoing remarks by one of the three accused lacrosse players two months ago after roy a cooper , the state attorney general , declared them innocent of the charges mr cooper called the players victims of a tragic rush to accuse two of the players , reade w seligmann of essex fells , nj , and collin finnerty of garden city , ny , attended the disciplinary hearing , which is being heard by a threemember panel mr nifong is expected to testify on friday his defense is expected to wrap up by the end of the day the panel s chairman has said it may rule as early as saturday , after closing arguments a penalty phase would follow if found guilty , mr nifong could face penalties up to disbarment he is accused of making inflammatory public comments and of withholding and lying about evidence that showed the dna of at least four unidentified men , but none of the lacrosse players' , on the woman s body and clothes brad bannon , a raleigh defense lawyer , testified about how he had made a breakthrough in the case by finding the evidence of the other male dna it was buried in 1 , 844 pages of laboratory data released by mr nifong in october , six months after a summary report had failed to disclose it , mr bannon said mr bannon said he read a book on dna and spent 60 to 100 hours analyzing the data he said that the defense team was surprised he found the other results and that several members asked him to check with experts to be sure they were happy because it helped their case , bewildered that it had not been disclosed in a summary report in may and , finally , outraged at mr nifong after a court hearing at which the evidence was discussed in december
allen snyder , a black man , is on death row in louisiana an allwhite jury in jefferson parish , in the new orleans suburbs , sentenced him to death in 1996 for the fatal stabbing of a man his wife was seeing it took some work to get an allwhite jury in a parish that is almost onequarter black , but the prosecutors were up to the task they used peremptory strikes ones not requiring a reason to remove all five eligible potential jurors who were black \( four more blacks were removed for cause , all at the request of the prosecution \) the purge had a purpose , according to a dissenting justice on the louisiana supreme court , who called for a new trial the prosecutor s intention to utilize racial bias became crystal clear when he commented during closing argument in the penalty phase that o j simpson got away with it' in the california verdict that had been rendered shortly before this trial , the justice , harry t lemmon , wrote in batson v kentucky in 1986 , the tried to put an end to the practice of excluding jurors based on race the effort has failed , and it is time to consider doing away with peremptory challenges in batson , the court recognized an exception to the general rule that peremptory challenges are completely discretionary race , the court said , cannot be the reason but all a prosecutor needs to do if challenged by the defense about the rationale for striking a prospective juror is to offer a neutral explanation that reason , the supreme court has said , does not have to be persuasive , or even plausible here is one reason the court found sufficient a prosecutor did not care for a potential juror s long hair , mustache and beard that is a very different standard from the one courts use in evaluating requests to remove jurors for cause if lawyers can persuade a judge that a juror will not be able to hear and weigh the evidence in a case fairly and impartially , that juror ought to be removed no one is suggesting changes there it is peremptory challenges the ones that do not require a judge s blessing , the ones that can be based on a hunch that exist uneasily with the goal of driving racial discrimination from the justice system the promise of the batson case has certainly proved to be an empty one in jefferson parish according to a 2003 report of the louisiana crisis assistance center , which studied 390 felony jury trials in the parish from 1994 to 2002 , the district attorney s office used peremptory strikes to remove eligible black jurors three times as often as white ones in the two decades since batson , there have been 20 murder trials in jefferson parish that ended in death sentences information about the race of the jurors is available in 18 of them because the parish is 23 percent black , according to the 2000 census , you might expect to see about 3 black jurors on each 12member panel but of the 18 juries , 10 had no black members seven had one one had two none had three not one , said richard bourke , the acting director of the center , gets to what should be the average from death row , mr snyder has asked the united states supreme court to hear his case it is his second trip to the court , which has already once sent the case back to the louisiana supreme court with the instruction that it take a hard look at how jury selection had been conducted the original vote in the louisiana supreme court , in 1999 , was 5 to 2 against mr snyder the nudge from the united states supreme court caused the author of the original decision to switch sides , but the vote in september was still 4 to 3 against mr snyder in a brief filed last month , paul d connick jr , the district attorney of jefferson parish , urged the united states supreme court to let the latest decision stand mr connick blandly recited what he called raceneutral reasons for striking every single black potential juror the invocation of o j simpson s acquittal , mr connick wrote of one of the most racially divisive verdicts in the history of american law , was not racial in 2005 , the supreme court tried to give batson some practical force , overturning the conviction of thomas millerel after prosecutors in texas excluded 91 percent of potential black jurors the strikes correlate with no fact as well as they correlate with race , justice david h souter wrote for the court in mr snyder s case , of course , that number was 100 percent in batson itself , justice thurgood marshall wrote that the decision will not end the racial discrimination that peremptories inject into the jury selection process that goal , he said , can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely two years ago , in the millerel case , justice stephen g breyer appeared to endorse that view , saying that peremptory challenges seem increasingly anomalous in our judicial system justice breyer noted that england has eliminated peremptory challenges but continues to administer fair trials based largely on random jury selection peremptory strikes are an odd and arbitrary historical artifact unlike equal protection , they are not guaranteed by the constitution , and in capital cases where race matters most they would not be missed
washington , march 7 king of jordan made a passionate appeal on wednesday for the united states to take the lead in pursuing arabisraeli peace , telling congress that without progress on that issue , none of the middle east s other problems would be solved sixty years of palestinian dispossession 40 under occupation a stopandgopeace process , all this has left a bitter legacy of disappointment and despair on all sides , he said in a speech before a joint meeting of congress he noted that his father , king hussein , traveled to washington in 1994 , when jordan and signed a peace treaty , and addressed congress in a joint appearance with israel s prime minister at that time , yitzhak rabin thirteen years later that work is still not completed , king abdullah said until it is , we are all at risk we are all at risk of being victims of further violence resulting from ideologies of terror and hatred king abdullah pleaded for a demonstration on the part of the united states of greater concern for the palestinian people a theme rarely heard in the halls of congress he received only tepid applause in return , and some proisrael lawmakers were quick to dump cold water on the view that the future of the palestinians lies at the heart of turmoil in the middle east he is in washington for five days of meetings with various officials , including president bush while he appropriately asked for a resumption of the peace process in the middle east , he was very imbalanced in identifying the obstacles to that peace process , said representative steve israel , a long island democrat , in a statement i expected to hear a speech about iraq instead , i was troubled to hear the suggestion that the fact that sunni and shia are murdering each other is somehow the fault of the israelis abdullah s speech comes at a time when the bush administration secretary of state condoleezza rice in particular has indicated a new willingness to pursue an arabisraeli peace initiative , a project from which the administration has largely shied away in the past six years while abdullah s speech was ostensibly directed to congress , arab officials said his real audience also included president bush the people of the region still regard the united states as the key to peace , the one country most capable of bringing the two sides closer together , holding them accountable and making a just settlement reality , he said in the past month , ms rice has sought to reignite a peace initiative , even arranging a meeting between prime minister ehud olmert of israel and mahmoud abbas , the palestinian president , in jerusalem on feb 19 but that meeting yielded little beyond a promise to meet again since then , israeli officials have reiterated their lack of interest in discussing socalled final status questions that would determine the contours of a future palestinian state with the palestinians , even if mr abbas and the militant islamist group hamas succeed in forming a national unity government hamas formed the current government after winning legislative elections more than a year ago it does not recognize israel s right to exist , and the united states and european union consider it a terrorist group still , america s sunni arab allies egypt , jordan and saudi arabia continue to push for an americanled peace initiative middle east experts say their aim is , in part , to quell disquiet in their own capitals among restive groups angry about what they consider israel s continued occupation of land that palestinians claim for a future state this was not a normal speech , said james zogby , president of the arab american institute , who watched king abdullah s speech from the house gallery he put a moral and political challenge on congress but , mr zogby added , some will run away from it representative tom lantos of california , the chairman of the house international relations committee , attended a lunch with abdullah and congressional leaders after the speech mr lantos said in an interview afterward that he preferred the king s private comments during the lunch to the public speech , which he complained was filled with platitudes calling for a new peace initiative , mr lantos said , is sort of unrealistic at a time when the dominant element in the palestinian area does not recognize the existence of israel
nolan ryan pitched his sixth nohitter when he was 43 then he pitched his seventh nohitter when he was 44 warren spahn won 21 games when he was 40 two birthdays later , he won 23 games ryan retired at 46 , spahn at 44 phil niekro last pitched when he was 48 , tommy john when he was 46 my body was 46 , but my arm had just had its bar mitzvah , john said , alluding to his groundbreaking elbow reconstruction in 1974 fortyyearold pitchers are not a new development in the major leagues , but their population is growing this season has featured a record number of 40yearold starting pitchers , and that was even before returned to the  clemens , who will be 45 in august , is the oldest with his start yesterday he was credited with the victory at yankee stadium he became the 11th pitcher 40 or older to start this season of the would argue that the number is only 10 he says he is only 37 , and that s how the mets list him on their roster but other records show him to be four years older , and even the mets' general manager , omar minaya , said before they joined the mets that hern ndez , a cuban defector , was four years older el duque s age , however , did not discourage minaya from trading for him a year ago and signing him to a twoyear , 12 million contract last november , right after he probably turned 41 jamie moyer \( 44 \) , david wells \( 44 \) , randy johnson \( 43 \) , tom glavine \( 41 \) , \( 41 \) , tim wakefield \( 40 \) , woody williams \( 40 \) , curt schilling \( 40 \) and john smoltz \( 40 \) do not dispute their age never before have so many 40yearolds pitched in the majors previously , the largest contingent of pitchers who made at least 20 starts in a season , according to elias sports bureau , which does n't count hern ndez , was last season when clemens , moyer , wells , johnson , glavine , wakefield and williams qualified at that level wakefield and williams did n't turn 40 until august the largest group before that was six in 1987 john , ryan , don sutton , steve carlton and the niekros , phil and joe reflecting on the trend toward more active 40yearolds , john said what does that tell you \? it tells you there is a dearth of talent john , however , was n't questioning the talent of the senior contingent if you look at the guys who are pitching other than clemens and randy and smoltz , they have captured the essence of how to pitch , he said you do n't have to blow the doors off the wagons to be really good the younger guys would do well to take heed on that young pitchers have had plenty of opportunities to watch 40yearolds pitch this season and even pitch against each other six times , the seniors have started the same games moyer and johnson started against each other three weeks apart last month , each time establishing plateaus for the combined age of starting lefthanders , the second time at 88 years 90 days moyer and glavine have started against each other twice and very likely will again as the phillies and the mets contend for the national league east title johnson and wells opposed each other april 24 , as did glavine and smoltz on may 24 it was the third time for glavine and smoltz , but the first two games came before smoltz joined the 40 crowd maddux and smoltz started against each other six days before smoltz turned 40 johnson and glavine missed each other by a day eight of the 10 40yearsolds pitch in the national league , giving new meaning to the league s old name , the senior circuit no senior matchups have occurred in the american league because schilling and wakefield are teammates now that clemens is returning to the majors , that absence could be corrected when the yankees and the red sox resume their rivalry later in the season entering yesterday , most of the 40yearolds had winning records only williams \( 28 \) and wakefield \( 57 \) did not smoltz had the most victories among the group \( seven \) , and hern ndez had the lowest earned run average \( 194 \) smoltz , at 283 , had the lowest among admitted 40yearolds i would say this is a unique group , said john , who manages the bridgeport \( conn \) bluefish in the independent atlantic league they are dedicated , intelligent , baseball savvy , they take care of themselves and they enjoy pitching none of them , however , have reached john s retirement age , 46 they retired me , he said i sent out tapes to teams i thought i could help either starting or out of the bullpen but no one called , so i went into my managerial career i managed my sons in little league told you so a recent column suggesting that the yankees erred in trading gary sheffield last winter prompted disagreement from some readers who raised several issues about him they questioned his clubhouse demeanor without ever having been in a clubhouse with him \( his teammates have liked him wherever he has played \) , they recalled how he admitted once deliberately throwing away a grounder \( when he was a young , immature kid \) and they said he was past his prime as a hitter for the last point , the critics might have been looking at sheffield s april performance through april 29 , sheffield batted 193 with six runs batted in and one home run in 23 games in 35 games since , before yesterday s game with the mets , sheffield batted 317 with 34 rbi and 15 home runs his slugging percentage in the first 23 games was 265 it was 676 in the next 35 the yankees , vulnerable to lefthanded starting pitchers , could have used that kind of righthanded production something brewin' prince fielder is threatening to be this season s ryan howard fielder , the milwaukee first baseman , slugged his nlleading 22nd home run in the brewers' 61st game last season , howard hit his 21st home run in philadelphia s 59th game it was after the allstar game , though , that howard took off on his way to 58 home runs , making him the eighth player to hit that many in his first 53 games after the allstar game , the 26yearold howard hit 28 home runs , including two on sept 8 to raise his total to 56 he had only two homers in his last 21 games as teams walked him with greater frequency fielder , 23 , hit 10 home runs in 17 games heading into last night s game short on offense if they had not bolstered their infield defense , the 2004 boston red sox were n't going anywhere acquiring orlando cabrera and installing him at shortstop was part of their solution but five days after the red sox won the world series , cabrera became a free agent and the red sox let him leave he signed with the angels three days after the red sox signed dgar renter a to play short renter a , however , lasted only one season in boston the red sox were especially dissatisfied with his majorleagueleading 30 errors and traded him to atlanta their new shortstop was the slickfielding lex gonz lez he committed only seven errors last season , but the red sox were n't satisfied with his hitting , so they let him go , instead signing julio lugo to a fouryear , 36 million contract gonz lez signed with cincinnati for three years and 14 million has lugo satisfied the red sox' desire for more offense at shortstop \? he was hitting 217 before last night s game , declining steadily from a 256 average in april to 209 in may to 133 in june gonz lez was hitting 268 for the reds with 11 home runs , compared with four for lugo good pitching beats no hitting in the first 65 days of the season , teams played a total of five 10 games then in a threeday stretch last week , teams played four 10 games two of last week s games were in the national league west , where san diego edged los angeles and arizona topped san francisco the american league , which had no 10 games until june 2 , had a pair of 10 games last tuesday and thursday cleveland defeated kansas city on a home run by franklin guti rrez , and boston edged oakland on a home run by david ortiz texassize disaster through no fault of their new owner , the texas rangers won the al west title in 1998 and 1999 , giving them three division championships in four years since then , they have been one of the worstrun organizations in the major leagues that development can be attributed to the owner , tom hicks hicks became the rangers' owner in june 1998 after enjoying the fruits of the previous ownership which at one time included george w bush hicks has overseen four consecutive lastplace finishes and three successive thirdplace finishes this season , the rangers are back in last place by a sizable margin after the 2001 season , hicks fired doug melvin , the general manager who built the division winners , and replaced him with the very expensive john hart , under whom the rangers have made no progress in four years an inexperienced jon daniels , hart s assistant for not much more than a season , replaced hart in october 2005 hicks also became an easy mark for the agent scott boras , who induced hicks to give alex rodriguez a record 252 million contract and to give chan ho park , an unproductive pitcher , 65 million for five years melvin became the general manager of the milwaukee brewers and has turned a perennial loser into a team that is in first place in the nl central
cleveland , oct 5 it is natural to be drawn to joba chamberlain , to the irresistible story of the rookie fireballer from nebraska who saved the ' season but nobody expected the bugs from lake erie to care yet they were attracted to chamberlain as much as the most rabid yankees fan , and a sudden swarm in the eighth inning helped derail the yankees in game 2 of their american league division series against the swatting at the air with his glove , wiping his face with his sleeves and covered in bug spray , chamberlain came unglued and the yankees now stand at the brink of elimination chamberlain lost andy pettitte s lead in the eighth , luis vizca no lost the game on travis hafner s basesloaded single in the 11th and cleveland stole away with a 21 victory at jacobs field the yankees trail in the series , two games to none , and face elimination in game 3 sunday at yankee stadium , where presumably the bugs will stay away i 've never seen anything like that , pettitte said it s crazy it s a shame that had to happen in such a pressurepacked situation like that their guy had to deal with it , and he was still lightsout in the ninth inning but that s a shame alex rodriguez went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and has only four hits in his last 50 postseason atbats , but he is not alone in offensive misery the yankees have scored one run a melky cabrera homer on four hits in their last 15 innings , and they were stifled for nine innings by fausto carmona on friday chamberlain came in with two on and one out in the seventh and bailed out pettitte , who worked six and a third steely innings , escaping trouble all night but the top of the eighth ended ominously , with the yankees' doug mientkiewicz repeatedly stepping out of the box and slashing the air with his hands before grounding out it was 81 degrees and humid at game time , and when a breeze died down in the eighth inning , mientkiewicz said , the bugs came out in force during my atbat , i had them in my nose , he said i chased a foul ball after that and i ate about four of them on my way down it was very strange joba had them all over his back and all over his neck and all over everywhere chamberlain was immediately distracted during warmups , twitching and shaking his head , trying in vain to scare off the pests he walked two , threw two wild pitches and hit a batter in the fateful eighth , yet he tried not to make an excuse they were in front of my face , but i was n't the only one that had to deal with it , he said everybody had to deal with the same thing they were bad , but they just did n't show up for me you can look at it a million ways , but when it comes down to it , we were in the loss column because i did n't do my job chamberlain walked the leadoff batter , grady sizemore , for his first fourpitch walk since his major league debut aug 7 he could not find a rhythm , stepping off the rubber , flailing with his glove and looking to the dugout for help the trainer , gene monahan , all but bathed chamberlain and others in bug spray , but it was no use as rodriguez and derek jeter waved their hats above their heads and flinched in the field , chamberlain s first pitch to asdr bal cabrera was a wild slider , moving sizemore into scoring position a bunt moved sizemore to third with the infield in , hafner hit a screamer at mientkiewicz , who caught it as he dropped to his knees but there was no relief for chamberlain , who threw another wild pitch on a 10 slider and ended up on his back at the plate , tangled with sizemore , who slid in safely the score was tied , 11 , without the indians getting a hit manager joe torre , who said the bugs looked like blankets of stuff out there , said his only concern was that chamberlain was able to see satisfied that he was , torre did not ask for a delay of game , and the umpiring crew chief , bruce froemming , saw no need for one , anyway you have to use common sense , froemming said i 've got five partners and myself not anybody , including both managers , nobody fussed about it we just put the stuff on , and let s play it s like a rain situation , almost , except a little more irritating chamberlain escaped worse damage , but the lead was lost , and after rodriguez struck out with bobby abreu at second to end the top of the ninth , mariano rivera came on for the bottom of the inning he was

he drew pictures of himself with angel wings he left a set of his dog tags on a nightstand in my manhattan apartment he bought a tiny blue sweat suit for our baby to wear home from the hospital then he began to write what would become a 200page journal for our son , in case he did not make it back from the desert in  for months before my fianc , first sgt charles monroe king , kissed my swollen stomach and said goodbye , he had been preparing for the beginning of the life we had created and for the end of his own he boarded a plane in december 2005 with two missions , really to lead his young soldiers in combat and to prepare our boy for a life without him charles wrote on the last page of the journal , the journal will have to speak for charles now he was killed oct 14 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his armored vehicle in baghdad charles , 48 , had been assigned to the army s first battalion , 67th armored regiment , fourth infantry division , based in fort hood , tex he was a month from completing his tour of duty for our son s first christmas , charles had hoped to take him on a carriage ride through central park instead , jordan , now 9 months old , and i snuggled under a blanket in a horsedrawn buggy the driver seemed puzzled about why i was riding alone with a baby and crying on christmas day i told him no charge , he said at the end of the ride , an act of kindness in a city that can magnify loneliness on paper , charles revealed himself in a way he rarely did in person he thought hard about what to say to a son who would have no memory of him even if jordan will never hear the cadence of his father s voice , he will know the wisdom of his words charles tried to anticipate questions in the years to come favorite team \? favorite meal \? childhood chores \? first kiss \? in neat block letters , he wrote about faith and failure , heartache and hope he offered tips on how to behave on a date and where to hide money on vacation rainy days have their pleasures , he noted charles mailed the book to me in july , after one of his soldiers was killed and he had recovered the body from a tank the journal was incomplete , but the horror of the young man s death shook charles so deeply that he wanted to send it even though he had more to say he finished it when he came home on a twoweek leave in august to meet jordan , then 5 months old he was so intoxicated by love for his son that he barely slept , instead keeping vigil over the baby i can fill in some of the blanks left for jordan about his father when we met in my hometown of radcliff , ky , near fort knox , i did not consider charles my type at first he was bashful , a homebody and got his news from television rather than newspapers \( heresy , since i'm a new york times editor \) but he won me over one day a couple of years ago , i pulled out a list of the traits i wanted in a husband and realized that charles had almost all of them he rose early to begin each day with prayers and a list of goals that he ticked off as he accomplished them he was meticulous , even insisting on doing my ironing because he deemed my wrinkleremoving skills deficient his rockhard warrior s body made him appear tough , but he had a tender heart he doted on christina , now 16 , his daughter from a marriage that ended in divorce he made her blush when he showed her a tattoo with her name on his arm toward women , he displayed an oldfashioned chivalry , something he expected of our son he wrote to jordan in his journal though as a black man he sometimes felt the sting of discrimination , charles betrayed no bitterness he wrote he had his faults , of course charles could be moody , easily wounded and infuriatingly quiet , especially during an argument and at times , i felt , he put the military ahead of family he had enlisted in 1987 , drawn by the discipline and challenges charles had other options he was a gifted artist who had trained at the art institute of chicago but felt fulfilled as a soldier , something i respected but never really understood he had a chest full of medals and a fierce devotion to his men he taught the youngest , barely out of high school , to balance their checkbooks , counseled them about girlfriends and sometimes bailed them out of jail when he was home in august , i had a baby shower for him one guest recently reminded me that he had spent much of the evening worrying about his troops back in iraq charles knew the perils of war during the months before he went away and the days he returned on leave , we talked often about what might happen in his journal , he wrote about the loss of fellow soldiers still , i could not bear to answer when charles turned to me one day and asked , you do n't think i'm coming back , do you \? we never said aloud that the fear that he might not return was why we decided to have a child before we planned a wedding , rather than risk never having the chance but charles missed jordan s birth because he refused to take a leave from iraq until all of his soldiers had gone home first , a decision that hurt me at first and he volunteered for the mission on which he died , a military official told his sister , gail t king although he was not required to join the resupply convoy in baghdad , he believed that his soldiers needed someone experienced with them he would say , my boys are out there , i 've got to go check on my boys , ' said first sgt arenteanis a jenkins , charles s roommate in iraq in my grief , that decision haunts me charles s father faults himself for not begging his son to avoid taking unnecessary risks but he acknowledges that it would not have made a difference he was a born leader , said his father , charlie j king and he believed what he was doing was right back in april , after a roadside bombing remarkably similar to that which would claim him , charles wrote about death and duty he wrote in jordan s journal when jordan is old enough to ask how his father died , i will tell him of charles s courage and assure him of charles s love and i will try to comfort him with his father s words charles wrote in the journal he had tucked a message to me in the front of jordan s journal he said
boston the moral to the story is , do n't make rash judgments it was only six months ago that batted alex rodriguez in the embarrassing eighth spot in the lineup during the final game in detroit some fans and sportswriters \( let us not name names \) were screaming that maybe it was time for torre to go , or rodriguez , or even both , since obviously something was n't working out with this expensive talent now rodriguez is on a tear that could match any one season that ruth , gehrig , dimaggio , mantle , maris or jackson ever had maybe he will even do major league baseball a huge favor by taking attention away from barry bonds arod did not hit anything out yesterday as the red sox beat the , 75 , in sundrenched fenway park , but he did drive in his 31st run and had a single and double , after his two home runs friday gave him 12 for the season i may have seen a player this hot , torre said earlier , but never with this ability rodriguez is not some fluke , some shane spencer or hurricane hazle just arrived from the bushes , having a hot week this is a great player , living up to his potential at the same time , a suddenly relaxed arod is adding some joy and excitement to accompany balco barry s inexorable drive toward hank aaron s careerrecord 755 homers to his credit , bonds is not dragging out his chase three months short of 43 years old , he whacked his fifth home run yesterday , giving him 739 for his career  but what if arod gets there first \? after all , he does have 476 home runs , heading toward 500 by july 4 , doing what people have expected of him when arod came up with seattle in 1994 , just turned 18 , his teammate , ken griffey jr , was the viable \( and popular \) choice to catch aaron however , injuries slowed down junior and something or other got into bonds in athletic middle age , turning him into one of the great home run sluggers , not merely the superb allaround player he had been now here comes arod , having already won two games with home runs after his abject failure last october , when he had one weak hit in 14 atbats when reporters , none too subtly , suggested that rodriguez was permanently damaged after torre had batted him eighth , brian cashman , the owlishlooking general manager , stood in the silent corridor outside the stunned yankees clubhouse in detroit and insisted that rodriguez was going nowhere , and if cashman had anything to say about it , neither was torre nothing much changed with the yankees the portion of the faithful that wants don mattingly to manage as soon as possible is currently upset at torre for using mariano rivera in the eighth inning friday night as the red sox caught the yankees , 76 but if torre can be blamed for managing decisions that go wrong , does he get any credit for the spurt by arod \? asked yesterday if he thought he had lost rodriguez that grim day in detroit , torre said , i never thought it would have an effect on him adversely torre added that he and rodriguez discussed the move when the yankees' flight landed in new york last october , and that they hugged before parting the bluster to move arod now seems like kneejerk punditry , if not temporary insanity whatever rodriguez did for himself in the offseason and it was clearly more than his normally obsessive physical workout he has come back with a new nutstoeverybody attitude , not that he would say so did torre ever give rodriguez any advice on how to loosen up \? i said to him , take what comes , ' torre said he gets in his own way sometimes but i sensed in spring training that he was having more fun his approach is so much softer , torre said a year ago , you did n't see the fluidity during his career , rodriguez seems to have tried too hard to please everybody , stemming from a need to be loved in february , he showed up for camp and started blabbing about his cooledoff friendship with derek jeter , and a lot of people wondered when arod would give up this touchyfeely stuff still , that admission may have been cathartic , helping him adopt some personal mantra , some psychological stance , that put him on a tear does torre have any theory why rodriguez is so comfortable this year \? no and do n't ask him , torre commanded with a smile naturally , we do ask him , on the hour but he s not giving much away and that s a good sign the red sox fans roasted arod on his return to fenway , as they have since he joined the yanks in 2004 of course , if rodriguez should take advantage of the opening in his contract his price probably went up a few more million this weekend the sox' fans would instantly adore him for his good taste in moving to fenway  yankees fans , note that until rodriguez has a really good october , none of this matters he left seattle for texas , saying it really was n't about the money , but of course it was he came to yankee stadium for a championship if he had left after last october , he would have been a failure , and he knew it what if this dedicated athlete catches ruth and maris , then chases down sosa and mcgwire \? what if this quite decent human , with no trace of scandal to his name , roars right past bonds s sixyearold record of 73 home runs in a season \? he could n't pick a better year for it

when the members of urban bush women took their bows at the joyce theater on tuesday night after walking with pearl africa diaries , they did not look like performers , though all are powerful dancers they looked spent , in the way that real people do after completing an arduous and illuminating journey , one not easily shrugged off those in the audience who managed to keep pace with jawole willa jo zollar s moody epic must surely have tasted at least a sliver of that delicious exhaustion earnestness can be a dirty word in the arts , but you 'd never know it while luxuriating in the seemingly effortless naturalism displayed by ms zollar s company this is true whether the work is a heroic tribute to the great choreographer and dancer pearl primus , or a rapped and hiprolling homage to the female derri re like batty moves that 1995 work has fast become a classic audiences expect it , cheering before anything really gets going , as they do anticipating alvin ailey s revelations the dance gods will no doubt punish a critic for such sacrilege , but i 'll take these women over ailey s church ladies any day of the week , sunday too on tuesday , in the first of two programs at the joyce theater this week , the eight company members embodied a host of worlds , from marjani fort s portrayal of a housewife in blondell cummings s 1981 chicken soup to a helterskelter chase in the premiere of here we go again ! \? this sketch by camille a brown , formerly with the evidence dance company , offered glimpses of what makes her such an exciting choreographic prospect as she sent the five dancers zooming through layered skeins of movement , riding a curious electronic score by anthonymichael alexander carolyn mechka cherry s deconstructed suits and chic hats were wonderful visual manifestations of the organized disorganization on display much quieter was the cummings revival , in which ms fort elaborated on an array of stylized domestic and abstract gestures to create an interior within an interior after a smattering of census figures on households and female labor were displayed , ms fort turned fact into story she was accompanied by a varied score , including atmospheric songs by brian eno and meredith monk and snippets from a grace paley story but none of these works approached the transformative energy of walking with pearl , largely because ms zollar s dancers settle into her lush , africaninflected modern dance language as if arriving home ms zollar read from ms primus s diaries , at one point recounting that ms primus s career has been a quest , a search for roots her urban bush women , though voyagers , know exactly where their roots are , and how far down they reach
to celebrate his 50th birthday and also to benefit a scholarship fund at ben gurion university of the negev , in israel the violinist shlomo mintz played paganini s caprices , all 24 , at on sunday evening as repertory choices for the occasion go , this one suggests either a midlife crisis or a sweet tooth fast , showy and full of dazzling effects , paganini s unaccompanied sizzlers are the violinistic equivalent of a sleek red jaguar but they are also highcalorie confections , like a box of expensive , fancily decorated chocolates the kind that you really do n't want to eat all at once but can find yourself bingeing on once you get started if there s one thing these works are not , it s a set of meditations on the meaning of life yet the set of a minor variations that closes the collection has inspired further variations by composers of all kinds , from brahms and rachmaninoff to dallapiccola and lutoslawski mr mintz seemed to lean toward the jaguar analogy standing front and center on carnegie s otherwise empty stage , he seemed intently focused on the music s nonstop technical challenges these include , in various combinations , zestily rippling arpeggios , melodies in octaves \( and other intervals \) , speedily ascending and descending runs , and chordal passages that sometimes advance paganini s melodies but more often punctuate streams of scales and arpeggios spiccato bowing , bouncing the bow off the string , is plentiful , and in the 24th caprice paganini revisits everything he did in the first 23 , adding variations in harmonics and lefthand pizzicato none of these devices fazed mr mintz , nor , for the most part , did paganini s more telling challenge maintaining sufficient warmth of tone and suppleness of phrasing to keep this fiery music sounding human rather than mechanical occasionally the speed and texture of a passage drained the color from mr mintz s sound , but where paganini provided a singable melody , however brief , mr mintz gave it as much vibrato and honeyed tone as it could bear , until the next patch of virtuosic figuration swept him off on a new adventure paganini was wise to put the best music at the very end of the set by the time you get there , you 've had more than enough , but this final burst of imaginative athleticism is worth the wait still , when mr mintz turns 60 , maybe he 'll play bach s unaccompanied sonatas and partitas instead
if you are looking for an explanation for the seemingly relentless changes made in recent years at the augusta national golf club , an excerpt from a book writtenby the club chairman is well worth reading referring to the par4 ninth hole , he writes the hole was originally designed to require a 4 or 5iron second shot , but a number of players had become able , under favorable conditions , to drive all the way down to the bottom of a hollow , from where an 8 or 9iron second shot might suffice the new arrangement adds a minimum of 15 yards to the length of the hole four or 5iron second shots are now again customary that s the sort of thinking that has prompted officials to lengthen augusta , home of the masters since its inception , to 7 , 445 yards for championship play as recently as 1998 it played at 6 , 925 yards \( to say nothing of the 6 , 700 yards it first played in 1934 \) the fretting over length has become an annual topic , and will be again this year when the tournament begins on april 5 the question raised is a sensitive one has all the extra yardage turned augusta into a course on which only the longest hitters have a realistic chance to win \? there s evidence of this since the supersizing of the course began in earnest in 1998 , six of the last eight masters have been won by \( three \) , \( two \) and vijay singh \( one \) , all bombers of the ball this year , woods , who has dominated the pga tour since last summer , will be shooting for his third straight victory in a major championship , and the augusta layout now seems as perfectly tailored for him as the club members' signature green jackets mickelson will be trying to defend his masters title while still burdened by the memory of last year s united states open his finalhole debacle there opened the way for geoff ogilvy to win his first major fueling the aussie s confidence as he heads into just his second masters whoever wins , augusta s recent changes are sure to figure prominently in the outcome the motivation for change at augusta is simple the members , who control everything from the speed of the greens to the color of the wrappers on the sandwiches sold to spectators , got tired of watching professionals with hightech clubs turn their masterpiece into something that played like a municipal golf course and when , in 1997 , the 21yearold woods set a tournament record by shooting 18 under par \( a fourround total of 270 \) , the members had no choice they had to tear up the course before someone probably woods went out and shot 25 under some observers called it tigerproofing all of this makes sense except that it is n't completely true that description of the ninth hole \? it was written in 1976 , by the late clifford roberts , who founded the masters with the legendary bobby jones roberts was explaining why the course is regularly altered and lengthened when jones and the architect alister mackenzie designed the course , it was supposed to bring every aspect of golf into play length off the tee , accuracy with the irons , shortgame finesse and the ability to putt on treacherous greens i think we understand that we are the custodians of a great treasure , says billy payne , the newly anointed club chairman , who will be in charge of the masters for the first time it s up to us to preserve the challenges of the course from year to year we have to be vigilant and aware of how technology is changing the game that s why we 're constantly evaluating the shotmaking that we see around the golf course each year this year , no yardage has been added in fact , the only two holes that have been changed the 11th and the 15th may actually play shorter , because the tee areas have been expanded to allow officials to move the tees in if weather dictates for all the harrumphing about woods s score in 1997 , he broke the record by only one stroke in 1965 , a lifetime earlier in terms of equipment , jack nicklaus shot 271 and won by nine shots eleven years later , raymond floyd shot the same score and won by eight woods s winning margin was a record 12 shots in his prime , nicklaus was the only top tour player who could consistently drive a ball 300 yards nowadays , almost all the younger guys average more than 300 yards in the air , says ben crenshaw , a twotime masters champion the club , he says , had no choice but to move the tees back the thing is , winning the masters has never been just about driving the ball nick faldo won three times , and so did gary player neither was an especially big hitter though long drivers have won the masters more often since the most recent changes were made , it has also been won by finesse players like jos mar a olaz bal and mike weir , who in 2003 was 39th in the field in driving and reached none of the par5 holes in two shots but almost everyone agrees that something unique about golf at augusta , an element of craftsmanship , has been lost by increasing the course s severity crenshaw thinks the addition of rough and new trees has as much to do with the change as length it used to be that you could hit your drive almost anywhere , and unless you were behind a tree , you could try to pull off a shot , he says it might be dangerous , but it was also thrilling to play and to watch that s what made the golf course unique there just was n't another championship venue in the world like it i think some of that s been lost tom watson , who won in 1977 and 1981 , says the two keys to winning at augusta are where you hit your second shot and how you putt you have to drive well , but that s true on any golf course at augusta , you might hit every green in regulation and not break par if you end up in the wrong places on the greens the greens have always been augusta s secret weapon they are full of undulations and play lightning fast during the masters all that said , the club has added 520 yards since 1998 and has added rough to almost every hole , meaning that wild drives are now penalized even if they do n't reach the trees the fairways have been narrowed considerably , and trees have been added at key spots at nos 11 , 15 , 17 and 18 , again to force players to drive the ball straight in total , 14 holes have been lengthened since woods demolished the field in 1997 in the case of the 13th , the club even purchased a small parcel of land from the adjoining augusta country club \( at an exorbitant price \) so the tee could be moved back the point has always been to challenge the players today the same way they were challenged yesterday , payne says we 're not really worried about a score , because scoring has n't changed all that much through the years especially troubling to members was the 18th hole players were simply powering their drives over the fairway bunkers to an open area where they could go as far left as they wanted in 1991 , ian woosnam hit his finalhole tee shot 50 yards left but still made par to win because he had a wideopen , shortiron shot to the green now , with the tee moved back 50 yards , no one not even woods can fly those bunkers it is n't anything new that long drivers do well at the masters , crenshaw says but it is even more true now when crenshaw won his second masters , in 1995 , he was 43 and did n't hit the ball nearly as far as when he won his first , in 1984 could the 1995 ben crenshaw win the masters on the 2007 course \? completely impossible , he says in the end , you win the masters with your short game but you have to have enough length to get into position to make those shots i could n't do that on this golf course which is a shame , because crenshaw at his best was a joy to watch so were olaz bal and faldo and player the most dramatic shot in the history of the masters in the television era was undoubtedly the 140foot chip shot that larry mize sank on the 11th hole to beat greg norman in a playoff in 1987 chances are a player like mize would have trouble contending today that does n't mean changes were n't needed no one wants to see the masters become the bob hope chrysler classic , where the winning score has been as low as 36 under par for years , one of the clich s about the masters was the tournament does n't begin until the back nine on sunday the reason was that five of those holes had water hazards , and the shorter , more wideopen layout encouraged risktaking that could produce anything from an eagle to a triple bogey perhaps that will happen again this year but it is n't nearly as likely as in the past some call it progress some call it a necessity some just call it a little bit sad
durham , nc , aug 31 \( ap \) mike b nifong , the disgraced former durham county district attorney , was held in criminal contempt of court friday for lying to a judge when pursuing rape charges against three falsely accused lacrosse players judge w osmond smith iii of superior court sentenced mr nifong , who resigned from office and has been disbarred , to one day in jail mr nifong had faced as many as 30 days in jail and a fine as high as 500 if what i impose with regard to mr nifong would make things better or different for what s already happened , judge smith said , i do n't know what it would be or how i could do it reading his contempt decision from the bench minutes after the conclusion of two days of testimony , judge smith said mr nifong willfully made false statements to the court last september when he insisted he had given defense lawyers all of the results from a critical dna test in fact , judge smith found , mr nifong provided the defense with what he knew to be an incomplete report the omitted data contained results showing that the dna of multiple men , none of whom were lacrosse players , was found on a woman who said she was attacked at a party thrown by duke s lacrosse team in march 2006 taking the stand friday , mr nifong insisted that he did not intentionally lie about whether he had turned over the evidence but he acknowledged that the report he gave the defense was incomplete
east rutherford , nj , sept 21 for most of the week , players and coaches have been bombarded with questions about the defensive scheme , possible changes to the lineup and the team s psyche maybe their troubles on the field are much simpler maybe the giants are just not that talented it is the heart of all other concerns an underlying fear , usually left unspoken , for any struggling team among the complex dynamics at play for the giants \( 02 \) is the unusual relationship between the person who coaches the team and the person who assembles the roster coach is in his fourth season nearly fired at the end of his third , he needs a successful season to keep his job general manager jerry reese is in his first season he is meticulously reshaping the roster , now the nfl s third youngest , and balancing the sometimes competing ambitions of the present and the future so when coughlin was asked about substituting players in his starting lineup , his answer presumably not intended as a criticism of reese brushed a broader point the players that we have are the players that we have , he said in the gm , the book about ernie accorsi , reese s predecessor , the author tom callahan described internal episodes from last season that demonstrated accorsi s frustration with the man he hired as coach presumably , the frustrations go both ways there s a natural vinegar between a coach and a general manager , callahan said in a telephone interview coughlin and reese said there were no competing agendas one man desperate to win now , the other building the franchise for years to come the dynamic for me is , i want to do what s best for coach right now , to help him try to win this season , reese said we 're trying to build a team , but we 're trying to win now , too , as well coughlin has held both jobs in the nfl he had broad powers over football operations in nine years as coach of the jacksonville jaguars he assembled the roster he coached he said friday that he is not frustrated by the team he has been handed by reese , largely inherited from accorsi no , we have worked together on every situation , and we are constantly trying to improve , coughlin said coughlin built a reputation as an aggressive pursuer of talent in free agency and one who led the jaguars into salarycap trouble by overspending he focused on quick fixes this offseason , after an 88 season , in which the team lost seven of its final nine games \( including a playoff contest \) , reese and the giants dabbled little in the freeagent market the top of the depth chart looks much like it did last year twenty of the 22 starters in the seasonopening loss to the dallas cowboys were with the giants in 2006 the exceptions linebacker kawika mitchell , signed as a free agent , and fullback reuben droughns , acquired in a trade all eight choices from the draft made the final roster , which is unusual , but none have emerged as a starter although the top pick aaron ross , a cornerback , could get his first start against the washington redskins we have gotten a little younger , reese said but that s not our no 1 objective we want to get talented , too you ca n't take all your old players off the roster then you 'd have nobody to play with at all we took some players off the roster , but you ca n't take everybody off the roster you 've got to play reese dismissed the notion that coughlin would be more desperate to win immediately than a firstyear general manager would everybody s desperate , reese said i'm desperate , tom s desperate , the whole team s desperate the defensive coordinator s desperate , the offensive coordinator s desperate we 're all desperate right now we 're desperate for a win extra points plaxico burress \( sprained ankle \) is questionable for sunday s game if he does not play , anthony mix or sinorice moss will get the start opposite amani toomer linebacker antonio pierce said he was sorry if the air horn he blew during interviews with reporters on thursday scared anyone , but dismissed news of criticism he earned from the likes of tiki barber and shannon sharpe , who said during radio shows that it showed a lack of respect for reporters and fans do they play for the new york giants \? pierce asked of barber and sharpe then i have nothing to say
a federal judge in gave the first legal endorsement yesterday to rules in california , being copied in 13 other states , that intend to reduce greenhouse gases emitted by automobiles and light trucks ruling in a lawsuit against vermont s standards on those heattrapping gases , the judge , william k sessions iii , rejected a variety of challenges from auto manufacturers , including their contention that the states were usurping federal authority the ruling follows a decision by the united states supreme court in april that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate heattrapping gases like carbon dioxide as air pollutants the ruling in vermont explicitly endorses the idea that california has the right to set its own regulations on the gases , and that other states , like vermont , have the right to follow its lead judge sessions ruled that the auto manufacturers had not proved their claims that compliance with the rules in vermont clones of the groundbreaking standards adopted in california was not feasible nor , he wrote of vermont s regulatory framework , have they demonstrated that it will limit consumer choice , create economic hardship for the automobile industry , cause significant job loss or undermine safety the judge also rejected a claim that vermont s standards would intrude into the sphere of foreign policy , which is the unique province of the federal government though the ruling by judge sessions did not deal directly with the california law , it is expected to embolden efforts in california a state with a threedecade history of subduing polluting industries and serving as a template for other states to further reduce the emissions that many scientists say contribute to  in 2002 , california adopted the first state law requiring auto manufacturers to begin reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other heattrapping gases in 2004 , it set standards for emission reductions vermont adopted the same standards , as did other states , including connecticut , new jersey , new york and pennsylvania automakers sued to block the standards in vermont and california the vermont lawsuit led to a trial in may and judge sessions s ruling on wednesday the california case is pending the federal clean air act gives california the unique authority to set its own emissions standards and allows other states to adopt california s rules instead of the federal rules but the california standards require a waiver from the environmental protection agency a request for a waiver in the case of the emission standards was made in december 2005 , and the epa administrator has said he will make a decision by the end of this year none of the state rules will take effect unless a waiver is granted david doniger , a lawyer with the natural resources defense council , an environmental advocacy group that supports the state standards , predicted that judge sessions s ruling would put a lot more pressure on epa to grant the waiver in a statement posted on the web site of the alliance of automobile manufacturers , which brought the lawsuit , dave mccurdy , the group s president , said an appeal was being considered mr mccurdy also said , the alliance remains committed to working with policy makers to make certain that the epa s judgment is based on credible , sound scientific data as to what policies truly impact california , its citizens and global climate concerns among other things , wednesday s opinion includes a lengthy analysis of why the federal transportation department s authority over fueleconomy standards does not prevent states from adopting california s controls over vehicle emissions one central reason , judge sessions said , is that the california standards cover more than just fuel economy they deal with carbon dioxide emissions , which are closely correlated with fuel economy , as well as other heattrapping gases , including those in automobile airconditioning units , which are not tied to fuel economy the district court s opinion is a sweeping rejection of the auto industry s claim that california and other states lack authority to regulate heattrapping gases , richard j lazarus , a law professor at georgetown university , said in an email message professor lazarus added that the ruling by the supreme court in april that the environmental protection agency had authority to regulate such emissions plainly emboldened judge sessions , who takes the further step of endorsing an actual exercise of such authority by the states but patrick a parenteau , a professor at the vermont law school , noted that the decision might have jumped the gun , legally speaking , because the vermont rules , pending the epa ruling on a waiver , have not yet taken effect an appeals court could rule that judge sessions was premature in deciding the case in legal parlance , that it was not ripe but , while the question of ripeness could upend the vermont case , the decision gives psychological momentum to the states aligned with california , which include arizona , florida , maine , maryland , massachusetts , new mexico , oregon , rhode island and washington under the california law , the emissions reductions for cars in the 2016 model year could be 30 percent or more below current levels california regulators have required that by 2012 emissions from cars and light trucks be reduced by 25 percent from 2005 levels for larger trucks and sport utility vehicles , cuts of 18 percent were required experts from the auto industry testified in the vermont case that , because of the engineering and economic difficulties associated with meeting these goals , few if any of their cars and trucks would be sold in vermont by 2016 the judge noted many of the emerging technologies for reducing gasoline consumption and questioned the automakers' pessimism it is improbable , he wrote , that an industry that prides itself on its modernity , flexibility and innovativeness will be unable to meet the requirements of the regulation , especially with the range of technological possibilities and alternatives currently before it he was also skeptical of an industry expert s claim that 65 , 000 jobs would be lost nationwide if california and its allies prevailed
the scene has become a fixture in the nhl playoffs a referee standing outside the penalty box , a phone receiver pressed to his ear the result of a video review puts the arena crowd , a television audience and two teams in technological purgatory the have found themselves in that anxious position in the past two games against the buffalo s near goal with 17 seconds left was the crucial turn in the rangers' victory tuesday , two days after a rangers goal was disallowed because video review determined the puck was kicked in we tell our video goal judges , if you see something questionable around the net , review it , colin campbell , the nhl senior vice president and director of hockey operations , said last night in a telephone interview from toronto in the past , so many of those things would have gone undetected the nhl has used replay since 1991 , the first of the major leagues to turn to it it comes under the most scrutiny in playoff games the rangers know that all too well a review granted them a seriesclinching goal by matt cullen off the crossbar in the fourth game against atlanta in the first round buffalo scored a goal in game 1 that was confirmed via video the rangers had a goal by defenseman karel rachunek disallowed in game 3 because it was determined that he kicked the puck into the net a video review on tuesday ruled that buffalo center daniel bri re s shot had not crossed goalie henrik lundqvist s goal line to tie the score in the final seconds the rangers escaped with a tied series , which is headed buffalo for game 5 tomorrow night afterward , both teams shrugged at the decision that s hockey , rangers coach tom renney said buffalo coach lindy ruff said , we 've had some good reviews before the playoffs started , campbell conducted a conference call with the league s general managers and coaches he told them he knew people would be unhappy about some of the video review decisions , but assured them that the league would treat every one seriously and independently video review is used in three cases to determine whether a puck has entirely crossed the goal line to determine whether a goal has been batted in with a high stick , above crossbar level or to rule whether it was propelled in with a skate with a distinct kicking motion or by another part of the body illegally we 've had two of those in the buffalonew york series , but we have n't had a high stick yet , campbell said we 'll probably have that friday night the process is triggered either by the referee on the ice who either calls it a goal or no goal based on what he saw and then requests the review if it is close or by the video replay official watching in the arena that official immediately contacts the nhl operations crew , which is monitoring every game in a room in toronto either campbell or mike murphy , senior vice president for hockey operations , is in that room for every game they watch all available angles of the goal in question , make a decision and relay it to the onice official with the phone pressed to his ear what is amazing to me is , how many pucks went in the net , how many things happened that we did n't see before video replay , campbell said in hockey , things happen so fast when you slow it down , it s amazing what you see the process , though , is dependent on the technology at hand the review is done off the television feeds available , making them reliant upon the camera angles and skill of the technical crew if those camera feeds are being recorded by a tivo machine , which many are , they cannot be shown in the type of slow motion that a television truck recording has , so some highspeed plays are lost in tuesday s game , campbell said they had the best available situation because the overhead shots were from highdefinition cameras but none of them provided a picture that showed the puck entirely over the goal line we 've tried to perfect it , or at least make it as flawless as possible , campbell said but there s always going to be judgment involved the technology has improved and fewer calls are dependent on lowbudget television feeds in the conference finals and stanley cup finals , the nhl installs tiny cameras on the inside of the goals to help make the calls the league does not do it earlier because technicians are required to constantly monitor and fix those cameras , which get jostled and hit by pucks the process has improved from the days when campbell was the coach of the rangers in the mid1990s , where video review played a role in several goals in the team s playoff drive in 1997 it s much better now , campbell said but when you 're the coach , you 're still just hoping it goes your way
these days a night at the museum is one of the hottest tickets in new york but do n't be misled this is not the hit movie in which ben stiller plays a security guard at a fictionalized , only to discover that the fossils and specimens come to life at dusk , racing and rampaging through the galleries this is a real overnight at the actual museum , and the racers and rampagers are not tyrannosaurus rex skeletons and bloodthirsty barbarians , but kids on saturday the museum began its night at the museum for children 8 to 12 \( and their required accompanying adults \) , a camping experience well suited to urbanites you get a cot for your sleeping bag , the snoozing is indoors in the milstein hall of ocean life and the wild creatures , while plentiful , are mostly stuffed the sleepover , said ellen v futter , the museum s president , is a longedfor revival of a program abandoned years ago \( she is n't sure why \) it s really a coincidence with the movie , she said of course the movie made it eminently ripe in a nod to the film , which features exterior shots of the museum but none of its interiors , the goodie bag for campers has a sheet describing which objects seen in the movie can actually be found in the galleries \( an easter island head and a crosssection of a giant sequoia , for example \) and which cannot \( sacagawea and attila the hun , for starters \) but as a visit on saturday proved , the night at the museum sleepover is n't really about the movie the experience starts with a 5 45 checkin and a brief orientation lights go out at 12 15 am in between is a mix of activities and free exploration one of the favorite scheduled stops is the butterfly conservatory , where some of the 500 or so residents often alight on guests at 9 30 campers go on the flashlight fossil exploration , investigating the darkened dinosaur galleries a few strobe lights give the place a bit of a dinodisco atmosphere something like a scavenger hunt , this activity includes booklets with clues and questions a typical entry just past the t rex is an allosaurus what skeleton is this large meateater standing over \? it s cool , said sophia berenato , 9 , of manhattan , even though she had n't found any of the species described but she and her newfound 8yearold friends , raina shoen thomas and ashley beere , made their own adventures we started playing this time game where we pretended we were going back millions of years ago , sophia said the exploratory phase of the sleepover ends with a bang , a big one a visit to the rose center for earth and space to watch cosmic collisions , a multimedia show about the formation of the universe the museum counters the astral chaos with bedtime stories and its own version of the late show back at milstein hall a film about dolphins just one promised commodity may prove elusive sleep
raleigh , nc , june 16 in a case that has brought one surprise after another , a disciplinary hearing panel found michael b nifong , the durham county district attorney , guilty today of ethical violations while pressing a false accusation of sexual assault against three former duke university lacrosse players the panel then ruled that mr nifong should be disbarred but the ruling was almost an anticlimax to the case because in the penalty phase of the fiveday ethics hearing , david freedman , one of mr nifong s lawyers , told the panel that mr nifong believed that disbarment was the appropriate punishment in this case the state also said it felt disbarment was appropriate after deliberating for less than an hour , the panel stated that any punishment short of disbarment would not be appropriate in the case in a lengthy statement , f lane williamson , chairman of the disciplinary committee , said that mr nifong had received due process , and that s what was nearly hijacked in the case of the duke lacrosse defendants six of the charges against mr nifong involved dishonesty , fraud , deceit or misrepresentation , the most serious of the accusations against mr nifong the developments come a day after mr nifong said in tearful testimony that he will voluntarily resign from office even though he insisted he had not lied about evidence , the most serious charges against him while the panel was deliberating , mr freedman said of his client , he just wants this over and that he was absolutely devastated mr freedman said mr nifong believes he s received a fair hearing and he accepts the findings of the commission david c evans , the father of one of the lacrosse players , said my reaction is we take no pleasure in this and that people should realize that the north carolina criminal justice system is strong we 've got the north carolina bar association presenting this case and the north carolina attorney general making a fair and independent investigation north carolina gives enormous discretion to their local prosecutors this is a case where the local prosecutor systematically abused that discretion and that trust in closing arguments on friday , doug brock , attorney for the north carolina state bar , the state agency bringing the case , said , from his very first involvement in this case , mr nifong weaved a web of deception , which continued up to this hearing mr brock called the prosecutor a minister of injustice who had hurt the duke lacrosse players , their families , real victims of sexual assault , and the reputations of lawyers , prosecutors and the justice system mr brock said mr nifong had immediately embarked on an unprecedented local state and national media barrage with loaded words like reprehensible , unconscionable and deep racial motivation and he said he had hidden evidence showing at least four unidentified males had left dna on the accuser s body and clothes , but none of the lacrosse players in closing arguments , one of mr nifong s attorneys , dudley witt , said he was an oldschool prosecutor who had never dealt with the media and never had a dna report other than from the state laboratory while admitting many mistakes , including inattention to the unknown dna matches , mr witt said , he s a very truthful guy it is egregious mistakes , multiple egregious mistakes , but it is not intentional conduct , mr witt said david freedman , another attorney for mr nifong , argued that he had a long history of ethical behavior and his handling of the dna report showed carelessness but no attempt at all to cover it up mr freedman said mr nifong , 56 , a prosecutor for nearly 29 years , would have never risked his law license and career on hiding dna evidence that he knew the defense would find f lane williamson , chairman of the ethics panel , responded that there is no rational explanation sometimes for unethical or illegal behavior i do n't know if we 'll ever know , he said mr nifong had admitted earlier this week to ethical violations in his media and public comments in the early weeks of the case closing arguments on that issue focused on his motives did he give dozens of media interviews to pressure witnesses to come forward as he claimed or to improve his political prospects \? mr brock , the bar prosecutor , said a poll by mr nifong s political opponent in the election for district attorney showed mr nifong was trailing , by 20 percent to 37 percent , on march 27 , 2006 , the day the police first briefed him on the case but he went on to win , by 45 percent to 42 percent , after all the media attention mr witt , the defense lawyer , said mr nifong was a career assistant district attorney who had only assumed the top job , by appointment , a year before the lacrosse case and had no experience with the media he said mr nifong had no political motives if he had , mr witt said , he would have dropped the charges after winning a primary election in may 2006 instead of keeping them as writein candidates emerged for the general election all three of the former players david evans , 24 , who now works as an investment banker for morgan stanley on wall street collin finnerty , 20 , of garden city , ny and reade w seligmann , 21 , of essex fells , nj are attending the trial today for closing arguments and the penalty phase they were accused by a stripper the team had hired for a party on march 13 mr nifong said her accusation and identification were the main reasons he filed the case he said most police officers and the sexual assault nurse believed the woman , but there was no other evidence mr nifong says he agreed with the attorney general s decision to drop the case the case touched nerves of race , class and privilege , fueled by mr nifong s public comments in a weeklong series of media interviews

they have also said the paper gave moveon favored treatment by charging it a discount rate , even though it ran the ad on the day that moveon wanted , which should have cost it more , and by giving the ad top positioning steph jespersen , director of advertising acceptability at the times , said that accepting an ad does not in any way reflect the official position of the new york times nor do we need to agree or endorse our advertiser s message or opinion he said that the advertising department accepts ads from across the political spectrum and accepted the moveon ad , because it met the department s standards the group was charged the paper s normal rate for standby ads we only decline or alter an opinion ad when the message is clearly discriminatory , illegal , libelous or hate speech , mr jespersen said in an online conversation with times readers he said in a telephone interview later that in the moveon ad , the phrase betray us was posed as a question and was therefore not perceived as libelous he also said in his online conversation that the advertising department accepted the ad because it is our ongoing desire to keep our advertising columns as open as possible to the public , which we believe is a first amendment responsibility moveon has said it paid 65 , 000 for the ad while the times does not discuss its fees for specific ads , it has said it charges 65 , 000 for fullpage , blackandwhite advocacy ads that run on a sevenday standby basis that means that while the client can express a preference that the ad run on a certain day , there is no guarantee that it will if a client specifies the day , the cost is higher 181 , 000 with an 8 percent discount for a fullpage ad , or about 167 , 000 the lower cost of such ads reflects the flexibility that gives us , mr jespersen said of the sevenday window any political or advocacy group calling up today to request a standby ad would be quoted the same rate that moveonorg paid rudolph w giuliani , a republican presidential candidate who is among those who criticized the moveon ad , paid the same rate for his own advocacy ad that ran in the friday editions of the times the price is even less , about 51 , 000 , if an advertiser will accept a 14day window in which an ad might run the times offers about 30 different prices for ads , depending on their size , placement , color , timing and whether the advertiser is a highvolume customer there are no standby rates for color ads because the presses cannot accommodate color on short notice critics have said that the moveon ad , which ran last monday , was not subject to standby rules because it used the word today in the text , suggesting advance knowledge that the ad would run on monday , when general petraeus began his testimony to congress but mr jespersen said that the advertising department routinely notifies advertisers a day in advance that the ad will run in the next day s paper and at that point , he said , the advertiser can make minor changes in the text the giuliani campaign was notified the day that it sought to place its ad that it would be running the next day among the critics has been the american spectator , which wrote the new york times in the past has rejected advocacy ads from swift boat veterans for truth , as well as from the national right to life committee , despite the fact that both would have qualified for the same special advocacy , stand by rates mr jespersen said in the telephone interview that the advertising department had rejected a righttolife ad because it contained an illustration that did not meet the paper s standards of taste it had nothing to do with the message of the group , he said as for the swift boat veterans group , which in the 2004 presidential campaign questioned senator john kerry s military record , it never tried to place an ad with the new york times , according to mike russell , communications director for the swift boat group there was never an effort to mock up an ad for the new york times and there was never any refusal for any ad copy because none was submitted , mr russell said mr jespersen estimated that the advertising department turns down perhaps two or three percent of ads that are submitted each year the department usually explains why the ad is rejected , he said , and the advertiser sometimes makes changes to meet the standards critics have also complained that moveon received favored treatment because its ad was put in a top spot in the newspaper the ad ran on page 25 of the a section mr giuliani s ad ran on page 9 of the a section advertisers generally consider the front of a section or back of a section to be the most valuable spot in papers like the times , which does not run ads on its front page the nextmost valuable spot is page 3 of the a section , which is the first inside page that most readers see in the times , that spot has long been occupied by tiffany

giuliani i ca n't comment on fred i can tell you that george will wrote a couple of years back , toward the end of my time of being mayor of new york city , that i ran the most conservative government in the united states in the last 50 or 60 years so i would think that was a pretty good indication of the things that he was drawing on i brought down crime more than anyone in this country maybe in the history of this country while i was mayor of new york city giuliani i brought down taxes , 9 billion , cut them 23 times i balanced the budget that was perennially out of balance removed 23 billion surpluses deficits and replaced them with surpluses so there were many i drove pornography out of times square there were many , many things about my governing of new york that particularly in that environment one of the most liberal cities in the country i had more success than anyone ever thought i could have with a city council that was 45 democrats and , i think it was , six republicans then it went down to five at one point giuliani so i think that was a pretty darn good conservative record i think , in every case , you can always find one exception or two to someone being absolutely conservative or absolutely this or absolutely that , but i think i had a heck of a lot of conservative results wallace governor romney , senator thompson says that you run to the left of teddy kennedy in 1994 , that you were proudly prochoice , as recently as 2005 , and that his philosophy does n't depend on geography who is more conservative you or fred thompson \? romney you know , this is a critical time for our nation and fore our party we have to decide which direction we 're going to head and , in my view , we 're going to have to bring together the same coalition that ronald reagan put together conservatives fiscally , conservatives from a military standpoint and conservatives socially romney and i believe that a candidate and all of us here are republicans , all of us are trying to put together that same coalition , but it s essential that the strength of the house ronald reagan built is going to lead us to become the successful nation that we 've always been , and our party to be successful because we 're not going to we 're not going to keep hillary clinton out of the white house by acting like hillary clinton now , i'm proud of my record not just of the words , but of the record of the governor of massachusetts like mayor giuliani i had a tough state to be running in i was a conservative republican in a very democrat state my legislature , 85 percent democrat we face a 3 billion budget gap we solved it without raising taxes , without adding debt we solved the problem in health care in our state not by having government take it over , the way hillary clinton would with private freeenterprise approaches my approach , i believe , is best for our nation \( applause \) wallace senator senator thompson , have these two guys convinced you that you 're wrong and that , in fact , they are both consistent conservatives \? thompson well , we 've got an hour and a half maybe they can work on it \( laughter \) but , they \( applause \) actually , mitt , i did n't know there was any room to the left of ted kennedy , but maybe there \( laughter \) in fact , i did n't know there was any room to the right of him , either , but maybe \( laughter \) i was conservative as soon as i put down conscience of a conservative when i was in the college i came back to a little home town of lawrenceburg , tennessee , started the first young republicans club in eight years in eight years in the united states senate , i fought for tax cuts , a balanced budget , and welfare reform , all of which we achieved , and i also fought for judges who would abide by the constitution and the law and not make it up as they went along \( applause \) all that time , i compiled a 100 percent prolife voting record now , both of \( applause \) they 're only giving me a minute here so both of these gentlemen have done some good things in their respective jobs they 've had but you mentioned mayor giuliani first mayor giuliani believes in federal funding for abortion he believes in sanctuary cities he s for gun control he supported mario cuomo , a liberal democrat , against a republican who was running for governor then opposed the governor s tax cuts when he was there so i simply disagree with him those issues and he sides with hillary clinton on each of those issues i just mentioned wallace mayor giuliani giuliani well , look , you know wallace why do n't you respond to senator thompson \? giuliani well , first of all , you know , you do one of those things and you know , fred has his problems , too \( laughter \) i mean , fred was the single biggest obstacle to tort reform in the united states senate he stood with democrats over and over again he voted against 250 , 000 caps on damages , which they have in texas he voted against almost anything that would make our legal system fairer loser pays rules , things that would prevent lawsuits like that 54 million lawsuit by that guy who lost his pants you know \? \( laughter \) giuliani that cost that family 100 , 000 in legal fees i think the man should have to pay the family for the 100 , 000 that he took from them in the abusive lawsuit \( applause \) fred thompson , along with very few republicans , blocked tort reform over and over and over again that is not a conservative position \( applause \) wallace mayor , if i may senator , you can have a minute to respond to mayor giuliani and also tell us what your beef is with governor romney thompson you 've just go a minute \? wallace that s right thompson ok wallace talk fast thompson as far as tort reform is concerned , i supported tort reform with regard to securities legislation i supported tort reform with regard to product liability legislation , things that have to do with interstate commerce i think it appropriately passed i supported and worked for those things local issues belong at the state level most states have passed tort reform \( applause \) thompson that s our system it s not all federalized you know , i 'd point out , as far as lawsuits are concerned , i voted for and we passed antisanctuary city build , outlawed them mayor giuliani went to court , filed suit himself to overturn our abolition of sanctuary cities and , fortunately , he lost \( applause \) wallace mr mayor , you want to respond , 30 seconds on the sanctuary city issue \? giuliani oh , the simple fact is that new york city had a policy of allowing people who are illegal immigrants to report crime and to put their children in school otherwise , we reported every single illegal immigrant that committed a crime the results had to be pretty darn good i brought down crime by over 60 percent in new york city i brought down homicide by 67 percent i had the most legal city in the country and i took the crime capital of america and i turned it into the safest large city in the country the senator has never had executive responsibility he s never had the weight of people s safety and security on his shoulders i have and i think i outperformed any expectations \( applause \) wallace senator mccain , if i may senator mccain , you did n't like it much when governor romney said recently that he spoke for the republican wing of the republican party who s more conservative you or mitt romney \? mccain i think it s pretty obvious that that statement was a paraphrase of howard dean s statement about the democrat party the fact is , i'm running on my record as a reliable conservative of 24 years and the indicators of that , obviously , is that i 've fought wasteful spending , i have had a strong and a long relationship on national security , i 've been involved in every national crisis that this nation has faced since beirut , i understand the issues , i understand and appreciate the enormity of the challenge we face from radical islamic extremism i am prepared i am prepared i need no onthejob training i was n't a mayor for a short period of time i was n't a governor for a short period of time for 20some years , including leading the largest squadron in the united states navy , i led i did n't manage for profit , i led for patriotism \( applause \) wallace governor romney , senator mccain suggests that you 're conning people he has used that phrase with your conversions on a number of issues during this campaign why is senator mccain wrong \? romney well , senator mccain is an american hero , and i respect his service i respect his service in government as well \( applause \) and we have some differences on some issues but when i ran against ted kennedy in 1994 , i knew that was going to be a big uphill climb but let me tell you , i was fighting for issues like making sure that we would have the death penalty in our state , fighting to keep our taxes down romney i fought , as well , to secure our borders i fought to keep the welfare bills from the 1960s that have created such a havoc in our nation , to try and get those changed so i was fighting against the liberal lion in perhaps the toughest state in america and i'm pretty proud of what i was able to accomplish in that race , but nothing compares to the pride i have with the work that i was able to do as a governor i served for four years my legislature was 85 percent democrat i fought to get english in our schools , to make sure we had english immersion i fought to make sure we kept our taxes down i fought for progrowth strategies i cut taxes all of us on the stage are republican but the question is , who will be able to build the house that ronald reagan built who will be able to strengthen that house , because that s the house that s going to build the house that clinton , hillary , wants to build wallace senator mccain , you did n't think much of the answer of governor romney in the last debate , when he said that he would ask his lawyers whether he needed congressional authorization to use military force against iran why not \? t mccain because i do n't think that s the time to call in the lawyers , when we 're in a national security crisis those are the last people i 'd call in the people i 'd call in , i 'd call in my wisdom , my knowledge , my background , my experience , and my ability to lead this nation governor romney , you 've been spending the last year trying to fool people about your record you ca n't i do n't want you to start fooling them about mine i stand on my record i stand on my record of a conservative of a conservative , and i do n't think you can fool the american people i think the first thing you need is their respect , and i intend to earn their respect because they may not agree with me on a couple of issues , but they 'll know i'm telling the truth , and what i believe and my steadfast positions on these issues for more than 20 years , and i know that the transcendent challenge i have the qualifications to lead , to grapple with and to emerge victorious i have those qualifications and i'm proud of them \( applause \) wallace senator romney governor romney \? romney do n't demote me i want to make one thing very , very clear , and that is if there were ever a question of a security threat to this country , i would act immediately to protect the interests of america and our citizens no question about that \( applause \) let me also note , the question is you properly asked it , chris was what involvement would congress have to have \? every president from the beginning of time who has had that issue has of course met with white house counsel and the attorney general and they have written opinions about the involvement of congress i can imagine every person on this stage would likewise apprise themselves of congress' perspective excuse me , of congress' role with those individuals but the decision to take our men and women to war is the most grave decision and i would do that on a very deliberate and careful basis , not a halfcocked basis this president went to congress romney hillary clinton is trying to rewrite history , that somehow he did this all by himself , going to iraq he went to congress and got their support let s not forget that \( applause \) hume governor , thank you very much thanks you , chris carl cameron has the second round of questions carl \? cameron thanks very much , brit congressman paul , to you , on the subject of one of the core debates in the party , over social issues gay marriage you 've been quoted as saying , any association that s voluntary should be permissible in a free society and you 've expressed your opposition to a constitutional ban on gay marriage many of your rivals on that stage disagree why are they wrong \? paul i'm afraid i have n't been able to get most of your question i know you brought up the subject of gay marriage , but i did n't get the point of what you 're saying i ca n't hear it that well cameron why are on those stage who support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage wrong \? paul ok well , if you believe in federalism , it s better that we allow these things to be left to the state my personal belief is that marriage is a religious ceremony paul and it should be dealt with religiously the state really should n't be involved the state , both federal and statewise , got involved mostly for health reasons 100 years or so ago but this should be a religious matter all voluntary associations , whether they 're economic or social , should be protected by the law but to amend the constitution is totally unnecessary to define something that s already in the dictionary we do know what marriage is about we do n't need a new definition or argue over a definition and have an amendment to the constitution to me , it just seems so unnecessary to do that it s very simply that the states should be out of that business , and the states i mean , the states should be able to handle this the federal government should be out of it there s no need for the federal government to be involved in this you can accomplish this without waiting five or ten or 15 years the authority can be put in the states by mere voting in the congress \( applause \) hume governor romney , among the socalled top tier candidates , you support the ban on gay marriage what does it say that fred thompson , rudy giuliani , john mccain and ron paul all do n't \? romney well , they have a different point of view but i 've been in a state that has gay marriage , and i recognize that the consequences of gay marriage fall far beyond just the relationship between a man and a woman they also relate to our kids and the right of religion to be practiced freely in a society so , for instance , i want to make sure that our kids have a mom and a dad i want to make sure the catholic church in our state , that s been banned from doing adoptions because they want the kids to go into home where there s a mom and a dad , that they can do adoptions again the status of marriage , if it s allowed among the same sex individuals in one state is going to spread to the entire nation and that s why it s important to have a national standard for marriage and i'm committed to making sure that we reinforce the institution of marriage in this country by insisting that all states have a right to have marriage as defined as between a man and a woman and we do n't have unelected judges , liberals , standing up and saying we 're going to impose samesex marriage where it was clearly not in their state constitution romney my state s constitution was written by john adams it is n't there i 've looked and in iowa as well you 've got a court saying they have to have samesex marriage the people need to speak on this issue and make sure that marriage is preserved as between a man and a woman \( applause \) cameron mayor giuliani , your opposition to the constitutional amendment banning gay marriage has been fairly well known i had an opportunity to talk to tony perkins of the family research council this afternoon who said that in a discussion with you just in the last couple of days you informed him that if , in fact , the defense of marriage act were to fail , or states began or states began to legalize gay marriage , you would oppose a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage giuliani i think you said that opposite , and the first part is wrong also , carl i have always i 've always had cameron you 're right my mistake giuliani i 've always had the same position giuliani i do not believe under the state that we presently exist , with the defense of marriage act and basically one state that has by judicial fiat created samesex marriage and they 're wrong , by the way i think the governor is absolutely right i do n't think we need a constitutional amendment at this point what i said to mr perkins which i also said five years ago and have consistently said is if a lot of states start to do that , three , four , five , six states , where we have that kind of judicial activism , and the kind of situation the governor is talking about actually occurs , if we 're dealing with a real problem , then we should have a constitutional amendment i did 210 weddings when i was mayor of new york city so i have experience doing this they were all men and women \( laughter \) i hope \( laughter \) \( applause \) giuliani you got to give me a little slack here it was new york city , you know , but it s not just a religious institution \( laughter \) giulaini it is a religious institution , but congressman paul is wrong it s a civil institution as well that s why i did those 210 weddings , because it s also a civil institution \( applause \) cameron governor huckabee , mayor giuliani has argued that he is , in his private life , opposed to abortion but as a matter of public policy , would do nothing to change the laws that keep it legal right now what are your views on that type of a position and as it relates both to public policy and the future of the republican party \? huckabee let me begin by saying , for the first time in about nine debates , i'm kind of glad i was n't in on the first few minutes because it was all about these guys fighting each other \( laughter \) and i am more than content to let you let them fight all they want tonight , shed each other s blood and then i 'll be ready to run for president because \( laughter \) i'm not interested in fighting these guys \( applause \) what i'm interested in is fighting for the american people , and i think they 're looking for a presidential candidate who s not so interested in a demolition derby against the other people in his own party huckabee there are some real issues out there in this country we need to be fighting for on behalf of the people now , one of them , quite frankly , i do believe , is the sanctity of human life \( applause \) because i do believe that it is one of the defining issues of our culture and civilization in that it expresses our understanding that every single human being in this society has intrinsic value and worth when our founding fathers put their signatures on the declaration of independence , those 56 brave people , most of whom , by the way , were clergymen , they said that we have certain inalienable rights given to us by our creator , and among these life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , life being one of them i still believe that \( applause \) cameron senator thompson , earlier this week , you were asked about your lobbying , years ago , for planned parenthood , the nation s largest abortion provider and you were quoted as saying , that was private life , as if to dismiss the question cameron can you explain to us what you meant by that and why thompson no , i cameron it would make a difference \? thompson no , what i said what i hope i said was that it was my private law practice , as opposed to my public service i was a member of a firm , of counsel to a large firm and it was their client they asked me to do a little work on it i made a few calls and that was that frankly , i 'd forgotten about it but they 've come forward now , because i'm their worst nightmare after that happened , i went to the united states senate and voted consistently against them on every bill that came up now they 're trying to defeat me \( applause \) cameron senator mccain , in recent months and years , you 've described as trying to reach out and mend fences with the evangelical right \( ph \) and religious conservatives across the country , having criticized them in years past , particularly their leaders cameron and there s some skepticism many want to know today whether or not you are now reaching out and truly trying to mend those fences , or if you remain the maverick , and which is the straight talk they should believe mccain well , i do n't change i have n't changed i think that anybody who is going to receive the nomination of their party obviously needs to appeal to and make their case to , but not pander to , all parts of the republican party i'm proud that in my life i have engaged in reconciliation with former enemies i did that with the vietnamese , who killed many of my friends i did that with other adversaries from time to time and when rev falwell came to my office and said he wanted to put our differences behind us , i was more than glad to and i'm even more glad today that i did i believe in reconciliation i believe that they 're an important part of our party mccain i think we need to move together we need all of us to win this election , and i think it s going to take a united party to do so and i hope that all elements of our party will respect the process and support the nominee of our party \( applause \) cameron congressman tancredo , recently you complained that the party had become hyphenated , that where were neoconservatives , paleo conservatives , compassionateconservatives , commonsense conservatives is that just a good line meant to say that a lot of the folks on this stage are n't the type of complete conservatives you think the party needs \? tancredo well , you know , one thing , by being a bookend to every one of these debates you get a chance to listen \( applause \) for a long time to everybody else talk about their positions on issues and every single person on this stage , certainly everyone of my colleagues , i believe , bring something very unique , very special , and certainly enormous capabilities to this whole debate and to the office that they are seeking tancredo but i must tell you , they also bring differences and those it is not , i think , a sin to discuss them i do n't believe it should be something that we hold back on when we talk to the american people about what it is that actually distinguishes us and , yes , i do think that there are organizations that should be looked at that actually rate people for their conservative history and the american taxpayers union , for one , gives me the highest rating the american conservative union , highest rating of anybody running for president of the united states an a rating from the national right to life an a rating from every organization every conservative organization that gives ratings to those of us who are here on this stage now , those are objective you know , there s somebody else that looks at us and says how conservative are these people really \? and what we do notice is that in a primary everybody in the republican party , everybody runs to the right tancredo but , as time goes on , they all move to the left and that s why people are so cynical about this process \( applause \) cameron congressman hunter \? some pretty sensitive issues gay marriage , abortion and tom tancredo with the highest rankings is he the right conservative \? and are these issues that are the republican party is in danger of not being conservative enough and losing track and losing connection with its principles \? hunter well , carl , you 've been dividing the party for the last 10 minutes , so let me let me say something that i think unites them this is a historic venue \( applause \) you know , 300 miles off this coast is a place where another party , once a great party , the democrat party , lost its identity and that s when , in 1961 , the cuban freedom fighters were struggling with a toehold on the beach , trying to take back cuba from castro and a democrat president with an aircraft carrier sitting a few miles offshore said we will not help the freedom fighters and a thousand miles away from there is el salvador , where a republican president , ronald reagan , hung tough , brought freedom to el salvador hunter and you know something \? today , they are fighting side by side with our guys in iraq \( applause \) we 're the party of freedom \( applause \) cameron i'm not so sure i should n't get 30 seconds to rebut as to whether i'm dividing their party hunter thanks for the question , carl hume well , thank you very much , congressman hunter carl , thank you wendell goler has the next round wendell \? goler gentlemen , i want to ask you some questions about health care and education , which are always important issues in every presidential election i want to ask you to be specific and , in deference to governor huckabee , you do n't have to beat up on each other senator mccain , your plan for lowering health care costs involves switching people from employerprovided health care to policies they buy on their own there s concern that could lead insurance companies to cherrypick their clients goler you also want to limit the amount doctors can charge for chronic diseases , which skeptics worry could make it difficult for people with diabetes , for example , to find doctors to take care of them how would you deal with these two problems \? mccain first of all , i think it is important that that will be one of the defining issues of this campaign , because we know that there will be hillarycare resurrected there will be efforts to raise your taxes there will be efforts to have a singlepayer big government solution by the democrats they 've already espoused those causes if you believe them , please take a trip to canada or england before you decide to support such a thing \( applause \) america has the highest quality health care in the world our job is to preserve it our job is to keep the costs down last year , the medicaid inflation was 10 percent no , no program in the world can survive under that so of course we want to remove the employer \( ootc epli \) tax , and tax incentives , and move it to the individual give the individual a 2 , 500 refundable tax credit , a family a 5 , 000 tax credit mccain if you need to have people in special categories such as congenital diseases , we may have to set up a fund to care for those but the key is , make health care in america affordable and available do n't destroy it , as the democrats want to do \( applause \) goler congressman paul , you say that insurance companies and government programs have made health care simply unafforable you objected so strongly to medicaid that , as a doctor , i'm told , you simply treated patients on your own , at your own expense is charity the way we should provide health care for the poor right now \? and how are you going to encourage doctors to do that primary care doctors to do that , when their salaries have been declining for more than a decade \? paul well , we 've had managed care , now , for about 35 years it s not working , and nobody s happy with it the doctors are n't happy the patients are n't happy paul nobody seems to be happy except the corporations , the drug companies and the hmos you take care of poor people by turning the medical care back into the system , where people have some choices now , we have a mess because we have a lot of people are very dependent on health care but i have the only way we can afford to take care of people now , because we 're going broke , with 500 billion going to debt every single year and we have a foreign policy that is draining us i say , take care of these poor people i'm not against that but save the money someplace the only place available for us to save it is to change our attitude about running a world empire and bankrupting this country we can take care of the poor people , save money and actually cut some of our deficit so you do n't have to throw anybody out in the street , but long term you have move toward the marketplace you cannot expect socialized medicine of the hillary brand to work and you ca n't expect the managed care system that we have today , which promotes and benefits and rewards the corporations because it s the drug companies and the hmos and even the ama that comes to us and lobbies us for this managed care , and that s why the prices are high paul it s only in medicine that technology has raised prices rather than lowering prices \( applause \) goler governor romney , we have an emailed question from kendrick of oakland , california , who says the health care plan you left in massachusetts , which required people to get their own insurance , amounts to hillary care you say it was the result of a democratic legislature i want to ask you if a democratic congress placed such a plan on your desk in the oval office , would you sign it \? and why was the plan good for massachusetts and not good for the nation \? romney first of all , i'm not going to give the democratic legislature credit for the plan that i helped build so , i want to let you know i'm very proud of what we did in massachusetts , and i think it s a model that other states can adopt in some respects but let me tell you something about our plan it s different than hillary clinton s in a lot of important ways but one thing that i'm happy about is that republicans are talking about health care this is n't a democrat issue it s a republican issue romney for democrats , they want to have government take it over and i do n't want to have the guys who did the cleanup at katrina taking responsibility for health care in this country the right answer \( applause \) the right answer is to get people insured , all of our citizens insured so they do n't have to worry about losing their insurance if they change jobs or have a preexisting condition but hillary says the federal government s going to tell you what kind of insurance , and it s all government insurance and i say no , let the states create their own plans , and instead of government insurance , private , marketbased insurance hillary s plan costs an extra 110 billion my plan does n't cost any additional money we use the money we 're already spending , we just use it a good deal more wisely and the real question here is , are we going to talk about health care and get everybody insured with private insurance \? absolutely because the alternative is unthinkable as pj o'rourke said , if you think health care s expensive now , just wait until it s free we 're not going hillary s way \( applause \) goler governor , i think one of the aspects of your plan required individuals to provide their own health insurance , and i think congressman hunter wants to talk to you about that hunter yes wendell , i think the governor s plan goes in exactly the wrong direction , because while it allows for private health insurance , it has lots of mandates he has a good piece of those 1 , 000 or so mandates that drive up the cost of health care that means that every single plan in the governor s state has to have certain things hunter it s got to have , for example , fertility coverage well , what if you 're 90 years old \? we may appreciate governor romney s optimism \( laughter \) but you may not need fertility coverage those 1 , 000 mandates that we have throughout the states , where we do have mandated health insurance plans , is driving up the cost of health care by about 35 percent we need freedom we need to allow people to buy their health care across state lines that will bring down the cost of health care \( applause \) romney oh , i 've got to respond to that goler briefly , governor romney we took as many mandates out as we could in our policies and the legislature kept some there i tried to take them all out they put some back in it was a compromise they put some mandates there but , let me tell you how many we got out the price of the premium for an individual , 42 years old , in boston , used to 350 a month now , it s 180 we basically cut it in half by deregulating romney congressman , you 're absolutely right that taking regulation out of insurance brings the price down , and that s why my plan would go state by state , deregulate them so we can get the cost of premiums down but it is unacceptable to keep talking about this and still have 47 million people without health insurance we got the job done this is the first state in america that is on track to have everybody insured half of my uninsured are now insured , and i am proud of what we 've done \( applause \) goler governor huckabee has wanted to say something for a couple of minutes now , and i get the sense he does n't think you got enough regulations removed governor \? huckabee first of all , we do n't have a health care system we have a health care maze and we do n't have a health care crisis we have a health crisis eighty percent of the 2 trillion we spend on health care in this country is spent on chronic disease if we do n't change the health of this nation by focusing on prevention , we 're never going to catch up with the costs no matter what plan we have \( applause \) huckabee the reality is it s a health crisis , and i would further say that one of the challenges we face is that a lot of the democrats want to turn it over to the government , while the republicans want to turn it over completely to the private insurance companies i think the better idea is to turn it over to each individual consumer and let him or her make that choice i trust me a lot more than i trust government or a lot more than i trust the insurance companies and we 've got a situation with 10 , 000 baby boomers a day signing up for social security , going into the medicare system and i just want to remind everybody when all the old hippies find out that they get free drugs , just wait until what that s going to cost out there \( laughter \) \( applause \) goler congressman tancredo , your health care plans seems intended to show how tough you would be on illegal immigration your concerns involve the illegal immigrants using our hospital emergency rooms the rand corporation says that illegal immigrants account for about 15 percent of the nation s health care costs you also want to import cheaper drugs , prescription drugs from canada , though the president says there would be no way to regulate them where is your help for the nearly 50 million americans who do n't have health insurance \? tancredo one of the most interesting parts of this debate about health care is the fact that we continually talk about the federal government s role in it we should actually be debating that specific point , not what kind of government program you know , michael moore went to cuba not too long ago , and wrote this documentary about the greatness of the system , how wonderful it was to be in cuba and have a socialized medical system you notice , however , that michael moore came back to the united states \( laughter \) \( applause \) now , there s a reason that he did that , of course it s because we have the best system in the world and why \? it s because we do rely more on individuals than not tancredo really and truly , it s a fascinating thing to think about this , that we have moved all the way to the point of simply debating what kind of federal plan we might have rather than debating what s the constitutional right of the federal government to get involved in this particular issue that s a challenge i think we all have to accept \( applause \) now , if there s a federal role , i completely accept the idea of giving people the greater opportunity individual opportunity to use health savings accounts why \? because that takes individuals they become the consumer in the marketplace dealing directly with the provider that s called a marketplace that will drive down the costs get the federal government do n't even talk about our responsibilities , because they always gives people the option to think that there is naturally the federal government should be involved it should n't \( applause \) goler senator thompson , you voted in favor of the no child left behind law , though critics warned that it was too intrusive , too bureaucratic they also warned that teachers would teach to the test thompson yes goler now you say all those things are true goler was your vote a mistake , and how would you change no child to correct those problems \? thompson yeah i did vote for it , and some of those critics were right and some of us were wrong what has happened is that , indeed , states have taught to the test we 've not gotten the transparency and the accountability that we thought we were getting i like the idea of testing \( inaudible \) it ca n't be like lake wobegon , where all the children are above average , you know everybody s , you know , making 90 on the test , you 're not learning very much i think what we need to do is realize the proper role of the federal government the federal government only is responsible for about 8 percent of what is spent we need to concentrate on helping the states , making sure that 8 percent is spent wisely thompson but there are a lot of good things going on at the state level , you know , in terms of free markets , in terms of competition , and the things that work in the rest of our society , vouchers , charter schools , things of that nature states ought to be allowed to experiment and do the things that they know best at the state and local level and we ca n't lay all this at the feet of any government we have to accept some hard truths part of the problem in our education system and with our children has to do with the societal breakdown that s going on in this country we need more fathers to stay and raise their kids \( applause \) goler mayor giuliani , most people agree that you helped new york s crime problem and its economy , but you met your match with the schools giuliani i could n't get that i'm sorry , wendell goler you met your match with the city school system you said that the school system was , quote , no good and beyond redemption that it was , quote , dysfunctional and should be blown up \( laughter \) \( applause \) goler a lot of teachers , frankly , hated you , sir the no child bill has already alienated a lot of the nation s teachers why are you the person to bring them back in the fold and how would you do it \? giuliani well , i mean , because what we need is choice i 'll give you a probably goler that s going to bring back public school teachers \? giuliani well , i'm actually i love teachers i think teachers are wonderful there are great ones , there are average ones and there are bad ones , but i really care about the kids more sorry , wendell \( applause \) and i just want to tell you a little story , because this is the thing that made me feel very strongly about choice there was a school scholarship program about 1996 , '97 they offered 2 , 500 scholarships to parents of public school children in new york city if they wanted to send their child to a private school , a parochial school , a charter school giuliani we had 168 , 000 applications by those parents we had to turn most of them down we had to tell them because they do n't have enough money , they could n't put the child in the school of their choice it seems to me the thing that s wrong right at the core of no child left behind is the enforcer of standards should not be the bureaucrat in washington or on the board of education it should be the parent we should have choice we should empower parents they should decide private school , parochial school , public school , charter school , home school \( applause \) that will give the parents the kind of control over their children s education they understand their children better why should a government bureaucrat be sending 168 , 000 children to failing schools when parents think they can do better for their children \? i think it s the single biggest civil rights issue that we face in the 21st century \( applause \) hume mr mayor , thank you very much candidates , it is time for a break coming up , how will these candidates run against the democrats' frontrunning senator hillary clinton \? we will find out live from the shingle creek resort in orlando , florida , right after these messages \( commercial break \) hume and we 're back in orlando with the republicans running for their party s presidential nomination our debates continues with more questions from chris wallace chris \? wallace gentlemen , you all have a couple of things in common you all seem to be planning to run against hillary clinton in the general election and at this point all of you i repeat all of you are losing to her in the polls so let s talk about how you intend to beat her governor romney , you trail clinton by 12 points in the latest fox news opinion dynamics poll you have compared clinton to karl marx you say when clinton \( applause \) when clinton hears about private sector , she thinks that that s a new recruit in the army \( laughter \) is hillary clinton fit to be commander in chief \? audience no ! romney the audience the audience is telling you the answer you know , look at the challenges that america faces right now romney and not only do we face global jihad , with all of the implications of a group of people who want to bring down our nation and free nations around the world , but you also face an emerging economic superpower in china it s the new asian tiger and china and india are coming in a remarkable way to compete for our jobs the idea that someone wants to be president who s never worked in the private sector is really a big question mark i 've spent 25 years in the business world , running a small business that became a large one i 've worked in 20 countries around the world , working on investments and helping manage a business and so forth that skill , that experience is essential hillary clinton wants to run the largest enterprise in the world , the government of the united states it employs millions of people , trillions of dollars in revenue romney she has n't run a corner store she has n't run a state she has n't run a city she has never run anything and the idea that she could learn to be president , you know , as an internship just does n't make any sense i have spent my life running things i 've learned how to run a business i 've learned how to run a state i ran the olympics in each case , i brought change and if there s ever been a time we needed change in washington to bring strength to america , it s now wallace governor , i'm going to give you \( applause \) wallace governor , i'm going to give you 30 more seconds i asked you specifically is she fit to be commander in chief \? romney well , i 'd vote no i 'd vote no i do n't want her as commander in chief i do n't believe she has the experience in leadership and running something of the scale of our military to be the commander in chief of this nation if you asked me , if the ballot is put in front of anybody in this room , i think you heard what they said the answer is , absolute anyone here want to vote for hillary \? audience no ! romney i agree with them wallace mayor giuliani , you trail clinton by four points in our latest fox news opinion dynamics poll governor romney says the republicans are n't going to beat hillary clinton by acting like hillary clinton and the point seems to be that on a lot of the social issues , like abortion and gay rights and gun control , that there s not much difference between you and clinton is there \? giuliani you got to be kidding \( laughter \) you have got to be kidding wait a second there is there are two things i agree with hillary clinton on first of all , we 're both yankee fans \( laughter \) well , wait a second i became a yankee fan growing up in new york she became a yankee fan growing up in chicago \( laughter \) do you believe that \? \( laughter \) second , she made a statement last week and i 've been very critical of her , but i want to tell her i agree with this one quote , hillary clinton , i have a million ideas america cannot afford them all \( laughter \) i'm not making it up i am not making it up one more time , i have a million ideas , america ca n't afford them all no kidding , hillary america ca n't afford you wallace mayor , mayor , i'm going to give you 30 more seconds because i want to you made a big point on the campaign trail about how you know how to beat senator clinton but the fact is , i looked today at the latest polls in all the key battleground states florida , pennsylvania , ohio you trail her in all three giuliani almost every one of them is within the statistical margin of error , and , and , if those polls are correct , then the president of the united states right now is john kerry last time i checked if those polls are correct , we 'd have al gore here to i do n't know , it might be a little colder , i'm not sure but i'm not sure we 'd be any better off right , we 'd be in a lot worse shape with al gore thank , thank you florida \( laughter \) \( applause \) giuliani thank you \( applause \) you saved us in 2000 that was a big one \( laughter \) i 'd also like to note , on behalf of all my republican colleagues , we 're not going to boycott florida the way the democrats are \( applause \) we 're going to be here , campaigning for your vote wallace senator mccain , you 're running the closest to clinton , but you still trail her by three points in our latest poll the biggest issue between the two of you clearly is the war in iraq you strongly support the troop surge she wants to start pulling the troops out is that a winner for republicans in 2008 \? mccain i do n't know and i ca n't be concerned because i know too many brave young americans that are serving and sacrificing in iraq , as we speak \( applause \) i would much rather lose a campaign than lose a war and now i'm \( applause \) let me just say that i know and respect senator clinton mccain the debate that i have between me and her will be based on national security , on fiscal conservatism , and on social conservatism it will be a respectful debate that is what the american people want now , one of them will be spending i have fought against outof control and disgraceful spending that s been going on and i have saved the american people as much as 2 billion at one stroke in case you missed it , a few days ago , senator clinton tried to spend 1 million on the woodstock concert museum now , my friends , i was n't there i'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event \( laughter \) i was tied up at the time \( laughter \) but the fact is \( applause \) mccain my friends , no one can be president of the united states that supports projects such as these and i believe that wasteful spending has got to be eliminated and i will have this debate and win because she is a liberal democrat and i am a proud , reliable , consistent conservative republican that s why i 'll win \( applause \) wallace governor huckabee , i'm sorry to say we did n't call the horse race between you and senator clinton , but you say that she will win next november if the republican party does n't do a better job of reaching out to minorities \( applause \) was it a mistake for some of your colleagues on this stage to skip those minoritysponsored debates \? huckabee i think it was a mistake we need to be making sure that the republican party is the most inclusive party for the simple reason that our message touches more americans and helps more people from the bottom get to the next rung on the ladder than anybody \( applause \) you know , it s interesting , the most , i guess , wonderful reaction we 've had in this entire room is when hillary s name is mentioned it gets louder than an aerosmith concert \( laughter \) but i want to say this you 've asked what s the difference \? no matter which one of us is on this stage and , look , i like to be funny , let me be real honest with you there s nothing funny about hillary clinton being president let me tell you why \( applause \) if she s president , taxes go up , health care becomes the domain of the government , spending goes out of control , our military loses its morale , and i'm not sure we 'll have the courage and the will and the resolve to fight the greatest threat this country s ever faced in islamofascism \( applause \) we 've got an enemy that wants to kill every last one of us we cannot be soft we must be strong we 'll sign crazy bills like the law of the sea treaty and give away our sovereignty and that s why , with all of the fun we 're going to have talking about it , there s nothing funny about hillary being president \( applause \) wallace senator thompson , you trail clinton by 12 points in our latest poll you said the other day that republicans do n't need to worry so much about clinton as much as they need to worry about themselves what do you mean by that \? thompson well , just what i said hillary is always a good applause line and almost everything everybody has said has been accurate if we go down that road , we 're going to go down the road of higher taxes hillary basically says that , you know , 40 percent of the people pay about 99 percent of the taxes why not 30 percent of the people \? why not 20 percent of the people \? we 're going to have a windfall when the tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 let s use that money our way we 'll go down the road of power spending , where people are told , do n't worry about your kids , do n't worry about the next generation , although we 're clearly bankrupting them , with regard to their social security and medicare expenditures thompson we ca n't sustain it but do n't worry about that we 'll make it all up out of the rich the only problem with democrats is that everybody who works for a living is rich , according to them \( applause \) they say that all we 've got to do is bring the troops home , and the world will leave us alone they 're the party that insults our generals and tries our troops in the newspaper and when they 're exonerated , they 're on page 15 or 20 \( applause \) so what i meant was , if we stick to our basic principles , we will win next november but we 've got to remember our first principles the fact that what the founding fathers told us a long , long time ago , that our basic rights come from god , not from government that we have a system of divided government , both state and local and state and federal level we believe in free markets we believe in free people we believe in free enterprise and americans who work hard and play by the rules have a decent chance of living the american dream , just like i have and so many others have that s the things that we have to keep in mind let s do n't get diverted onto some single individual , whoever their nominee is they 're going to lead us down the road to a comfortable mediocrity and that s not the united states of america i grew up in \( applause \) wallace congressman paul \( applause \) wallace congressman paul , you 're against the iraq war so is senator clinton so what are the differences between you \? paul well , there s a very big difference , and i think the american people , if we as a party realize this and understand it , 70 some percent of the people in america want the war over with they 're sick and tired of it and they want our troops to come home now , senator clinton has nothing new to offer she s endorsing the same policy she said that the troops would be there for another five years , continue to build this embassy that s going to be bigger than the vatican , continue to build 14 air bases as are going on there , these private bases going on there , and never change paul we in this party have to realize the american people are sick and tired of big government , big government overseas , an empire we ca n't maintain , the bankruptcy of this country , and also the attack on our personal civil liberties we do n't have privacy left anymore , and hillary clinton offers no solution to that , and neither does any of the democrats and we are not doing a very good job either if we do n't recognize that , we do n't have a chance because we need to get back to the basics , believe in the constitution , believe in the rule of law , and not allow our government to spend endlessly and bankrupt this country \( applause \) hume congressman paul , thank you senator thompson , i want to go to the issue that you mentioned in passing just a couple of minutes ago , the solvency of medicare and social security you said those programs were threatened with bankruptcy they indeed are , as countless economists have advised us if they were to be kept in their present form , it is argued that they could swamp the private economy with unacceptable levels of taxation or would force severe benefit cuts hume you have stepped out on this , suggesting that we could change the indexing method for the growth of benefits in social security you have said that we could n't really afford the prescription drug bill that was passed under president bush you have talked about the possibility that highincome medicare beneficiaries would have to accept less benefits this is a hard area , as the president s adventure on this has shown are you prepared to say , tonight , that you would propose these things and make them part of your campaign \? thompson yes as i think that you have stated them , yes i do n't want to be bound to your exact words , but the principles that you 've outlined are absolutely hume me either thompson are absolutely correct it s based on the notion that there s no reason to run for the presidency of the united states if you ca n't tell the truth it s a difficult thing politically \( applause \) thompson but the fact of the matter is we 're bankrupting the next generation we 're spending the money of our grandkids and those yet to be born they do n't have a seat at the table our present mandatory spending cycle leaves us in an unsustainable position the comptroller tells us that , the government accountability office everybody that looks at it says it s unsustainable can you imagine something that s unsustainable and threatens our economy for our grandchildren and those yet to be born not being discussed more on the campaign trail \? i 've just set out a couple of things that i think will avoid future generational warfare , where we have to fight over a lot higher taxes or big benefit cuts if we do some responsible things now we do n't have to do that and the indexing of benefits in the future , from wages to prices , is one way to do that current retirees or for those near retirement would n't be affected and those retiring in the future would get the same benefits in real dollars as those retiring now , but not more hume all right \( applause \) what senator thompson said , mayor giuliani , will open him to accusations that he s trying to cut social security benefits he will be accused of being willing to diminish or take away the prescription drug benefit that many now have come to depend on he has suggested that medicare beneficiaries might have to suffer loss of benefits \( inaudible \) high income he s out on a limb on that are you prepared to be as bold \? giuliani was that question for me \? hume yes it is giuliani ok i think the reality is that we have to deal with social security the first thing we have to do is get a consensus behind private accounts if we 're going to change it \( applause \) it does n't make much sense to figure out what the compromises are going to be if you ca n't get the big thing that you need to really change social security and the fact is , medicare and medicaid and presently more expensive than social security giuliani and within 10 years , they 'll be twice as expensive so they 're going to go bankrupt a lot faster and they need a private solution as well what we need to do if we 're going to bring down the cost of medicare and medicaid is bring down the cost of the entire health insurance market and in the discussion you were having about health insurance before , the point that i think was missed we only have 17 million people in america who buy their own health insurance if we have 50 million or 60 million people who bought their own health insurance , the price of health insurance would be cut in more than half and the way you cover the people that are n't presently covered the people who are n't presently covered with health insurance are not the poorest people they 're covered with medicaid the people who are presently not covered are all buying something they 're consumers they may be buying a television , they may be buying i hate to mention a cellphone , but they may be buying a cellphone but in any event , they have they have consumer power they have to start getting into that market it s the only way in which you bring down costs so i think in both cases , if you start to establish a private market , you 're going to be able to figure out how to solve these things within costs that are sustainable \( applause \) hume how about it , governor romney \? are you prepared to be as bold as senator thompson has been in making an in addressing these extremely politically sensitive entitlement programs \? romney i'm prepared to be entirely bold , but i'm not prepared to cut benefits for lowincome americans we 're going to make sure that we protect these programs for our seniors that s number one number two hume how \? romney well , our current seniors currently , we 're taking more money into social security that we actually send out so our current seniors , their benefits are not going to change for people 20 and 30 and 40 years old , we have four major options , for instance , for social security one is the one democrats want raise taxes it s the wrong way to go number two , the president said let s have private accounts and take that surplus money that s being gathered now in social security and put that into private accounts that works other people said , well , extend the retirement age romney that mathematically works it s not as attractive and the last is to index the social security benefits , the first benefit , to something other than wages , which is what it has always been but , in my view , that s the wrong way to go that s the wrong way to go other than for higherincome americans higherincome americans that is the posen plan yes , let s consider doing that that is indexing based on prices rather than wages but the others , medicaid and medicare , we can solve those i know that we did it in our state we are on track to have everybody in our state insured these problems are not impossible to solve good , effective leadership that brings people from both sides of the aisle together can get this job done i have done it in business i did it at the olympics i did it as a governor i will do it as president hume you spoke well of private accounts president bush tried very hard he came into office with a reputation of being able to bring people together in texas he tried very hard to bring people together around his proposal you saw what happened to it romney yes hume how could you do better \? romney well , you know , i will learn from his experience and from my own , because it took us about a couple of years to get find a way to get everybody in our state insured romney we wanted them insured , but we did n't want government to have to pick up a new bill and so we spent a lot of time working on it we did n't just have a bunch of bureaucrats we had a professor from mit , an investment banker , a head of a consulting firm we all worked on it , came up with an idea , and then we met with democrats and said can we find common ground here \? and , you know , democrats also love america as ronald reagan used to say , it s not that liberals are ignorant it s just that what they know is wrong \( laughter \) so , you 've got to you can educate each other we 've got some things to learn from time to time , too and you find common ground we will do that , and we will solve these entitlement problems hume governor huckabee \? \( applause \) huckabee the president had the right idea , but he used the wrong word when he used the word privatization , it scared the daylights out of a lot of people because it was right in the middle hume well , he did n't he used the word private accounts huckabee well , but it scared the daylights out of people because they 're thinking enron and worldcom , and that that s where their money would go the right word is personalization empower individuals to have a greater say over their money and that s what it is keep the government from robbing the trust funds , which is something that , if it was done in the private sector , would get a guy in jail \( applause \) and that s been going on and then another thing is to come up with some creative solutions you asked are we willing to be bold \? yes we have to be bold it s a big problem it needs a big solution one thing , when people reach retirement age , if they really have enough retirement benefits , they do n't need social security for the long term , give them the option of onetime buyout , or the opportunity to purchase an annuity , with their funds , taxfree , that frees up the longterm obligation of the government because the problem is the actuarial tables were designed so that people would retire at 65 and die at 67 \( laughter \) well , i'm sorry , but folks are n't dying that early and short of taking them out , which is not a good idea \( laughter \) we 're going to have to make the benefits work better and that s one way to get it done \( applause \) hume congressman paul , your thoughts on these issues \? paul it s a mess and it proves that the government is not very good at central economic planning , even for retirement paul the money was taken from the people with good intention we should do our best to return it to those that have taken it but we need to allow the young people to just flat out get out of the system because , i tell you what \( applause \) if you have the government managing these accounts , it s not going to work and the other thing that you have to consider if you 're really serious about protecting people s incomes , each and every one of us , is how you 're going to protect the dollar if you do n't have the dollar maintaining its value , no matter where you put the money you 're not going to have any value that s where the crisis is coming you 're going to go up with all these cost of living increases but you 'll never keep up with the cost of living because the dollar s going down , the cost of living is going up our dollar today is worth 4 cents compared to the dollar of 1913 , when the federal reserve took charge of it and if you do n't deal with the dollar there will be no retirement for anybody we 're going to have chaos and that is why you have to cut spending that s why we need a new foreign policy we need to tie it to people over here in this country , the people who are dependent , but we need to let the people get out , whether it s social security or medical care or education the constitution does n't advise that we do any of that anyway paul that s the only way we can solve the problem \( applause \) hume senator mccain , you 've grappled with this issue as long as anybody here you 've heard all the proposals and you heard what senator thompson offered your thoughts \? mccain first of all , i'm glad they 're not dying at 67 , governor \( laughter \) \( applause \) pleased to know that look , what americans need is some straight talk they need to know every man , woman and child in america needs to know that both of these are going broke they 're going broke and we 've got to do the hard things we 've got to fix it for the future generations of americans do n't we owe that to young americans today \? i say we do \( applause \) and you can do it with a couple of charts one of them , on social security , is you can show them how much money is going out , how much is going in and when there s no money left and then you look at a model for that , and that took place in 1983 the last time social security was in serious trouble , a liberal democrat named tip o'neill and ronald reagan stood together in the rose garden and they fixed social security mccain i got to tell you another little secret it s got to be bipartisan there s not 60 votes in the united states senate and you have to got to the american people and say we do n't we wo n't raise your taxes we need personal savings accounts , but we got to fix this system and the american people , as always , when told of a crisis , will respond and support a solution \( applause \) hume congressman hunter \? hunter you know , brit , one thing we need with this smaller generation that s coming up , that s going to have to carry these massive loads economic loads and security loads is bigger paychecks you take a 75 , 000ayear job , and you move it to china , and that guy gets a 20 , 000ayear job , the amount of money that he or she contributes to medicare and social security falls off the cliff now , we 've lost over 3 million highpaying manufacturing jobs in the last five years because we have n't insisted on a level playing field with out competitors they all get their taxes rebated to their manufacturers american manufacturers pay double taxes hunter and for that reason , we 've got a trade deficit with countries that have higher labor rates than we have now , what we 're going to have to do is demand a level playing field that means that we 're going to i think we should involve ourselves in what i call mirror trade , and that means that if another country is charging us a 19 percent tariff , we 're going to hold up a mirror , and they 're going to see it when their goods come into our country \( applause \) hume congressman , do you really hunter leveling the playing field \( applause \) hume do you really think we can solve the social security and medicare entitlement programs with trade policy \? hunter let me give you one statistic , brit we have a 161 billion deficit this year we have an 800 billion trade deficit and that is closely linked with the ability to take care of our seniors , to take care of medicare , and to pay social security , absolutely hume congressman tancredo , you have n't been heard from on this issue please , sir \? tancredo well , i certainly agree with everything that s been said , especially with regard to the issue of structurally changing both social security and medicare we have to when we talked earlier , in the other debates , about what problems we face as a nation in terms of trying to reduce our deficits and the rest , all the stuff that we talk about in terms of discretionary spending that we can cut , ridiculous tancredo i mean , not ridiculous , but on the other hand it wo n't matter in the total scheme of things you 've got to go after those and structurally change them i agree entirely with the idea of doing it by giving people the ability to control their own money , moving it from just exactly like they would in their 401 \( k \) but let me add one more thing , and mr mayor quipped something to me during the break , and here s my chance , mr mayor , to do what you were saying \( laughter \) the fact is that we have n't talked about this aspect of it in reality , of course , there is a plan to give social security benefits to illegal aliens who have worked in this country that is ridiculous and we should never ever , ever , do anything that would harm not just the social security plan , but also you go back and talk to me about health care tancredo let me tell you what health care means , with illegal immigrants 1 billion a year in california , 86 or more hospitals closed , maybe up to hundreds of hospitals closed , throughout this country , because they 've had to provide care for illegal immigrants and cannot be reimbursed so there s a health care plan i mean , problem and a social security problem that also deals with illegal immigration hume congressman tancredo , thank you very much we 're going to take a break when we come back , we 'll deal with issues of foreign policy and , time permitting , we 'll have a lightning round of wild card questions stay with us \( commercial break \) hume more questions for the candidates now , beginning with carl cameron carl \? cameron thanks , brit senator mccain , it s been some time since the first debate question on foreign policy was about russia and not the middle east but let s do that vladimir putin has announced just in the last 24 hours that he plans a new , quote , grandiose , nuclear weapons program to counter the us missile defense system president bush just recently described president putin as wily \( laughter \) are we headed back to a new cold war , or has the bush administration been naive in dealing with mr putin \? mccain i do n't know about naive , but i do know that when i looked into mr putin s eyes , i saw three letters a k , a g and a b \( laughter \) \( applause \) and i'm not saying we will have a return of the cold war , because russia does n't have the kind of capabilities , the territory nor other things but have no doubt , the problems they are causing us are severe and the united nations security council assisting iran as they continue to develop nuclear weapons , as he continues to consolidate power as he attempts to restore the old russian empire mccain and he bullies his neighbors and he wants to get a control of the energy supply of western europe this is a dangerous person and he has to understand that there s a cost to some of his actions and the first thing i would do is make sure that we have a missile defense system in place in czechoslovakia and poland , and i do n't care what his objections are to it \( applause \) and he s going to cause us to set up a league of democracies to address issues from darfur to burma to iran and others , because he and the chinese are blocking meaningful action to keep us in a peaceful world in the united nations it s going to be some tough times ahead cameron congressman hunter , did you have a comment there \? hunter yes , just one comment you know , president putin did give us one opening , and i think we should exploit it and that is that he offered to work with us on seabased missile defenses the throat of the of missiles launched from iran at western europe would go over the black sea hunter i think we should undertake an initiative with putin s people and discuss the prospects of putting our aegis missile defense cruisers in the black sea , ask them if they 're interested in an partnership that would protect western europe , also protect us but , lastly , you know last month , we had a successful intercept above the pacific ocean with a missile coming out from alaska with an interceptor coming up from vandenberg and we hit it 100 miles above the surface of the earth that was a demonstration of the new success of what ronald reagan started with missile defense we 've got to keep missile defense strong \( applause \) cameron mayor giuliani , do you agree with the idea that now is the time to start working with russia on missile security \? giuliani you know , i think now is the time to make it clear to putin that america can speak softly and carry a big stick we want to engage \( applause \) we want to engage russia we want to continue to commercially engage them giuliani but at the same time , the senator is absolutely right we should move as quickly as we can to build missile defense i think this would be a heck of a good time to expand nato nato needs a little revitalization i think we could look to countries like australia we could look to japan we could look to expand it , geographically it s certainly the time to make sure we shore up our relationships with the eastern european countries that have emerged into being free market countries , democracies ukraine is n't quite there yet ukraine is in a struggle , internally they need us they need us to support them to they 'd be a good hedge against russia and at the same time , i think we should make it very , very clear that we understand that we can both engage a country , commercially , like we are doing with russia , or at the same time , we can be very , very firm in our own defense ronald reagan gave us the best answer to how to deal with these situations giuliani the answer is a very , very strong military that no other country on earth would ever consider challenging \( applause \) according to gorbachev , in his book , he says that ronald reagan spent the soviets out of existence right now , an increase in military spending , increasing the size of our military in all aspects in a sensible way , would send a heck of a signal both to russia and to china to not think about challenging us down the road \( applause \) cameron senator thompson , violence escalated again today on the turkishiraq border the terrorist group , pkk , took turkish soldiers hostage if as president bush says , we are fighting terrorists in iraq to protect our homeland , should n't the turks be able to go into iraq to protect their own \? thompson well , let s hope it does n't come to that i think the underlying point here is that turkey is a friend of ours we 've got an important base there , actually more than one , but one especially important as far as our efforts in iraq are concerned thompson they 've got a right to defend themselves from acts of terrorism , and pkk are terrorists the kurds in the northern part of iraq are our friends , too so we 've got to get these people together it s one of those situations where we 've got friends on both sides but militarily and strategically , we have to understand turkey s position i hope that they do n't invade i think that this is one area where diplomacy could work because you have two people or two countries or two areas , i should say that we 're used to talking to and used to working with but turkey is a nato ally , and they have helped us as far as iraq is concerned not everything they do is pleasing to us , and we have some issues with them now , nancy pelosi has brought up an armenian genocide proposal which is totally irresponsible she s interjecting partisan politics into a matter of national security \( applause \) cameron thank you , senator congressman tancredo , i saw that you had your hand up tancredo that was it i just wanted to say that we have to remember why this is happening in turkey tancredo and that is exactly right it is because the present leadership of the house of representatives brought up this bill , agreed to bring up a bill , a resolution , that we knew would in fact , if they did that , would cause turkey to do exactly what they did now , that goes to show you that pandering for votes , which was what this was partly based upon , and a complete ignorance of the foreign policy implications of doing such a thing , are the reasons why we are here now and we should take away from this some very important lessons , not the least of which is that nancy pelosi is not a very good speaker of the house , and she is an even lousier secretary of state \( laughter \) \( applause \) cameron governor , i saw that you do you want to weigh in on this , governor \? huckabee when , four days ago , the parliament of turkey indicated that they would amass those troops , it s a clear signal not just saberrattling , they 're serious about defending themselves it would seem to me that we should dispatch the secretary of state immediately to do two things first of all , we need to train and equip the kurds to fight the terrorists in their midst the pkk is a terrorist organization those 3 , 500 terrorists can best be dealt with by trained and armed kurds we do n't have to put our military in harm s way the kurds have the capacity to do it against those in the pkk but also to try to get turkey to realize that there s nothing to be gained by crossing into that border and creating yet another hostile situation none of us need it none of us want it and i would hope that maybe the base in irbil that was shut down earlier could become the base in which those operations could be staged \( applause \) cameron mr paul \? paul this is a this is a result of a foreign policy of interventionism the founders advised noninterventionism and even our president won the election in the year 2000 to have a more humble foreign policy , not to go into nationbuilding , and not get involved in the internal affairs of other nations and we won an election on that but here we are we 're over there and we 've invaded this country and this is just another unintended consequence the war is spreading , the war is likely to go into iran , nobody s willing to take anything off the table what would it be like if somebody came in here into mexico and did some of these things say , like , putting missiles in europe \? we 're just looking for trouble it s so unnecessary and we jeopardize ourselves and , quite frankly , we 're not able to afford this so we do n't need to go looking for trouble we do n't need another cold war and all we have to do is start talking to people and trading with people we do n't need to assume that the world is going to blow up just think of \( audience booing \) paul when i was drafted into the military , and i served five years in the military , the soviets had 40 , 000 nuclear weapons and here , we 're now learning about agitating and putting missiles in europe paul it s the turks' business it s not our business \( audience boos \) \( applause \) hume governor romney , i assume you 're eager to get into this go ahead romney yes , we spoke about russia , we 've spoken about what s happening in turkey and , obviously , iraq as you look around the world , you recognize that it s still a dangerous place during the clinton years , the president said we 're going to take a peace dividend we got the dividend we did n't get the peace he reduced the scale of our military dramatically , took 500 , 000 troops out , cut back our navy by 80 ships , knocked our air force down 25 percent our aircraft fleet today are 28 years old the un is failing in its mission to protect the world and to prevent genocide \( applause \) the strategy for america s safety is not to live in what charles krauthammer called a holiday from history , but to realize america must be strong romney we need a strong military to protect us with more troops , more equipment and better care when our troops come home \( applause \) we also need a strong economy so we can have a strong military , and we need strong families and values to teach our kids to build a strong economy and a strong military \( applause \) hume thank you , governor last round , wendell goler wendell \? \( applause \) goler gentlemen , i want to ask you a series of questions on no particular subject these are simply questions i have n't had a chance to ask yet congressman paul , i want to start with you you have drawn some of the strongest reactions of any person on the stage , both pro and con , sir when ronald reagan became a republican , he said he had n't left the democratic party , the democrats had left him given your differences with the other gentlemen on the stage , has the republican party left you \? have these gentlemen left the republican party \? paul i think in many ways they have n't followed our platform and they do n't follow the constitution so they 're really not following \( inaudible \) i think in many ways we have become big spenders republicans are the big spenders our biggovernment conservatives , they 're part of the neoconservative movement they 've lost their traditions about traditional conservatism and the constitution we have benefited for so many years and decades by having a position of less use of force eisenhower won his election in 1952 by trying to clean up the mess that democrats created in korea nixon won in '68 we continuously won in taking this position of a more commonsensical foreign policy like i said , even george bush won criticizing this interventionism , and now all of a sudden , just in this short period of time , we have accepted the democrats' position on foreign policy , on entitlements , on deficits i mean , we have lost our way no , i think that the position of the republican party today has not fulfilled their traditions and that s why we lost last year and if we do n't go back to our traditions and believe in the constitution , limited government , personal liberties , and a foreign policy that s noninterventionist , that wo n't bankrupt us , so that we can defend this country we ca n't even defend our own cities while we 're prancing around the entire world \( applause \) goler mayor giuliani , given our experience in iraq , does the prospect of a nucleararmed iraq worry you more than the prospect of going to war with iran \? giuliani there s no question that the idea of going to war with iran , or even taking military action against iran would be very dangerous it would be something you would not want to do it would be a last resort but if you 're asking me the question , which is more dangerous , a nucleararmed iran is more dangerous and it should be the clear position of the united states government that we will not allow them to become to become nuclear \( applause \) and i honestly believe and , again , i think this comes from the wisdom of ronald reagan if we can be clear about this , and our allies can understand this , and china and russia can understand that we would take action to stop them from becoming nuclear , in our judgment , you know , when that has to happen , if they thought we were very serious about that , i think the chance of the sanctions working direct , indirect , disinvestment from iran , i think the sanctions working would work much more effectively china and russia have , obviously , economic interests in dealing with iran what they have to see is that america would act and if america acted , that would be inconsistent with what would be good for them you 've got to understand , in foreign affairs , just like in the affairs of people , selfinterest is enormously important you 've got to figure out the other person s selfinterest , and then you have to deal with that and i think our taking a strong position here would be similar to the difference between ronald reagan and jimmy carter , when he was dealing with iran \( applause \) jimmy carter had hostages for 444 days in one hour , the iranians released the hostages and they saw something different in ronald reagan s eyes than in jimmy carter s eyes goler thank you , mayor \( applause \) senator thompson , reporters on your campaign say your stumbles on the terry schiavo case and on the issue of oil drilling in the everglades show that you do n't do your homework the week after , though you took a week off after the last debate speech yesterday was about five minutes long some people say you 're lazy , sir how do you deal with that \? \( laughter \) thompson well no , it s ok let me answer that i was a father at the age of 17 and a husband at the age of 17 i got started working in a factory i borrowed and worked my way through my folks did what they could to help they were country folks came in off the farm i was able to be an assistant us attorney when i was 28 , prosecuting most of the major federal crimes in middle tennessee most of the major ones thompson howard baker selected me to go to washington and be his counsel on the watergate committee at the age of 30 i came back , took on a corrupt state administration , and won against them i went to the united states senate , got elected twice by 20 points in a state that bill clinton carried twice condoleezza rice called upon me to head up an international security advisory board to advise her on international security matters president bush called me to help shepherd chief justice nowchief justice john roberts' nomination through the judiciary committee if a man can do all that and be lazy , i recommend it to everybody \( laughter \) \( applause \) hume and that is it for us tonight our thanks to the candidates thompson and i should add , the most important the most important part is i'm a proud father of five two of them are under the age of four so let me add that to the list \( laughter \) \( applause \) hume our thanks to the candidates and their staffs , to our debate partner , the republican party of florida , and also to all the great people here at the shingle creek resort candidates , please note our next debate is in iowa , tuesday , december 4th that s just less than a month before the caucus themselves we 'll see you there
good morning , mr davis hello' how are you feeling \? we 'll see ! ' behold al davis , the owner of the the occasion was the national football league s annual meetings in phoenix last march , and mr davis always mr for supplicants trying to get his attention had agreed to a short interview the raiders' press department , adept in the ways of sovietera obfuscation , had neither confirmed nor denied davis s presence in phoenix , but here he was , just after 9 am , standing in the hallway of the arizona biltmore at least you can tell everybody he s well , that he s not dying , davis told me yes nonetheless , the first thing you notice about al davis is his fragility he moves with both hands clutching a walker , taking small , mincing steps , and he has an attendant trailing behind him , seemingly to make sure he does n't topple over backward davis has watery blue eyes and an aquiline nose his sartorial style remains defiantly retro hair in a pompadour , body in a polyester tracksuit he wears a super bowl ring on each hand he is 78 davis began our conversation with a diversionary feint , talking current events instead of football you got these newspapers screaming at the president of the united states to get out , he said , and the president screaming to stay in it concerns me , obviously as it should anyone who has any interest in what s going on in this country davis was concerned about venezuela s president , hugo chavez , too he s going to socialize that country and take away land now , is that bad \? one country cuba survived with it i say survived i do n't want to say prospered i told davis i had no idea he was interested in foreign affairs no , i know foreign affairs , he said from a strategic standpoint dating back to world war ii , and maybe a little before that , to the growth of the third reich this was an interesting place to take things in 1981 , in a conversation with the sportswriter gary smith , davis confessed he was captivated by hitler coming from a jewish man who had grown up in crown heights , brooklyn , the remark invited all sorts of inquiries davis chuckled when i reminded him of the article i did n't tell him that , he said davis paused he had to be stopped , you know \? gary smith \? no , hitler now , was there some admiration for what they were doing \? if you were connected with football , you had to have some admiration you know , quick strike the raiders and their quickstrike , vertical passing game were so successful that , over four decades , the team put together the best winning percentage in the nfl and al davis was both the source and the beneficiary of that success , for no owner inhabits a sports franchise as thoroughly as he does your gardenvariety megalomaniac like george steinbrenner can achieve a certain grandiosity , but babe ruth and joe dimaggio and 20 world series championships put their stamp on the yankees long before steinbrenner made the scene davis has been with the raiders for 43 of the team s 47 seasons he has been to five super bowls and won three times he has been the team s head coach , its general manager and its managing general partner \( davis acquired a small ownership stake in 1966 , then leveraged it into control of the team \) he minted the team s muscular catchphrases just win , baby , pride and poise , commitment to excellence and he chose its silverandblack uniforms \( davis , as it happens , is colorblind \) davis spends most of his time in his oakland aerie i'm not really part of society , he once said steve ortmayer , who worked for davis for 14 years as an assistant coach and director of football operations , says his life is the raiders that s not a statement to be taken lightly , like a lot of people s life is what they do it s to an extent that he has never taken a day off from the raiders never this makes davis the last practitioner of a classical style of sports management you might call personalitydriven football as perfected by paul brown of the cincinnati bengals and george halas of the chicago bears , personalitydriven football is the psychological joining of owner and team davis flouted league decorum in the front office the raiders flouted it on the field but in the new nfl which , in his charmingly outoftime way , davis has likened to ibm teams tend to be owned by captains of industry and are no more an extension of their owners' personalities than their fastfood franchises or theme parks or usedcar empires davis , on the other hand , has no other business we 're not a club where the owner was in the widget business , says amy trask , the raiders' ceo davis pours everything he has into the raiders which may not be enough anymore there was a time when , with apologies to the former nfl commissioner pete rozelle and tex schramm , the president and general manager of the dallas cowboys , you could have called davis the savviest man in the nfl but the league , which has always strived for competitive parity , has caught up with davis in both its breakneck growth and its adoption of many of the raiders' methods , the nfl has bumped up against the limits of personalitydriven football , because it takes more than one man s instincts to run a successful team someone must monitor the salary cap , make sense of the vast amount of data on college prospects and run the stadium which in the raiders' case happens to be one of the most decrepit in sports since 2003 , the raiders have put together the worst record in the nfl davis has been through four head coaches in the past six seasons , most recently the hapless art shell , who also coached the raiders from 1989 to 1994 shell made it through one season the second time around , overseeing the most dismal season in davis s years with the team those raiders were 214 and finished dead last in the league in total yards gained and points scored , and by season s end shell , convinced that a raiders' executive was undermining his standing with davis , was making cryptic references to a fox in the chicken coop an assistant coach offered to fight players on the sideline this is the raiders' baroque period they 're like north korea , one rival team official told me they 're in the community of nations , but they 're kind of not the same official added that the raiders are the only business that has ever said no when he called and asked to leave a message the team and its owner have long been mysterious \( one of davis s players once compared him to greta garbo \) , but the lengthy silences were taken to mean that davis was concocting some ingenious scheme a new offense , a surprise draft choice , even moving the whole team to los angeles , which he did in 1982 for 13 years and has threatened to do again now the silences seem to indicate something else football men are naturally paranoid creatures , and because davis has little life outside football , he maintains a wariness even in his private exchanges what he decides to let you see is what you get , says gene upshaw , a former guard with the raiders who is now the executive director of the nfl players association he s not going to let many people inside his head , his brain , his thinking , his philosophy he s just going to do what he does , and you just accept it and move on upshaw suspects , but cannot exactly confirm , that on a few recent occasions davis asked him to be general manager of the raiders davis would call upshaw and say , i do n't know what i'm going to do or i do n't have anyone to run this club but he never said , gene , please come be my general manager , and upshaw figures this is a purposeful omission , designed to allow davis to maintain a plausible deniability omission is one of davis s favorite strategies he lets others fill in the blanks since his health keeps him away from the field during practices , davis frequents a small room in the raiders' headquarters in alameda , south of oakland , where he spends hours pouring over cutups , quick snatches of video that show every play from the previous week s game if davis crosses paths with an assistant coach , he 'll stop him and ask a purposefully hazy question say , how did that kid beat us across the middle \? the coach will begin nervously scanning his visual memory for the one play that davis is talking about he is wary of davis s temper and humbled by his football knowledge , which despite his age remains unparalleled if he gives the correct answer the safety took a bad angle , say davis will never mention the matter again if the assistant tries to fool him , davis will never let him forget it what davis s friends would most like to hear from him is what s wrong with his health last year , the raiders installed a special elevator in mcafee coliseum , where they play , so that davis could get to the owner s box without climbing any stairs but davis insists his health is fine except for a bum quadriceps i 've known him since i was 17 , and he s never going to admit that he feels bad , says paul maguire , an espn football announcer and former player , who met davis in 1955 if you ask him how he s feeling , he 'll say , my team s not doing well' that concerns him more than any ailment he might have davis s inner circle , a small , footballcentric group , includes three former raiders and members of the pro football hall of fame jim otto , a center who played 15 seasons ted hendricks , a 6foot7 outside linebacker known as the mad stork and george blanda , who provided superb backup quarterback play and fieldgoal kicking until the outlandish age of 48 davis has enormous affection for these men and invariably links his favorite adjective , great , to their names as in the great jim otto until a few years ago , otto and blanda and hendricks could often be seen on the field at games flanking their paterfamilias like some kind of praetorian guard these days , the former raiders are , like davis , considerably more frail otto has had 28 knee surgeries and recently had one of his legs amputated when in town , they often join davis to watch the raiders play from the owner s suite here , there is a certain decorum the exraiders may pipe up to interject an opinion now and again , but if the team is losing , the three of them will sit silently while davis stews it was a long year last year , hendricks says during a raiders loss , the only noise in davis s suite is a fus illade of insults after nearly every play offense has always been his primary interest , and when the raiders are n't throwing long attacking , as davis likes to say he has been known to dispatch the great jim otto to visit with the raiders' assistant coaches and , as otto puts it , remind them of something that s going on down on the field the saturday night dinners davis gives before road games have a more jovial feel otto , hendricks and blanda are often there , joined by davis s friend dr robert albo his brother , jerry and their wives , including davis s wife of nearly 53 years , carol , whom he calls carohlee unusual for davis , there is not a word of football discussed more recently , davis has also discouraged the discussion of politics , owing to tense arguments that hendricks says predate the current bush administration davis never drinks alcohol , but he s a lively host , and the conversation hops from military history to women s basketball to one of davis s secret passions , music among the many friends davis has eulogized over the years are the jazz singers sarah vaughn and billy eckstine the eulogy is one of davis s best mediums he is sweet and often funny , even for those with whom he crossed swords get a good picture , please i want everyone to know i'm alive that was davis s unusual request last december , after he made his way into the raiders' locker room following a sloppy , turnoverfilled loss to the st louis rams as this and his proofoflife moment in phoenix demonstrate , death has been on davis s mind quite a lot lately it fascinates and confounds him it s the only thing that i do n't think i 've licked in my life , he says in an espn documentary that aired in 2003 i was n't able to save some people who were dying when davis s loved ones fall ill , he snaps into action former raiders like willie brown are dispatched to deliver checks to cover medical expenses , airplanes are commandeered to whisk the sick to distant hospitals anything to keep friends and former players alive davis credits his steadfast bedside vigil with helping carol recover from a heart attack she suffered in 1979 when a raiders employee named del courtney contracted guillainbarr syndrome , a rare disease that can cause complete muscular paralysis , in 1971 , davis would stand next to him and say , you 're a raider , and raiders do n't die \( courtney made a miraculous recovery \) but even with his interventions there have been the inevitable disappointments the death of former raiders like john matuszak , who died of heart failure in 1989 lyle alzado , who succumbed to cancer in 1992 and more recently , bill walsh , who coached with the raiders for one season and whom davis visited two days before he died this summer when we met in phoenix , davis was still reeling from the deaths of ernie ladd and ernie wright , whom he coached as an assistant with the american football league s chargers in the 1960s lately , davis has reached beyond his inner circle to talk about matters of mortality last year , he called jack kemp , whom he met when they were with the chargers kemp as quarterback and davis as wide receivers coach kemp had been busy writing opeds calling for the abolition of the estate tax , which his fellow republicans often refer to as the death tax al called me when he read one of my articles , kemp told me , and he said that i was right , and that he was calling to say he supported tax reform and putting an end to the socalled death tax davis was not putting his own affairs in order , he assured kemp he said he was looking out for his africanamerican players who were the first in their families to earn big money kemp had n't heard much from davis in recent years , but he was giddy over the endorsement i think al s a good oldfashioned hubert humphrey democrat , and i'm a ronald reagan republican , and here we were in solid agreement , he says another recent davis confidant is bill romanowski , the allpro linebacker who played his final two seasons in oakland after suffering more than 20 concussions in his playing career , romo , as he s known , set about creating a brain fuel that would restore his mental powers \( that romanowski was considered one of the nfl s dirtiest players makes you wonder whether this was a good idea \) romo dubbed his brain fuel neuro1 and now markets it as an elixir to help you confidently recall names and facts and to enhance one s quality of life and performance feeling fully revitalized , romanowski recently called his former employer and said , mr davis , i think i can change your life ! davis summoned romanowski to oakland , and now , romanowski says , he visits davis three or four times a year to discuss nutrition when i asked if neuro1 had enhanced davis s mental acuity , romanowski paused and then said , well , you talked to him , did n't you \? davis s football intelligence was never so much a matter of x s and o s as a cultural consciousness that davis has called his gestalt the raiders were a peculiar mixture of davis s desires well into the 1960s and '70s , pro football retained a militaristic snap george plimpton , the journalist and erstwhile quarterback , wrote that the '60s were so violent that it is impossible to accept the metaphor of football , and its popularity , without wondering whether it reflects some of the country s excesses as a student of foreign affairs going back to the third reich , davis plundered the association with gusto for years , the gameday schedule he distributed to the team listed 1 o'clock game time as we go to war ! military metaphors abounded the nfl afl merger of 1970 , which davis initially opposed , reminded him of the agreement at yalta he issued statements like the guerrilla wins if he does n't lose howie long , a defensive end who studied history at villanova , found that after his indoctrination with davis he began imagining the team s practice center in alameda as a fortress city in the hills of cortona , something to be defended at all costs but the hard line davis took in metaphor disguised a more liberal heart , an almost tender inclusiveness what we tend to remember as the badboy oakland raiders the m lange of odds and ends , oddities and irregulars , factory seconds and seeming chaingang escapees , as the writer mark ribowsky put it was in fact an early template for modern professional football it is well known that davis provided feed and care to troubled souls like alzado and matuszak it is less well known that davis was among the first wave of owners to scout the historically black colleges , from which he pulled , for example art shell , the rumbler on the left side of his offensive line davis could look at a castoff and see a future star , like jim plunkett , who had been cut by the san francisco fortyniners , or todd christensen , a washedup fullback whom davis converted into a rangy tight end if davis was more paranoid and combative than other owners he has sued the nfl numerous times his players looked upon him as unconcerned with reputation or conventional wisdom the truth of it is i 'd been cut twice and had tryouts for four teams , todd christensen told me , so he could have been khameini or osama bin laden for all i cared the mix the raiders achieved was revolutionary , and davis managed a number of historic firsts he became the first owner to draft an africanamerican quarterback in the first round , eldridge dickey , way back in 1968 he made art shell the first africanamerican head coach in the modern era he made tom flores the first hispanic coach amy trask is the first woman to serve as chief executive of an nfl team in the 1960s , davis moved two games out of segregated cities in the deep south when he learned the stands and local hotels would be segregated i just think he is absolutely unencumbered by prejudice of any type , trask says davis was n't simply attempting a demographic shift but wholesale behavioral modification in the 1970s , some nfl teams were still enforcing a ludicrous , topdown propriety the rival kansas city chiefs , for example , required players to wear red blazers when they traveled together the raiders would have none of it these are the greatest athletes in the world , john madden once said they 're like artists and if you take their creativity away from them by making them robotic , then they 're going to play like robots the raiders' ethic was organic and bottomup sometime in the 1970s , jim plunkett and fred biletnikoff began sitting on their helmets during practice there was nothing particularly special about sitting on your helmet other than most other teams in the league would n't let you do it , and for the player it conveyed a certain psychic benefit the raiders' idea of a mandatory team function was camaraderie , a thursdaynight drinking session masterminded by some of the more intimidating members of the offensive and defensive lines \( at super bowl xv in new orleans , in 1981 , the raiders moved camaraderie to the french quarter , and they encircled and shared litersize hurricanes as if they were standing in a huddle \) the raiders were not unfamiliar with northern california s counterculture scene linebacker chip oliver left the team to live in a commune linebacker phil villapiano was beaten senseless by a group of hell s angels in a bar fight gene upshaw kibitzed with bobby seale , huey newton and other members of the black panthers at one of upshaw s oakland bars seale and newton , upshaw says , were raiders fans , because they admired the team s fierce sense of loyalty indeed , it is tempting to regard the team davis cobbled together as the nfl s first radical political organization , with a militant ethos and an openminded approach toward membership al always felt the enormity of the raiders , the mystique of the raiders , could control players , because players wanted to fit into that mystique , steve ortmayer says a more conventional owner might have insisted on a few nods to decorum coats and ties on the team plane , no fraternizing with the panthers but davis s refusal to commit to a moral code other than just win , baby helped him juggle all the heterogeneity excluding anyone on the basis of race or attitude might cost him a player and give another owner an edge davis had an expansive vision of what could make a football team what other teams craved , the raiders had in spades camaraderie what changed was not so much davis losing his touch as the rest of the league catching up two events leveled the playing field one was the nfl s belated adoption of more expansive free agency and a salary cap in 1993 as ortmayer puts it , this was a problem because it broke down the ability of al to run the operation totally as a family suddenly the raiders' camaraderie had less appeal than the big contract the other change was that the nfl became more like the raiders the nfl now has africanamerican coaches like tony dungy and lovie smith and africanamerican quarterbacks like steve mcnair and vince young the remnants of fauxmilitary culture have given way to a relaxed atmosphere that can accommodate even those players with attitude problems randy moss , whom the raiders acquired from minnesota in 2005 , quit on the team last season he suggested in a radio interview , unwisely but perhaps not incorrectly , that there s a lot of funny things going on around here in this organization when the raiders traded moss to new england this spring , it was a measure of how the nfl has evolved that the wonkish and corporate patriots , rather than the raiders , were thought to provide a nurturing environment in which a provocateur like moss could flourish davis s cultural innovations had been integrated into the nfl s mother brain and thanks to further measures like harsh punishments for on and offthefield transgressions , the league has entered a period where there s very little cultural difference between the franchises the gap between the smartest owner and the dumbest owner is much narrower than it was a generation ago , says michael maccambridge , the author of america s game , a history of professional football this change has proved beneficial for historically benighted franchises like the arizona cardinals and disastrous for oncesmart franchises like the raiders as the new century approached , and the raiders had n't won a super bowl since 1984 , they had the desperate look of every other mediocre nfl franchise all that remained of personalitydriven football were davis s quirks not long ago , i called rich gannon , the quarterback who led the raiders to the super bowl in 2003 , and asked him to explain davis s management style he s a complicated guy , gannon said i think he s misunderstood at times , and other times people s interpretations and impressions are fairly accurate when gannon came to oakland in 1999 , the raiders were already sliding into mediocrity davis had let his personality run wild he was on his third head coach in five seasons the raiders' players were teetering on the edge of revolt guys coming in 5 , 10 minutes late to the practice field without their jerseys on , gannon recalled players that had total disrespect for the coaches and the other players just a sick , sick , debilitating environment to work in davis was still practicing personalitydriven football , but in impatient rather than visionary mode this affected his coaches most conspicuously in 1998 , davis hired jon gruden , who was 34 , to be head coach along with personnel man bruce allen and offensive coordinator bill callahan , gruden began the slow process of restoring order to the raiders by adding battletested veterans gannon , charlie garner and jerry rice but davis clashed with gruden over his contract and , in a huff , allowed him to leave for tampa bay in 2002 allen followed gruden a season later callahan led the raiders to the 2003 super bowl , lost to gruden s buccaneers and was fired a year later in one swift stroke , all the people who had returned the raiders to respectability who had brought the kind of fresh ideas that smoothed the rough edges of davis s personality had vanished that left only davis look what s happened since then , gannon told me they 've had the worst record in the nfl over the last four years last year that was a travesty he added , you could have brought in tom landry or vince lombardi and it would n't have made any difference landry and lombardi being unavailable , last winter davis turned to lane kiffin , an offensive coordinator at the university of southern california \( strangely , davis had first interviewed steve sarkisian , another usc coach sarkisian reportedly turned down the job , though the raiders claim it was never offered to him \) kiffin is a boyish 32 , two years younger than the raiders' defensive tackle warren sapp when kiffin interviewed with davis late one night in january , the old owner dazzled his young pupil by reeling off the precise heights , weights and 40yarddash times of prospects going back decades when i met up with kiffin a few months later , he was still giddy in telling the story imagine you 're interviewing with an owner who s been a great coach as well , who s already in the hall of fame , kiffin said he s not just managing the team interview this is about x s and o s , coaches , playcalling , everything , because he knows it all far from a na f , however , kiffin has so far proved to be a capable bureaucratic infighter the raiders had the no 1 choice in april s draft , and davis is credited with selecting jamarcus russell , the fiercely large quarterback from louisiana state university \( at the end of july , russell still had not signed with the raiders , and the team signed daunte culpepper to compete for the starting job \) but oakland s boldest offseason move , credited to kiffin , was to trade moss to new england for two players and a draft choice kiffin installed mark jackson , an associate from usc , as director of football development , and he moved robert gallery , a former high pick , from offensive right tackle , where davis reportedly wanted him , to left guard kiffin is thoroughly unmoved by davis s just win , baby propaganda obviously , there s an unbelievable tradition and history there , kiffin told me but over the course of time , things change it s an organization that s fallen on hard times lately it s no secret he realizes that though he talks to kiffin on the phone every day , davis has shown signs of receding in recent years one agent told me that last season he never spoke to davis in the course of contract negotiations a former assistant coach told me davis had minimal , if any , input into the game plans davis has even become something of a league man a persistent noodge to pete rozelle \( who called davis a charming rogue \) , davis rallied owners last spring to approve an extension to the collective bargaining agreement paul tagliabue , the departing commissioner , appointed davis to the committee to select his successor davis even gave up his longstanding suit against alameda county , which for a time controlled the sale of raiders tickets davis is the team s titular head , and will be as long he s alive , but the team is no longer a revolutionary force last season , friends report , you could see the pain on his face clearly , the old methods were n't working tom flores , who coached the raiders to two super bowl titles in the 1980s , visited davis in may and found him blaming himself for the raiders' recent frustrations i think he realizes he s not 57 years old , flores says he wants to do this and get it done as quickly as possible but he knows it ca n't be done overnight he feels like he wants to do more , bill parcells , another longtime davis friend , says i just hope time does n't run out , you know \? huddlehuddlehuddlehuddle ! part of lane kiffin s plan to revitalize the raiders is to make the team s training camp in napa valley a bastion of positive reinforcement when i visited one afternoon , kiffin was making his way through the ranks and tossing footballs to unsuspecting defensive tackles when he flipped one to warren sapp , who checked into camp at a svelte 282 pounds , kiffin said , he s lost weight and he s working on his hands ! sapp replied , i 've had these since i was 5 , coach ! even beyond the usual optimism at the start of training camp , a new friskiness prevailed when the raiders lined up to run a play , kiffin s assistants gathered behind the line of scrimmage as soon as the play was over , they ran up like expectant stage moms to congratulate the players davis was not in napa that day or given his ability to transcend time and space , perhaps he was the reliably surrealistic raiders press department would neither confirm nor deny his presence in napa or oakland or anywhere else \( he showed up on the practice field the next day \) davis had once been an omnipresent figure at these practices gene upshaw remembers how , when he was still playing , he would see davis lurking behind him as he was about to run a play and then , after running it , he 'd see davis clear across the field and then , after running another play , upshaw would look up and there was davis standing right behind him again davis had covered the field faster than lester hayes ! every day i go on the football field i think about him , willie brown , now an assistant coach with the team , told me if any raider in napa seemed linked intellectually to davis s old raider irregulars , it was jerry porter , who , with the departure of randy moss , has become the raiders' best and most mercurial wideout last year , after a feud with art shell , porter showed up in napa wearing a professional wrestling belt and a tshirt featuring an extended middle finger shell would later suspend porter for four games for insubordination after porter yelled at him during a practice according to a report in the san francisco chronicle , porter also availed himself of al davis s private parking space in napa , porter was claiming selective amnesia \( i do n't remember last year , he said \) , making a series of leaping catches and periodically throwing a penalty flag to entertain his teammates i pulled porter aside after practice and asked him what it was like to play for al davis he shrugged his shoulders i do n't necessarily play for al , he said say again \? i said i do n't necessarily play for al , porter said al s not our coach even so , i said , between the raider mystique , the five super bowls and just win , baby , the davis legend , if not davis himself , must surely permeate the raiders' facilities no , you see him in passing , porter said we have a good backandforth conversation of about 20 words , and we 're on our way and what wisdom did davis , the aficionado of the longbomb passing game , impart \? porter was hardpressed to recall anything specific something about football , he said this is the postdavis raiders a team with its own quirks , coaches and vision , but without the considerable imprint of its owner through the ministrations of dr romanowski , davis may be able to emerge every now and then to declare that reports of his death are greatly exaggerated lane kiffin may succeed in reversing the embarrassments of the last four seasons but davis s personalitydriven football is dead jerry porter delivered the eulogy , without malice the raider mystique does not exist anymore
you do n't favor deadlines for withdrawing troops what would be the mechanism you would employ to encourage the iraqis to take steps toward political reconciliation \? well , first of all , on the issue of setting timetables for withdrawal , very few people that i respect share the view that that s an effective way of doing anything but setting a date for surrender with the ensuing consequences even jim baker wrote , in the washington post a week ago , date for withdrawal is disaster and so i have no doubt that that is simply a way of ensuring that we are going to be involved in a war for generations to come so how do you motivate the malaki government \? well , one of the ways is go sit down and have dinner with him like i like lindsey graham and i did last week and said , look , guys , you 've got to do it we 're telling you , there s been votes in both houses of congress which portend , unless the american people see measurable success , that we 're going to be out of here no matter whether i happen to agree with it or not make it very clear to them that they that time is not on their side and you do n't have to set dates but you obviously can tell them what benchmarks you expect to be accomplished and some of them are the ones i just mentioned to you from your standpoint , how long would the new strategy of the surge need to last to create the conditions for a sustainable political process \? i do know that these demonstrations in najaf , which were against the united states but were peaceful and they were monitored not by us troops they were by iraqi police and military i do know that when iraqi and us military units are together , as they are in some 53 outposts throughout baghdad , that they act with effect are they capable of doing it by themselves now \? no and when will we reach that crossover point where they are able to function without being hand in glove with us forces \? i do n't know the answer to that but i know they 've got to show measurable progress and that s , i think , the key to whether we are going to be able to maintain our effort there or not and petraeus , who i have the highest regard for , says that he believes that it is doable i have great respect for nie s , although we know in that past nie s have not been notoriously accurate , particularly where weapons of mass destruction are concerned so i have the greatest respect for them but i have a greater respect for the opinion of general petraeus , who looked me in the eye and said , if i think this thing is going to fail , i 'll tell the president and then i 'll tell the american people well how long did general petraeus tell you the surge needs to last \? he did n't say how long but he s a smart enough general and so is odierno and you know this , michael they 're smart enough to know whether we are showing progress or not and it wo n't be gauged on the number of suicide bombers ask the israelis how hard suicide bombers are to stop they completely seal their borders with the west bank and gaza and they still get they still get suicide bombers coming across what will it be gauged on \? whether the iraqi military is able to take over more and more of the responsibilities and whether these areas are kept into an environment of security so that the political and economic life can move forward it s the classic and i hate to insult your intelligence and i know i do that when i say some of these things and i apologize but the fact is it s the classic counterinsurgency strategy which has either succeeded or failed in the past sometimes the best counterinsurgency strategy does n't work it fails but at least we 've now got the right strategy i know that these answers are probably too long and i apologize no , they 're not too long ok they 're not too long at all feel free to express yourself the way you want we 're going to run a transcript on the web ok you know , a point that general petraeus alluded to in a recent interview on the lehrer newshour was that the timelines for accomplishing things in iraq are rather long , given the difficulties there and also counterinsurgency is inherently a timeconsuming operation if you try and protect and win over a population expectations in washington are that results should be achieved in the near term how can you reconcile these two if you sort of well , in a way it s a matter of leadership , to explain to the american people where we are , where we have what progress or lack of progress we have accomplished , and probably keyed to some degree on the level of american casualties as one of the measures of whether we are making progress or not i think if the american people can be shown signs of progress and improvement in the situation and at the same time be made aware of the consequences of a set date for withdrawal , then i think that we could probably maintain at least a significant amount of support on the part of the american people is it long and hard and tough \? yes one of the worst aspects of this conflict was all this rosy scenario , few deadenders , last throes , that raise the expectations of the american people to a unrealistic degree i never begin a conversation about iraq without saying it s long and hard and tough it will not be easy but i also try to point out what the stakes are here and my criticism of the democrats , with the exception of joe biden , who says they would kind of break up into different entities , which i think is totally unrealistic , as most experts do , you know , you would , as somebody wrote the other day , you 'd have to separate bedrooms sunni and shia married to each other they offer no alternative they offer no scenario as to what happens next when do you think you 'd have to show results \? i do n't know the answer to that i do n't know the answer i know that , for example , i 've been a bit surprised at the level , at the amount of progress that they 've achieved with only two , and now three , of the five brigades i 've also been not surprised but sorry that some of this activity has gone outside of baghdad , particularly into diyala province and some of that , i think , has motivated this decision on the extension of the troops over there , which i'm sure was not an easy decision but in a perverse sort of way i applaud it because petraeus told us at a hearing he said , if i think i need more , i'm going to ask for more and the president has told me i'm going to get more and so , you know , and i 'd like to ps postscript what , again , you already know there s only one thing worse than an overstressed and fatigued army and that s a defeated army i 'd like to just ask two questions and adam will jump in if you were elected president , you 'd have to deal with two either one of two kind of scenarios one would be that the surge had was a success to some degree mmhmm militarily in that there had been some political reconciliation in iraq if that was the state of affairs when you became president , how would you see the future of american forces in iraq \? what would be the role of american troops a future role of american troops in iraq \? how many would there be there \? you know , where would they be \? what would they do \? a scenario that i would envision is that they gradually withdraw to their bases and the iraqis take over the daytoday security requirements of the country there can be times when they 'd be called upon both for air power and even other cases where the ground power as well but then eventually leave but let me just expand that a little bit to you suppose that we get an environment of security in great parts of iraq then you 're able to rebuild the infrastructure then the oil revenues begin to flow higher then you begin to process have a process of economic restoration and development all this is dependent upon an environment an atmosphere of security and then you could see other countries in the region contributing and out of the region i recently had a meeting with musharraf musharraf said pakistan , indonesia and malaysia would be glad to come in and help out in many respects , if you had the secure environment clearly , if you could get this environment into some kind of control , that jordan , egypt and syria excuse me , jordan , egypt and saudi arabia have an interest in helping out in making sure that you get progress in a broad variety of ways so the scenario that i would envision and i will admit it is the optimistic scenario is that you get the secure environment you begin to have security around the oil facilities you restore more electricity to baghdad and other parts of the country and then you get other countries involved as well and you are able to , because of increased oil revenues , have an efficient way of getting that money to the people and to a sustainable economic development but realistically , under the optimistic scenario , you 're going to have , at least at first , a substantial american presence yes and a fairly gradual drawdown how many forces did you envision and how long do you think drawdown \? i do n't know the answer to that , michael i 've been a pretty good armchair general , a guy who always stays away from from any possibility of getting injured so i ca n't predict that but i know that we will be able to know whether they are progressing or not and i have no illusions i have no illusions about the length of time that the american people will remain patient well let s turn go the other scenario let s say the bush administration has allowed that the surge strategy may not work mmhmm especially since it depends on the actions of others the iraqis to reconcile and i think you yourself in some of your statements pointed out that plans often are , you know , do n't survive the first contact so let s say the surge does n't produce the results that are hoped for the iraqis do n't reconcile you do n't see the kind of steps that you 're hoping for on the part of the iraqi leadership what s the next course of action that you would take as president \? what s plan b \? i have no plan b if i saw that doomsday scenario evolving , then i would try to come up with one but i cannot give you a good alternative because if i had a good alternative , maybe we could consider it now every alternative that i know of that is keyed to a date for withdrawal , which that would dictate , is chaos in the region and genocide and then the other nations play and it emboldens the iranians and the syrians and then you see more trouble in lebanon and the israelis come under more and more attacks because of the emboldenment by being emboldened by our failure so i 'd love to tell you , whoa , then what we have to do is move outside the border , say to kuwait , and parachute in when there is some kind of a problem arises please what s wrong with that \? you ca n't the fact of modern warfare is that you ca n't parachute into places you ca n't go in without a solid base of support if you 're going to be engaged in heavy fighting we 're having trouble doing things with the situation the way it is , much less having people based outside of iraq well what about some of the democrats , like senator clinton , talk about this strategy of a containment within the borders of iraq , which would posit a limited number of forces , maybe in kurdistan and anbar , with a limited mission of engaging in counterterrorism activity what s wrong with that approach \? that assumes somehow that the place has n't descended into chaos and again , most every military expert that i know believes that it will if if we leave well , she s well , if we ca n't do it reduce and limit our role i just do n't know stay in iraq with a limited force to do what \? to be rocketed \? to be rocketed in their bases \? to be well , look , if you can find the credible military experts who i admire and respect that say that that has any viability , i would very seriously consider it the only viable strategy that i know of is the strategy we are pursuing now so i know that many other senators have many other scenarios as to what should be done i do n't think they 're credible there s containment within the borders of iraq , there s containment outside the borders of iraq , there s partition , which you 've already addressed mmhmm and i think the last one i think that s been put forward was putting the emphasis on training the iraqis and embedding trainers , standing back from a large conventional force you know , maybe not have a combat role in iraq but purely a training role that s been put forward as an option i 'd be very reluctant to send young men into a country where there is chaos and tell them that they 're going to be trainers when general abizaid i think was testifying i'm pretty sure you once made , you were arguing against the status quo approach yes you and senator graham and saying status quo was not the option you were saying if we were n't , and you made a point that if we were n't going to increase , and you spoke for a different strategy perhaps , you know , under those circumstances the best thing to do would be to withdraw are there circumstances where , if the surge did n't work , you do n't like these other options , withdrawal is not a good option but maybe it would just become a recognition of reality in a sense that why expend american lives in pursuit of other strategies that are n't effective \? well i think in our hearings when i was arguing against the status quo was that i was arguing that the eventual result would be us withdrawal because we could n't succeed i mean democracies wo n't support continuous failure , unending failure i think that s what i was i think i heard you say in one of the speeches that at a certain point you reach a point where we 're just getting status quo you 're not going to send more americans in to die yeah yeah if the strategy has failed if the strategy has failed , which it was and which i had pointed out for three and a half years , then continuing of a failed strategy is a waste of additional lives i think that s pretty obvious michael s point i think is if you come in in two years as president and find that the surge has failed well , at that time , if i find that it has failed , then we would obviously have to consider what the other options are but i do n't know what those are i do n't know if i knew of a good option to the present one i would probably give it serious consideration now i simply do n't know of one and when i ask military experts i say , hey i just asked gen jim jones , one of my dearest friends , what s the option \? i do n't know i do n't know maybe the option is at a certain point it s not worth losing any more american lives then you pull out is that at all an option to you \? yeah , but you have to understand that that pullout is different from the vietnam war where we pulled out and came home we pull out , they pull after us i mean then we have a whole new set of challenges to our nation s security , including chaos in the region i guess another way of asking it is under what circumstances would you consider withdrawal \? the this strategy fails , obviously , you have to then examine what your other options are but the political reality is , and i understand it , that americans will not support a continued failed strategy for an unlimited period of time and we have to show progress , otherwise that patience will run out sooner rather than later could you see sending more troops \? my impression was you thought early on that we needed more i always believed that but again , i looked general petraeus in the eye , he said , if i need more troops i 'll ask for them , and if i think this strategy is failing i will tell the president and the american people i have great trust in him and when he tells me that and that s why we have just seen this extension of 15 months to the military , because he said , look , i'm going to have to have some more troops over there that s why they 're sending a couple more of these guard brigades also do you think the current increases are sufficient \? or as president would you increase the number of troops in the military \? i would evaluate it but at first blush i would like to see i 've always called for 90 , 000 or 100 , 000 additional army and marines but i think that part of that would be dictated by the situation in the world too if we settled the north korean issue , which is by no means clear to me , if things progress then maybe not but if things continue to deteriorate , not just in the middle east but in other parts of the world , then i might have to ask for more but i 'd evaluate it at the time it s going to take us a while to get this buildup , the increase that we 're already embarked on so i 'd like to see the effects of that before piling on to that one thing that you have n't mentioned is the utility of discussions with iraq s neighbors the iranians , the syrians , maybe the sunniarab states , the turks as to how that might or might not contribute to stability in iraq what your sense as to what might be accomplished through diplomacy \? i think that it s very clear , and if we can show the kind of progress then you will see greater participation on the part of at least the friendly arab states jordan , egypt , saudi arabia i think the syrians and the iranians both have been emboldened by our failure after the initial victory they could n't have been more cooperative and as we have failed they have become more and more belligerent and active i just read again today that the iranians are providing this especially lethal ied and training people to use them the iranians encouraged hezbollah to attack israel , we all know that and so would i sit down and have direct facetoface talks with them \? probably not because that would legitimize a government that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of israel , which they say repeatedly would i have lines of communications with them \? sure absolutely and probably the most overrated thing in the world and in the world of national security issues is this sit down facetoface there s plenty of ways to communicate in the case of our other allies i think one of the mistakes we 've made all along is not having them more involved in a broad variety of ways and i would try to make it clear to them what the consequences of failure are as well , as far as how it would impact their national security iran seems to be moving ahead with its nuclear program yep some argue that to the extent they might have been emboldened by the american difficulties in iraq sure and their nuclear programs might be a case of it as president , how would you attempt to deal with it \? would you rely essentially on a containment strategy \? economic sanctions \? or would you seriously consider a military option \? i would do everything that i could to increase the economic , diplomatic , moral pressures on iran , including doing what we can to encourage the prodemocracy elements within iran i do believe that there is some limited effect of some of the sanctions that have already been brought to bear against the iranians and if the united nations would n't do it , i would work more closely without european allies we have , at least in france coming up , and in germany , different leadership than we 've had in the past so i have some renewed optimism about better cooperation from an effort on the part of the europeans and i think there are many , many areas that have yet to be exhausted but i agree with the president of the united states when he said we will not allow iran to destroy the state of israel , or any other state for that matter and so , would i use the military option \? under almost every scenario i would not but to say that under no circumstances would you ever use the military option , then would i think would not be the right way to make the iranians understand that we will not tolerate the extinction of another nation and so , i guess in some i would not take the military option off the table , but i certainly believe there s many other options that need to be explored and traveled before we would even seriously consider it it s a very complicated operation , by the way , from a tactical standpoint how many years does the united states have i do n't know i do n't know the answer , michael some say two , some say seven i do n't know the answer to that but i think that we have good enough intelligence and so do our allies to know if they really actually acquire one at least i hope so given that you are also uncertain of the surge does n't it makes sense to start thinking about some plan b \? in other words , if you come into the white house and the surge has not worked oh , obviously we will know if it s not working or working we will know within months i do n't know how many months , but within months we will know then , if it s apparent that it is failing , then i would obviously , you would have to seriously consider what the options are so far every expert who i have talked to knows of no good option now some may be less bad than others but knows of no good option  look , adam , this will be dictated by the american people the american people will dictate this the next president will have to make these decisions and the one thing i thought was interesting about there are so many of these ideas that are put forward by people here and they seem attractive the point you 're making is that when you look at them and scrutinize them and kind of put them to the test you think they 're sorely deficient and kind of what i took you to be saying was that really the surge is the best of the new strategy is the best hope there is to try to reverse the decline or salvage the situation , and that absent that you really have to confront seriously of the possibility of withdrawal from iraq of course but i would confront those issues if the surge is failing for me to say , well , i'm supporting the surge and this new strategy , but here s what we 're going to do if it fails we 'll have plenty of time to develop alternate strategies , if there are any , if this new strategy fails so what you 're asking me to do i mean we 're going around and around on this , in all due respect what you 're asking me to do is say , well , if it fails we must do b i want to devote all of my effort , every fiber in my body to see that this thing succeeds we will know if it s going to fail so i am not , i am not going to tell you what the alternatives are because i know of no good alternative but what i take you to be saying , and i'm not trying to yeah beat a dead horse \? here is that if the surge fails there may be no better alternative than withdrawal from iraq and as i say , if the surge fails i will not have any i will not be able to decide that the american people will demand it they will not be satisfied with an openended commitment without succeeding in iraq so these kind of socalled partial plans or partial steps of limited deployment in iraq or a partition , which we might enforce , or training , you think it s something the american public would n't accept well , i think they might accept again , it s awful hard to know what the situation is at that time whether it s i mean it s just impossible to because there s a thousand scenarios but i do believe that history shows us , americans will not continue to support an overseas engagement involving the loss of american lives for an unlimited period of time unless they see some success and then , when they run out of patience , they will demand that we get out and if we get out , i believe that there will be chaos and genocide and we will be in a very , very long conflict can you see circumstances where you would try to argue to the american people that we need to actually send more troops in \? that the problem with the surge , it did n't work because there were n't enough \? it would depend on whether or not i thought that would bring success or not petraeus obviously felt that he needs to do what the defense department has just announced so i think it would depend on whether i thought that that would be a viable solution or just putting good people after good people and so i do n't if he came to you and said , give me another x number of troops , i think we can make this work , even there are no signs of progress it s a very hypothetical situation , but obviously the burden of proof would be on the military commanders at the end of the vietnam war , after the tet offensive , the military came and said we need 400 , 000 additional troops i guess it was , and the american congress said no so we left so we lost the war i do n't have any more iraq questions , i'm just thinking and i understand you do n't want to prejudge the surge the american public , the pentagon and the various agencies will look to the president and the white house for what our future strategy will be , and that 'll have to be something if the strategy is succeeding they will not ask for an alternate strategy if it s failing then obviously they will we will know over the next some months whether it s succeeding or failing we 'll have plenty of time to devise a strategy if we are forced to withdraw do you think we 'll know before the caucuses \? i do n't know when is that \? january well we 'll know i mean secretary gates and petraeus have said they expect to see indications over the summer whether trends are positive so if it fails you 'll know before the caucuses , if it succeeds you may only have a partial verdict can i ask you if yeah , and this also is related to the maliki government , also , whether they are functioning effectively go ahead if you were president and you had to pick a team military team , civilian team who are the sorts of national security advisers that you draw on and that you expect to draw on \? gen jim jones is one of my closest and longtime friends and associates , so i think he would play a key role i think so far that gates is doing a good job you might keep him on in his current capacity \? i hate to engage in this but it seems to me that he is doing a fine job i would also try to get some people into the pentagon who are very successful in other parts of american life fred smith of fedex john chambers of cisco people who have succeeded and know how to manage our problem in the pentagon today is that there s never been really strong management for a long time i would go to these people and say , look , you 've made a billion dollars , come on now and do what david packard did years ago , serve your country , be in charge of acquisition reform , be in charge of weapons or you know , make the pentagon run , that kind of thing you 've got to get people , i think , who have the proven skills at managing , and then try to get the world s largest bureaucracy under some kind of efficiencies what type of person do you think would serve as the chairman of the joint chiefs \? hmm , if petraeus succeeds , obviously he would be one of the candidates i think odierno is clearly good every report i hear about admiral fallon is good i think that there are some people now , like mcmaster yeah but i see them emerging as kind of a battletested level of leadership and proven skills senator obama had talked about what to do i complimented him i thought he said that if the president s veto is n't overridden go ahead and give him a clean bill and let s support , you know , give them the money they need do you think he s been acting responsibly on this \? oh , i do n't i respect his views and his position i do n't i 've made it very clear that i think that this is a struggle that transcends electoral politics and what happens now will affect future generations of americans and for us to be engaged in partisan political activity is a source of great sadness and sometimes anger how many times have we taken up the war in iraq on the floor of the senate already \? i mean how many times do we have to \? how many times do we have to have a resolution \? how many times do we have to have a debate and a vote \? and , no , it does n't affect the morale of the men and women who are over there fighting , but it does n't increase their respect for us and i 'll tell you that from personal experience meaning what \? they asked me when i went over there , when are you guys going to stop arguing about this \? when are we going to have  privates , corporals , sergeants they go online , they know what s going on they 're very aware now , does this mean they are n't going to do their job , carry out their mission \? absolutely not they 'll shoulder their weapon and they 'll go fight but , as i say , they do n't believe that they 'd like to have a set strategy and support from the american people they 'd like to have that when you tell somebody that you support them but you do n't support the mission that they 're on and you believe that they 're going to fail if you go on it , that s not exactly the kind of support that these young people are seeking i do n't question anyone s motives nor anyone s i question his judgment and the others' judgment on this issue i question their judgment and i question their judgment because i do not believe that you can just set a date for withdrawal and then , again , with the exception of biden , then what do you do \? do you think , between him and mrs clinton , do you think one of them has a better command of the issue \? yeah you know , i ca n't make those kinds of judgments did you meet recently with president bush \? i have a meeting with him this afternoon \? what s going to happen \? well , one of the things that i'm going to tell him , and i do n't often talk about my conversations with the president , the american people need to be told more often what s happening they need to know what s happening where we 're succeeding where we 're failing where we 've made progress where we have n't here s the state of readiness here s why we continue to see suicide bombers in anbar province 16 of the 24 sheiks are on our side now in diyala province things are tough , some of these al qaeda people have fled , and mahdi army , have fled baghdad and they 're raising hell , we 're going to have to have some control there , but we ca n't lose control of the neighborhoods of baghdad i mean people need to be told these things i called up maliki and i said , mr prime minister i'm speaking as bush mr prime minister , you got to enact these laws , you 've got to enact these laws in other words , there s got to be more communication with the american people , in my view franklin delano roosevelt did it so when i went to the floor with a map of iraq and pointed out with my pen , you know , different places like that , people you know , we got calls from regular contact with president bush right \? no no you guys do n't talk that often \? no no how long has it been since you 've had a meeting with him \? he asked to see me and lindsey graham as a result of our trip oh , interesting when you were giving that speech yesterday i was thinking i have n't heard anyone make the case for either the surge or the success , or however you want to put it , of the surge until i heard you saying it the american people need to be talked to as a result of the town hall meetings that i 've had all over the country but , strangely enough , primarily in iowa and new hampshire , people are very concerned they want to know how are we going to get out of this \? how are we going to succeed \? i do n't think see , and maybe i'm all wrong , i think if you can show the american people , look , we 're making this progress , we 've got this under control , we 're going to , you know , that things are getting better and here s why and etc , etc , i think they 'll show some patience but they 've got to be told i just wonder whether he s saying it and we 're not hearing it i think , yeah and i think general petraeus and secretary gates and general pace , they 're pretty cautious in their pronouncements now they 're saying it s early days , there are some indications but in that sense they 're not making and they should n't and they should n't and they should n't so therefore there s no one making this yeah but , see , i think they should say , i think you should say , look , we 've got 53 outposts now in the neighborhoods of baghdad and things are much quieter but i want to tell you , diyala province , we 're going to have a hell of a fire fight and you may have noticed that they set off a bomb in the green zone and killed three politicians i mean you should tell them the whole story , you see what i mean , rather than just say the good things and you brief people like that and they say , well , you know , i understand at least that s what happens when i talk to them and at the town hall meetings they stand up and say , why are you doing this \? i say , well , let me take you through this you know , they 're still upset , they 're still sad , they 're still frustrated , but at least they understand that there is a process here that can succeed and i'm not guaranteeing that this succeeds , michael i am not i am just saying that i think it can i believe it has a good shot and if it does n't succeed , then obviously we explore all those other options but none of them are good and this comes back around , i 've got to have another option \? not right now not right now but i may have to come up with one are you a fatalist , as my colleague david brooks wrote \? oh , yeah listen , you may not have seen my speech that kid , i'm going to go see him this afternoon mark robbins oh , god , i 've seen a lot of things in my life , i 've seen a lot of things , that kid sitting up there , his head , blood all over the back of him where he was sitting up like that and grabs my hand and says , 'i'm honored you 're here thanks for your support we can win this fight' you know \? i'm supposed to worry about my political future \?
fishermen and scientists may never fully understand the striped bass , but they will never stop trying few fish have been studied as much as the striped bass has between spring and fall its wintering biology , however , is less understood during autumn , stripers entertain anglers as they migrate south from new england large individuals then winter in ocean waters , but many of their smaller counterparts , known as schoolies , travel to major estuaries that support striped bass spawning , namely the hudson and delaware rivers and the chesapeake bay some , however , ride out the cold months in systems where they do not reproduce , including the housatonic and connecticut rivers in connecticut and scortons creek on cape cod judging from fishermen s catches , none of these hold anywhere near the sheer numbers of the upper thames river in connecticut , home to an unusual aggregation of wintering striped bass long known to fishermen but not to scientists mike bednarski , a queens college graduate student and an avid angler , tried to tackle this striped bass riddle in december , he placed ultrasonic transmitters in seven stripers to use remote sensing to chart their movements in relation to changing conditions a couple months later , on the second day of a midwinter thaw , we could sense spring uncoiling from winter s grip when we met at the town dock in norwich , conn after idling through the fishing fleet , we ran five miles downriver among ice sheets spooking two bald eagles off a floe to test temperatures and salinities in the same reach of river where bednarski had located the southern end of a great striper school in early january , before the freeze began the sonar fish finder did not mark any striped bass at this destination , so we headed back to norwich harbor to sample the fishing there , the fish finder showed a solid mass of stripers under the boat , but we caught only one in half an hour nearby , three men were gleefully landing one fish after another asked what they were doing right , one said that , because most of the stripers were swimming at a depth of about 20 feet , they were dropping their lures to 17 feet and gently teasing the fish upward he handed us a couple of the jigs they were using even then , we struggled to work the lures with the correct action and landed only a few while the other men were at times fighting three schoolies at once because this fishing sometimes occurs under brutal conditions and requires a degree of skill , its practitioners tend to be dedicated we noticed partners in one boat marking stripers with tags from the american littoral society to learn where their catches went after they left the river in spring most appear to originate from the hudson , the nearest river where stripers spawn bednarski also wanted to capture the striper schools on videotape , so he lowered an underwater camera the water was murky , but when the rig hit the magical 20foot level , we saw stripers moving past the lens the final task was to find the seven stripers that bednarski had tagged with transmitters in december he slipped on the receiver s headphones , dialed to the frequency of one striper , submerged the listening cone and rotated it to determine the direction of the strongest signal the river was surprisingly noisy bednarski could hear the hammering of other anglers' fish finders and even interference from someone else s ultrasonic transmitter he teased out the pinging sound from striped bass no 1 and , after two more location adjustments with the boat , zeroed in on the fish to document the conditions that the fish preferred , bednarski conducted a series of temperature and salinity measurements at regular depth intervals near the striper s position while he recorded his data , i watched two men troll and land striper after striper by now i had come to realize that the abundance of striped bass in this stretch of the river was staggering as the trollers neared us , bednarski shouted , how many are you up to \? the reply 107 and they were not done yet we located all seven striped bass before nightfall , and all told the same story the fivemile long body of stripers seen in december had contracted to become a dense aggregation at the head of the estuary the surface waters were fresh and frigid , carrying ice chunks from the two rivers the yantic and shetucket that feed the main stem thames but beneath this inhospitable layer was a tongue of the sea 42degree , fullstrength salt water , slightly warmer than what we measured downriver , and phenomenally attractive to a not insignificant portion of the atlantic coast migratory striped bass stock when we finished and motored toward the dock , i thought that , considering how hard it is to locate this species for so much of the year , it was extraordinary to know at this moment exactly where these seven stripers were holding , with untold numbers of their brethren alongside them but i also noted with pleasure that in a few weeks , as winter yielded to spring , these particular fish would disappear back into the vastness of the sea , trailing plenty of other mysteries behind them
it is still not clear what alex rodriguez said during a routine popup when the played the in toronto on may 30 but it certainly created a stir rodriguez shouted , ha ! or mine ! depending whom you ask either way , a ball that was expected to be an easy out dropped and led to more yankees runs and a debate on the unwritten laws of baseball last night , the yankees played toronto for the first time since that game it was only natural to think the blue jays might retaliate by throwing at rodriguez it did not happen rodriguez went 1 for 4 in the yankees' 64 victory at yankee stadium , hitting his major leagueleading 32nd home run none of the pitches he saw came close to hitting him asked after the game if he was concerned about retribution , rodriguez said no , zero , next question both managers played down the significance of last night s game , saying beforehand that they did not make that connection until reporters told them we 've forgotten all about it it was so long ago until somebody brought it up , toronto manager john gibbons said that s all i got to say the last time they met , the yankees were leading by two runs with two outs in the top of the ninth inning with rodriguez on first base and hideki matsui on second , jorge posada hit a popup blue jays third baseman howie clark camped under the ball as rodriguez passed clark , he shouted something clark thought shortstop john mcdonald was calling for the ball so he stepped away rodriguez later said he shouted , ha ! clark said he heard , mine ! the ball fell to the ground as matsui scored and rodriguez reached third it was ruled a runscoring single , and the yankees went on to score two more runs and win , 105 rodriguez seemed pleased with himself , smirking as he stood on third , but the blue jays were incensed gibbons argued with the umpires and told rodriguez he thought the play was bush league mcdonald had to be restrained as he yelled at rodriguez shouting on the basepaths is widely regarded as inappropriate by major leaguers but the rules do not prohibit it after the game , yankees manager joe torre defended rodriguez , albeit in a lukewarm manner two days later , when the yankees were in boston to play the red sox , he reconsidered , saying it s probably something he should n't have done some in the yankees organization were not pleased with torre s criticism of rodriguez , who can opt out of his contract after this season clark and mcdonald , neither of whom started last night , said they had no lingering animosity clark is a backup , but mcdonald has been splitting time with royce clayton mcdonald , who entered the game as a defensive replacement in the seventh inning , earlier in the day defended his initial anger i would n't have gotten a little bit upset about the situation if i had thought that it was right , he said but that s my opinion it does n't have to be everyone else s opinion clark noted that even if he had caught the ball , the blue jays would have had to score two runs against mariano rivera in the bottom of the ninth to tie the score they did not score any i was frustrated because you feel like you 'd let the team down , clark said before the game with tempers seemingly in check , major league baseball did not appear concerned about the yankees and the blue jays meeting again the umpires , before they go into a series , are made aware of any sort of history that goes on between two teams , pat courtney , a spokesman for major league baseball , said yesterday i'm not sure if they 're specifically going to give them a warning before the series starts payback may still come delayed reactions are not uncommon in baseball in the bottom of the first inning against josh towers , with runners on first and second , rodriguez grounded into an inningending double play two innings later , he hit the home run to right field off towers to give the yankees a 42 lead in the sixth , towers induced a soft groundout brandon league , a righthanded reliever , struck out rodriguez on three pitches in the seventh the game s most amusing play occurred in the top of the eighth inning when , with two outs , vernon wells popped up to the left side of the mound it was anything but routine as rodriguez trotted toward the infield grass on the replay , it appeared as if he shouted , i got it ! rodriguez made the putout then he exhaled
hong kong , sept 20 long before became a controversial figure in american political fundraising , he had a tangled history of business dealings in hong kong with friends and investors who remain bitter about him a former university friend describes mr hsu as having taken money in the 1980s for an apartment building investment and an american distribution company , and then failing to return the money or account for it another former friend said that mr hsu had lavishly spent the money of two other distribution companies , and one creditor pursued mr hsu for years through the bankruptcy courts mr hsu has left a trail of disillusioned investors stretching across more than two decades and two continents leaving angry investors behind in hong kong in the late 1980s , he went to california , where he ended up being convicted of corporate theft in 1992 but disappeared before his sentencing his lawyer now wants the conviction expunged he returned to hong kong , where his activities resulted in a furious creditor who took him into hong kong bankruptcy courts in 1998 he returned again to the united states to build an empire of investments and political contributions that federal prosecutors now describe as illegal now mr hsu is in federal custody in california , making it difficult to obtain his description of his past business dealings his lawyer , james j brosnahan , has said mr hsu plans to make restitution to victims mr hsu and his former university friend , pedro woo , grew up in hong kong but did not meet until they were students at the university of california , berkeley their friendship has since dissolved after the late '80s , we stopped being friends , mr woo said he totally abused my trust i was one of his first victims mr woo , who is now the managing director of his own 1 , 000employee electronics company here , recalled feeling sorry for mr hsu , who had said that his mother had recently died and that his father had died when mr hsu was young mr woo said he heard much later through a mutual friend that mr hsu s father , a citizen of taiwan , had actually divorced mr hsu s mother when mr hsu was very young mr hsu used an inheritance to rent an apartment in college and had his mother s chinese furniture shipped to him from hong kong , where she had lived mr woo described mr hsu s mother as welltodo , but not wealthy when mr hsu moved back to hong kong in the early 1980s , mr woo invited him to stay with him at his apartment on kennedy road , a fashionable street near the center of the city mr woo said that mr hsu proposed two business ventures one was for the purchase of a small apartment building in the san francisco area by a half dozen berkeley graduates from hong kong he was a good talker , very smooth and very friendly , so he established an image among friends that he is very good in real estate , mr woo said the other venture was the creation of a distribution company in the united states to sell stereo components made by mr woo s electronics business and clothing made by chinese companies mr woo invested 35 , 000 for a stake in the apartment building and a similar sum to bankroll the distribution company , named fama concerned that clothing and stereo components were too different , mr woo insisted that mr hsu specialize at first in clothing mr woo introduced mr hsu to a casual wear manufacturing executive , ernest ng mr ng then helped bankroll the creation of two more companies , both named laveno , one in hong kong and the other in the united states laveno \( hong kong \) ltd was incorporated on jan 14 , 1983 , but went dormant by 1987 and was legally dissolved in 1996 , mr ng s records show mr ng said he soon became disenchanted with mr hsu we parted ways after only a year , after it became obvious he was not putting any effort into building the business , and he was a big spender , always living in fancy hotels and eating in fancy restaurants , mr ng said though i must say he was a very friendly , very sociable , very humorous person six months after forming fama and laveno , mr hsu moved out of mr woo s apartment and into the regent hotel , which is now the intercontinental hong kong and which has long been one of hong kong s two most luxurious hotels , mr woo said mr hsu billed the cost of living in a luxury hotel to fama and explained it to mr woo as a necessary business expense to impress clothing buyers he said , for the garment business , you need an image , ' mr woo said but fama piled up inventory without selling many garments mr woo said he had also been dismayed by mr hsu s penchant for going out with young women , even on business trips mr woo said he had warned mr hsu about that when the two men happened to meet in chicago i said , when you are on a business trip , you have to discipline yourself , when you spend time with girls , the next day you are tired , ' mr woo recalled , adding that mr hsu stopped talking about his interests in women after that during those years , mr hsu married and had a child , but the marriage ended in divorce mr woo finally demanded his money back from mr hsu by mr woo s account , mr hsu said that fama did not have any cash to return to investors mr hsu stopped talking to mr woo , who had never obtained anything in writing from mr hsu for his two investments mr woo said he had later heard that the apartment building in the bay area had been sold for a profit , but when a friend checked for him , he learned that mr woo s name had never been listed among the owners and he received none of the proceeds mr woo said that he never pursued legal action against mr hsu because he was embarrassed not to have documents mr hsu had another dispute in hong kong with a creditor whose identity remains a secret mr hsu was forced into bankruptcy here in 1998 by the creditor while bankruptcies normally last only four years here , mr hsu s lasted eight years , something that normally happens in hong kong only if a creditor is angry enough to ask a court for an extension of the period in which further earnings can be seized for the repayment of earlier debts mr hsu ceased to be legally bankrupt here only last year the details of his case are protected by privacy laws mr woo last saw mr hsu in 1991 in the lobby of another luxury hotel here i was with my manager , waiting for a customer , he said when he happened to see me , he quickly walked away he never said hello
i thought i deserved it but the hour and a half i spent on windwhipped 49th street in manhattan two weekends ago , hunched in the predawn freeze with 100 other people , turned out to be a weak , amateur effort that kind of commitment may be enough barely to get into a taping of one of the daily comedy shows on cable for those of us in the shadow of 30 rockefeller plaza that morning , however , it would take a much more punishing , more frigid , more sleepless dedication to get what we wanted a lownumbered standby ticket to sit in the studio audience of saturday night live steve martin once said that comedy is not pretty it s not cheap , either , as anyone who has run up a bar tab waiting through five standup comics knows but almost every night of the week new york offers one of the world s great comedy bargains , the chance to be part of the audience for the latenight shows watched by millions , free in less than one square mile in midtown , four weekday shows are taped in the afternoon late show with , late night with , the daily show with and the colbert report and saturday night live broadcasts 20 new episodes each season free almost always comes with qualifiers of course as i learned while standing my way into every studio i could , the price for those free seats is time and in deep winter there is another cost the price of long johns and something to protect tender ears from bitterly unfunny gusts each year thousands of organized , forwardplanning people many of them tourists but plenty of new yorkers too arrange for tickets to these shows months in advance the nbc information line states that for saturday night live all requests must be made in august for the season that follows , and if you are lucky enough to be sent a pair , they will be for a random saturday and cannot be exchanged the rest of us have standby lines since most shows overbook to guarantee a full audience , standby is often a long shot subfreezing temperatures , however , can be the skinflint s best friend , since the cold generally increases ticketholder absenteeism and decreases the number of people willing to risk frostbite to take those people s place that , at least , was what i was counting on with saturday night live its procedure is somewhat cruel numbered tickets are handed out on saturday at 7 am , and suppliants return that night to wait for a chance to get in standby , no matter how many hours of chilly hardship you have endured , does not guarantee anything i set my alarm for 5 am and , with the skies still dark , slumped in a cab and headed for rockefeller center my confidence sank when arrived and i saw the masses huddled beneath the nbc studios marquee on 49th street they were bundled in thick jackets , wrapped in blankets and hidden in sleeping bags , and it was clear that many had been there all night taking my place behind a group of 20somethings from florida a birthday crew , one of three i encountered in various lines i rubbed the arms of my inadequate wool coat for warmth as dairy and bakery trucks barreled by at 6 57 a perky woman from nbc came out and explained the deal we had a choice of standby tickets to either the dress rehearsal or the live broadcast one ticket per frozen nose i chose the live show , got a nicely printed blue card bearing no 41 and headed home to thaw that night we queued up according to number inside , thankfully and waited for orders from the young women who mind this line , dressed in identical gray suits , like stewardesses around 11 15 one of our keepers explained with a smile that we could still be let in until just before the broadcast begins it was 11 26 before i learned that i would not be so lucky not every show is as hard to get into as saturday night live , but none are truly easy for the daily show , on comedy central , i filled out a request form for a regular ticket a few days in advance on the web and to my surprise got a confirmation within hours but even with this assurance i still had to wait in line the audience is overbooked , so attendees are advised to come early on a blustery tuesday i stood for almost two hours outside the 11th avenue studio , where a banner above the door reads , in faux old english script , abandon news , all ye who enter here once inside i was led to a room with about 200 seats arranged on three sides around a fairly spacious stage , with jon stewart s desk on a riser in the middle there i met my first warmup man every show has one to get the audience members excited and to explain that even if they are not excited , they must fake it with lots of laughing , clapping and hollering so accustomed the semivegetative state of latenight channel surfing , we were now asked to become actors each warmup man i saw relied on those hoariest of standup clich s , ridiculing audience members' home states and questioning their sexual orientation but these uncomfortable moments offer important practice for the crowd s prime directive even when it s not funny , you must laugh it becomes pavlovian i chuckled and applauded heartily when neil degrasse tyson , an astrophysicist , told mr stewart , we 're in the universe , but not only that because the chemical ingredients of life are the same as that of the universe , and traceable to stars , the universe is also in us but is that comedy \? the funniest and most exciting moments were when something unscripted or unexpected happened i could see on a monitor the lines that mr stewart was supposed to be reading when he did his endofshow checkin with mr colbert , and the madcap jokes the two men improvised over a video link acting out daniel daylewis s running sequence in the last of the mohicans and bellowing , i will find you ! drew the most honest laughter of all i was still cold when i left the daily show studio about 7 10 , and i was dreading even worse chills for late show with david letterman , on cbs about 41 million people watch mr letterman on an average night , more than six times as many as watch the daily show for a standby hopeful , that means serious competition for those scant extra seats to get standby tickets for letterman , you must call at 11 am and correctly answer a trivia question about the show i have n't been a regular watcher of it since high school , and the question i was asked who is rupert jee \? i could n't answer \( he s the proprietor of the hello deli , around the corner from the studio \) but the man on the other end said not a problem your number is 24 come to the ed sullivan theater at 53rd and broadway at 3 30 i never had to give my number when i arrived i was handed a ticket a real ticket and told to wait around the corner in the roseland ballroom at 11 degrees , it was just too cold for an outside line , they said holding ticket no 317 , i waited in comfort on roseland s dance floor , where word got around that the guests on the show would be dr phil and fall out boy at 4 15 we were led to the theater by the show s pages , this time all young men in worldwide pants varsity jackets , after mr letterman s production company , and crossed 53rd street like a family of ducks the intricate gothic revival interior of the ed sullivan theater , built in 1927 , is worth the trip alone inside , late show has the greatest audience capacity of all , with about 460 seats on two levels but mr letterman s offcamera manner was brusque , and being there was not much different from watching it on television if my pageguided trip across 53rd street for letterman did not seem like the most sophisticated new york experience , i felt even less like a city slicker the next day at nbc s late night with conan o'brien the policy there is for those without advance tickets to wait outside on 49th street the same spot as for saturday night live at 9 am i was there at 8 30 and got no 8 the temperature was 20 degrees but returning to the studio at 3 45 i waited in line after line that shuffled through drab office corridors , all the while being directed by the late night crew go down this stairway , up that one form a line four bodies wide make sure your ticket is in the same hand as your wristband it was like being a kindergartner again the reward was conan o'brien i groaned when i heard that one of his guests would be dr phil whom i was not excited about seeing once , let alone twice but the show was the only one that made me genuinely laugh out loud it featured vomiting kermit , as in the frog , and a slide show of presidential candidates and their popculture lookalikes that paired rudolph w giuliani with skeletor from heman and hillary rodham clinton with chucky , the horror movie doll nobody said latenight tv had to be subtle mr o'brien was a treat to see in person even paler and more boyish than he appears on screen , he was also doubly zany and energetic in his own crowd warmup spending much more time with the audience than any other host , he directed two men in the front row to hug each other \( they complied without hesitation \) and then sent another young man to embrace the bandleader , max weinberg \( that one was a little less enthusiastic \) as a live , improvising comedian , only stephen colbert compared dressed and coiffed as perfectly as a brooks brothers model , mr colbert took questions from his crowd , which at about 100 was the smallest of all when one man suggested that mr colbert do tek jansen , his animated spacetraveler character , on ice , he responded instantly with a fairly lengthy song and dance number about super awesomely spectacular heroes saturday night live remained unconquered as the weekend approached i waffled between staying overnight and just rolling the dice again at 5 30 remembering the previous week s line , i estimated that only the first 10 or 12 people had been equipped to spend the night everyone else must have gotten there sometime between , say , midnight and 6 i split the difference and decided to go at 3 i was 17th in line at the front were , as i expected , about 10 people packed like sleepers at pompeii , followed by recently arrived standees line etiquette allows brief absences for food and relief i held out as long as i could and about 5 45 stepped into a nearby building and ran to the heating vents the skies began to lighten about 6 30 , and at 7 a familiar face came out holding two stacks of tickets i took no 8 for the live show a big improvement over 41 , but still no sure thing fast forward to 10 55 pm the first 12 of us were screened by security and then lined up , tantalizingly , in front of the elevator bank there my party giggled nervously and asked the guards about eight versions of the same question what are our chances \? they gave about eight versions on the same answer totally unpredictable i was starting to lose hope when , at 11 15 , a woman with a clipboard leaned around the corner and told the guard matteroffactly , let 'em up we all hooted joyously and began our trip to studio 8h , the home of saturday night live for 32 years taking my seat in the secondtolast row of extreme stage left , i was struck by the vastness and complexity of the operation the area in front of the stage , and every exit i could see , teemed with activity as stagehands , producers with headsets and dozens of others took up whatever space was not occupied by a camera more than any other show i saw , snl seemed most like an elaborately orchestrated television taping and less like theater , though the clockwork production activity became theater in itself with sets constantly going up and being broken down all over the soundstage , the actors were often not visible , but the busy crew always was the instant a skit cut to commercial , a woman grabbed the guest host , forest whitaker , by the hand and dragged him backstage all the while lorne michaels , the show s creator and executive producer , coolly paced the set in a charcoal suit and smart red tie after the show ended it was n't the funniest episode i had ever seen , but i contributed my quota of laughter and applause i walked through the doors of 30 rock the barriers were up on the sidewalk again and new lines were forming , this time to spot celebrities on their way out i was tempted to join them but i decided instead that it was time to head for what was clearly the best seat in the house my couch

milwaukee , july 21 s personal pitching machine is 52 years old , 165 pounds , gray on top , built with a durable left arm and prefers to be anonymous if bonds called at 3 am , john yandle , that robot of a batting practice pitcher for the , would get up and throw yandle has pitched to bonds for the last 15 years , so he has allowed more home runs to bonds than anyone none of them have been catalogued none appear on the back of bonds s baseball card but yandle has twisted his neck a staggering number of times to watch baseballs disappear it s hundreds and hundreds , yandle said it s a good trivia question i'm sure he s hit more than the seven hundred and whatever homers off me bonds s real home run total sits at 753 , two shy of hank aaron s career record , after he went 0 for 2 with two walks as the giants beat the milwaukee brewers , 80 , at miller park on saturday this is the city where aaron s career started so superbly and ended so regally and the place that commissioner bud selig calls home after yandle threw batting practice to bonds on thursday , and a rejuvenated bonds ended an 0for21 drought with two home runs against the chicago cubs , yandle joked about how well he , not just bonds , had performed it was a good day , yandle said he s probably saying it was all him there are several reasons why bonds likes hitting off yandle , reasons why yandle has been allowed inside bonds s cloistered world yandle is lefthanded , he throws hard and his pitches move , traits that make him more challenging than the sorearmed coaches who toss 60mileanhour lollipops before about 120 of san francisco s 162 games , yandle leaves his job as a senior vice president for a commercial real estate company to play ball with bonds and the giants yandle , a former class aaa pitcher who is as skinny as a foul pole , looks like he could squeeze inside one of bonds s pants legs still , when yandle stands in front of the mound and throws , he surprises some hitters orlando hudson of the arizona diamondbacks actually asked yandle to throw softer during allstar game workouts yandle s fastball hums in at 80 mph , but since he pitches from 50 feet , he said it translates to 90 mph that is an aboveaverage major league fastball each year , i just move up a little closer , yandle said that s my secret yandle stumbled into his job 22 years ago he was friends with ricky adams , a giants infielder , and was visiting adams before a game yandle overheard that the coaches were fatigued and there was no one to throw batting practice so he volunteered , impressed the giants and never left the pitching position has been yandle s path to wearing a major league uniform , a path that was closed to him as a professional yandle was chosen by the san diego padres in the 11th round of the 1977 amateur draft out of stanford and lasted three and half years in their system he went 22 with a 352 earned run average at class aaa hawaii in 1980 since the padres planned to send yandle to class aa the next spring , he waddled into hawaii manager doug rader s office wearing a snorkel and fins to ask to be returned to the sun and sand the props failed yandle requested his release , signed with the angels , went 58 with a 344 era at class aa holyoke and retired he was only 26 all of my friends from stanford were out in the world making money , so i quit , yandle said i 've regretted it ever since while yandle moved on , he never stopped pitching he still performs in a senior baseball league against some players who are 24 years younger than he is , and he still notches outs in the stanford alumni game but it is the batting practice gig , those 100 pitches a day and about 300 , 000 and counting for a career , that drive him most of the times , for me , it s a dream , yandle said i get to be in the big leagues it s without the fame and the fortune but i 've lasted longer than i would have as a pitcher plus i get to know the guys yandle knows bonds well and said the slugger , who can be surly to many , has been the greatest friend to him , his wife and their three children there is no family portrait over the fireplace inside yandle s home instead , there is an autographed bonds poster and an autographed bonds bat bonds signed the poster by writing to john thanks for the batting practice god bless , barry bonds as much as yandle values his connection to bonds , he added that there are times where bonds is in a bad mood and you just stay away yandle was sitting on a couch in the clubhouse last sunday when bonds , about a minute after calling himself an embarrassment , tipped over a laundry cart it happened a few feet from yandle , but he said nothing bonds refused to answer questions about yandle or their relationship saturday across batting practice sessions with hundreds of players , yandle stressed that none have matched bonds s handeye coordination , quick wrists and power bonds has been dogged by suspicions that his accomplishments have been tainted by using performanceenhancement drugs , something he and yandle have never discussed whether he did or did n't , i 've never asked , yandle said i do n't really care it was part of the game that has been cleaned up now for very good reason and i'm glad for that yandle , a senior vice president at cornish and carey commercial oncor international , said he earned in the low thousands as a battingpractice pitcher , which he donated to charity if the giants are facing a lefthander or bonds wants some extra work against a lefty , he finds yandle that includes the offseason , when yandle opens christmas presents and then throws long tosses in the parking lot to get ready for bonds in january yandle s job is simple throw hard strikes , lots of them so yandle uncorks a fastball to bonds gone then another gone three more fastballs going , going , gone yandle does not mind being bonds s version of a pitching dummy , but he does fantasize about stifling bonds one day he s 42 and i'm 52 , yandle said he owns me right now , even from 50 feet i tell him i'm going to keep going and , when he s 80 and i'm 90 , we 're getting back out there and it s going to be a different story
ni o josele , the young gitano guitarist , is playing bill evans music at the village vanguard this week that pianist s own compositions , as well as songs by others that evans brushed up against at various points between the 1950s and the 1970s but because ni o josele \( born juan jos heredia \) is a flamenco musician with only a recent interest in jazz , the tunes were redesigned to suit his strength and temperament the best parts of the set were n't much like flamenco , and they were n't much like jazz either and this was very good in the first two sets of the week , on tuesday , he and his trio were getting the kinks out , still addressing rough patches in sound and pacing \( there s a danger of romantic ballad overload here , which the group barely skirted \) together the musicians worked through closetotheground grooves and slow rhythmic buildups , and ni o josele applied what he knew , troweling on the flamenco ornamentation on each chord after he landed on it but he performed very little jazzstyle improvising through the chord changes of the songs , and it may seem odd that a spanish musician untrained in jazz would go straight to bill evans , one of the music s heroes for soloing through changes it did n't much matter the gig , and the record it draws from paz \( calle 54 sony bmg \) are a good enough reason to get ni o josele here and interacting with our musicians flamenco does n't neatly superimpose over jazz , and ni o josele is n't meeting evans completely on evans s terms \( he s not drawing out the andalusianness in these songs , either , because there s none to speak of \) but paz reflects a larger and more important desire ni o josele s desire to expand the setting for what he does he began both sets on tuesday with solo guitar pieces , drawing from evans s satielike peace piece , luiz e a s dolphin and the standard my foolish heart they were all pretty ballads , and he trawled through them for emotional resonance , savoring the chords with his fingers but then the americanborn bassist esperanza spalding and the cubanborn drummer horacio \( el negro \) hernandez came onstage , and suddenly we were hearing a take on the steve swallow song hullo bolinas as the song picked up , it shifted into a strong , lowvolume groove , with strummed guitar , bowed bass , brushed drums this was now some mutant strain of folk music , played by excellent musicians coming from three different temperaments it did n't sound like anything normally heard at the village vanguard except maybe 30 years ago , in the days of hippiejazz syncretism , when people like gabor szabo were on the scene but it made you want more , quickly there was a slightly unfocused version of paul simon s i do it for your love , which evans covered toward the end of his life ms spalding , who is also a singer , put her light voice to it but then the good , strange stuff struck again , in a version of evans s turn out the stars the snare drum carried a reference to the buler a rhythm of flamenco , with mr hernandez intimating the same chattering patterns , and the group came alive each musician demonstrated a wicked gift ms spalding played a melodic solo on the bass that made it seem like an extension of her voice mr hernandez intensified and got rougher , making the groove more acute and though ni o josele had been playing warily through the evening , perhaps out of deference to the aura of sensitivity that surrounds bill evans s music like a barbedwire fence , here he started to broach the intemperate gestures of flamenco guitar playing , the hammerblow chords and fast flourishes , and his wary expression turned into a hungry smile
phoenix , oct 4 if , as chicago cubs fans have taken to say this season , it s gonna happen meaning the end of the cubs' 99year world championship drought the team is going to need a magical comeback that belies its history the arizona diamondbacks pounded the 15game winner ted lilly for six runs in three and a third innings thursday night and went on to win , 84 , to take a twogamestonone lead in the national league division series by winning twice at chase field , the diamondbacks who started four rookies in each game put themselves in position to clinch this bestoffive series saturday or sunday at wrigley field the rookie chris young s threerun homer in the fourrun second proved the key hit for the diamondbacks , wiping out a 20 cubs lead and prompting lilly to throw his glove in frustration we 're stunned , cubs second baseman mark derosa said we 'd like to think we could have grabbed a game here , but we still have a pulse we have to find a way to get it done we 've dug ourselves this hole , and we 've got no one to blame but ourselves it is beginning to look like the cubs closer ryan dempster was right when at tuesday s workout he suggested the young diamondbacks' nlbest 90 victories should not be dismissed they won more games than we did in the regular season , dempster said , so i kind of look at us as the underdog doug davis , the deliberate diamondbacks lefthander , earned the victory with a serviceable five and twothirds innings \( four runs , five hits , eight strikeouts \) he left to a standing ovation from the crowd of 48 , 576 , a total just shy of a sellout two runs scored after davis left the game , on daryle ward s pinchhit tworun double against reliever juan cruz davis fared much better than lilly , the former yankee lefthander lilly s 158 season , tying his career high for victories , included a 91 mark in 17 starts after cubs losses but lilly gave up seven hits , walking four , and never made it out of the fourth inning tonight i did n't do us much good in a big game , lilly said i could care less how many wins i had it s what you do in the postseason i 've got absolutely zero excuses i do n't know what to say i guess if i really wanted to i could come up with something , but that s not going to get me anywhere in contrast to the crisp , wellpitched game 1 , this one proved difficult on the players' concentration neither davis nor lilly are fast workers , and the first inning took 27 minutes even though neither team scored a run cubs catcher geovany soto , a lateseason class aaa callup whom cubs manager lou piniella started over the veteran jason kendall for the second consecutive night , hit a tworun homer in the second to give the cubs their first lead of the series but the diamondbacks , who drew two firstinning walks , jumped on lilly for four runs in the bottom of the second , all with two outs davis helped his cause by sacrificing runners to second and third for the second out of the inning young , on a full count , homered to left to put arizona ahead it s exciting to hit a homer any time , young said but to do it in the playoffs with 48 , 000 people yelling , you feel like you 're floating on air when you run the bases you see your teammates in the dugout waiting to congratulate you there s nothing like it stephen drew beat out an infield hit to short before eric byrnes ripped a runscoring triple off the wall in leftcenter soriano and jacque jones converged at the wall , leaving both out of position for the carom , which rolled free augie ojeda s controversial bunt single led to the two runs in the fourth that chased lilly ojeda ran wide of the threefoot running lane to slide around derrek lee s tag , which brought piniella out to complain usually , anyone running out of the lane is called out but baseball rule 605 \( k \) allows a runner step or slide outside the lane near first base if trying to touch the bag , which ojeda did with his hand lilly then walked young ahead of drew s tworun triple to right ojeda then figured in another rally in the fifth , begun after two walks by reliever kevin hart scott eyre replaced hart for one batter , leaving after he tried to barehand ojeda s liner through the box the ball ticked off eyre s fingers and bounded into center field for an runscoring single with michael wuertz on for the cubs , davis safetysqueezed justin upton home from third for a 82 lead piniella had been secondguessed in chicago for pulling his ace carlos zambrano after six innings and 85 pitches in game 1 so he could come back in game 4 a game that , unless the cubs win saturday , will not be necessary piniella dismissed the criticism and called the cubs' lack of timely hitting the bigger issue that s the key for us in this series , piniella said before the game after going 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position in game 1 , the cubs had trouble getting runners to second base at all thursday night after soto s home run the cubs never advanced a runner past first base until the sixth , when they trailed by six runs the cubs went through six pitchers , including kerry wood \( two scoreless innings \) and dempster the game was out of hand when the diamondbacks' scoreboard and video crew spoofed the cubs' cursed history in its betweeninnings kiss cam feature on the jumbotron , the camera focused on a man dressed in a cubs cap , glasses and headphones to resemble steve bartman the camera slowly pulled back to reveal a goat in the next seat the man put his arm around it and kissed it lightly on the neck

juan padilla , the mets resident sleightofhand artist , practices card tricks in his spare time this morning , he dazzled teammates and reporters with an old favorite he made 4 piles , each with a jack , queen , king and ace , before putting them all in one stack duaner sanchez cut the deck once , then again padilla dealt the cards into four piles again one of jacks , one of queens , one of kings and one of aces pretty good , huh \? padilla said but he wasn t done yet he needed a new victim he asked aaron sele to pick out any card from the deck before shoving it back in padilla shuffled for about 20 seconds and then put the cards into his back pocket before he took them out , he asked sele to pick a number between one and 10 sele chose eight one at a time , padilla took the cards out of his pocket and put them face down on a stool after the seventh one , he turned over the cards so sele could verify that none were his oh , this must be your card then , said padilla as he pulled out the eighth card he turned it over to reveal a two of spades , sele s card looking to capitalize , sanchez took off his hat and passed it around the crowd no one put any money in
concord , nh , nov 9 now that president bush s decision early this year to send more troops to is showing signs of reducing the violence in baghdad , senator , who had long called for beefing up the american military presence there , is betting that the politics of the war are changing as well mr mccain , republican of arizona , is making his early advocacy of the troop increase and his push for a change in strategy a central theme of his presidential campaign he is using it to distance himself from the bush administration , whose handling of the war he regularly denounces , and from his republican rivals , none of whom , he says , displayed the leadership , courage or knowledge necessary to win in iraq i was the only one , the only candidate for president of the united states on either side who fought to change course by providing more troops , he told voters in iowa this week i did everything in my power to try and change that strategy , he said , referring to the course originally set by president bush i was severely criticized by other republicans for being disloyal i said we had to have the strategy we are using now mr mccain is asking voters where his main republican rivals rudolph w giuliani , mitt romney and fred d thompson were as the situation in iraq deteriorated , pointing to their silence as evidence of lack of experience if they want to be president of the united states , they should have informed themselves , he said in an interview in cedar rapids , iowa while not questioning his opponents' patriotism , he said giuliani could have informed himself by remaining on the iraq study group some people tell me that he was fired some people tell me that he withdrew whatever it is , he did n't show much interest in a war where young americans are fighting and dying more than any republican candidate , mr mccain has been an outspoken supporter of the war while that appeared for much of the year to be a problem for him as the public grew increasingly disenchanted with the lack of progress in stabilizing iraq , he is casting the glimmers of improvement there as a vindication and a selling point as he tries to get his campaign back on track a poll by cbs news last month found that 33 percent of americans believed the troop increase was making the situation better in iraq , with 41 percent saying it had made no difference and 13 percent saying it had made things worse mr mccain said that he did not know if americans would be receptive to his view on the war , and that his unstinting support for the invasion might have cost him the support of many of the independent voters who helped propel his campaign in 2000 but he said that just as he had taken blame for the failures of the war , he would ask voters to recognize where he deserves credit when senator sam brownback , the kansas republican who recently ended his own bid for the presidential nomination and who had initially opposed the troop increase , endorsed mr mccain in iowa on wednesday , he said he had been wrong and mr mccain right he even referred to the steppedup effort as the mccain surge but in highlighting the successes of the surge , mr mccain is walking a fine line , since iraq has more often than not served as a graveyard for optimism when mr mccain visited a baghdad market in april , he was accused of painting an overly sunny description of the area s safety , failing to note that he had been guarded by more than 100 soldiers in armored humvees mr mccain said he regretted how his poorly worded comments seemed to underplay the difficulties of the war now he is usually careful to highlight the challenges that remain in iraq , specifically citing the problems with the country s government and a corrupt police force i know and you know how frustrated and saddened americans are about this war , mr mccain said in iowa he said the war was terribly mishandled for nearly four years by mr bush and former defense secretary donald h rumsfeld when mr mccain s wife , cindy , joined him recently in south carolina , she told voters that they have one son , a marine , overseas , and another at the united states naval academy mr mccain said he started to realize america was off course on a trip to basra in the summer of 2003 , when a british colonel warned him that the situation , unchanged , was headed for disaster he said that when he raised those concerns with mr rumsfeld , he was ignored in november 2004 , mr mccain delivered a detailed speech to the council on foreign relations in which he blasted the administration and critics of the war simply put , there does not appear to be a strategy behind our current force levels in iraq other than to preserve the illusion that we have sufficient forces in place to meet our objectives , he said but he campaigned for mr bush in 2004 , and even as mr mccain pushed for changes , he also often talked about progress other republican candidates have said much less on iraq , and their campaigns rejected mr mccain s assertions that they had fallen short in their approaches adm robert j natter , an adviser to mr giuliani , said i assume that senator mccain s emotions got the better of him to even suggest mayor giuliani does not care about our servicemen and women serving and dying overseas is an example of letting politics come before thoughtful commentary on matters of national security mr giuliani , the former new york mayor , has said he withdrew from the iraq study group because he was considering running for president and did not want to interject partisan politics into the process but he also missed several meetings before he withdrew , giving lucrative speeches on some meeting days a search of archived news articles and transcripts from 2003 through fall 2006 turned up no reports of his calling for a change of course in military strategy in iraq nor could his campaign point to any public statements on the issue when he introduced his 12 commitments this summer , which he said represented america s most important challenges , there was no mention of iraq mr giuliani rarely speaks in detail of mistakes made in the war in fact , he has said repeatedly that we focus too much on iraq , obscuring the broader terrorists' war against us mr romney , the former massachusetts governor , went to iraq for a day in may 2006 , just months after the bombing of a goldendomed shrine in samarra set off sectarian killing that was still sweeping the country i am not engaging in monday morning quarterbacking , mr romney told the boston globe i supported the war , as did congress and many democrats we have learned some lessons about the period immediately following major conflict i believe we are doing the right thing aside from mentioning problems in iraq , he did not push for a change of course in september 2006 , as the surge was being considered , mr romney said , my inclination would be more boots on the ground , not less a spokesman , kevin madden , said , governor romney is not interested in the idea of claiming credit for being the first to criticize he added , governor romney is interested in showing the kind of leadership it takes to deliver solutions and attain results mr thompson , a tennessean who voted in 2002 to authorize the war just months before leaving the senate , said little in public about war strategy in later years despite retiring from the senate in 2002 , fred thompson has never hesitated from openly and honestly assessing the situation in iraq , said todd harris , a spokesman for the campaign
the mets can thank shortstop jimmy rollins for transferring the target from their backs to the backs of his team , the philadelphia phillies he has done his teammates no favors , but they do not plan to toss him overboard , as if he were jonah , so he can be swallowed by a whale that s jimmy being jimmy , ryan howard , the national league s most valuable player last season , said , invoking a phrase heard often about a player in the boston red sox clubhouse usually it s the defending champion that is the target of contending teams the next season that would put the bull seye on the mets' back in the nl east but last month rollins proclaimed the phillies the team to beat , an assessment the team s general manager , pat gillick , quickly said he did n't agree with not that gillick was questioning the moves he has made in the offseason , but he has not forgotten that the mets finished 12 games ahead of the phillies in 2006 as randy wolf , a phillie in 2006 who is now a neutral observer on the los angeles dodgers , said monday the phillies are going to be a strong team but you ca n't argue with what the mets did last year it was like the braves before that until someone dethroned them , they were always the team to beat now the mets are the team in control of the national league east they 're obviously the one to beat the phillies have talked about how they have improved their starting pitching by signing freddy garcia and adam eaton , but they really added one starter because wolf , a 30yearold lefthander , opted to go home to los angeles last season , the phillies struggled through the first four months , plummeting 14 games behind the mets by july 29 declaring themselves out of the race , they traded bobby abreu , one of their best players , to the yankees the next day it turned out to be an unusual salary dump for the rest of the season , the phillies actually compiled a better record than the mets , 3823 to 3524 , and nearly stole the national league wildcard spot , won by the dodgers none of the players who were asked could explain exactly why the phillies were better without abreu i ca n't tell you , aaron rowand said i have no idea we pulled together , howard said everybody was having fun wolf called it coincidental , adding there were a lot of things going on at that time guys were just getting hot at the right time we were pitching better as well all those things coincided with the time bobby was traded what wolf neglected to note , speaking before he pitched two hitless and scoreless innings against the red sox , was that the same day abreu was traded , he pitched for the first time after a nearly 14month absence following tommy john surgery he won four and lost none of his 12 starts the rest of the season , and the phillies won nine of those games it was the phillies' strong finish and their offseason acquisitions primarily catcher rod barajas and third baseman wes helms , along with the pitchers that prompted rollins s proclamation when asked about it , howard , rowand and chase utley all said rollins s boast came down to confidence in order to be successful , we need to have confidence in ourselves , utley said rowand added i do n't in any way wish he did n't say it but no matter how good you are , you have to go out and play the games the players believe the phillies will be a better team , and they should be but they may very well be overestimating what they expect the newcomers to contribute garcia is a solid starting pitcher , but he has never demonstrated that he is a no 1 starter in 2005 , when the chicago white sox won the world series , garcia had the fewest victories and the highest earned run average of the team s four primary starters the phillies have a deep starting rotation , but they were n't one of the teams that bolstered their bullpens in the offseason the mets and the atlanta braves did and the addition of helms and barajas does n't make the phillies an instant contender nevertheless , the phillies say they will pitch and field better this season and , they add , they are not putting down the mets howard , trying to keep things in perspective , said that before rollins proclaimed the phillies the team to beat , rollins had stated that the mets had a great team last year utley added they have a great team they won last year they 're on top of the mountain right now , and it s up to us to knock them off they won it last year and they won it handily we ca n't take anything away from what they did or what they 're capable of doing they 're a tough team they have a lot of talent there , a lot of experience there what the mets do n't have , wolf said , is the kind of starting pitching they would like but , he added , their lineup is one of the best in baseball and it s going to be a tough task for the phillies
ornskoldsvik , , april 27 everyone here seems to agree that victor hedman is a hockey prodigy at 16 , he not only has the skills , speed and size 6foot5 , 215 pounds to be a great defenseman , but , according to his coach , hedman also possesses that rare , quiet determination that elevates raw talent into stardom so when hedman is among the top five picks in the 2009 nhl draft , as is widely expected , he will be the pride of this town of 30 , 000 hockeyloving souls but he will not be the first the pride will have to be shared with many others the three players who lead the in points this season all hail from ornskoldsvik the sedin twins , daniel and henrik , and the allstar left winger markus naslund the canucks trail the ducks , three games to one , in the western conference semifinals game 5 is thursday night in anaheim peter forsberg , the nashville predators center who has won the stanley cup and olympic gold , is also from ornskoldsvik in the 20023 season , 13 nhl players had roots in ornskoldsvik s local team , modo , including 7 who were born and raised within a couple of miles of the town a swedish economist calculated that , statistically , to produce that many nhl players , ornskoldsvik should have had about 12 million inhabitants now a new generation is ready to make its impact on the wider hockey world , spurred by modo s recent triumph in the swedish national championships seventeen of the team s 23 players were local products , with 6 born in 1986 or later and hedman has yet to make the team among the sports world s talentbreeding hot spots from the dusty baseball diamonds of the dominican republic to the basketball playgrounds of america s urban areas to the improvised soccer grounds of brazil ornskoldsvik , which lies near the arctic circle , may be the most inconspicuous caught between the deep nordic forests and the baltic sea , it is remote , to say the least but with little to offer except a faint smell of rotten fish when the wind blows from the direction of the pulp mill a few miles away , ornskoldsvik continues to churn out great hockey players like a factory perhaps there is something in the water here or the pizza apart from skates , sticks and pucks , the one thing that all of ornskoldsvik s great hockey sons have in common is that they have fueled their growth with food from the town s unofficial hockey pizzeria , mammamia the hockeyloving pizza maker , giordano sternad , denies adding a secret ingredient to his pies but he admits to being an important part of a closeknit hockey community that comprises most of the town here , it s like one big family united in hockey , he said , sitting next to his pizza oven , surrounded by hockey memorabilia when modo won the national championship april 14 , forsberg , who has given sternad an autographed jersey each time he has changed teams , called from the united states with instructions to buy 30 bottles of dom p rignon for the team s celebration at mammamia if there is such a thing as a father of ornskoldsvik s hockey family , it is anders melinder for the past 20 years , he has been in charge of the town s hockey high school , working closely with modo s junior program in 1990 , melinder , a bear of a man with a bushy mustache and piercing blue eyes , visited minsk , now the capital of belarus but then still a part of the mighty soviet hockey machine there he realized that the swedish training regimen was , as he put it , way behind so he doubled the amount of training his teenage students had to do the new regimen fell on fertile grounds the generation attending melinder s school at the time each year , 1215 teenagers are admitted included forsberg , naslund and niklas sundstrom during workouts and practice games , none of these future nhl veterans would give in it was like war , said sundstrom , who played for 10 years in the nhl , for the rangers , the sharks and the canadiens , but came back this season to win gold with modo we pushed each other so hard it was like life and death according to melinder , their determination set the tone for the generations of players that came after they did what bannister did when he ran the mile in less than four minutes , melinder said they showed it could be done apart from the youth program , people here explain the success with the town s endless playing opportunities there are six indoor rinks in the area , and countless openair places to skate and the fact that there is not really much to do except to play hockey several of those who have played in the nhl showed great talent in other sports the sedin twins were asked to play for the swedish junior national team in soccer but they chose hockey because , hockey is what s close to you here , as their father , tommy , said when modo won gold its first in 28 years 8 , 000 people crowded into the new swedbank arena to celebrate just as many filled the town s main square during the past season , the team had an average attendance of close to 7 , 000 a game in a town with 30 , 000 residents like sundstrom , several nhl players have returned to play for modo others , like forsberg , are investing heavily in the town swedbank arena was partly financed by forsberg and his father , kent it is almost as if this small town is bigger than its stars , said lennart hermannson , modo s juniorprogram coach and a close friend of forsberg it lets them be regular guys when they come back here and now the next generation is coming on a recent spring day , victor hedman was playfully passing the puck in kempehallen the old , rickety hockey stadium where ornskoldsvik stars played before swedbank was built together with his brother oscar , a 21yearold defenseman who played on the winning modo team and who was drafted by the washington capitals asked what his goal was , victor said , to be part of modo s regular lineup and then he added , quietly , to begin with
boston , april 30 a certain slant of light was edward hopper s thing and he made it our thing , hardwired it into our american brains white latemorning light scraping across a storefront twilight , plangent with heat and regret , settling over a city slabs of latenight lamplight chilling the walls of lonely hearts hotels everywhere hopper once said that , as an artist , the only thing he ever aspired to do was to paint sunlight on the side of a house , and that , in essence , is all he did is this an accomplishment weighty enough to support an american master title \? sometimes , yes often , no , at least on the evidence of edward hopper , an exhibition at the here the show is billed as a retrospective , but it is n't significant pieces of hopper s output are missing the paintings done in paris from 1906 to 1910 all but a few of his many drawings and most of what he produced as a commercial illustrator in the long years before he became a star to some of us , hopper was an illustrator from first to last , a justok brush technician , limited in his themes his main gift was for narrative paintings with graphic punch and quasimodernist additives manet touches , de chirico props and like any shrewd storyteller , he knew the value of suspense reveal just so much of a plot no more mystery keeps an audience hanging on unfortunately , there s not much suspense or mystery in this show , which travels to washington and chicago museums are riskfree zones these days , spooning up boilerplates of what audiences are expected to like on the whole , edward hopper fills that bill too well still , it gets off to a strong start and comes to a striking close it opens with a single oil painting , hodgkin s house , done in 1928 when the 40something hopper , his career finally on a roll , was summering in gloucester , mass in the picture , late \( or very early \) sunlight hits one side of a white clapboard house , leaving the rest of it in shadow there are no figures none are needed illumination and architecture engage in an expressive exchange the house , with its two higharched windows , seems to greet the light with shy consternation , like a prim victorian danae startled by a shower of gold this is the hopper effect the impression of everyday life touched with secular sanctity and the show s first gallery gives a good idea of how he developed it in a 1908 painting of a locomotive stalled in a field , he suppresses anecdotal detail to make a prosaic scene inscrutably monumental , even a little sinister in the coarsely brushed summer interior \( 1909 \) , the first of a long series of pictures of women in bedrooms , he introduces narrative ambiguity is the seminude woman crouched by the bed hurt , embarrassed , at rest \? and he turns light into an object a sourceless rectangle of it sits on the floor like a donald judd box light is inseparable from architecture in a 1913 stage set of a picture called new york corner , or corner saloon the mood they generate is the main character on that stage all these elements would be combined in famous later paintings like nighthawks \( 1942 \) the show enshrines that one in a room labeled icons but the mechanics were in place three decades earlier after giving the initial impression of a restless artist who resisted settling into a groove , who might have gone this way or that , comes a long interruption in the form of galleries devoted to a lot of gloucester watercolors and others done in ogunquit , me , through the 1920s the show seems to argue that in these pictures of sunbleached lighthouses and village rooftops hopper was trying to come to grips with depicting light in fact , he had already done so a decade earlier in paris anyway , the new england pictures are far from experimental they 're blandly virtuosic touristbrochure illustration , chamber of commerce modernism maybe watercolor was too easy for hopper he was good at it and maybe the 1920s artistcolony summers were too relaxing he needed resistance , and in the awkwardness of oil painting , the grit of the city , and the great depression , he got it in the 1930s the work toughens up and turns strange in the country he tended to paint houses as if they were public monuments , from a respectful distance in the city no distances are respected hopper s eye is everywhere he peeps through apartment windows , catches people undressed , depressed , lost in thought , just plain lost he looks over shoulders , down women s dresses if hopper s rural work can be too simple , his city scenes can be fussily overcomplicated , illustrational in a different way but when the balance is right , they 're great in house at dusk \( 1935 \) , a woman silhouetted by light stares from a topfloor apartment window , unaware of the darkening park and glorious afterglow sky behind the building she sees nothing we see it all , from a god seye view we 're back to light if art reflects the sensibility of a time and a culture , it also creates that sensibility hopper s light gave depressionera americans , and many others thereafter , a glamorous , even heroic image of themselves as solitary and tragic , persevering , deservedly nostalgic some people think he invented this , but he did n't american landscape painters were there before him hopper grew up in nyack , ny , just up the hudson from manhattan from the bedroom window of his childhood home he had a panoramic view of the river and in essential ways he is direct heir to the 19thcentury hudson river school tradition , particularly the elegiac work of thomas cole as the nation s first official artist , cole was probably expected to create romantic images of a brave and optimistic new world at its dawning what he actually painted was a vision of a golden age of innocence already past his art is far less about hope than about fear fear of change , fear of the future , fear of the unknown , fear of the brash , crass , willdo america bumping and screeching around him hopper s art is not so different technically , he is a modernist , but without a drop of modernism s utopian rationality , confidence and breadth he did n't make a dystopian art , either , one that stakes out an alternative position , as warhol would do he went with anxiety and longing , and made them feelgood entertaining , like hollywood films , which he both influenced and was influenced by often his most ambitious paintings feel hollywoodfake , overproduced , overwritten the renowned second story sunlight \( 1960 \) does with its thelma ritter mother , sunbathing ing nue and lighttouched roof peaks , it is a silly , stagy , symbolic affair you have a sense that the plot , if there is one , is n't worth wondering about it s when hopper lets light take over , assume the leading role , that the late paintings work it does so again in morning sun \( 1952 \) , in which a woman hopper s wife , jo , his principal model sits in profile , in a pink slip , on a bed , staring out a window as light hits her pinched cheeks and rawred hands you can take the picture as just another piece of hopper shtick , with soundstage spots , an actor in place , and a director shouting for silence on the set as a scene called sadness starts or you can take all that out and just leave light breaking the world into squares and rectangles , dark and bright , exposing it , hiding it , before moving on this is the essence , the only drama , of sun in an empty room , the last painting in the show done in 1963 , four years before hopper s death , it is what it says an image of contained space there s a window the trees outside it look windwhipped , but you ca n't hear the wind inside is all blank walls and wheatandhoneycolored sunlight , the two things hopper loved best and felt comfortable with he does n't strain for a story here , or a sentiment , or skill , or completion , which all but the best of his art tries too hard for maybe that s why this is the least gimmicky painting in edward hopper , and the only happy one , and the most lucid
san diego , nov 2 \( ap \) applying lessons learned in the last few weeks , southern california is lining up fire crews and aircraft to get a jump on wildfires if the hot , dry santa ana winds that are expected to return this weekend cause major blazes none of more than two dozen air tankers and military helicopters that arrived from around the country to fight last month s blazes are returning to their home bases , francis solich , a spokesman for the department of forestry and fire protection , said friday if anything breaks loose , mr solich said , they 'll be here the state also has 75 strike teams of five engines spread throughout southern california , he said marines began training with state firefighters at the marine corps air station miramar here on friday , and they will be available to join firefighting efforts this weekend we are training them on how to work in our airspace , said capt matt streck of the forestry agency the marines are great pilots , but they do n't have any experience in how we fight fires as firefighters prepared for this weekend s winds , several small fires continued to burn in sparsely populated areas two large ones also had yet to be contained the forecast this weekend called for santa ana winds gusting to 50 miles per hour near san bernardino and fontana , east of los angeles , and in the mountains near santa clarita , in los angeles county similar gusts were expected in the hamlet of campo , about 60 miles east of san diego on the mexican border , and in the sparsely populated mountains of orange county
henry louis aaron is a man of few words but on the edge of his wooded tennis court in suburban atlanta , he gave me two that would raise some eyebrows no asterisk , said aaron , who reigned as baseball s home run king for 33 years and 121 days i'm not interested in the controversy let s just congratulate barry and give him his due for months , people wondered how aaron was really feeling about barry bonds s relentless assault on no 755 fine , just fine , he said i'm happy for him he was clearly leaving something out , but it was not ambivalence about whether the record was tainted , nor was it sadness at losing his claim to fame instead , it was about the apprehension of reliving what aaron still considers the darkest days of his life you have to understand , aaron said , i got more abuse than barry did , in a different kind of way , for daring to pass the babe i was getting something like 3 , 000 letters a day and had to have a personal bodyguard my parents could n't get a night s peace because of crank calls , and my daughter could n't go out at college because of death threats and i always felt like i was just doing my job , the best that i could on april 8 , 1974 , after he deposited an al downing fastball into the leftfield bullpen in atlantafulton county stadium for career home run no 715 , aaron s first words were , i 'd just like to say to all the fans here this evening that i just thank god it s all over with and that is how he feels now the home run record is just a number , aaron said and now barry has it period let s celebrate and move on people do n't seem to realize that it s not what defines me it s not my legacy it s just an accomplishment i was proud of which made it easier for me to do the things i wanted to do , the things that really mattered and none of that has changed more than a dozen years ago , my partner brian robbins and i flew to atlanta to persuade aaron to allow us to tell his story on film his principal concern was insuring that our focus would be more on civil rights and social history than on home runs and pennant chases he seemed less interested in how much he would be paid for his troubles than in how much the film might raise to launch a dream of his , a foundation to offer scholarships and benefit innercity children as it turned out , the documentary chasing the dream was nominated for an oscar and an emmy , and won a peabody award more important , the chasing the dream foundation has awarded more than 15 million in scholarships to nearly 1 , 000 children all over the country in his video tribute that played on the occasion of bonds s 756th home run , aaron said he hoped the achievement would inspire others to chase their own dreams aaron s achievements did more than that when i interviewed jimmy carter for the film in the summer of 1994 , he had returned from a peace mission to haiti i was astonished that he was able to find time to speak about a baseball player who had retired nearly two decades earlier it was sports , racially integrated sports teams , that brought about the change that i think saved the south , carter said if not for that , for hank aaron and the braves coming to atlanta , i would never have been considered seriously as a presidential candidate telling aaron s story , i realized , would also have to include the vicious hate mail that he received in connection with the chase on a steamy summer morning in 1994 , i went digging through aaron s attic for the letters he had saved what i found cost me my appetite i had to decline an invitation for breakfast and head back to the hotel room to steady myself but aaron only smiled the smile of a teacher whose lessons were finally being learned the smile of a wise man who sensed that the world might actually be catching on still , the more things change , the more 1974 seems like yesterday when recent polls showed that far more black fans than white fans said they were rooting for bonds to break the record , it saddened but did not surprise aaron of course there s been progress , he said but we still have such a long way to go africanamerican kids need to know that anything is possible not just becoming a home run king , but maybe even becoming a president that s the message we 're trying to convey with the chasing the dream foundation after collecting tributes from several dozen hall of famers , two former presidents , numerous friends and relatives , and a handful of prominent civil rights leaders , i chose to end chasing the dream with these words from a 29yearold outfielder with 222 career home runs i think we have to stick together as a people to make it happen , to keep it going , to let our younger brothers know that there is an opportunity out there and you can make it happen you might have to work double time to make it happen , but there is a light at the end of the tunnel as long as we stick together and henry aaron will be remembered a lifetime as far as the black community goes he s the granddaddy of them all he made it possible for us today the speaker was barry bonds as for the notion of surpassing the record of 755 home runs , bonds said in the summer of '94 , impossible , straight impossible no one can do that !
davie , fla as the celebrated and exhaled after their first victory of the season sunday , the peculiar cousin to triumph was already present in their locker room blind optimism that they could somehow upset the undefeated this weekend there would be something special about the dolphins , especially this team , finding a way to knock off the new england patriots , kicker jay feely said after miami s overtime victory against the baltimore ravens if we can get a windy game where you ca n't throw the ball and get some turnovers feely , a close friend of patriots quarterback tom brady s , let his thoughts trail off as a smile creased his face perhaps he realized how absurd his hypothetical scenario sounded the patriots are 21 point favorites to defeat the dolphins and improve to 150 but feely , who grew up in tampa , fla , became a dolphins fan as a boy because of the last time miami faced an undefeated team late in the season on dec 2 , 1985 , a monday night , the dolphins played the chicago bears , who were 120 and headed toward a super bowl title the dolphins , however , were playing with a higher purpose and a bit of a crowded sideline that night larry csonka , jim kiick and bob kuechenberg from the undefeated 1972 dolphins stood among the miami players , exhorting them to be the keepers of the flame according to an account in the new york times , miami coach don shula , who had also coached the 1972 team , told the players the important thing is what happens here and now but there s a lot of dolphin history on the line , things that are important to the coaching staff and to the organization' i would never ask them to win one for the gipper , but i wanted them to know what was at stake the dolphins won , 3824 , to end the bears' bid for an unblemished record in a game that remains a touchstone for miami fans , feely among them the 1972 dolphins reunited sunday to celebrate the 35th anniversary of their accomplishment shula was there , super bowl ring on finger , saying that he thought the patriots were playing by the rules he was careful not to repeat his earlier statement that a perfect season might be tainted by the spying controversy , and he said he would be the first to call patriots coach bill belichick to congratulate him should his team finish 190 the gathering gave the graying dolphins plenty of opportunity to ponder the possibility of sharing history with the patriots and to speculate on the tantalizing possibility that these dolphins , who had not won a game since dec 10 , 2006 , might preserve their honor for at least one more year this is not exactly a dan marinoled team that did this to the bears in 1985 , said nick buoniconti , a former dolphins and boston patriots linebacker who was on the 1972 team tom brady would have to have appendicitis , and half the defense would have to have dysentery for them to lose this is a great football team the dolphins are not even a good football team the chance of them beating the patriots is slim and none indeed , the 1985 dolphins were on their way to a 124 season and a loss in the american football conference championship game to the patriots the 2007 dolphins are enduring a season memorable only for its futility they have been so ghastly that when asked about reports that the owner , wayne huizenga , was considering selling the team , buoniconti responded , if i owned this team , i 'd be depressed this is a team bereft of much talent , hammered by injuries and so bad that the firstyear head coach , cam cameron , may not keep his job jim mandich , a tight end for the 1972 dolphins and now a team broadcaster , said a victory over the patriots would be the equivalent of appalachian state beating michigan but in the locker room and on the airwaves , hope sprang eternal , epitomized by the postgame embrace shared by cameron and defensive end jason taylor , who have reportedly been at odds vonnie holliday , the dolphins' ebullient defensive lineman , referred to the dolphins' inexplicable recent history against the patriots in 2004 , with miami about to go 412 and new england headed toward its third super bowl championship , the dolphins beat the patriots in december they also beat them in december 2005 and again last season what better time before we go to new england to get this kind of confidence , to get our swagger , to get this off our back so we can play free , holliday said they even switched the time , because everybody was anticipating 014 versus 140 not anymore what an opportunity a few of the 1972 players toast one another when the last undefeated team falls they will not be on the sideline this time , and even their football descendants are not sure it is time to put the champagne on ice it would be especially meaningful if anybody puts an end to it , csonka said to insinuate that the dolphins , he added , pausing , that s a pretty long stretch from where the dolphins are right now
paradise valley , ariz , jan 7 the florida football team has labored this season without a reliable tailback its kicker hit only 30 percent of his attempts and none from beyond 33 yards the gators rank 118th out of 119 division ia teams in penalties , giving up 64 yards a game has breezed through the season with the topranked defense , the heisman trophy winner at quarterback and only one close game that means the topranked buckeyes \( 120 \) and the no 2 gators \( 121 \) meet in the bowl championship series title game monday night having made markedly different journeys one of the biggest themes of this ohio state season has been the need to stay sharp during long lulls in action or competition the buckeyes did not play a ranked opponent between a victory at iowa on sept 30 and their game against michigan on nov 18 only 2 of their 12 games have been decided by fewer than 17 points florida s season , meanwhile , has seen a blur of creativity and innovation seven of the gators' 13 games have been decided by 10 points or fewer the gators have juggled two quarterbacks , adjusted to their kicking deficiencies and managed to compensate for the loss of defensive tackle marcus thomas , maybe their best nfl prospect , who was thrown off the team in the course of a football season , it s all about adapting , florida receiver jemalle cornelius said we 've had to adapt and go with the flow the gators survived one of the most difficult schedules in the nation and then , improbably , vaulted into the national title game on the regular season s final day when ucla upset southern california i have n't sat back and said , wow , florida coach urban meyer said but it s been a team that s had to fight , scratch and claw you 're playing 17 true freshmen , blocking punts and field goals , and your quarterback is running a bit of a single wing there s been a lot of minds in there working and trying to be creative the biggest area of creativity for the gators has been the offense their leading rusher , deshawn wynn , ran for only 621 yards and was slowed by injuries lately , the gators have relied more on percy harvin , who has run the ball from the receiver position , and the backup quarterback tim tebow , the nation s top quarterback recruit last year for the past week , meyer has referred to harvin and tebow as the team s top rushers meyers acknowledged the implausibility of reaching the final game without a reliable tailback that is kind of hard to imagine , he said it is also difficult to figure how the gators successfully juggled two quarterbacks , a system that often proves disastrous the senior chris leak is entrenched as the starter and takes a majority of the snaps leak throws one of the most beautiful balls in the college game , though he has often thrown them to the other team he had 13 interceptions , but cobbled together a season that put him among the top 20 in passing efficiency some of the biggest plays by a florida quarterback this season have come from tebow , a true freshman who takes 10 to 15 snaps a game many are in shortyardage or goalline situations , where tebow can use his 6foot3 , 229pound frame to ram ahead for tough yardage tebow converted a fourthand1 in the fourth quarter at tennessee to set up leak s winning touchdown pass and threw two touchdown passes against louisiana state in a 2310 victory florida s quarterbacks have accepted their roles the offensive coordinator , dan mullen , said that while watching film of tebow getting stuffed on a run during the alabama game , leak joked , hey tim , you know they lift weights at alabama , too there is no jealousy , mullen said with a patchwork offense , florida has had to rely on its staunch defense and a specialteams unit that has thrived in every area outside of fieldgoal kicking by chris hetland the strengths of those two units have allowed the florida offense to play to its strengths and not gamble this florida team has played out its season much like the 2002 ohio state team , which was known as the luckeyes for its good fortune during its run to the national title that team , much like this florida one , was a heavy underdog in the title game but the buckeyes ground down one of the best miami teams and eventually won in double overtime florida will probably try a similar approach monday we know that we do n't have to come out and score a bunch of points , because our defense will keep us in the game , mullen said our special teams are going to make a play instead of give up a play those little things happening allow you to be more patient on offense the baffling part about florida s success is how often the gators have been penalized florida is averaging more than eight flags a game meyer refused to accept the argument that the penalties were simply a byproduct of aggression undisciplined teams make penalties , he said that s not something we are very proud of but while meyer jokes that florida has played enough close games this year to give him gray hairs and ulcers , he said he was proud of his team s resolve and the gators are just one more game away from completing one of the most improbable runs in college football you learn a lot about your football team when you get hit right in the mouth and you respond to that , meyer said we were hit in the mouth quite often this year against some very good opponents on monday , in its biggest test , florida will have a chance to respond against the nation s best team on the game s biggest stage

correspondents dinner , which mr giuliani attended as a guest of fox s parent company , the news corporation now these allies and friends find themselves on largely uncharted political turf mr giuliani , 63 , is a leading republican candidate for president mr ailes , 67 , is head of fox news , the preeminent media outlet for likely voters in a republican primary whether their friendship would ever affect coverage fox insists that it has not and will not it is nonetheless the sort of relationship that other campaigns have noted , though none wanted to speak publicly for fear of offending the station so far this year , one political journal found , mr giuliani has logged more time on fox interview programs than any other candidate most of the time has been spent with sean hannity , an acknowledged admirer of the former mayor , according to the data compiled by the journal , known as the hotline fox executives say mr giuliani s appearances have been driven by his news value and by his status as a frontrunner , not by his relationship with mr ailes i ca n't remember his ever saying anything , one way or the other , about our coverage of the giuliani campaign , brit hume , the anchor who coordinates much of fox s political coverage , said of mr ailes and i am under no injunctions , restrictions , encouragements or directions of any kind as to how that campaign should be covered yet the relationship between mr ailes and mr giuliani is of the sort that led mr ailes to grouse about cnn during the clinton administration rick kaplan , the president of cnn at the time , and president clinton were established friends mr ailes , asserting the cable channel s coverage of the president was altogether too warm , called it the clinton news network mr ailes declined to be interviewed for this article , as did mr giuliani , whose campaign would not answer specific questions about the relationship but aides to both men acknowledge that they have been friends for more than 20 years after meeting at dinner parties in the 1980s , where they discovered a shared respect for ronald reagan , they developed into the kind of friends who lend one another help , trade accolades and attend each other s weddings they grew close enough that when mr ailes was hospitalized in 1998 , mr giuliani showed up at his bedside bearing gifts a book about new york landmarks and an issue of wine spectator today they see each other infrequently , according to aides , who said mr ailes did not offer mr giuliani any sort of political advice in 2002 , mr ailes was criticized for having offered advice to president bush months before in the form of a note that suggested how to respond to the 9 11 attacks critics contended that mr ailes , as a news executive , had crossed a line mr ailes said he was only expressing his outrage over the attacks on his country i did not give up my american citizenship to take this job , he said at the time for much of his career , mr ailes s job was to counsel politicians he worked as the media consultant to three presidents richard m nixon , mr reagan and the current president s father , george h w bush few , if any , presidents have taken office with a close friend at the helm of a network news division , said thomas e patterson , the bradlee professor of government and the press at harvard , and author of out of order , a book about the relationship between the news media and politics but the value of television appearances to politicians , he said , has never been in doubt it gets to be circular , mr patterson said the more coverage you get , the easier it is to stay up in the polls you stay up in the polls , you get more coverage it s a cycle that the second and thirdtier candidates just tear their hair out about when mr ailes and mr giuliani met , mr giuliani had recently finished a tour as associate attorney general i had found myself at several dinners with roger , including at his house , and each time we would wind up talking about how much we liked ronald reagan , and how much we agreed with his policies , mr giuliani wrote in his book , leadership the two joined forces in the 1989 mayoral campaign , when , mr giuliani later said , mr ailes helped him overcome his stiffness in front of cameras so as to connect with people rather than launch into a dissertation roger explained that every time a candidate is given a microphone , he s getting 100 , 000 worth of publicity , mr giuliani wrote in his book after he became mayor , mr giuliani spoke at a reception in 1994 as mr ailes was named president of the new cnbc business news network before a crowd in the rainbow room , the mayor listed mr ailes s accomplishments as a producer of comedy specials and documentaries , including the emmy awardwinning television and the presidency i am personally gratified to see that roger has reached a new pinnacle in a remarkable career , because roger has played an important role in my own career , mr giuliani said , according to a draft of his speech in 1996 , when mr ailes and rupert murdoch started fox news , mr giuliani intervened as mayor after time warner cable refused to carry the new station in the city time warner , which had 11 million subscribers in the city , said it had room for only one more news station , which it had just awarded to msnbc fox accused time warner of trying to protect cnn , which time warner was buying on sept 20 , 1996 , mr ailes called mr giuliani to ask for help a flurry of meetings followed , but time warner did not budge three weeks later , the giuliani administration said it would broadcast fox news on a municipalrun station , citing the benefits of offering diverse news sources and protecting the 600 jobs fox had created we looked into it , and the mayor decided , this is something the city had a vested interest in and that we should pursue it , and on that level i agreed with him , fran reiter , a deputy mayor under mr giuliani , said in an interview i really believe that the mayor believed what time warner was doing was wrong but a federal judge blocked his plan , calling it special advocacy to reward a friend and to further a particular viewpoint the companies came to terms the next year time warner executives found the pressure from mr giuliani extraordinary , richard aurelio , a former head of time warner s city cable operation , said in an interview to have politicians getting into the act of making those judgments was , to me , outrageous , he said never before had any politician ever done anything of that kind the episode undermined mr giuliani s relationship with richard d parsons , the president of time warner , whom mr giuliani had once worked with at a law firm and who had been one of mr giuliani s few prominent black supporters a spokesman for mr parsons , now time warner s chairman , said he was not available to be interviewed under mr ailes , fox news grew to claim the largest audience in cable news now he is about to introduce a new channel for the murdoch empire , focusing on financial news the acquisition of dow jones and its marquee financial brands is part of a murdochailes strategy to conquer a new frontier in business news mr ailes has at various times been described as tightly controlling coverage , even suggesting particular jokes for his anchors to deliver but a spokeswoman said his influence had grown more diffuse since he took over several other fox divisions mr hume , managing editor of fox s washington coverage , said mr ailes was involved in meetings to discuss stories , but had never done anything to favor any candidate this year through july 15 , mr giuliani appeared for 115 minutes in interviews on fox , according to the hotline , the political journal more than half of those minutes , 78 , were spent with mr hannity , cohost of the hannity colmes talk show mr hannity , a conservative who has spoken of his admiration for mr giuliani , makes his own decisions about bookings , a spokeswoman said mr giuliani s onair time on fox was 25 percent greater than that of his republican competitor mitt romney , and nearly double that of senator john mccain of arizona fred d thompson , who has yet to formally announce his candidacy , came in second to mr giuliani with 101 minutes of fox interviews aides to mr ailes said he and mr giuliani spoke with and saw each other only infrequently these days , though the two sat together in april at the correspondents' dinner mr ailes attended mr giuliani s 2003 wedding and was invited to the yankees' world series celebrations at city hall mr giuliani sent a personal note to mr ailes when his son was born in 2000 two years earlier , he had presided over mr ailes s wedding at city hall thanks for making our families feel so special , mr ailes wrote later in a note to mr giuliani we appreciate everything you did to make it such a tremendous day , but most of all thank you for your friendship
british prime minister tony blair seems determined to use his final weeks in office to show how far he has strayed from the pledges of clean government that helped sweep him to power a decade ago defending his decision to block a corruption investigation into the sale of fighter jets and other weapons to saudi arabia , mr blair said last week that the probe would have led nowhere except to the complete wreckage of a vital strategic relationship that glib dismissal ignores the crucial point bribery is never justified , smart or legal so says the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions , by which britain is legally bound the case revolves around allegations that bae systems , britain s largest defense contractor , paid bribes to secure a 20year deal to sell tornado fighters and other weapons to saudi arabia last december , mr blair halted an investigation into the matter on grounds of national security the saudis were apparently threatening to cut off the deal , as well as intelligence about terrorist activities then , earlier this month the bbc and the guardian newspaper reported that over the years , bae had paid millions of pounds into accounts controlled by saudi prince bandar bin sultan , a highly influential former ambassador to washington and top foreign policy adviser to the saudi king prince bandar and bae have denied any wrongdoing perhaps there was none , and perhaps the saudis leaned on mr blair only because they did n't want british investigators rummaging in their bank accounts the house of saud regards the kingdom as personal property , making it hard to distinguish between a legitimate payment to the state treasury and a bribe to one of the 200odd royal princes mr blair ought to understand , even if the princes do n't , that avoiding embarrassment to powerful friends and allies is not a legitimate reason to quash a corruption investigation all that does is increase suspicion , and send the wrong message to any other princes or government leaders who think that a wink and an envelope is the only way to conduct international business
stratton , vt , march 15 the 1260 is the next revolution in snowboarding literally after a 1080degree spin \( three full rotations \) , which was a money trick at the winter olympics last year for the past halfdozen years , trick progression in snowboarding has moved from 900degree revolutions , to 1080s , called 10s , and on to 1260s \( three and a half rotations \) and with such an emphasis on spinning , some riders have suggested the sport might be blurring what everyone seems to agree is its most important element style some guys are doing 1260s , but now you have to figure out how to add grabs , mason aguirre , who finished fourth at the winter games , said , referring to maneuvers in which a rider reaches down and grabs his board while airborne judges will dock you points if you do n't grab , because it does n't look good few sports stress aesthetics like snowboarding the international ski federation , the sanctioning body for snowboarding at the olympics , requires one straight aerial and one rotation during runs but most judged competitions , especially in the united states , have no compulsory elements we do n't want that for our sport , said greg johnson , competition director at the us open of snowboarding , where slopestyle finals begin friday at stratton mountain when riders have routines , everything becomes homogenous that s a very bad thing for snowboarding snowboarding has to be creative in order to establish a baseline for competitions , judges all of whom are trained watch practice runs to gauge how riders are performing at a particular event as a result , each event is judged according to a unique standard then , during runs , riders are evaluated on a number of factors , including difficulty of tricks , amplitude \( height \) , how a rider grabs , whether his hand touches down and , especially , style but scores are still based on overall impression , and the judges reward innovation , which allows for a wide range of subjective interpretation i think it s the hardest sport to judge , for sure , johnson said and although judging has not been without controversy , most riders want to retain its interpretive elements style is such a huge part of snowboarding , said travis rice , who won a silver medal in slopestyle at the winter x games in january said aguirre i do n't think snowboarding should be a spintowin sport tricks should look stylie when it comes to barriers and benchmarks , baseball has a 400 batting average running has a fourminute mile and snowboarding has , by most accounts , a 1440degree spin \( four rotations \) only eight riders can land a 1260 on a slopestyle course , and fewer can land one in a halfpipe and none with any style , according to johnson and with the largest superpipes now 22 feet tall , and the cutting equipment used to make them nearly maxed out , spins may have scratched the upper limits of what is possible when that happens , and all the riders can perform the same number of rotations in the air , then style will become even more important , johnson said style elements become more important for bigger rotations , he said all things being equal , it s all about who has the most style , a certain lan in the pipe rice has advocated a more personal approach to trick progression a lot of it lies in individual style and different ways to make a trick your own , rather than another rotation , he said in 2004 rice innovated a doublecork an offaxis spin almost by accident while soaring 90 feet through the backcountry of utah s wasatch mountains while launching off a jump at a place known as the pyramid gap , he became more offaxis than he intended while spinning a frontside 900 the trick , which has suggested new possibilities beyond simply spinning , has since been introduced during competitions several riders including the 2006 olympic halfpipe gold medal winner , shaun white have been working on landing variations on it meanwhile , women s riding has more room to grow i do n't think that s the case for women s snowboarding , as women have been behind the men , said kelly clark , the 2002 olympic gold medal winner in halfpipe clark suggested the upper level for progressing women s spins would be 1080s three full rotations female riders , a few of whom first pulled 900s in 2003 , have begun landing them backtoback during pipe runs when jake burton carpenter founded the us open of snowboarding 25 years ago , he had no sponsors , he used an upsidedown kitchen table as a start gate , and his biggest concern was finding riders competent to get down the mountain without falling now riders launch 40 feet above a halfpipe , spinning three and a half rotations in the air i do n't think we 'll see snowboarding as spincrazy in the next five years as it has been in the past five years , carpenter said every time the sport starts to get too gymnastically oriented , the sport rebels

young , bubbly and ready to make a statement about its status in the gymnastics world that is the team the united states sent to the pan american games in rio de janiero , a group that includes a world champion , two national gold medalists and three teenage girls with dreams of matching or surpassing their teammates and none is older than 17 we have lots of talented juniors this year who just happened to become seniors , coach martha karolyi said friday as the six americans nastia liukin , shawn johnson , samantha peszek , ivana hong , rebecca bross and amber trani posed for photographs together beneath an american flag we thought this is a great opportunity to give them the experience in competition of this type of organization , which is just like the olympics we included nastia because her name is known , and she has the experiences and the resourcefulness she is a senior able to share her experiences with the younger competitors this group has the right chemistry and training this is the new generation for the next major events coming up the world championships in two months , and then looking forward to selecting the team for the olympics the right stuff begins with liukin and johnson liukin , whose father won two gold medals at the 1988 olympics for the soviet union and whose mother was a world champion in rhythmic gymnastics , is the veteran she won five medals , including two golds , at the 2003 pan american games she carried her momentum from that performance to win her second united states junior title in 2004 , but , at 14 was ineligible for the athens games because she was too young instead , she won the senior united states title in 2005 she followed with two golds and two silvers at the world championships last year , she won yet another united states crown and two apparatus titles , but an ankle injury limited her to just the uneven bars at the world championships that same ankle is dicey enough that liukin will go only on bars and balance beam in rio de janeiro as she builds toward bigger things , like the beijing olympics next year i do n't even think about the olympics right now , liukin said it s always in the back of your mind and it comes to the front quite a bit but shortterm goals lead to longterm goals the olympics are so huge , but things can go wrong and so you ca n't get overwhelmed about it , it s just not worth it you ca n't go to the olympics without the nationals and making the team still , after missing the 2004 olympics because of her age , was liukin getting antsy \? did she look forward to finally getting on that grand stage \? she said she did not hold a grudge about having been excluded because of the olympic age limit i never thought of that , being born a year earlier so i could have gone , she said i kind of believe that rule does protect younger athletes until they are ready now , i am so much more experienced , so it was a blessing really i'm still young and my time is getting closer bross is in the same predicament that liukin was four years ago she turned 14 last wednesday , and is ineligible to compete in beijing so she turns often to liukin it helps calm you down and get you through stuff because you have not been there before , bross said i guess it s a good rule a lot of young girls can get hurt easy if you 've been in the sport a long time like nastia , the more you know to do karolyi views the pan american games as the perfect opportunity to learn , so she is not emphasizing results too much yes , everyone is expecting us to win , but we are not talking about it with the kids , she said you do it the right way , always positive , and they enjoy doing it for the pleasure to be the best you can be
tough is a brand all the republican candidates want to own as they run for president tough on terrorism , tough on crime , tough on democrats but representative tom tancredo , republican of colorado , is standing out from the pack , advocating a position that even the most hawkish members of his own party deem irresponsible during a debate in iowa on sunday and in other recent campaign appearances , mr tancredo said that the united states should reserve the right to bomb islam s two holiest sites , mecca and medina , in retaliation for a major terrorist attack on american soil if it is up to me , we are going to explain that an attack on this homeland of that nature would be followed by an attack on the holy sites in mecca and medina , mr tancredo told iowa voters last week a state department spokesman called his comments absolutely crazy none of the other candidates on the stage with him during sunday s debate came to his defense marc santora photo
, march 15 the security council received on thursday a draft of a new resolution to impose sanctions on for its defiance of demands that it suspend its nuclear enrichment activities and return to negotiations over its nuclear program the measure expands a roster from an earlier resolution that lists companies and individuals subject to an assets freeze among them are bank sepah , four groups controlled by the iranian revolutionary guard corps , an elite military force , and seven commanders identified as key persons in the corps the draft also says that iran is prohibited from exporting any arms or material related to its weapons programs and that other countries should make sure that none of their citizens transport or purchase any such material from iran alejandro d wolff , the acting american ambassador , said the draft was a good , balanced , incremental step , while emyr jones parry , the british ambassador , said it was a ratcheting up of restrictions in the last resolution on iran that measure , adopted on dec 23 , called for iran to cease nuclear activities within 60 days or face further action iran not only ignored the feb 21 deadline but also announced that it was accelerating its enrichment schedule the new document is a result of weeks of negotiations among germany and the five permanent members of the council , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , and was agreed to overnight after lastminute reviews in the six capitals it will now be discussed by the 10 other members of the council , effectively postponing a vote until late next week the united states and the european countries involved in drafting the resolution wanted tougher steps but had to factor in objections from china and russia , which maintain close commercial ties with tehran and protested any terms that could harm the iranian economy or public instead of the broad ban on imports of weapons that the americans wanted , the draft calls on countries to exercise vigilance and restraint in supplying iran with heavy weapons , including tanks , combat aircraft and artillery systems , or with any training or technical assistance connected to such weapons also dropped from the original proposal is a ban on international travel by iranian officials engaged in nuclear activities it was replaced by a call on nations to notify the council if any of the named people pass through their territory the text calls on countries and financial institutions to curb all grants , financial aid and loans to iran except those for humanitarian and developmental purposes the draft gives iran 60 days to comply or face a threat of additional penalties , which the text specifies would be nonmilitary in keeping with the drafters' repeatedly stated wish to persuade iran to return to negotiations , however , it emphasizes that all measures will be suspended if tehran halts enrichment activities after 60 days , the director of the international atomic energy agency , dr mohamed elbaradei , is to report to the council on whether iran has met the demand to cease enrichmentrelated and reprocessing activities such a report last month led to the current draft resolution iran s president , , said this week that he wanted to come to new york to appear at the session where a vote will be held richard a grenell , the spokesman for the united states mission , said that an official request for a visa had been received thursday the iranian party will include 38 others , most of them security people , he said dumisani s kumalo , the ambassador of south africa who is council president this month , said normal procedures allowed for highlevel representatives of a country that is the subject of a council debate to appear before the panel and speak mr wolff , the american representative , said , i find it again ironic that president ahmadinejad , who is quoted today as saying that he tears up security council resolutions and has no respect for what the security council says , is interested in coming and addressing the council uranium enrichment is the first step in making fuel that can be used for nuclear power plants , but is also necessary for making nuclear arms iran has asserted its national right to pursue nuclear energy for generating electricity , but the united states and european nations contend that its real purpose is making bombs the december resolution ordered all countries to stop supplying iran with materials and technology that could contribute to its nuclear and missile programs and to freeze the assets of 10 iranian companies and 12 individuals conducting the programs the new draft identifies 15 individuals and 13 companies the presentation on thursday was made in response to complaints from the 10 nonpermanent members of the panel that germany and the five permanent members in the past had labored for weeks in private on a text , only to submit it to the full council and demand speedy approval mr kumalo said the council would insist on not being treated like a rubber stamp

philadelphia chris rivers , the director of basketball in reebok s sports marketing division , represents everything there is to love and hate about summer basketball a man who has devoted his life to the game , rivers has also been privy to what some would consider its largest corruptions he spent three years on what he labeled the lebron chase , a reference to the marketing courtship of lebron james i stayed at his house watching him play video games more times than i should have , rivers recalled now he is in charge of reebok s showcase basketball camp , called rbk u , a gathering of top talent here this week that has been part of the grassroots basketball theme of stressing education and fundamentals  forgive me if i am slightly cynical about the education portion of the camp in my second year at the adidas abcd camp in new jersey several years ago , i was enrolled in a mandatory sat prep class in response to low scores on a practice exam , our instructor chose a novel approach he insisted that we would not learn enough mathematics over the course of the week to improve our scores instead , he introduced us to a technique in which most of us were already well versed guessing for all math questions , we were to throw out the highest number the right answer is almost never the highest number second , we were to throw out the lowest number the right answer is usually not the lowest number , either finally , we were told to throw out the answer that looked correct every question is accompanied by a trick answer , the one that is too obvious or too visually appealing once you have thrown out the three incorrect answers , you are left with the correct ones and some of our scores went up none of which is to say that the classes were not well intentioned obviously , there is a need for sat prep this year at rbk u , the classes appeared even better there were seminars on dealing with the news media and managing finances and scattered among the more informative classes were some topics aimed at fulfilling the players' curiosity one introduced them to the process of designing and making shoes another had them produce presentations on other career opportunities in sports rivers said he especially enjoyed seeing the group presentations , because they showed the athletes in a different light i can assure you that the abcd camp allowed me to do the same thing my fondest memories are not from the court or the classroom , but rather from the hotel , where i hung out with guys who would be future nba players one night , a teammate called me to come up to his room he met me at the door with his finger over his lips , making me promise not to tell anyone what he was hiding in the world of summer basketball , i was expecting either expensive gear or cash i found neither in his room , he had an entire bed covered with candy he had taken all of the candy from the players lounge the player \? robert swift , who would later be drafted out of high school by seattle i can only imagine what he did with the millions of dollars from his rookie contract  of course , not all of reebok s interest in the players is altruistic rivers s experience with james \( who ultimately signed with nike \) is only one example of shoe companies working to forge ties with players and their families in the hope of luring them with endorsement deals later but rivers insisted that this was not the primary motivation for the camps if he wanted to recruit elite players , he said , there would be better ways to do it than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars running a camp only a couple players even have the potential to sell shoes anyway the purpose of rbk u is not to recruit players the purpose is branding rivers compared it to apple s donations of computers or cocacola s donations of drinks he wants the best basketball players to be , he said , subliminally engulfed in reebok he wants them to go home and wear reebok shoes , shirts and shorts technically , all of the gear at the camp is supposed to be purchased for 200 or returned but my last night at abcd camp showed how lenient those rules could be i received a call from a scout who had given me a ride to camp he said adidas wanted me to have the gear and that there was no reason to turn it in the next day , it was no surprise to see everyone still wearing their shoes and shorts this fits directly into the marketing plan of the camps if the top players return home in reebok gear , their teammates , little brothers and others who look up to them may follow along but reebok considers more than its bottom line , rivers said while the company showcases its products at the camp , players can showcase their abilities and coaches can see them without chasing them all over the country some say that money in the shoe business is ruining the sport , yet it is important to remember that along with the vices come virtues all you have to do is talk to any player to realize that they know it is the opportunity of a lifetime , even if there are potholes along the way
grasse , tucked in the hills outside this small southern french town , high among the terraced olive groves , sits a peaceful stone mediterranean villa once acquired for the family of  today , the villa is abandoned its fish pond overgrown with reeds , its rooms ransacked , its walls scrawled with graffiti and colorful murals of the kind once seen on new york city subway cars the arab father christmas , reads one of the spraypainted slogans left behind by a gang of squatters who briefly took over the property after its iraqi caretakers abandoned it in the wake of the war the french riviera has long been a favorite playland for dodgy characters of all stripes jeanclaude duvalier moved here in 1986 after being chased out of haiti mobutu sese seko , the deposed dictator of zaire , also had a home here but none can compare with the notoriety of iraq s former first family neighbors say the iraqi government bought the grasse house in the 1980s from count alexandre de marenches , who has since died but was director of france s foreign intelligence service when mr hussein visited southern france in 1975 , with jacques chirac , then the prime minister mr hussein s half brother , barzan ibrahim altikriti , who was iraq s representative to the united nations in geneva at about the same time but who most notably served as chief of the fearsome iraqi intelligence service , picked out another property that villa , on the corniche of earthly paradise overlooking the sea above cannes , is also abandoned and in disrepair , its shutters shattered , its grounds overgrown the two hideaways were among the iraqi assets later frozen under united nations resolution 1483 immediately after the americanled invasion in 2003 the secluded property in grasse perfume capital of the world soon became the redoubt of squatters who , judging from the paintings and debris , spent much of their time smoking marijuana and vandalizing the premises i'm sitting with satan , one graffiti scrawl reads the police chased the squatters away years ago , and mice are the only intruders now , giving the empty rooms a forlorn , haunted air the properties are finally being unfrozen and transferred back to iraqi control mr hussein and mr tikriti , meanwhile , have been hanged contacts are taking place directly between the iraqi and french governments , said an official at the iraqi embassy in paris , adding that it had taken some time to find the relevant documents in iraqi archives he said the new iraqi government expected to take control of the properties soon it intends to keep the house in cannes but sell the one in grasse , he said no wonder the sheetmetal gates leading into the walled property are unlocked and both the gatehouse and main building are gutted the 25foot swimming pool is filled with a slimy compost of fallen leaves it s a disgrace , with a capital d , said the caretaker at a nearby property still owned by the marenches family the iraqis evidently left little of value in the eightbedroom , fivebathroom house one of the main bedrooms has satincovered shelves in its closets , another has velveteencovered shelves , some labeled walking shoes and others town shoes , suggesting that the owner had many shoes and relied on someone else to put them away there are a few sofas , some beds and two armchairs all tumbled and torn by the squatters a safe , once concealed behind a wall , is open and empty , a gaping hole blowtorched into its thick steel door a few magazines dated 1988 suggest that the house was not used much by the iraqis after the persian gulf war in 1991 , when united nations sanctions put a crimp on the family s travel abroad there are few other clues to what the iraqis did in the house besides broken telephones , a smashed television set , a damaged stove and dishwasher and an instruction pamphlet for ballistic safety goggles together with a halfdozen gun targets , the black human silhouettes unblemished by bullet holes saddam hussein never even visited the villa , french and iraqi authorities say some accounts suggest that his son uday did while he was temporarily banished from iraq for killing his father s personal valet and food taster at a party in honor of suzanne mubarak , wife of the egyptian president , hosni mubarak they never bothered us , said an elderly woman in a brown coat and cameo brooch , walking outside a neighboring house we were more worried about the squatters setting the place on fire

albert bergeret and his new york gilbert and sullivan players have been plying the savoyard repertory for more than three decades starting at a time when small operetta companies were plentiful in new york and outliving all the competition that is n't how fans of this repertory , and even admirers of this company , would have wanted it although the groups that flourished in the 1970s worked on tight budgets that barely allowed for makeshift sets and costumes , their combined activity kept the scene lively and the music on the stage still , it would be hard to find a more devoted champion of this repertory than mr bergeret , whose company has come a long way its productions , if by no means metscale extravaganzas , are attractively built and the troupe has moved from symphony space to the more grandly theatrical city center if only its season stretched through the year , as it did in the early days , instead of being confined to a few weeks every january mr bergeret revived his trusty production of the mikado on saturday , and the evening performance \( there was also one in the afternoon \) had everything an admirer of this music could want there was , for example , a fine balance of the traditional text and topical amendments in as someday it may happen , for example , koko , the squeamish lord high executioner , expanded his little list of those who would not be missed to include suv drivers and the checkout girl at rite aid who s perpetually annoyed in the miya sama chorus the nonsense syllables were replaced with the names of japanese electronics and motorcycle companies after the first pass and when the mikado sang of making the punishment fit the crime , he suggested severe penalties for cellphone users in the theater mostly gilbert s libretto and sullivan s music were left to do their work as written that work includes skewering governments , bureaucrats , legal arcana and , not least , opera itself along the way it offers a parade of gilbert and sullivan favorites , among them , a wand'ring minstrel i , three little maids from school are we and here s a howdedo daniel lockwood s strong , attractive tenor served nankipoo s music well and proved to be the most polished voice in the cast but vocal beauty is n't the point here if stephen quint was a vocally roughhewn koko , he has a good theatrical voice and an ear for broad comic timing broader still was louis dall'ava s portrayal of poohbah as a rolypoly in makeup reminiscent of that worn by the rock band kiss elizabeth hillebrand gave a lovely performance as yumyum , and she was well matched in the ensembles with melissa attebury , as pittising , and lauren wenegrat , as peepbo dianna dollman contributed a suitably imperious rendering of katisha keith jurosko , as the mikado , and edward prostak , as pishtush , played their roles with comparative subtlety mr bergeret paced it all comfortably and drew a solid performance from the orchestra
houston , aug 8 the legend of matt schaub may have had its genesis one saturday in late summer in charlottesville , va , with an embarrassing benching in a college season opener nfl reputations are usually built from something more auspicious than a junior quarterback briefly losing his job to a freshman , but in schaub s case , virginia coach s quick hook in 2002 paved the way for a season that put schaub on the nfl radar screen schaub has remained there , existing a little below the public s consciousness , a starterinwaiting as the mythology about him grew among football insiders until now schaub will start for the this season , the first time he has been anything more than a talkedabout fillin since college schaub won back the cavaliers' starting job not long after the benching and finished the season with a completion percentage of nearly 70 percent , shockingly high even in the highpercentage west coast offense that virginia and many nfl teams use there are few secrets in football scouting and almost none when the subject is a quarterback so when a 6foot5 quarterback , playing for a former nfl head coach in a popular offensive system , sparkles the way schaub did that season , the luster does not wear off for a while , even after an injuryrelated dip in his senior season schaub became a thirdround pick by the atlanta falcons in 2004 and since then has been the latest manifestation of an old football mantra the most popular guy on the team is the backup quarterback it s similar to phil simms and jeff hostetler , new england patriots coach said , referring to the giants' quarterback situation in the 1990s sometimes you just have another quarterback who is a good quarterback , but for whatever reason he has n't had the opportunity gil brandt , the former dallas cowboys personnel chief who analyzes the draft for , had schaub rated with the top group of quarterbacks in the 2004 draft philip rivers , ben roethlisberger and but when atlanta grabbed him to be s backup and the object of falcons fans' ardor whenever vick looked uneven schaub slipped in seamlessly to atlanta s west coast style , which used almost the same playbook and language as virginia that gave schaub a quick start and allowed him to play well in preseason games , which serve as public auditions for backups but during a game in his second season , when vick was hurt , schaub served notice to general managers that he might have been ready for more it was only his second professional start \( his first was a miserable performance in a loss to the new orlean saints in his rookie season \) the opponent the defending super bowl champion patriots new england blitzed schaub often , and schaub threw deep schaub rallied the falcons from a 14point deficit in the first half and a 15point deficit late in the second half before led the winning drive for the patriots schaub finished with 298 yards passing , 3 touchdown passes and no turnovers in a 3128 loss those might have been the moments when people took notice and i made a name for myself , schaub said after a recent practice after that , when an nfl team needed a quarterback , schaub was at the top of the list got hurt , and the jets wanted schaub , who was strikingly like pennington without great arm strength , but with intelligence to make up for it the oakland raiders were interested , too in denver , the offensive coordinator gary kubiak and the personnel chief rick smith were paying attention even other nfl players , like houston receiver andre johnson , heard about him kubiak said , if you step up on sunday and you do it , nobody in this league forgets it schaub waited , hearing his name and then hearing nothing when those times arose , i forced myself to not think about that , schaub said i just had to keep telling myself i 'll get an opportunity groh fielded calls from his friends in the league seeking information , and he told them all the same thing he s a terrific team guy at a position that on the nfl level , with all the attention , can become very individualized , groh said he knows what he s looking at , he s smart , he s well prepared , he recognizes it quickly , he s fast to react to it good accuracy the falcons , also smitten with schaub , clung to the security blanket he provided in the uneven vick era all based on that stellar college season , a few snippets of preseason film and the one inspiring start against new england , even though schaub was 02 in his nfl starts it was an encouraging r sum with a gaping hole experience the falcons , faced with losing schaub to free agency next year , finally traded him in march to the texans , where kubiak is the coach and smith is the general manager the trade came weeks before the falcons and the rest of the nfl learned of the investigation into vick s link to a dogfighting enterprise , a bit of bad timing that could shadow the falcons for a few years in houston , the texans were aching for something more from their quarterback david carr was the first draft pick of the new franchise , but he proved to be a distant team member , inclined to go home to his family rather than spend extra time bonding with his teammates and studying film for a young team desperate for leadership , carr was a bad fit schaub , who had gone through the adjustment pains of life in the nfl , was the right one as soon as he was acquired , he began calling his teammates he moved into a place five minutes from reliant stadium , and he routinely beats everyone else to work schaub said he had immersed himself so fully in the texans that he had spent no time contemplating what might have been in atlanta he solved a lot of problems for us , smith said schaub is softspoken and modest , but he carries himself with a bit of swagger that has not gone unnoticed by his teammates his command of the west coast offense the texans run the same system he has played since college means the ball is delivered even into tight spots at exactly the right time , allowing his teammates , like johnson , to relax they always say he has n't started that many games , johnson said when you see him , you 'd think he has played in a lot more games and it all goes back to one game schaub played but did not finish schaub understood why al pulled him , said running back wali lundy , a teammate of schaub s at virginia and at houston he told al if he ever got another chance , he was never coming out from then on , his confidence skyrocketed he was a totally different quarterback it made him the player he is today
a fan seated behind the ' dugout held up a bright orange sign with black lettering during the top of the sixth inning yesterday that read , we believe but the faith of mets fans may soon be tested the mets dropped their fourth consecutive game last night , a 63 defeat in 10 innings against the at shea stadium it is their longest losing streak of the season we did n't play well this series , catcher paul lo duca said they played well , and that s all that mattered we had chances the mets were swept in a series for the first time this season after they lost a 32 lead in the ninth inning when billy wagner allowed a basesempty home run to pat burrell the phillies scored three runs in the 10th inning the mets' bullpen has been an asset throughout the season but it struggled in this threegame series scott schoeneweis allowed a runscoring double to chase utley in the 10th inning , and aaron rowand and burrell gave the phillies some insurance with runscoring hits against joe smith , who replaced schoeneweis for the fifth time in their past six games , the mets failed to score more than three runs they are now 1716 at shea the offense needs to do a better job scoring , david wright said but what might be most troubling for mets fans was the array of injuries that could threaten the mets' lead atop the national league east , which stood at three and a half games over the atlanta braves endy ch vez , who was injured while running to first base in the seventh inning of wednesday s 42 loss to the phillies , was placed on the 15day disabled list after a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed a strained left hamstring he was expected to miss at least four weeks ch vez , the mets' top backup outfielder , had been playing every day since the mets lost left fielder moises alou to a strained left quadriceps on may 12 right fielder shawn green has been sidelined with a broken right foot since may 26 when carlos beltr n bruised his right knee last week , the mets played with an outfield of backups manager willie randolph said that his players might be pressing at the plate to compensate for the injuries overanxiousness just has to do with sometimes trying too hard , randolph said but we have too good of a lineup to try and take that approach we do that sometimes jos valent n , who had been out since april 29 with a partially torn ligament in his right knee , was activated yesterday and started he will play with a brace for the rest of the season , and he said that he would need surgery if he were to play next year valent n went 1 for 4 last night , with a single in the fifth inning the mets trailed , 20 , at that point , after jimmy rollins s runscoring single in the third inning and ryan howard s runscoring single in the sixth both of those runs came against starter john maine , who allowed six hits , struck out two and walked none over seven innings the mets took the lead when carlos delgado , wright and lo duca hit successive home runs with two out in the sixth against cole hamels , the phillies' starter wright s shot , which appeared to hit off a yellow sign just above the fence in leftcenter field , was not initially ruled a home run , and wright stopped at third base after randolph requested that the play be overturned , the umpires had a conference and ruled it a home run phillies manager charlie manuel then made his own protest and was ejected after arguing with the firstbase umpire , jerry lane it was the first time the mets had three consecutive home runs since april 17 , 1989 , also against the phillies those home runs were hit by darryl strawberry , kevin mcreynolds and keith hernandez last night the fans cheered as each player crossed home plate but if the mets continue to endure injuries , there will be little to cheer the mets have recently used damion easley , david newhan , ben johnson and carlos g mez in the outfield johnson started in left and g mez in right last night , and easley was used as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning after a magnetic resonance imaging test on his sore right knee was negative lastings milledge would have been an option in the outfield but he , too , is injured milledge

there was no conflict of interest in gov jon s corzine s conduct during labor negotiations with a union led by a woman with whom he once had a romantic and financial relationship , an ethics panel reported on tuesday mr corzine , a democrat , appointed the ethics advisory panel last month to review his actions in the talks after questions were raised about his relationship , before he became governor , with carla katz , the president of local 1034 of the communications workers of america a complaint alleging conflict of interest on the governor s part was filed by steven m lonegan , the mayor of bogota , in bergen county , and a republican the inquiry s focus was the nature and status of mr corzine s relationship and contacts with ms katz during the talks between the administration and seven union locals , which led to an agreement in february on a new fouryear contract ms katz leads one of two locals that opposed the contract , which workers approved last month the panel found that the two had conversations in which she expressed concerns about the pace and seriousness of the talks but those ceased in early february , when the talks were entering a crucial stage and when mr corzine refused to communicate with her the way he had until then , the report said there was no conflict on interest in the governor s handling of the cwa labor negotiations , according to the 37page report the panel , nonetheless , faulted the governor at several points for not specifically and officially closing down all contact with ms katz before the talks began last fall it recommended that this be done in the future to strike a balance between the governor s nondelegable duty to govern and his right , even as a public figure , to a private life a spokesman for the governor did not return calls on tuesday seeking comment on the panel s findings but mr lonegan said we have a very simple ethics standard in new jersey , and that is that we have none if you do n't get indicted , you are ok in a statement , ms katz said she was pleased that the panel s finding confirms what i have always maintained that all bargaining took place at the table
las vegas , aug 26 it was a hot night here on the strip last saturday amid the cabarets , gambling and just plain debauchery , more than 11 , 000 people , including senator of nevada , the majority leader , decided to take in the fights not boxing , but the mixed martial arts league called the ultimate fighting championship that in just a few years has emerged from almost complete disrepute to become perhaps the fastestgrowing spectator sport in america even as boxing seems to implode in slow motion , millions across the country are becoming fans of the ufc s jigsawlike submission holds and lightning kicks and its athletic , even sometimes balletic , practitioners the league s popularity has made it the top payperview television attraction in the country , and its basiccable offerings have become a major draw , especially among young men i 've been a friend of the boxing industry for 35 years i 've been to hundreds of boxing matches and this is better than i thought it would be , senator reid said beside the trademarked octagon arena \( do n't call it a ring \) after watching the lightweight joe \( daddy \) stevenson win a decision over kurt \( batman \) pellegrino with dazzling combinations of punches and holds the senator said that it was his first time attending the league and that the scene at the mandalay bay took him back to his youth except for all the referees , doctors and safety regulators this is a fair street fight , he said when i was a kid , we had street fights , but this reminds me of a street fight that s fair since 2000 , 29 states , including california , new jersey and texas , have come to agree , by sanctioning mixed martial arts under the same general drug testing and oversight rules applied to boxing at least two other states are currently considering legislation to sanction such fights new york is not among them of course , most people do n't really know how it feels to be kicked in the face they do n't know the sharp pain of a knee to the gut or an elbow across the chin most have never experienced the primal fear of suffocation a person suffers when his neck has been entwined by the thighs and ankles of a jujitsu master , constricting like an anaconda those techniques , and hundreds of others , are all fair game in the ultimate fighting championship but while mixed martial arts bouts were once known by terms like anything goes and even as human cockfights , the ufc has won over both queasy regulators and fans with a long list of rules there are the more conventional rules , like no biting , no headbutting , no hair pulling , no eye gouging and no attacks to the groin or throat then there are the more exotic restrictions , like no fish hooking \( putting fingers in an opponent s mouth and ripping at the cheek from inside \) and no smalljoint manipulation \( yanking , bending or breaking an opponent s finger or toe \) flying to las vegas from the east coast a few days before the fights on the ufc s brown gulfstream iv , dana white , the league s muscular , articulate 38yearold president , was reclining in his customary black tshirt , explaining an earlier fight on dvd , when he said there had never been a death or serious injury in his league do you know why people die in boxing all the time \? he said neurological damage in boxing my goal is to hit you in the head and knock you out , or hit you in the head more times than you hit me in the head that s basically all there is and with the boxing glove they have actually created a weapon for repeated brain trauma he leaned over the aisle and make a quick , athletic flick of the shoulders you know what would happen if i punched you in the face right now \? he said yes , it would hurt you , but since i'm not wearing a glove , i would probably break my hand but in our sport there are 500 different ways i can win without hitting you in the head boxing basically requires it ultimate fighting championship participants use light , fingerless gloves that are meant to protect the hand but not enlarge the striking area or increase the weight of a punch another key difference relating to safety seems to be the culture of the two sports a boxer who gives up before the referee stops the fight \( as roberto duran is famously reported to have done , against sugar ray leonard , in the 1980 no mas fight \) is considered psychologically weak , if not a wimp in the ufc a fighter who submits , or taps out , generally seems to get credit among his peers for recognizing an impossible situation \( there are no female fighters in the ufc , though there are scantily clad octagon girls \) in his bombastic style , mr white is fond of pointing out that all participants in statesanctioned bouts are tested for steroids before every event , unlike members of most major sports leagues fighters who test positive \( and some have \) are generally banned for a year look at football , he said at a prefight news conference if all those guys got tested before every game , like our fighters do before every fight , guess what \? there would be no football , none maybe you 'd have the quarterback and the kicker out there it all adds up to one of the fastestgrowing sports and media properties in the world in 2001 the casino magnates and brothers lorenzo fertitta and frank j fertitta iii bought the ufc for 2 million and installed mr white , a former trainer , as president as a private entity , zuffa , the league s parent company , based here , does not announce financial results , but according to trade publications the league generated about 220 million in payperview revenue alone last year that compares with about 200 million for world wrestling entertainment , the scripted professional wrestling company , and roughly 175 million for hbo s industryleading boxing operation the average ufc payperview event now draws roughly 500 , 000 households , up from fewer than 100 , 000 just a few years ago the league has been in negotiations with hbo for at least six months about having that channel carry some fights , though no deal has been reached of course , payperview results do not include merchandise sales , gate receipts or revenue from the company s basiccable programs , which include the ultimate fighter reality series on spike tv now one of the perennial leaders in cable ratings among young men as well as live and taped fights also on spike in september alone we will have 56 hours of ufc programming , kevin kay , spike s general manager , said over the last few years we have seen the ufc become absolutely huge among men 18 to 34 , which is our core audience i really think they were thirsting for the new boxing boxing is like your grandfather s sport , and there s this sort of fascination with mixed martial arts now ultimately it s a combat sport , and guys love to watch guys hit guys in fact , the ufc still seems to be in its infancy in appealing to a broad variety of fans there were very few young children and very few people over 45 among the thousands of fans packing the concourse of the mandalay bay events center to see the weighins and get autographs the day before the fight the crowd was overwhelmingly , though by no means entirely , white many of the fans and fighters seemed to share the same west coast aesthetic a lot of black clothing , a lot of hard rock music and a panoply of tattoos surprisingly , perhaps , women appeared to be at least a third of the crowd amy moore , a 37yearold veterinary technician from cincinnati , was in line for autographs with her 14yearold daughter ms moore said she had become a ufc fan over the last five or six years and that she was part of a 20member crew of friends back home who made sure to watch every big fight together but she had a big problem her brother , also a ufc fan , was scheduled to get married at another las vegas hotel the next day , just as the main card was scheduled to start oh , let me tell you , both me and my brother tried to move the wedding to another day , maybe next week , she said but my brother s fianc e , the bride to be , just was n't having it but she did make a concession and say we can bring a tv into the reception to watch that 'll have to do until the next one she did not say whether she meant the next fight or the next wedding
gerald ford spoke the truth when he called watergate but even a nightmare can have its interludes of ribsplitting farce none were zanier than the antics of baruch korff , a smalltown new england rabbi who became a fulltime richard nixon sycophant as the walls closed in korff was ubiquitous in the press and on television , where he would lambaste democrats and the media lynch mob for vilifying the greatest president of the century despite nixon s reflexive antisemitism , he returned the favor by granting the rabbi audiences and an interview that allowed the embattled president to soliloquize about how his own faith and serenity reinforced his conviction deep inside that everything he did was right clearly we 've reached our own korffian moment in our latest long national nightmare the nixon interviewed by the rabbi sounded uncannily like the resolute leader chronicled by the conservative columnists and talkshow jocks president bush has lately welcomed into his bunker for his part , william kristol even published a korffian manifesto , in the washington post it reassured us that the bush presidency would probably be a successful one and that we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome in iraq a bush flack let it be known that the that he recommended it to his white house staff are you laughing yet \? maybe not no one died in watergate this time around , the white house lying and coverups have been not just in the service of political thuggery but to gin up a gratuitous war without end there is another significant difference as well washington never drank the nixon koolaid it kept a skeptical bipartisan eye on tricky dick throughout his political career , long before the watergate complex had even been built the charmed mr bush , by contrast , got a free pass both democrats and republicans in congress and both liberals and conservatives in the news media were credulous enablers of the iraq fiasco now a reckoning awaits , and the denouement is getting ugly the ranks of unreconstructed iraq hawks are thinner than they used to be some politicians in both parties \( \) and truculent pundits \( \) who cheered on the war recanted \( sooner in some cases than others \) , learned from their errors and moved on one particularly eloquent mea culpa can be found in today s new york times magazine , where the former war supporter that those who truly showed good judgment on iraq might have had no more information than those who got it wrong , but did not make the mistake of confusing wishes for reality but those who remain dug in are having none of that some of them are busily lashing out korffstyle some are melting down some are rewriting history most seem more interested in saving their own reputations than the american troops they ritualistically invoke to bludgeon the wars' critics and to parade their own selfcongratulatory patriotism it was a rewriting of history that made the blogosphere \( and others \) go berserk last week over an by michael o'hanlon and kenneth pollack the two brookings institution scholars , after a pointed selectively to successes on the ground in iraq in arguing that the surge should be continued at least into 2008 the hole in their argument was gaping as the next chairman of the joint chiefs , said honorably and bluntly in his congressional confirmation hearings , no amount of troops in no amount of time will make much of a difference in iraq if there s no functioning iraqi government opting for wishes over reality , mr o'hanlon and mr pollack buried their pro forma acknowledgment of that huge hurdle near the end of their piece but even more galling was the authors' effort to elevate their credibility by describing themselves as analysts who have harshly criticized the bush administration s miserable handling of iraq that s disingenuous for all their lateinthegame criticisms of the administration s incompetence , mr pollack proselytized vociferously for the war before it started , including in and both men have helped prolong the quagmire with mistakenly optimistic sightings of progress since the days of mission accomplished you can find a compendium of their past wisdom in that thinktank pundits with this track record would try to pass themselves off as harsh war critics in 2007 shows how desperate they are to preserve their status as beltway experts now that the political winds have shifted such blatant careerism would be less offensive if they did n't do so on the backs of the additional american troops they ask to be sacrificed to the doomed mission of providing security for an iraqi government that is both on vacation and on the verge of collapse at least the more rabid and korfflike of the war s last defenders have the intellectual honesty not to deny what they 've been saying all along but their invective has gone over the top , with even mild recent critics of the war like john warner and richard lugar being it s also the tic of mr kristol s magazine , the weekly standard \( and its murdoch sibling the new york post \) , to claim that the war s critics hate the troops when the new republic ran a lessthanjingoistic essay by a the only to have its bluff called when the author s identity was revealed and his controversial anecdotes were a similar overthetop tirade erupted on last month , when another war defender in meltdown , senator lindsey graham , repeatedly cut off his fellow guest by saying that soldiers he met on official congressional visits to iraq endorsed his own enthusiasm for the surge unfortunately for mr graham , his sparring partner was jim webb , the takenoprisoners virginia democrat who is a vietnam veteran and the father of a soldier serving in the war senator webb reduced mr graham to a stammering heap of jello when he chastised him for trying to put his political views into the mouths of soldiers the last new york timescbs news poll on the subject found that most members of the military and their immediate families have turned against the war , like other americans as is becoming clearer than ever in this korffian endgame , hiding behind the troops is the last refuge of this war s sponsors this too is a rewrite of history it has been the war s champions who have more often dishonored the troops than the war s opponents mr bush created the template by doing everything possible to keep the sacrifice of american armed forces in iraq offcamera , forbidding photos of coffins and skipping military funerals that set the stage for the ensuing demonization of ted koppel , whose by reading a list of their names in the spotlight of nightline was branded unpatriotic by the right s vigilantes the same playbook was followed by the war s champions when during a townhall meeting in kuwait in december 2004 rather than campaign for the armor the troops so desperately needed , the right attacked the questioner for what rush limbaugh called his near insubordination when the washington post some two years later the weekly standard and the equally hawkish took three weeks to notice , with all of two sentences protecting the white house from scandal , not the troops from squalor , was the higher priority one person who has had enough of this hypocrisy is the a boston university professor of international relations who is also a vietnam veteran , a product of the united states military academy and a former teacher at west point after his 27yearold son was killed in may while serving in iraq , he said that who talk about how priceless the troops' lives are i know what value the us government assigns to a soldier s life , professor bacevich wrote in the washington post i 've been handed the check the amount , he said , was roughly what the yankees will pay roger clemens per inning anyone who questions this bleak perspective need only have watched last week s sad and ultimately pointless congressional hearings into the we still do n't know who rewrote the witness statements of tillman s cohort so that pentagon propagandists could trumpet a fictionalized battle death to the public and his family but it was nonetheless illuminating to watch mr rumsfeld and his top brass sit there under oath and repeatedly go mentally awol about crucial events in the case their convenient mass amnesia about their army s most famous and liedabout casualty is as good a definition as any of just what supporting the troops means to those who even now beat the drums for this war
salt lake city , april 16 eight men were killed monday after a sport utility vehicle carrying a driver and at least 14 other illegal immigrants rolled over on a remote desert highway in southeastern , the authorities said this has all the earmarks of an organized smuggling operation , said virginia kice , a spokeswoman for the federal immigration and customs enforcement agency for smugglers , these are n't human beings they 're human cargo the driver of the vehicle , an eightpassenger chevrolet suburban , apparently swerved about 3 30 am and lost control , said trooper preston raban , a utah highway patrol spokesman in salt lake city the truck rolled several times on a straight and flat stretch of utah state route 191 , about 11 miles north of the arizona border near bluff , utah , trooper raban said all the passengers were ejected from the vehicle ms kice said the occupants , who were all men , were illegal immigrants from mexico and guatemala lt todd peterson of the patrol s southeastern utah division arrived at the scene shortly after the accident there was n't a mirror or piece of glass left in the vehicle , lieutenant peterson said the driver , the only occupant wearing a seat belt , ran away , the authorities said san juan county sheriff s deputies followed his footprints through the desert for nearly eight miles and found him hiding in the brush , lieutenant peterson said the driver was identified as rigoberto salisl pez , 30 , of guatemala mr salisl pez was taken into custody by authorities six of the passengers died at the scene , lieutenant peterson said , and two more died later at hospitals in arizona and colorado one passenger remained hospitalized in critical condition trooper raban said identifying the dead and notifying relatives in latin america had been complicated because none of the passengers had identification , nor did they appear to be related or even to know one another mexican consular officials have been assisting , he said excessive speed did not appear to have contributed to the crash , lieutenant peterson said investigators suspect that the driver may have fallen asleep or turned sharply to avoid a coyote or a large farm animal the driver could be charged with fleeing the scene of a crime under utah laws , but any criminal case would be handled through the federal courts by immigration officials new federal sentencing guidelines allow for very , very severe penalties in smuggling cases that result in death , ms kice said the agency and local law enforcement officials in utah and elsewhere have seen an increase in smuggling cases , often involving similarly overloaded vehicles that have compromised handling and safety , ms kice said more smugglers are also traveling at night to avoid detection , adding to risk of drivers' falling asleep , she said the suburban , which had not been reported as stolen , was legally registered to a man in mesa , ariz , trooper raban said ms kice said the agency hoped to take the case farther up into the organization of the smuggling operation in the nation s worst human smuggling disaster , 19 passengers were found dead of suffocation , heat and thirst in a sealed tractor trailer on may 14 , 2003 , in victoria , tex
here is another sign that is no longer the tempestuous owner he once was marty miller and dana cavalea have yet to be booted out the door at yankee stadium and dispatched to an unemployment line in the bronx miller and cavalea are in charge of the strength and conditioning program for the highly paid players on the job for less than a month of the regular season , the two men have watched the yankees accumulate more injuries than some teams do in , say , half a season miller and cavalea remain on the job if for no other reason than appointed them he is the general manager who has been handed greater control over the yankees' operation than any of the multitude of his predecessors in the steinbrenner regime cashman wanted it that way , and he understood the perils of being in such a position of authority the question is whether steinbrenner can still summon enough anger to jettison cashman if he feels his trust is misguided and misplaced had a general manager in the first 30 years or so of steinbrenner s reign made the move that cashman did , and had similar results , he might already be gone , along with the offending new strength coaches  it is possible , of course , that steinbrenner does not know the full extent of the earlyseason injuries , that threefifths of his starting pitching rotation \( foursixths if you count the first replacement \) are on the disabled list and the season is only two weeks old twothirds of the outfield has also been afflicted , with johnny damon missing a few games with a strained calf muscle and hideki matsui taking an early turn on the dl with a strained hamstring now , none of these injuries which also include chienming wang s bad hamstring , mike mussina s bad hamstring , carl pavano s forearm stiffness and jeff karstens s elbow stiffness may be the result of the team s new strength and conditioning program but years ago , that never stopped the old steinbrenner from acting like the old steinbrenner in 1984 , for example , dave righetti , the yankees' lefthanded closer , cut his left index finger on the bullpen water cooler and went on the disabled list for 15 days the day after the mishap , jerry mcnertney , the bullpen coach , was banished to the minor leagues the yankees have new strength and conditioning coaches because cashman fired jeff mangold , who had held the job since 1998 this act has become tiresome for the 52yearold mangold he had previously held the job for five seasons , from 1984 through 1988 , was let go because the yankees felt they had endured too many injuries , then was brought back now he s gone again mangold learned shortly after last season that he would n't be back this season , but he has not talked about the reason and declined to do so yesterday they just felt it was time for a change , mangold said in a telephone interview from his home in oakland , nj i just was n't rehired i do n't want to get into it it does n't make sense for me to it was their decision to make , and i have to move on from there cashman did n't want to talk about the change , either i made the decision , he said , but i do n't want to speak to the reason in fairness to everyone involved , the people who are here and those who are n't cashman did n't say it , but he and his aides apparently felt that the yankees had encountered a lot of injuries in recent seasons and they did n't feel that mangold had been as focused on his job as much as he should have been as for miller , a 34yearold native of niagara falls , ny , he was not allowed to address his new job yesterday because , the yankees said , cashman does n't permit him to speak to reporters miller does have a title , director of performance enhancement , that is appropriate for his newwave type of conditioning , but not all of the players have adapted to his approach some players , in fact , have their own trainers and follow the methods those trainers employ considering the salaries that players are paid these days , the teams would seem to have reason to expect that their conditioning regimen would be adhered to by the players but that s a matter for the clubs and the union to debate mangold would n't talk about miller and his methods when the conversation turned to the recent rash of injuries , mangold said , i do n't want to express my thoughts publicly on what has happened given the spate of injuries , especially to the four starting pitchers , mangold could have said a lot but did n't but here s what he could have noted the major leagues , according to records compiled by the commissioner s office , have 20 starting pitchers on the disabled list the yankees represent 20 percent of that number no other team has more than two starting pitchers disabled  but mangold did n't say any of that those are my words and my research cashman said yesterday that injuries were up this year and that on opening day , the disabled list had a population 30 percent greater than a year ago and 30 percent greater than the average number over the past four years but only the yankees have four starting pitchers on the disabled list
cleveland , oct 17 leave it to to utter the words that will antagonize a legion of restless and demanding fans ram rez , who rarely speaks to reporters , has probably made the red sox and their fans wish he had muzzled himself wednesday , too the lead the american league championship series three games to one , meaning the red sox need three straight victories to avoid elimination as ram rez discussed boston s potential mortality , he did so in a casual way we 're not going to give up , he said we 're just going to go , play the game and move on if it does n't happen , so who cares \? it s always next year it s not like the end of the world in boston , they care they care deeply in boston , having the red sox end what is supposed to be a special season in disappointing fashion would feel like the end of the world to some fans memo to ram rez this is a pretty big deal back home ram rez has never been considered the voice or conscience of the red sox , so his remarks will evaporate before josh beckett is scheduled to oppose c c sabathia in game 5 on thursday night still , with the fading red sox trying to extend the series by making almost as incredible a comeback as they made in the 2004 alcs , ram rez s softly spoken words sounded a little louder why should we panic \? he said we got a great team if it does n't happen , good we come next year and try to do it again of course , other red sox players had different thoughts dustin pedroia , a rookie second baseman , spoke in the language that fans crave we all believe , pedroia said we still think we can win this thing naturally , the red sox embraced the notion of repeating what some of them did by rallying from a 30 deficit to stun the yankees three years ago but only 7 of the 25 players were on that 2004 alcs roster doug mirabelli , a backup catcher , said that it would be a lie to describe the 2004 red sox as confident before game 4 against the yankees , but that they were focused catcher jason varitek said that he recalled something notable that happened in the clubhouse before boston began its comeback , but smiled and coyly declined to elaborate experience always helps in any situation , varitek said because , with experience and having done something , you have belief ram rez , david ortiz , curt schilling , tim wakefield and mike timlin were the other members of the 2004 team kevin youkilis was not on the 2004 alcs roster but was on the roster in the other two rounds ram rez drew no inspiration from 2004 we 're not thinking that much about '04 , he said anything is possible that s it we 're going to think about thursday in beckett , the red sox have the perfect pitcher to try to make sure they maintain a pulse beckett is 20 with a 120 earned run average in the playoffs and is 42 with a 187 era for his career in the postseason he won game 5 of the 2003 national league championship series to help the florida marlins rally from a 31 deficit , so he has thrived in this delicate situation manager terry francona refused to discuss speculation that beckett had back stiffness after winning the opener , saying that beckett s start took its toll francona started wakefield over beckett , who would have worked on three days' rest , in game 4 , a decision that could be dissected all winter now it is up to beckett to try to extend the season i do n't think there s anyone in the league we 'd prefer on the mound for our team and in this situation , third baseman mike lowell said even if beckett is effective , the red sox need production from players other than youkilis , ortiz and ram rez the 234 hitters are 17 for 41 \( 415 \) with 4 homers and 9 runs batted in the remaining players are 20 for 104 \( 192 \) with 2 homers and 12 rbi francona said he contemplated possible lineup changes , but he made none just like in game 1 , bobby kielty will start in right field over j d drew against the lefthanded sabathia that lineup is so potent , paul byrd , who defeated boston in game 4 , said they have such great pitching over there we could very easily turn around and lose three if we 're not careful ram rez has been in boston for seven years , so he knows how rabid the fans are and how high their expectations are still , he sat by his locker , with music pumping out of an unused digital music player , and calmly discussed boston s possible passing ram rez s offseason will be here if the red sox do not throttle cleveland in three straight games we go , play hard and if things do n't come like they 're supposed to come , we move on , ram rez said we play next year
my italian is so bad i have a hard time pronouncing gnocchi , but i grew up hearing enough of it to know when i'm being yelled at and that s definitely what was happening at a table in a small roadside restaurant in abruzzi i had driven through the italian mountains with an interpreter to find ateleta , the village where my grandmother floriana ranallo zappa grew up i had come in search of a recipe or more precisely , the evolution of a recipe for reasons i could n't put together until recently , i had been obsessed with tracking a path that began in my grandmother s village and ended with the pot of red sauce that simmers on my stove on sunday afternoons i ended up on the red sauce trail largely because i do n't have a hometown my parents were dutiful players in the great corporate migrations of the 1960s and '70s my dad worked for the uniroyal tire company his rise through the ranks of midlevel management required a series of moves , which were always euphemistically presented to the children as transfers the company sent us from wisconsin to california to michigan to texas and then back to michigan , where i finally got off the family train and went to college through all that moving , the one constant was my mother s spaghetti sauce as soon as we got the kitchen shelf paper laid and she figured out where the grocery store was , she made the sauce it meant this was home , and that first plate of spaghetti and meatballs made us all feel as if everything was going to be ok now , with several more states' worth of my own transfers behind me , the first thing i cook in a new kitchen is a big pot of sauce when my siblings and i visit each other , spaghetti is on the menu i wanted to know where the recipe came from and in a way , where i came from so i became a culinary detective but back in the italian village where it all supposedly began , things were n't going so great i was sitting with the closest relative i could find , filomena sciullo ranallo , my grandmother s sisterinlaw we were at a table at la bottega dell'arte salata , the small rosticceria my distant cousins run they were thrilled each time one of the american relatives came to visit , explaining with great pride how madonna had tried to find her relatives at a nearby village a few years ago and failed but not you , they told me you are luckier than madonna i was trying to write down recipes when the old woman grabbed my arm , shaking it hard why did n't i speak any italian \? and even worse , why did i think oregano had any place in tomato sauce \? well , because my mother put oregano in her sauce but oregano , like the meatballs i add to the pot , was only one of the twists and turns the recipe had taken during nearly a century in america in fact , it turns out that there is no single iconic red sauce in my grandmother s village there are sauces with lamb , an animal the village organizes an entire festival around there are sauces with only tomato and basil , sauces just for the lasagna and sauces just for grilled meats small meatballs might go in a broth , but never in sauce for pasta in fact , only two things in the village reminded me of anything i grew up with the fat pork sausages were cooked and served the same way , and my italian cousins looked just like my brothers to understand why i made my sauce the way i did , i needed to start closer to home , with my mother she has been making spaghetti sauce for almost 60 years , from a recipe she learned from her mother , who had been making it with american ingredients since the early 1900s my grandmother had been shipped to america , literally and largely against her will , to marry an italian named john zappa he ran a dairy farm in a little town called cumberland in northwest wisconsin she was still a teenager , illiterate even in italian to the day she died , grandma zap spoke only enough english to communicate the most basic things to her bored american grandchildren , of which i was one in between , she raised 11 children my mother , anne marie , was the secondyoungest among my four siblings , how mom makes her sauce has been a constant source of discussion we 're all decent cooks , but none of us can get it just right when does she put in the paste \? is a little bit of roasted pepper essential \? do you need to use oregano in the meatballs \? this is a problem my cousins have , too sharon herman still lives in cumberland , not far from the zappa family dairy farm her mother \( my aunt and godmother , the late philomena degidio \) was one of the oldest of the zappa girls and was considered the best sauce maker my cousin has lived for years under the cloud of never having mastered the master s sauce i could never figure it out , cousin sharon told me i even took her little hand once and made her measure out all the spices like she did and put them in measuring spoons to try to get the exact amounts it still did n't taste right the master s secret , perhaps , was that she ran a can of carrots , a couple of celery stalks and the onion and garlic through a blender and then put the mixture in the sauce my mother does n't do this the master also put in the tomato paste at the end my mother prefers to brown the meatballs and ribs first and then deglaze the pan with the paste
torrance , calif earlier this year , the maplewood memorial library in new jersey became the center of controversy over what is a growing problem throughout the region and across the country faced with unruly middle school students who were flocking to the library after school , library officials announced plans to close on weekdays from 2 45 to 5 pm the resulting uproar was so intense that the town s mayor stepped in to keep the doors open and in addition to the town s providing security guards at the library s two buildings , community groups decided to extend the hours of afterschool programs and expand their offerings this was good news all around after all , librarians people coming into their libraries but that librarians were even considering such drastic action highlights what a serious issue this has become and it s not just maplewood nearby irvington struggled with similar problems several years ago as have libraries in connecticut and westchester and on long island i have worked in a library for more than 10 years it is across the street from a junior high school and a few blocks away from an elementary school at 2 pm , the library is a place of intellectual curiosity , civilized calm and innate civility the regular patrons are uniformly aware of the witching hour they know that they have to be checked out and in their cars with the windows rolled up by 3 15 pm tops ! the teenagers and preteenagers are like a storm surge they 've been sitting all day they 've been good and relatively quiet but now school s out by 3 25 pm , the library is packed , every seat is taken , the noise level ramps up and even the homeless lose their nerve and bolt for the door there are , at most , four fulltime library employees braced for this assault they have gone to graduate school and know how to recommend a good adventure novel and how to put together a bibliography , but none have been trained for anything like this facing us may be 100 to 125 middle school students some will open a book others will take out pencil and paper and start doing their homework but we 're not homework monitors , and so many of them do n't bother they are there because that s where their parents told them to be until they get picked up usually around 6 pm , sometimes as late as 7 30 , and in a few odious situations , well past 8 pm , when we are officially closed three to four hours a day in the library for a teenager is punishment , pure and simple we are paid to be there they are not even the ones who bear down and do their homework are bored with the whole affair in an hour or two their options are limited so they go wild the four library employees do n't have a chance it s like trying to take four conscientious adults and put them in charge of crowd control for the french revolution while one employee is calming down a small group of radicals by the science project books , another group is erecting a guillotine in the juvenile biographies what s the solution \? we have had some success with asking the wilder youngsters to leave and not allowing them back until they are accompanied by a parent or guardian it may not be fair , but it gives us a chance to meet the folks and make a pitch for solidarity usually they understand we 've been known to call the police in certain circumstances , but we 'd better have a really good reason renting a security guard or hiring more librarians is neither in the cards nor the current budget still there are some creative solutions a library in norwalk , conn , offers training to staff members in dealing with adolescents the library has created a teenage advisory board and blocks computer access of anyone caught misbehaving in an attempt to deal with rowdy teenagers , the new rochelle public library recently got a grant to install more computers indeed , several libraries in westchester and nassau counties are using computer technology in educational and recreational ways to work with teenagers during afterschool hours in our library , we 've gotten good mileage out of cheap plastic chess sets it s a war game of sorts , and they 're mesmerized but dealing with disruptive teenagers is not something that can be fixed simply with a parade of innovative ideas in many parts of the country , there s a baby boom going on and those babies are going to grow up fast with more and more parents choosing or having to work outside the home , public libraries need to stand up and admit they have problems city officials should see to it that those libraries with a significant number of teenage users have at least one librarian who is trained to provide programs for adolescents depending on the number of teenagers pouring into the library , they might also consider dedicating specific space in the library just for them and if a library finds that a security guard is necessary , it would be sweet synchronicity between the libraries and the schools to set up a program where teachers and principals chaperone for a few hours each week in many ways , the maplewood memorial library forced the issue to the forefront , and the community is responding in all the right ways i hope they succeed libraries around the region and across the country will be watching and taking notes
singapore , april 8 as it struggles to pull itself together as a functioning democracy , the tiny , young nation of is scheduled to hold a presidential election on monday amid continuing violence , poverty and selfdoubt the election , for a largely ceremonial post , has exposed bitter personal rivalries as well as divisions among clans and regions poverty and unemployment have led to the spread of gangs and contributed to an atmosphere of instability and lawlessness tensions remain between an older , portuguesespeaking elite and a younger generation educated during 24 years of indonesian rule the failure of independence to bring prosperity has added to a sense of futility and anger this election is very important in the context of the crisis , that we are not a failed state , said the departing president , xanana gusm o , the charismatic independence leader who is expected to be a candidate for prime minister when parliamentary elections are held later this year east timor won independence from indonesia through a referendum in 1999 , and graduated from united nations control to become an independent nation in 2002 yet it has remained one of the poorest countries in asia , with a political system marked more by turmoil than governance more than 522 , 000 people are eligible to vote monday , although a runoff is likely if , as expected , none of the eight candidates wins the required majority along with the parliamentary election , the contests could keep east timor in a state of instability for months to come the most prominent of the candidates is a nobel peace prize laureate , jos ramoshorta , 57 , a member of the portuguesespeaking diaspora who led an overseas campaign for his country s independence and became its first foreign minister he became prime minister last year after a military mutiny and surge of violence that led more than 100 , 000 people to flee their homes and forced the incumbent , mari alkatiri , to resign although public resentment has built against the presence of international peacekeepers , mr ramoshorta has said he would ask them to stay on to ensure that women , children , the elderly and students can walk free on the streets without fears of being attacked among his strongest rivals is francisco guterres , a former guerrilla commander who is a member of mr alkatiri s revolutionary fretilin party and who has served as parliamentary speaker another leading opponent is fernando de araujo , 44 , the youngest of the candidates , who spent six years in an indonesian prison along with mr gusm o for leading a proindependence resistance group for some people , it seems , the country s problems may be beyond the grasp of any new leader we do n't have a culture of peace , we have a culture of war , said carlos filipe ximenes belo , the former roman catholic bishop of dili , who shared the nobel peace prize with mr ramoshorta since the 18th century we have been fighting each other fighting seems to be the only situation in which we are content it is in our blood violence has accompanied the election campaign , as supporters of rival candidates have clashed and signs of earlier unrest are not difficult to find a 3 , 000member international peacekeeping force , deployed a year ago when a military mutiny brought down the government and threatened to escalate into civil war , remains in place the soldiers are still searching for a renegade officer who led the mutiny about 37 , 000 displaced people remain in refugee shelters indonesia invaded east timor in 1975 after portugal abruptly ended more than 400 years of colonial dominance about 200 , 000 people died during the separatist insurgency and brutal indonesian rule that followed after the overwhelming vote for independence in 1999 , the indonesian military unleashed a revenge campaign of arson , killings and mass deportation carried out by local militias it had organized and armed about 1 , 000 people died , and 250 , 000 more were forced across the border into the indonesian territory of west timor independence meant the departure of the mostly indonesian skilled technicians , civil servants and subsidies from the central government the new nation of about 900 , 000 people remains , as mr gusm o said , on the verge of becoming a failed state , with an average per capita income of less than the equivalent of a dollar a day , and with close to half the workingage population unemployed malnutrition and food shortages are widespread in a nation with few natural resources apart from rice and coffee , and with little foreign investment in businesses and manufacturing a plague of locusts recently devoured about 11 , 120 acres of cropland west of the capital , dili east timor does have a nest egg of 12 billion in oil revenue locked in a special account in a bank in new york without a functioning bureaucracy capable of managing the oil revenues , and wary of the corruption that has ravaged other oilrich developing nations , the government has placed the money in a fund for future use but mr gusm o has backed mr ramoshorta in making the money an election issue , saying it could be used to relieve some of the country s pressing problems democracy will not work if the people are hungry , mr gusm o said we have so much money in an account in new york , while here in timor people are struggling and living in misery speaking to foreign reporters in dili last week , he said the government could not postpone measures to address social needs or even hunger we used to promise people jobs , the creation of jobs , he said , a promise he himself often made in the difficult early days to calm restive crowds but they do n't see light at the end of the tunnel
there has been a good deal of irrational exuberance in the virtual world of chat sites since tuesday that morning apple the beatles' company , not the computer maker announced that neil aspinall , its chief operating officer nearly from the start , has decided to move on , and that his chair would be filled by jeff jones , a vice president at sony bmg whose focus over the past dozen years has been catalog reissues to read some of the comments posted on the internet , you would think that mr aspinall has singlehandedly delayed everything from upgrades of the standard beatles catalog to the release of video projects like the restored and expanded versions of let it be and the 1965 shea stadium concert , which have languished on apple corps shelves since the 1990s but that s not how it is mr aspinall is answerable to apple s board , which is to say the beatles or their representatives \( who in turn are answerable to the beatles who appointed them \) , and he could not move forward on any of these projects without their approval he was the beatles' alter ego , often the bad cop to their good cop the beatles themselves could publicly say anything that everything anyone could want to hear would eventually be released or that they enjoyed collecting bootlegs themselves but the beatles have the last word on what will be released , and when and whether to pursue bootleggers or even authors who write about bootlegs mr aspinall and apple s lawyers simply do their bidding that s why the wording of the announcement was so odd saying that mr aspinall has decided to move on , with none of the usual platitudes about spending time with his family or pursuing other interests , makes it sound like something s up did he suddenly quit \? was he fired \? was there something to the illogical rumors that the beatles were dissatisfied with the february agreement between their apple and the computer company \? people close to apple say that mr aspinall is simply retiring he turns 65 in october and had heart problems in the 1990s perhaps , having spent 46 years at the beatles' beck and call , he wanted to reduce his stress for mr aspinall , his work with the beatles has been a handful literally at first he became the group s road manager in 1961 , which means that he has been part of the beatles entourage longer than 50 percent of the surviving beatles ringo starr did n't join the group until august 1962 \( mr aspinall came to the beatles through mr starr s predecessor , pete best , and remained with them after mr best was booted out \) when the beatles were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame , in 1988 , george harrison said that if anyone deserved to be known as the fifth beatle , it was mr aspinall having driven their van and hauled their equipment during the touring years , he became a sort of general factotum when the beatles stopped touring in 1966 when the beatles , holed up in the recording studio till the wee hours , needed anything from tea and sandwiches to arcane noisemakers , it was mr aspinall s job to round it up the beatles' decision to start apple corps led to all sorts of turmoil , which was exacerbated by their growing internal divisions not least among them , who should run the company when the smoke cleared , mr aspinall had been thrust behind a desk as chief executive officer and put in charge of a number of thankless tasks first there was a stack of lawsuits among the beatles themselves , and between the beatles and emi , that needed to be settled that took 20 years in the meantime mr aspinall began assembling film clips for a history of the beatles , originally to be called the long and winding road there was no possibility of doing much with this project until the lawsuits were settled , but when they were , in 1989 , mr aspinall revived the project and persuaded the surviving beatles \( and yoko ono , representing john lennon \) to sign on the result was the beatles anthology , which turned out to be a huge trove of previously unreleased audio and video material as well as a book the six discs of the cd anthology \( 199596 \) , taken together with the double cd beatles live at the bbc \( 1994 \) , just about doubled the size of the beatles official catalog mr aspinall s accomplishments notwithstanding , mr jones s appointment may be a good sign if there s one thing the beatles need , it s someone savvy about reissues and how to properly remaster , package and market them but another thing apple needs is someone who comes to the job without the baggage of 46 years of subservience to the beatles we can probably assume that someone like mr jones , who has been in the record business since the 1970s , did not just hear of apple and the beatles last wednesday and knew all about how demanding the beatles and their representatives can be if we can assume that he has negotiated a measure of independence and freedom to navigate , his tenure may be refreshing how many beatles collectors , after all , have looked at the sony legacy reissues of recordings by the byrds , janis joplin and miles davis and thought , if only the beatles archive were treated this way \?
sangin , the british army compound here in a drug lord s former villa , with its sandbagged windows and lookout posts and shrapnelscarred walls , is a reminder that until just a few weeks ago sangin was one of the most dangerous towns in afghanistan s most dangerous province , helmand since their arrival last spring in this lawless region of mountains and desert , british troops have lost 64 men in almost daily combat against a force second to none in size and ferocity in the country the insurgents still control half the province , the most serious threat to afghanistan s stability yet despite the presence of thousands of taliban fighters , and some tough fighting still ahead , british military commanders here say they believe they have turned a significant corner in recent months they have succeeded in pushing the taliban back and keeping them out of a few strategic areas at the same time , they say , popular support for the insurgents is eroding we see it now as a threat that can be countered , maj hamish bell , second in command of the british battalion deployed in northern helmand , said of the insurgency the progress in helmand is perhaps the most important anywhere in the country , military commanders say , given that the province has the largest concentration of insurgents and produces 42 percent of afghanistan s opium crop , which has helped fuel the insurgency if they can get helmand right , they say , it could pave the way to broader progress against the taliban but while helmand shows what is possible in afghanistan , commanders warn that a long , hard fight remains to win back territory from the taliban , region by region , village by village nearly six years into the war , a third of afghanistan s provinces are in the grip of insurgents , a level far worse than it was from 2002 to 2005 , the years immediately after the americanled invasion , when the taliban were toppled and forced to retreat across the border into pakistan provinces like helmand , remote from the capital and relatively calm , were only secured by a light american military presence , leaving them wide open when the taliban chose to return in the other southern provinces , kandahar and oruzgan , the taliban presence remains strong fighting the taliban is like pressing mercury or squeezing a balloon , commanders say as insurgents are suppressed in one area , they emerge in another and once pushed back in conventional fighting , the taliban switch tactics to suicide attacks , roadside bombs and kidnappings in one measure of the lingering dangers even here , in early july the 14yearold son of sangin s police chief was kidnapped on a road outside town and killed but military commanders say the progress in helmand is an indication that nato forces have found their stride since last year , when the taliban staged a spectacular resurgence , taking advantage of the transfer of southern provinces from american commanders to an expanding nato force as nato forces have become better established and more numerous in southern afghanistan , american forces have been able to deploy more troops in the east there , they are also reporting gains in some border areas all of this has helped nato forces take the offensive against the taliban , rather than fighting from their back foot , as they were forced to do last year , and gain local confidence i do n't think the taliban will come back , said abdul rahman , 45 , a paramedic , the only qualified person working in a small private clinic here they have been weakened also the people would not support the taliban anymore , he said what has made the difference here , the british say , is a shift in their tactics and a doubling of force numbers , to nearly 6 , 000 today , with more troops on the way when the british paratroopers arrived in helmand , president hamid karzai asked that they focus on preventing small district centers from falling to the taliban , so grave was the insurgent threat surrounded and cut off , the british came under attack up to seven times a day they used artillery fire to clear an area just for supply helicopters to land over the winter they deployed mobile marine units to push the taliban back from besieged district compounds and out of the town centers in spring and summer , they staged sweeping operations , with help from american , afghan and small danish and estonian units in may they pushed the taliban out of the sangin area with three companies in the valley , they have since thwarted attempts by the insurgents to reinfiltrate it s not over but indications are that the uplift in forces and the more offensive mindset has been successful , said maj dominic biddick , 32 , commander of company a of the royal anglian regiment , now based in sangin the british base , once virtually under siege , has not taken a single hit in a month , he said the british have now been able to focus on their original counterinsurgency plan , which was to create inkblots , or secure zones around the main towns , and gradually expand security outward in this way they are starting reconstruction projects in the provincial capital , lashkar gah , the town of gereshk on the main road , and now sangin strategically located , sangin , a rich agricultural town on the banks of the helmand river , commands access to the north , where most of the taliban are concentrated , and to the hydroelectric dam at kajaki , a major united states development project the taliban threat remains even in these secure zones but lt col stuart carver , who commands the battle group north , said , there are n't big groups of 50 taliban roaming around town and taking over big parts of the town the strong british and afghan security presence in sangin has for the first time encouraged local afghans to come forward with information on taliban movements this year , the taliban have lost ground and men , including some highlevel commanders , and are struggling to find recruits among the local population , colonel carver said nato officials categorize the taliban into two types of fighters tier one , as they are called , are hardened , ideologically driven men who have come back to fight from their rear base in pakistan tier two fighters are local men who may join the war for a variety of reasons economic , tribal or religious the biggest change from last year to this year is there has been no tier two mobilization , colonel carver said they have tried , he said of the taliban still , military officers said , the taliban never seem short of forces they have filled out their ranks with foreign fighters , mainly pakistanis , but also a handful of arabs and chechens , as well as afghans from other provinces , like neighboring oruzgan the military has found pakistani identity cards on dead fighters , as well as papers and cds with jihadi propaganda in chechen and arabic , one officer said a large group of men from pakistan s tribal area of waziristan were killed in one battle , colonel carver said but the weakening of the taliban is apparent even to local people , like hayatullah , 29 , a farmer who fled northern helmand last year and now lives near the main british camp , bastian , in central helmand the taliban are not stronger , he said , if they were strong , they would come down and fight the british here sangin , which was a ghost town three months ago , is struggling slowly back to life shops have reopened , while others lie in rubble , and the initial silent hostility toward the foreign troops is starting to thaw a few tribal elders have asked the military for help in clearing irrigation channels afghan , american and british military medics offered two days of free consultations in midjuly and were swamped by hundreds of people , including dozens of women and children that was a step toward acceptance , major biddick said he and other commanders hope that momentum will build i think the big battle was for local support , colonel carver said a proportion of the locals now think we are actually going to stay , and therefore they are prepared to throw their cards in with us before , they thought we were going to come in , kill a few taliban and then leave it has gone from people too scared to even look at you or wave in case someone was watching , now they will talk , he added it s a step forward that they will talk to you , and it s a real step forward that they talk to you as if you can solve their problems after a year and half of intense fighting , not all local people are persuaded , however we do n't expect good government , only bloodshed , said hajji mullah fida muhammad , an elderly man with a white beard he said he thought the taliban were still strong enough to win the town again others expected them to try again the taliban is out there , so we expect more fighting , said hajji mullah salim , 55 , a cloth merchant he had returned to open his shop , but his family was still camping out in the desert for safety , he said there is still talk of a taliban offensive , but nato commanders are keeping the pressure on the insurgents , and say the danger now is the shift in taliban tactics , toward roadside and suicide bombs the guerrilla tactics are threatening enough and can erode local support , as the local police chief , hajji ghulam wali , can attest it was his son who was pulled out of a taxi and kidnapped by insurgents on the road from sangin to the provincial capital the taliban commander , tor jan , taunted hajji wali on the telephone , telling him to quit his job to save his son when he refused , they bound his son s hands and feet with a chain and returned him dead , riddled with 20 bullets then , in midjuly , a bomb detonated in the pushcart of a boy as the police chief s car passed the town bazaar , killing four people , including the boy they committed a terrible crime , hajji wali said of his son s killing islam does not permit such cruelty still , he said , the town was safer the taliban , he insisted , have lost morale , they are weak now before we could not go to the bazaar , but now they are hiding and cannot go to the bazaar , he said he , like several afghan officials interviewed in the province , urged the british to press their advantage and finish the taliban while the insurgents are down wary of the ease with which the taliban can reinfiltrate areas , the british are moving with care british commanders said the job now was now to consolidate control of sangin and gereshk , rather than pursue taliban in their holdouts we could deploy and clear the rest but the danger is if we clear the taliban out we create a vacuum , major biddick , the british commander in sangin , said the afghan government also needs to catch up in deploying more army and police to fill the vacuum , he added this is setting the conditions 12 months in , and afghanistan will be measured in decades , not years , the major said we realize it is just the tip of the iceberg

i lewis libby jr , the former chief of staff to vice president dick cheney and one of the principal architects of president bush s foreign policy , was sentenced tuesday to 30 months in prison for lying during a cia leak investigation that became part of a fierce debate over the war in iraq the sentence ordered by judge reggie b walton of federal district court and his refusal so far to delay its enactment means that mr libby may have to report to prison in about two months that was expected to prompt mr libby s supporters to accelerate their calls for mr bush to grant him a pardon , although a white house spokeswoman offered a discouraging view of that possibility tuesday mr libby , who was once one of the most powerful men in government and was heavily involved in planning both iraq wars , stood calmly in the well of the court as judge walton said he appreciated his long service to the country , the record of which was put forward by his lawyers as an argument for probation and no prison time but , the judge said , people who occupy these types of positions , where they have the welfare and security of the nation in their hands , have a special obligation to not do anything that might create a problem judge walton , who presided over the trial that ended in march with mr libby s conviction on four felony counts , said the evidence was overwhelming that mr libby had obstructed justice and lied to a grand jury and fbi agents investigating the disclosure of the identity of a central intelligence agency operative , valerie wilson the sentence was several months longer than the minimum recommended by federal sentencing guidelines , based on what judge walton said was his agreement with prosecutors that mr libby s crimes obscured an investigation into a serious matter and that his lies obliged the government to engage in a long and costly investigation that might have been avoided had he told the truth if mr libby goes to prison , he will be the first senior white house official to do so since the days of watergate , when several of president richard m nixon s top aides , including h r haldeman and john d erlichman , served prison terms in the second setback to mr libby , judge walton refused a request by defense lawyers to delay the sentence until mr libby s appeals are exhausted unless the judge reverses his position , as mr libby s lawyers will press for in arguments next week , or unless mr bush grants a pardon , the bureau of prisons is expected to order mr libby to report to a federal prison in the next 45 to 60 days mr bush , who learned of the sentence while traveling in europe , expressed sympathy for mr libby and his family through a spokeswoman , dana perino , who was accompanying the president on air force one from the czech republic to germany but as to the possibility of a pardon , ms perino said only , the president has not intervened so far in this or any other criminal matter , so he s going to decline to do so now as well several republicans advisers close to the white house , speaking on condition of anonymity , said tuesday that they were perplexed as to why mr bush seemed reluctant to acquiesce in pardoning mr libby mr bush has pardoned more than 100 people so far , but none have been prominent an intriguing question for many is what role mr cheney will play in pressing mr bush to grant a pardon in a statement , mr cheney noted that mr libby was appealing the verdict and said that he and his wife , lynne , hope that our system will return a final result consistent with what we know of this fine man judge walton issued his sentence after intense arguments by both sides over the significance of mr libby s crimes , and after sifting through scores of letters asking for leniency that were sent to the court by notable figures , including former secretary of state henry a kissinger , former defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , and paul d wolfowitz , who recently resigned as president of the world bank and who is a former professor and government supervisor of mr libby neither mr bush nor mr cheney were among the 150 people who wrote letters of support in addition , mr libby , who did not testify in his own defense at the trial , delivered a brief statement , asking judge walton to consider , along with the jury verdict , my whole life mr libby , who has continued to maintain his innocence , did not offer any words that would have hinted at an acknowledgment of wrongdoing mr libby was not charged with leaking ms wilson s name , which first appeared in a column by robert d novak on july 14 , 2003 mr novak s sources were later revealed to be richard l armitage , a former deputy secretary of state , and karl rove , mr bush s senior political adviser in the white house , neither of whom was charged with violating the law prohibiting the disclosure of the identities of cia officers but mr libby was indicted on charges of lying about his conversations with reporters about ms wilson mr libby argued that the three reporters who contradicted his grand jury testimony were incorrect and that , in any event , he was too pressed by other business to remember details about any conversations concerning ms wilson
pittsburgh , jan 17 \( ap \) numerous visiting coaches have predicted that pittsburgh could be a final four team , an understandable reaction given the panthers' no 6 ranking and 120 record at home when jim calhoun of connecticut , a twotime national champion , said it , the premise gained more validity calhoun was not happy with his huskies' performance in their 6354 loss to pitt on tuesday night , the panthers' seventh consecutive victory that he expressed disappointment in his own team did not mask calhoun s respect for what seems certain to be pitt s sixth consecutive ncaa tournament team pitt can get to atlanta , and i think you 'll see them there , calhoun said they 're the best team we 've seen in the league winning in december and january is nothing new to pitt \( 172 , 50 in the big east \) the panthers have won at least 25 games in all but one season since 20012 however , none of those teams won more than two games in the ncaa tournament the big difference between those pitt teams and this one is that none of the previous squads had an inside player as dominating as the 7foot aaron gray , who had 22 points and 19 rebounds against  gray took on centers even taller than he is in his past two games , georgetown s 72 roy hibbert and uconn s 73 hasheem thabeet , yet averaged almost 17 points and 12 rebounds for the season , he has averaged 151 points and 103 rebounds he s a differencemaker , calhoun said it s great when you have an out pitch and they have a great out pitch when he can score like that what also makes the panthers a team to watch is their outside shooting the five most recent pitt teams that reached the ncaa tournament were driven by point guards , led by brandin knight and carl krauser but the teams were streaky at best from the outside if you focus on gray it s a mistake , because he s surrounded by some great shooters and passers , georgetown coach john thompson iii said when gray scored 9 points or fewer in four consecutive games , the panthers averaged nine 3pointers while winning all four games by an average of 21 points we have depth , forward mike cook said aaron gray is great , but we have so many players on this team capable of scoring 20 points against uconn , pitt was effective inside and outside ronald ramon complemented gray s inside playing by going 4 for 4 from beyond the arc during a 17point night we have tremendous depth and a lot of guys who can score , but i think it s our perimeter shooting that really sets this team apart , coach jamie dixon said we 've had other teams that were good at that , but none that were quite like this the panthers are shooting 40 percent from 3point range , led by antonio graves \( 28 of 56 , 50 percent \) and ramon \( 41 of 88 , 455 percent \) it is a major improvement from last season , when they made only 35 percent from beyond the arc i worked a lot on my shot this summer and came into the season ready to be a real weapon on offense , ramon said pitt s upgraded schedule may pay benefits in march the panthers played away from campus five times in november and december , something they never did in dixon s three previous seasons as coach as a result , they have had few nights when they could play poorly and still win they will be challenged again sunday when they play no 24 marquette \( 164 , 32 \) at home what we took away from all that is we do n't want to be the best team in december or january , gray said you want to be the best team in march
they will come from the highest ranks of the pop aristocracy tomorrow , filling stages on seven continents as part of live , a planetwide series of concerts meant to encourage all people to live , consume and vote ecoresponsibly , they will use their fame to persuade a global audience that is not only an urgent problem but one they can help solve madonna the police the red hot chili peppers dave matthews , bon jovi , kanye west , metallica and nunatak nunatak \? even for the superstars playing live earth which begins in sydney , australia , at 10 eastern time tonight \( noon saturday in sydney \) and proceeds westward to japan , china , germany , britain , south africa and brazil , ending tomorrow at giants stadium the size of the crowd will be especially huge organizers of the concerts , boasting an elaborate media architecture of television , satellite radio and internet broadcasts throughout the world , say they expect to reach two billion people but perhaps none will have as great a leap into fame as nunatak , made up of five british scientists at a research station in antarctica , which at this time of year it s winter there , when no ships or even planes can reach them has a population of 22 when not studying marine biology or weather patterns , they play blur and nirvana covers and some originals in a spare room next to stores of sleds and tents their last gig , at a colleague s birthday party , did not quite prepare them for what lies ahead the last time we played , we played to 17 people , said roger stilwell , a 34yearold field assistant who plays bass in the band suddenly we find ourselves playing to half the world for former vice president al gore , one of the principals behind live earth , the stakes are much higher than entertaining a big audience his ambition is to create a critical mass of opinion worldwide , he said in a telephone interview from london this week , that will push the world across a tipping point beyond which political and business and civic leaders across the spectrum will begin offering genuinely meaningful solutions to the climate crisis i think that s a realistic hope , and it s greatly needed mr gore and his partner in live earth , the veteran liveevent producer kevin wall , know it will not be easy live earth joins a long history of megaevents in which the spectacle can sometimes overshadow the cause , and promises made under the spotlights can be hard to keep in the long term two years ago , after the live 8 concerts held on the 20th anniversary of live aid , the granddaddy of the modern worldwide charity superconcert the leaders of the group of 8 nations pledged to double their aid to africa by 2010 but recently bono s advocacy group , data \( debt , , trade , africa \) , issued a report saying that most of the rich nations had already fallen far behind in their commitments mr wall , who worked with bob geldof on live 8 and live aid , says the disappointments of the big concerts of the past have taught him the importance of holding onto a mass audience s interest long after regular programming has returned to television you ca n't solve a problem in one day , mr wall said at live 8 , unfortunately , the big campaigns that could have followed , with the email addresses and the people that joined , were n't executed on on this we wo n't allow that to happen his answer is to make live earth , which took six months to pull together , a launch event for what he says will be a three to fiveyear campaign of education and grassroots activism the locations of the concerts represent the global significance of climate change nunatak s involvement allows live earth to say it is on all seven continents though the event has had difficulties in some parts of the world late last month istanbul s show was canceled , in part because of lack of interest , and this week the authorities in brazil withdrew permission for a concert on the beach in rio de janeiro , citing security concerns , though organizers said yesterday that the decision had been overturned and the event would go on as planned on friday , live earth announced that a ninth show , with garth brooks and trisha yearwood , was added on the mall in washington , and that madonna had invited the new yorkbased gypsy punk band gogol bordello to perform with her in london last week mr wall and mr gore unveiled a sevenpoint pledge they want people around the world to take , ranging from a demand for an international treaty to reduce greenhouse emissions to a promise to plant trees it s a nonbinding pledge of course , and tomorrow concertgoers and fans at home can make their affirmation by a conspicuously easy method text message to announce intentions to change the world is to invite criticism , and live earth has already been hit by a predictable series of analytical arrows environmental bloggers questioned the need for big , energygorging concerts news reports pointed out that performers would be making trips around the world in exhaustspewing jets , and that some of them \( kanye west , sheryl crow \) have songs in suv commercials and the ratio of political effectiveness to celebrity glitz is not always clear reebee garofalo , a professor of media and technology at the university of massachusetts , boston , who has written about music s role in mass movements , noted that many big charity events , like the concerts for nelson mandela , had tangible success mr mandela himself acknowledged the importance of music to the worldwide antiapartheid movement but the event itself will fundamentally be about entertainment the people going are going to hear the music , professor garofalo said so the question then becomes how do you use that event to promote the growth and expansion of a political movement that involves collective action \? proceeds will go to the alliance for climate protection , a nonprofit group founded by mr gore tickets for giants stadium , with the police , the dave matthews band , kelly clarkson , akon , smashing pumpkins , roger waters , fall out boy , kanye west and others , are still available , from 83 to 348 unlike live 8 , the tibetan freedom concerts and the amnesty international tours of the '80s , live earth focuses less on governments and world leaders than on ordinary people an array of media will offer middleclass lifestyle tips to conserve energy and reduce waste live earth has produced some 60 short films and 30 public service videos on these topics with hollywood stars like cameron diaz and will ferrell , and chocked its web site \( \) and a new book , the live earth global warming survival handbook , with more information and guidance in a funny way , mr gore said , it s probably easier to imagine change at the grassroots level enduring than it is to expect political leaders to make changes in the absence of a political base of support for those changes the organizers are hoping that the nuts and bolts of the shows themselves will be influential they have created a concert green standard of alternative energy sources and waste recycling , and say they will be closely monitoring every drop of fuel and pound of garbage wind and solar power will be used in tokyo , for example , and the power generators at wembley stadium in london will run on 99 percent biodiesel fuel , a spokesman said giants stadium is to use recyclable concessions products and compost organic waste in these efforts live earth is tapping into a slowly growing trend in the music industry big festivals like bonnaroo and lollapalooza have developed extensive green programs like using energyefficient lights and recycled water and paper products live nation , the country s biggest concert promoter , has a similar pilot program in the san francisco area and is planning to expand it nationally later this year but for many musicians at live earth , the concerts are less about parts per million than the urgency of the overall message the climate change situation is the no 1 problem facing humanity , said flea , the bassist of the red hot chili peppers , in an email message this week while on tour in europe if it is not addressed globally , then all other attempts to reduce human suffering shall be for naught to get to live earth in london , the chili peppers will play three shows in three countries over 24 hours \( tonight paris tomorrow afternoon live earth tomorrow night denmark \) but even given their passion for the cause , it took some gladhanding from mr gore to persuade them to do it mr gore said he went to the grammy awards in february to do some recruiting for live earth , and sat in the chili peppers' dressing room discussing their thorny tour schedule the band still had not agreed to play when mr gore and queen latifah presented the award for best rock album we opened the envelope , and lo and behold it was the chili peppers , he said and they came onstage , and the confetti fell down , and after i gave them the award a couple of them took me aside on the stage and whispered to me , we 're in' i just thought that it was a very neat way to get the news
the received some good news and some bad news before their game against the yesterday a magnetic resonance imaging test on carlos beltr n s right knee was negative that was the good news the bad news was that awoke with back spasms neither player was healthy enough to start for the mets , who were already missing three starters so they began their game at shea stadium with five reserves behind starter john maine that was when the really bad news arrived brandon webb , the diamondbacks' sensational righthander , threw a sinkerball that baffled the mets , reserves and regulars alike the mets \( 3419 \) managed four singles only one of them out of the infield in a 51 loss that probably would have felt more disheartening had it come with their more robust lineup he was painting his sinker all night , catcher paul lo duca said he was tough to hit we knew we were in trouble with such a makeshift lineup , and with webb in such a groove , there was little margin for error by maine he was nearly flawless early in the game , allowing a leadoff single to eric byrnes in the first inning and then retiring the next nine batters , five of them on strikeouts but maine made two costly mistakes in the fifth inning he allowed a oneout double to carlos quentin the next batter , chris snyder , clobbered a 91mileanhour fastball that was supposed to be inside but stayed in the middle , sending the ball cruising over the leftfield wall to give the diamondbacks \( 3323 \) a 20 lead you never want to give up runs when another pitcher s doing well , maine said it just makes it tough the mets' depleted lineup , which had damion easley batting third , appeared puzzled by webb , who won the national league s cy young award last season webb surrendered two hits through the first six innings , an infield single in the third and a bunt single in the sixth , both by jos reyes easley , who has been filling in at second base for the injured jos valent n and usually bats much lower in the order , went 0 for 4 with the fourth and fifth batters , carlos delgado and lo duca , also hitless , manager willie randolph tried to generate some offense in the sixth inning by lifting maine , who had thrown 103 pitches , for a pinchhitter the move failed when webb struck out carlos g mez maine allowed two runs and five hits in six innings while striking out seven batters and walking none he threw the ball well , randolph said webb was even better on a normal night , maine s performance might have been good enough but this night was anything but normal with beltr n out , the outfield was made up of backups i hope they do n't run into each other , randolph said before the game beltr n , who would have been in center field , injured his knee during the first inning of thursday s game against the san francisco giants he was listed as day to day i feel better than yesterday for sure , said beltr n , who sustained the injury while colliding with first baseman rich aurilia but my leg s still weak i just want to take the field when i feel like i can play the game the way i want to play the game maybe not 100 percent , because that s impossible but at least 80 , 85 percent endy ch vez replaced beltr n and was joined in the outfield by david newhan , who started in left , and ben johnson , recently called up from class aaa new orleans the mets were already missing left fielder moises alou \( strained left quadriceps \) and right fielder shawn green \( broken bone in his right foot \) , both of whom are on the disabled list wright wanted to play and even requested to pinch hit during the game , but was persuaded to sit the 48yearold julio franco started at third base more than anything , it s precautionary , said wright , who had back problems last season and usually sees a chiropractor once every week or two i talked to willie and planned on playing the whole day i sat down with him and our trainer , and they thought it was best just to give us a day but i plan on being there tomorrow had wright played , he might have had success against webb but it is hard to imagine how webb allowed four hits and one unearned run over eight innings he retired the side in order four times and allowed only four runners to reach scoring position the diamondbacks increased their lead to 50 when stephen drew hit a threerun homer in the eighth against guillermo mota , who relieved maine i think i made a good pitch , mota said he hit it on a good part of the bat the mets finally scored in the eighth , when newhan reached on an infield single and advanced to second on a wild throw from third baseman mark reynolds he scored when pinchhitter rub n gotay s grounder squirted past a diving conor jackson at first base and rolled into right field for the only mets hit that left the infield as a player , obviously you want to be on the field , newhan said , speaking for himself and for his fellow reserves it s fun to run out there and play but you got to come away with a win
senator began running his first facetocamera television advertisement on wednesday in iowa in which he dismisses the unnamed cynics in washington who he says have rejected his message of hope the 60second spot is now running only in iowa akpd message and media gmmb wearing a trim dark suit and a deep purple tie , mr obama stands in an airy , creamwalled room and strolls slowly toward the camera , speaking directly into the lens at the end of the advertisement , a dark blue fills the screen , accompanied by the words in white text , change we can believe in every time i speak about my hope for america , the cynics in washington roll their eyes you see , they do n't believe we can actually change politics and bring an end to decades of division and deadlock they do n't believe we can limit the power of lobbyists who block our progress , or that we can trust the american people with the truth and that s why we face the same problems and hear the same promises every four years my experience tells me something very different in 20 years of public service , i 've brought democrats and republicans together to solve problems that touch the lives of everyday people i 've taken on the drug and insurance companies and won i defied the politics of the moment , and opposed the war in iraq before it began this is barack obama i approve this message to ask you to believe not just in my ability to bring about real change in washington i'm asking you to believe in yours mr obama is correct in reminding viewers that he was an early and consistent opponent of the iraq war he states that he took on drug and insurance companies , but does not specify when or how he did it he speaks of decades of division and deadlock , but does not say who is at fault the spot is simple and compelling , and its message is a nonetoosubtle shot at mr obama s main opponent , senator hillary rodham clinton , by setting up a contrast between her and mr obama in suggesting that he is an outsidethebeltway figure promising to limit the power of lobbyists the advertisement highlights mr obama s years of public service , in the senate , in the illinois legislature and as a community organizer in chicago it seeks to confront what polls have shown is a major concern about mr obama s candidacy that he lacks leadership experience in mr obama s successful senate race in 2004 , he heavily utilized the facetocamera format
\( to see part one of this article , click to see part three , click \) it was an historic occasion i arrived with my cameraman , bob chappell , and his first assistant , eric zimmerman , within a few days of the 150th anniversary of the fall of sebastopol on september 8 , 1855 the airport at simferopol the crimea s capital was clotted with dozens of elderly british tourists arrived on the afternoon flight from istanbul for a brief moment i had this fantasy that i would make a movie about people at the end of their lives reaching back into some unknowable past , trying to recover something perhaps unknowable about their own past i would follow them about record their attempts to reconnect with history because of the anniversary , it was difficult to locate an available guide , but eventually we found the often disgruntled olga makarova the guide of guides when i told her about the valley of the shadow of death , she assumed that i wanted to go to the valley of death , the site of the charge of the light brigade susan sontag herself points out the difference to disabuse us , her readers , of the possibility of such confusion 1 there is even the suggestion in sontag that fenton might have deliberately fostered such confusion she writes , in the first version of the celebrated photo he was to call the valley of the shadow of death \( despite the title , it was not across this landscape that the light brigade made its doomed charge \) 2 tennyson , in his poem the charge of the light brigade , writes about the valley of death , not the valley of the shadow of death half a league half a league , half a league onward , all in the valley of death rode the six hundred forward , the light brigade ! charge for the guns he said into the valley of death rode the six hundred even before going to the crimea , i had assembled an impressive collection of maps , and you can see , clearly marked on the maps of the period , the valley of the shadow of death and you can clearly see why it was given that name it is at the confluence of cannonball trajectories from three major russian artillery batteries the flagstaff , barracks and garden batteries olga led us first to the woronzoff ravine , marked on contemporary maps as lying to the east of the valley of the shadow of death i was adamant no , no ! this is the woronzoff ravine this is not the valley of the shadow of death there is always difficulty when you try to tell local guides their business , but we retraced our steps back to sebastopol and took a different road , which took us up to a ridge to the west of the woronzoff ravine at last we were able to look down into the valley of the shadow of death miraculously , the area is still undeveloped 3 you can still see the remnants of trenches on the hill facing the great redan the old chapman batteries the cannonballs are gone but the ground is littered with very tiny snail shells on what is called shell hill in many accounts from the crimean war i don t know why , but the snails made me feel connected to history we parked off to the side and then descended into the valley , down to a road at the bottom the same road that can be seen in the fenton photographs olga had shoes with highheels not stilettos , but heels high enough to make walking difficult the apex of her career had been shepherding the duke of edinburgh around sebastopol for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the german defeat we were a few rungs down from her most illustrious customers , and we were breaking the rules the usual tour includes the site of the charge of the light brigade , the monuments to the british and russian war dead , a visit to balaclava harbor and the panorama , an extraordinary 360degree tableau of the siege of sebastopol we were definitely off the beaten track and wandering around in the middle of nowhere we continued south along the road , checking the overgrown views against copies of the fenton photographs soon , we came to a fork possibly the same fork seen in the 1855 photographs after a certain amount of rummaging around , walking back and forth over a smaller and smaller patch of terrain , a couple of false alarms and a faulty calculation , we found the actual place where fenton s two photographs were taken could i be mistaken \? of course error is the central feature of human existence however , i believe we found it and that the topographical evidence and historical maps bear me out there is no other point on the road where the landscape looks so similar to the landscape in the fenton photographs in this one spot , there was a match looking south , away from sebastopol , the landscape flattens out toward the high plains of the british encampments looking north , we see the hills just before sebastopol there is no way of telling for sure from fenton s photographs which direction we re facing both ulrich keller and richard pare , two of my experts from part one , believe that fenton was looking south , and i can easily understand their mistake looking at the photographs , it looks as though we are looking back into the hills , but appearances are often deceiving and so are photographs standing in the landscape , it is evident fenton was looking north or , more specifically , northnorthwest 4 fenton s april 24 letter tells us that the photographs were taken in the afternoon but gives us little information about the direction his camera was pointing at least , the trip to the crimea had provided empirical data now we knew both camera direction and time of day this is more than idle information think about it for a moment depending on time or direction , everything gets reversed if we are looking north or northnorthwest in the afternoon , then toplit balls come first but if we are looking south or southsoutheast in the morning , then toplit balls come second looking north on before off looking south off before on there was one disturbing problem \( that voice inside your head that says not so fast , buster \) just where is the light coming from \? when i first saw the fenton photographs i thought the cannonballs looked backlit 5 but this doesn t really make any sense they can t be not if we are really looking north in the northern hemisphere the light comes from the south the balls aren t backlit , they re frontlit ! had i allowed my beliefs to determine what i saw \? \( had i , too , fallen victim to the principle believing is seeing \? \) furthermore , what do the shadows on a cannonball , a crimean cannonball , circa 1850 , really look like not in a fenton photograph but sitting alone , unadorned in the valley of the shadow of death 150 years later \? olga seemed amused i am not a great believer in certainty , but i am pretty certain the duke of edinburgh never asked to go to the panorama museum to borrow a crimean war cannonball the museum is an extraordinary place part museum , part rotunda that houses the 360degree panorama it was not long after the war that the first panoramas were constructed of the siege first in paris , later in sebastopol panoramas were in vogue in those days installed in a special rotunda in 1905 , marking the 50th anniversary of the siege , it shows the russians temporarily victorious before their ultimate defeat by the allied forces \( the french , the english , the turks and , believe it or not , the sardinians \) the panorama a panorama of the destruction of war was destroyed by german bombing during world war ii and then reconstructed in a new rotunda built after the war \( it is an amazing work of art should we allow a painting of the destruction of war to be permanently destroyed by war \? \) it looked like a back door but it was really the front door i looked through the mail slot , but there was nobody there we returned the following day , and an old sovietstyle guard ushered us into what looked like the parlor of a mental institution after some confusion , we were brought upstairs to meet the curator and some of the staff \( i told them i d won an oscar \) after a desultory conversation as desultory as a conversation can be when none of the parties understand each other or have a clear idea of what is going on i asked for a cannonball there were additional translation difficulties i remember olga gesticulating wildly successful , we returned to the valley of the shadow of death with one cannonball and took various pictures as the sun descended in the west , the sky became hazy and the shadowline on the cannonball less and less welldefined , perhaps the first indication that an examination of the pattern of light and shadow on the cannonballs might be more difficult than i had imagined  richard pare , the fifth expert quoted in part one of this essay , always an interesting commentator on fenton , talks not just about the flipflopping of the sequence of photographs , but the flipflopping of the pictures themselves richard pare fenton always had a taste for the abstract and the geometrically formal in image making there s this strange collapsing of perspective that he gets because of the footpath that s trodden into the left hand side of the road that connects up in the further distance to the main track as it disappears over the horizon they have a parallel width that causes the thing to flipflop in a way , visually condenses it into a kind of uneasy restlessness he was very satisfied with the two pictures he made in getting two negatives and left it at that the way it fits into the whole of his output is interesting i don t know how familiar you are with the whole body of work \? it s largely given over to portraits of the major senior officers , camp activities and landscapes portraits of lord raglan , the commanderinchief , and omar pasha , in charge of the turkish troops , p lissier , in charge of the french , and senior generals do you know about the history of the crimean war \? in my obsessive discussion of these two pictures , had i forgotten that roger fenton was one of the first photographers to chronicle war and a truly terrible war at that \? had i forgotten about the war while drifting into the war photograph \? i hope not photographs provide a window into history not into general history but into a specific moment , a specific place it is as if we have reached into the past and created a tiny peephole em richard pare it s 1854 and napoleon iii wheels out an old treaty from 1740 to insist upon the right of the french to defend foreigners and people visiting from other nations into the holy land which was then part of the ottoman empire the original pretext was monks quarreling catholic and russian orthodox monks fighting it out in the church of the nativity in bethlehem they got in a fight and some of them were killed over who should have the right to put a star up over the manger is it possible that 200 , 000 people were killed over who should have the right to put a star over the manger \? em napoleon iii has just got onto the throne after a coup d tat in 1852 but he has been effectively snubbed by the tsar , who looked down at him as kind of arriviste upstart and used the squabble as an excuse to march down towards the holy land immediately the french established an alliance with the british , quite an extraordinary thing in itself it s only 30 years after waterloo the british and french were both working at the extreme limits of their supply lines the winter of 18545 was absolutely ghastly when they arrived in september , they had perfect fall weather , wildflowers blooming in all directions it was like heaven on earth by january they were in the most desperate situation , in complete misery there was a freak windstorm , a hurricane that blew all the tents away , so nobody had any shelter at all officers , men , it didn t make any difference cholera was rampant , dysentery casualties grew twothirds were killed by disease and sickness rather than actual battle wounds fenton arrives when things are beginning to improve a bit after a huge uproar in england the government has fallen over the miscarriage of what was going on , having started out with almost complete support from pretty much everybody a brilliant and controversial contrarian called john bright who was one of the great civil libertarians of the age stood up in parliament and gave impassioned speeches about the angel of death being brought to the land fenton arrives after all this looking at these men who ve seen hell very close up , and it shows in their faces so he was trying to , somehow or other , with the very difficult mechanics of working at the time , to encapsulate some of that , and gets it , finally , in that one photograph there is also an extraordinary photographic panorama in eleven parts that he did of the whole plateau of sebastopol it starts off with the camp on the left , troops marshaling , armaments in pyramidal forms , ditches being dug , tents , clothes being aired , all kinds of activity going on you can see stretcher parties ready to go and people gazing out toward sebastopol with bombardment going on as a daily occurrence , then it goes to the wasteland in the middle , which is , literally , the killing field where people died by the thousands , and finishes up with the graves of the senior officers on the far right hand side so it operates as a kind of background to the other single image the valley of the shadow of death which is without question the greater picture but that single image gains in resonance by comparison with the panorama  it is of course impossible to capture the horror of war in a single image or single letter the british artillery had assembled on the hills overlooking sebastopol , the lines split into two parts , bisected by the woronzoff road , the chapman batteries on the left \( facing sebastopol \) and the gordon batteries on the right a railway had been built from the port at balaclava to the british encampments on the heights above sebastopol the french and british had positioned approximately 500 large guns close to the russian fortifications artillery shells of every size and description had been stockpiled and then the barrage began fenton s letter of april 45 , which refers to the valley of death was written on a wednesdaythursday the second bombardment started several days later there has been very heavy firing today , but the promised opening of all the batteries did not take place it is now said to be adjourned until the question of peace or war is finally settled up to the present time the russians have decidedly the best of it that is the siege though whenever they attack they loose sic heaps of men but they keep advancing their works getting fresh batteries made new rifle pits the rumour today is that the firing is to begin on monday continue 5 days when the troops are all to go in the firing actually began \( as fenton had predicted \) on april 9 , easter monday , 1855 , and continued for ten days i have read estimates that 6 , 000 russians were killed , and 1 , 600 allies the following letter is from a young captain to his wife it attracted my attention because it was written on april 20 , a couple of days after the bombardment ended and three days before fenton took his two photographs it captures the desperation that many british soldiers felt after the second bombardment the shelling , designed to put an end to the war , ushered in just another period of indecision , confusion and violence our siege must be numbered among the things that have been it is over has been a more ridiculous disgusting farce than the first the russian batteries works are as good strong as ever further than the mischief that such a fire must have caused in the town sebastopol , we are no near our end than we were months ago there is one universal feeling of disgust and humiliation among us at this second ridiculous exhibition we are now , as we have been for months , ourselves the besieged in our corner of the crimea we have a most splendid army thrown away on our chiefs , either by their dissensions or their incompetency an absurd reconnaissance took place the day before yesterday in which the turks and our cavalry took part they solemnly went out killed one cossack took another and our loss consisted in the capture by the enemy of two navvies who went out to see the fun ! our only other attempt at offensive operation consisted of an attack on some ambuscades that annoy our batteries on the right it was conducted as all our operations seem to be a body of the 77th went out last night , drove the russians out of their holes were left totally unsupported to hold their places against whole columns of the russes they were of course cut to pieces but fought splendidly held their ground in one of the ambuscades they lost their colonel , egerton , a very fine fellow , and a captain , a little boy named lempriere , who had just got his company , about 20 ! , killed , two officers wounded all of this is very sad has caused great feelings of disgust among us men s lives , if one may use the term , being frittered away , in wretched little mismanaged attacks of this sort that do nobody any good that are only redeemed from being ridiculous by the gallantry our poor soldiers always show from eyewitness in the crimea the crimean war letters \( 18541856 \) of lt col george frederick dallas , edited by michael hargreave mawson for me , the crimean war is the perfect war started for obscure reasons , hopelessly murderous , and accomplishing nothing even the charge of the light brigade was a senseless exercise \( if you believe cecil woodhamsmith s account in the reason why one of the truly great books about war the charge occurred because of a missing comma in lord raglan s orders to lord lucan \) the crimean war , often described as a precursor to the american civil war , is more a harbinger of world war i a stationary front informed by endless and futile exchanges of lethal artillery fire trench warfare par excellence lord raglan , the commander of the british forces , previously the duke of wellington s aidedecamp , lost his arm to a french cannonball at waterloo his specially designed sleeve the raglan sleeve , along with the cardigan and the balaclava is how we remember the crimean war a war defined by innovations in wardrobe a sleeve , a sweater and a hat raglan , who died in the crimea just before the fall of sebastopol , seemed often confused about what was going on he would exhort his soldiers to go out and fight the french and had to be reminded that in this particular war the russians were the enemy the french were his allies  there is an extraordinary passage in aw kinglake who wrote an eightvolume history of the crimean war , the invasion of the crimea its origins and an account of its progress down to the death of lord raglan the passage concerns the april 1855 bombardment and makes liberal use of what is known as the pathetic fallacy the term , coined by john ruskin in 1856 , refers to our propensity to endow inanimate nature with humanlike characteristics ruskin disapproved he called it a fallacy , didn t he \? but to navigate in the world to read the world , so to speak we need to see the world as having some sort of purpose , some sort of motivation \( it is too frightening otherwise \) hence , we see intentionality everywhere the hurricane wants to thwart our plans the earthquake intends to teach us a lesson here is the passage from kinglake in its entirety it is possibly the masterpiece of the pathetic fallacy the ways of a cannonball when obstructed without being stopped whether taking its flight through the air , or encountering more solid obstacles a roundshot of course must be always obeying strict , natural laws , and must work out the intricate reckoning enjoined by conflict of power with absolute , servile exactness but between the composition of forces maintained in our physical world and the fixed resolve of a mind made up under warring motives there is always analogy , with even sometimes strange resemblance and to untutored hearers a formula set down in algebra would convey less idea of the path of a hindered , though not vanquished cannonball than would the simple speech of a savage who , after tracing its course \( as only savages can \) , has called it a demon let loose for not only does it seem to be armed with a mighty will , but somehow to govern its action with everready intelligence , and even to have a policy the demon is cruel and firm not blindly , not stupidly obstinate he is not a straightforward enemy against things that are hard and directly confronting him he indeed frankly tries his strength , and does his utmost to shatter them , and send them in splinters and fragments to widen the havoc he brings but with obstacles that are smooth and face him obliquely he always compounds , being ready on even slight challenge to come , as men say , to fair terms by varying his line of advance , and even if need be , resorting to crooked , to sinuous paths by dint of simple friction with metal , with earth , with even the soft , yielding air , he adds varied rotatory movements to those fell skill as he goes he acquires a strange nimbleness , can do more than simply strike , can wrench , can lift , can toss , can almost grasp can gather from each conquered hindrance a new and baneful power can be rushing for instance straight on in a horizontal direction , and then because of some contact spring up all at once like a tiger intent on the throat of a camel wow the demon is cruel and firm , he acquires a strange nimbleness a new and baneful power , a tiger intent on the throat of a camel the soulless , inanimate world of the iron cannonball comes alive literally with a vengeance not only does the cannonball have intent it plans , it connives it is hopelessly devious , maybe even deviant photographs are no different we look at them they are nothing more than silver halide crystals arranged on paper or with digital photography , nothing more than a concatenation of 1 s and 0 s resident on a harddrive yet we believe they have captured something of our essence something of the stuff that is in our heads i , too , look at the two fenton photographs and try to imagine what fenton s intentions might have been it s unavoidable we have been programmed to do so by natural selection to project ourselves into the world and to imagine his world as we imagine ours i try to figure out which photograph was taken first and to develop theories about fenton s motivations , but these are just theories , nothing more the day after our second excursion to the valley of the shadow of death , we took a trip to yalta it s a threehour drive from sebastopol along the southern coast of the crimea on our way there olga asked us to pull off the road no turnout no signs just a guardrail , shrubbrush and a steep hill looking down to the black sea she pointed to something you could just make out the orange roofs of a large building complex gorbachev s summer home it kind of looked like a metastatic international house of pancakes as olga described it , he came to this home as premier of the soviet union and left as nobody not far from gorbachev s complex is khrushchev s dacha , although it can t be seen from the road olga , who considers herself a russian , had a bone to pick with khrushchev khrushchev , a ukrainian , had given the crimea to the ukraine as a birthday present to himself when the soviet union broke up , the crimea stayed with the ukraine even though it had traditionally been part of russia olga was not prepared to forgive him for this largesse to himself and to the ukraine at the expense of the russian federation khrushchev s dacha was built at the closest point across the black sea from turkey i remember reading that khrushchev would sit on the deck of his dacha and look out across the water i see his pawlike hand holding an exquisite crystal glass of vodka at times , he imagined that he could see turkey a physical impossibility because of the curvature of the earth not just turkey , but kennedy s damn jupiter missiles in turkey aimed at the soviet union and at his dacha that was when he decided on a titfortat policy if kennedy could put his missiles in turkey a couple of hundred miles from the soviet union a couple of hundred miles from khrushchev s dacha then khrushchev could \( with impunity \) put his missiles in cuba the die was cast i also remember reading an account of october 28 , 1962 the last night of the cuban missile crisis , when many knowledgeable people thought the world would end khrushchev had not yet capitulated and kennedy was poised for nuclear war khrushchev was in moscow kennedy in washington we know what khrushchev was doing from the accounts written by his son , sergei khrushchev was so worried about the possibility of nuclear war that he spent a sleepless night and then announced his decision to remove the missiles from cuba over radio moscow the following morning , so that it could be broadcast to the entire world without delay that night , kennedy was down by the white house pool with his aide dave powers and two girlfriends watching audrey hepburn in roman holiday what a story hepburn , heir to some unspecified throne , dreams of being free of the obligations of state , but in the end knows that she must return to the requirements of the monarchy that die , too , was cast it was a fantasy within a fantasy within the reality of the white house war is such a peculiar thing inaugurated by the whims of few , affecting the fate of many it is a difficult , if not impossible thing to understand , yet we feel compelled to describe it as though it has meaning even virtue it starts for reasons often hopelessly obscure , meanders on , then stops  my attempts to solve the question of which came first , took many months to a certain extent , they are still ongoing i sometimes wonder is the entire meaning of photography contained in these twin fenton photographs one the doppelganger of the other and often indirectly described as such \? the good fenton photograph , honest and unadorned by a desire for contrivance or misdirection , and the bad fenton photograph the photograph decried by sontag corrupted by the sleight of hand , the trick , the calculated deception 6 but which is which \? an ironclad solution to the puzzle of which photograph came first \( and which has been rediscovered by a number of respondents i refuse to call them bloggers \) was eventually provided by my friend dennis purcell it uses no evidence external to the photograph other than simple common sense and was motivated by a few words from one of his professors in college always look for small things i will discuss dennis s solution and some attempts that i made at a solution myself in the third part of this article one last thought i imagine a counterpart to fenton someone on the russian lines who experienced the terrible shelling during april 1855 a russian stationed at the garden battery who was involved in shelling the valley of the shadow of death and then i found him a young artillery officer who despaired of ever having a military career he said , i may never be a general of the army , but perhaps i can become a general of literature in his sebastopol sketches , he wrote now i have said all i wish to say on this occasion i am , however , beset by a painful thought perhaps i ought not to have said it perhaps what i have said belongs to the category of those harmful truths each of us carries around in his subconscious , truths we must not utter aloud lest they cause active damage where in this narrative is there any illustration of evil that is to be avoided \? where is there any illustration of good that is to be emulated \? who is the villain of the piece \? and who its hero \? all the characters are equally blameless and equally wicked no , the hero of my story , whom i love with all my heart and soul , whom i have attempted to portray in all his beauty and who has always been , is now and will always be supremely magnificent , is truth written june 26 , 1855 , 60 days or so after fenton s letter to his wife there is no evidence to support this , but i imagine one of the flaminghot cannonballs careening from wall to rocky wall in the valley of the shadow of death perhaps landing at fenton s feet bearing the invisible fingerprints of leo tolstoy this is the second part of a threepart article i would like to thank all the readers of this column in particular , the more than 800 people who wrote to the times in response to the first part of this essay their commentary provides an extraordinary collection of insightful and thoughtprovoking analysis i may respond in a fourth part first , however , i would like to publish in these electronic pages the third and final part of this essay i would also welcome any and all contributions concerning the april bombardment and its relevance to the fenton photographs footnotes 1 some of the posts for part one of this essay display this very confusion 2 fenton himself , in his april 45t letter , writes about the valley of death although he is clearly referring to the valley of the shadow of death 3 i had tried to convince julia , my wife , to come with me to the crimea my first argument was that it would give her an opportunity not only to read the 23rd psalm , but to see the 23rd psalm then i suggested that it was an opportunity to experience the 23rd psalm and while i didn t have a chance to make the argument before i went there , it turns out that there a parts of the valley of the shadow of death that are for sale , and there was an opportunity not to just to see and experience the 23rd psalm but to own it who could resist \? i started to think about the possibility of valley of the shadow of death time shares what a fantastic place for a nursing home ! 4 my trip to the crimea also dispelled one other concern the possibility that the photographs had been flopped , leftright since the landscape corresponds so closely to the photographs , i feel that s not very likely 5 many people who wrote responses to part one share this view it made me feel a little better about myself 6 although , to paraphrase shakespeare , the fault , dear brutus , lies not in our photographs but in ourselves

baghdad , oct 12 fresh accounts of the shooting last month , given by three rooftop witnesses and by american soldiers who arrived shortly after the gunfire ended , cast new doubt friday on statements by blackwater guards that they were responding to armed insurgents when iraqi investigators say 17 iraqis were killed at a baghdad intersection the three witnesses , kurds on a rooftop overlooking the scene , said they had observed no gunfire that could have provoked the shooting by blackwater guards american soldiers who arrived minutes later found shell casings from guns used normally by american contractors , as well as by the american military the kurdish witnesses are important because they had the advantage of an unobstructed view and because , collectively , they observed the shooting at nisour square from start to finish , free from the terror and confusion that might have clouded accounts of witnesses at street level moreover , because they are proamerican , their accounts have a credibility not always extended to iraqi arabs , who have been more hostile to the american presence their statements , made in interviews with the new york times , appeared to challenge a state department account that a blackwater vehicle had been disabled in the shooting and had to be towed away since those initial accounts , blackwater and the state department have consistently refused to comment on the substance of the case the kurdish witnesses said that they saw no one firing at the guards at any time during the event , an observation corroborated by the forensic evidence of the shell casings two of the witnesses also said all the blackwater vehicles involved in the shooting drove away under their own power the kurds , who work for a political party whose building looks directly down on the square , said they had looked for any evidence that the american security guards were responding to an attack , but found none i call it a massacre , said omar h waso , one of the witnesses and a senior official at the party , which is called the patriotic union of kurdistan it is illegal they used the law of the jungle many of the american soldiers were similarly appalled while blackwater has said its guards were attacked by automatic gunfire , the soldiers did not find any casings from the sort of guns typically used by insurgents or by iraqi security forces , according to an american military official briefed on the findings of the unit that arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the blackwater convoy left that analysis of forensic evidence at the scene was first reported friday by the washington post the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter , added that soldiers had found clear evidence that the blackwater guards were not been threatened and also opened fire on civilians who had tried to flee the cartridges and casings we found were all associated with coalition forces and contractors , the official said the only brass we found where somebody fired weapons were ones from contractors the case has angered many in the military who believe that the conduct of the security guards makes the troops' jobs harder if our people had done this , another american military official said , they would be courtmartialed the shooting , on sept 16 , and the deaths of two iraqi women in a shooting by a different security company on tuesday , have provoked anger at politically potent levels of iraqi society in the holy cities of karbala and najaf , officials affiliated with s most revered shiite cleric , grand ayatollah ali alsistani , called for sanctions against the companies in karbala , a spokesman for the ayatollah inveighed against the cheapening of iraqi blood and called for parliament to take action in a legacy of orders handed down during postinvasion american rule here , western contractors essentially have immunity to iraqi law none of the roughly two dozen witnesses previously interviewed by iraqi investigators said that they saw or heard anyone but the blackwater guards fire during the shooting , which iraq says killed 17 and wounded 27 still , because nearly all of those witnesses were in the field of fire , their accounts could conceivably have been skewed by the terror and confusion of the moment the kurdish witnesses on the rooftop said they had not been interviewed by iraqi investigators they said they had been visited by american investigators , but had not been fully interviewed after the shootings , american soldiers found plenty of empty bullet casings 762 millimeters in diameter had the 762millimeter casings been from an ak47 rifle , a common insurgent and iraqi police weapon , they would have been 39 millimeters long had they been from a pkc machine gun , another common iraqi weapon , they would have been 54 millimeters long the soldiers did not find any of those , the military official said instead , the official said , the casings were 51 millimeters long , the length used by nato weapons , including the m240 machine gun , a standard automatic weapon used by the america military and american security contractors , the official said the soldiers also found empty 556millimeter casings of the type used by the m4 and m16 rifles that american troops and contractors bear the fbi has been interviewing soldiers from the unit that responded to the scene , the third battalion of the 82nd field artillery regiment , which is part of the second brigade of the first cavalry division , to collect information in its investigation of the shooting , the official said only one of the kurdish witnesses , a guard who would give his name only as sabah , saw the first shots fired by the blackwater guards into a white sedan , killing a man and his mother and setting the events in motion two others , mr waso and his driver , sirwan ali , went to the roof after the shooting started and observed long enough to see the blackwater vehicles leave the square eventually both went down to help the victims , they said all three men have military backgrounds when asked if anything had occurred to provoke the initial shots from blackwater , sabah said nothing at all no mortars no shooting all he saw , sabah said , was that the white sedan moved a little bit and they started shooting as events unfolded and the blackwater guards unleashed a storm of gunfire into the crowded square , mr waso and mr ali both said , they could neither hear nor see any return fire it was onesided shooting from one direction , mr waso said there was n't any return fire mr waso said that what he saw was not only disturbing , but also in some cases incomprehensible he said that the guards kept firing long after it was clear that there was no resistance people were shot while trying to flee , he said one man ran from a volkswagen and the guards shot him in the head from behind , mr waso said finally there was a pause of a few seconds in the shooting as the blackwater convoy prepared to leave , he said then , mr waso said with a look of disbelief on his face , at least one blackwater guard began firing again , this time at a red bus full of people on the western rim of the square the glass was all broken , mr waso said , struggling to describe the bus after the firing resumed women and children , all of them were shouting and crying some of the people who survived in the bus were tended to later at the patriotic union of kurdistan building , he said after that last burst of gunfire in the square , mr waso said , all four of the blackwater vehicles left as far as he could see , they drove away under their own power , he said in the end , mr waso said , he went down and asked iraqi national guard soldiers to chase the blackwater team leave them and try to follow that company before they get away , mr waso said he told a soldier they killed innocent people for no reason
it was about five hours and 8 , 000 vertical feet into the ride when i found myself next to nigel he was english and a member of a somewhat ridiculous , somewhat serious cycling club not far from london called the old portilians a year earlier we had ridden the raid pyr n en together that had been 450 miles of hard riding from the atlantic to the mediterranean , over many of the great climbs of the pyrenees , and i 'd never heard nigel complain once but now he was on a rant this is goddamn insane , this ride we 're going to die what were we thinking \? i always ask myself the same question at a certain point in any preposterous endurance endeavor but it was still early in the day , and besides , the thought should never be uttered aloud cheer up , man it s a gorgeous day and we 're in the middle of the french alps how bad could it be \? you think those goats up there are n't enjoying the day \? what goats \? i pointed to the top of the massive peak in front of us you idiot , nigel said through his sweat those are n't bloody goats , those are cyclists that s where we have to climb up there \? high above , the tiny figures were moving god , they were riders depressed now , mate \? i nodded we 're going to die right you hear a lot of reasons why kids are drawn to sports a sense of belonging , the sheer love of the game , a chance to earn attention , all those highly touted social benefits but for me it was always the violence as a kid growing up in the deep south , what i liked most about sports was the endless opportunities presented to hit somebody and not get into trouble the same sort of violent outburst that doomed you to days of detention would have coaches jumping up and down and shouting gleefully you knocked the snot out of 'em ! way to go ! at least it was that way with football , and where i grew up , football was n't just a part of life , it was life , and all that other stuff we did to fill our days seemed monochromatic and slightly sissified the notion of engaging in an athletic endeavor in which you were penalized for hitting someone seemed an utter waste of time i was vaguely aware of endurance sports but lumped them together in the same oddball category as race walking you do that for fun \? so i played football and rugby , boxed and wrestled , none of it particularly well i tried basketball but always got into fights , mostly as a way to cover for the fact that i never could master that dribbling thing this all works well enough through high school and college , but at a certain point you look up and the options for participating in sports as a socially accepted way to commit pleasurable acts of violence have narrowed when most peers are focused on building a career and starting a family , it becomes problematic to admit that what you most enjoy in life is lining up and knocking the snot out of somebody , or vice versa what once made you seem funloving and enthusiastic so wellrounded ! now begins to paint a darker portrait of an emerging psychopath with serious developmental issues you 're not just the aging lifeguard whose friends have all left the beach you 're the aging lifeguard with a little serial killer practice on the side eventually , the time came for me to find other athletic outlets equally gratifying and consuming , though i swore i 'd never take up any sports that fat people do well like golf as is typical , the first endurance sport i tried was running i hated it freud says that anatomy is destiny , and my destiny as a runner was utter mediocrity short of a mandate that all races end with a refrigeratorlifting contest , i was doomed those countless hours spent in the gym building a certain mass were suddenly as helpful as lugging around a crate of rocks it just did n't seem fair i ran my first marathon on a flat course and was feeling quite proud of myself when at around mile 19 i fell into conversation with a stick figure of a guy who seemed fresh enough to have just started he explained that he was training for an upcoming 100kilometer race and that this was his off day , so he had decided to run the marathon then i noticed he was wearing hiking boots i need to make this a challenge , he said i had to stop and pretend to be tying my shoe so that i would n't tackle him then , by chance , i stumbled across one of the few endurance sports that did n't automatically favor those with the body of a pow crosscountry skiing i 'd never really considered crosscountry skiing a sport but more an excuse to wander in the woods and talk to god , both of which had little appeal i 'd tried it once in college when an exceptionally gorgeous girl of a nordic type suggested a trip up pikes peak in colorado as something of a first date \( that sort of squeakyclean approach was popular at that time and place , a phase i hope has passed for those still dating in colorado \) our romance floundered as we slogged through deep snow on heavy skis , and i quickly progressed from mere gasping to throwing up while she kept demanding , what s wrong with you \? all this changed when i discovered track skiing nordic racing it happened in my late 20s when i was living in switzerland , where my wife was teaching i coached the school s rugby team , but it would be a charitable understatement to say that i had a lot of time on my hands one of the faculty members had raced crosscountry at middlebury , and he convinced me to tag along to a nearby ski area for a training session with the wellpracticed efficiency of a racer , my friend quickly stripped down to a lycra suit and bolted off on his borrowed racing skis , i tried to follow , still wearing my heavy warmups it did n't take long to leave my halfdigested breakfast in the snow \( again ! \) , but an hour or so later , i began to get a hint of the allure of nordic skiing it was the glide that seduced me gliding it was a transforming experience , as if suddenly sprouting wings and darting into the air , a complete rearranging of one s relationship with gravity sheer magic the sun glistened off the snow , groomed to perfect corduroy and bisected by miles of parallel tracks a train of skiers passed by wearing team warmups they were double poling in unison , reaching high with both hands and then thrusting their poles into the snow with tremendous force , their upper bodies bent toward the ground for an instant before their poles shot out behind them in a fluid stroke again and again , the same motions repeated , their bodies hurtling across the snow with amazing speed , all synchronized grace and power in that moment i did n't understand what i was seeing later i would study the mysteries of double poling with an intensity worthy of cracking the genetic code there was just the sense of a door opening to a hidden world i suddenly wanted to be part of a year later , my entire life revolved around crosscountry skiing any pretense of career or nonathletic ambition had been tossed aside for a slavish devotion to training , technique , equipment and racing actually , the races were just a small part of the equation it was the 20plus hours a week of skiing i craved , the two and sometimes three workouts a day , that blissful , purposeful exhaustion that made staying awake through dinner a legitimate challenge on its most basic level , mine had become a supremely hedonistic existence i lived in a world totally consumed with my body had i been spending 18 hours a day on the beach in search of the perfect tan , i would have been no more useless a member of society but i 'd discovered that having race ambitions gave a patina of respectability to what in fact was exceedingly selfindulgent behavior as i immersed myself in crosscountry skiing , i learned of a circuit of longdistance events called the worldloppet 10 races \( later it would expand \) , each in a different country , 8 in europe and 2 in north america in my crosscountry frenzy , i decided to do all of them in one eightweek season it was a silly idea , but of course that only increased the appeal to do all 10 races , i 'd have to spend backtoback weekends flying across the atlantic , racing on saturday , then catching an overnight flight to make the start of another race sunday morning no one had ever done it , but then again , no one had ever bothered to try there was a whimsical how many goldfish can you swallow quality to the project , and yet there was something about its being a series of races that made it seem almost important when friends or family asked what i was up to a polite way of wondering if i had a job yet i 'd assume a somber look and say , usually with a sigh , i'm training to do all the worldloppet races this usually got me a puzzled look no one having the remotest idea what the worldloppet was followed by a serious nod and the inevitable , how s it going \? i loved it i had played sports since i was 3 and had been on a million teams , but racing the worldloppet was the first time i began to define myself as an athlete even though i was mediocre on my best days , my obsession with crosscountry skiing gave me an entirely new perspective on life and self then , when the season was over , i told myself it was time to grow up and get serious about pursuits worthy of an adult reluctantly , i moved on , working as a writer and as a political consultant , which , if nothing else , served as an outlet for my violent tendencies but it did n't take long to realize that my taste of the endurance life had created a hunger that normal life did n't come close to satisfying endurance sports brought order to my days in an everconfusing and chaotic world in which truth seems elusive , a serious training session or race made it inescapable truth , often ugly and disappointing but honest , was impossible to deny but as you get older and life becomes more complicated , it s easy to start questioning the value of spending huge chunks of your days going in what amounts to glorified circles one morning you wake up and it suddenly hits you all the things you could be doing with an extra 15 to 25 hours a week it s an entirely rational epiphany and one that must , of course , be crushed immediately the key is to reassure yourself that what you are doing is perfectly normal and worthwhile and that it s all those other people who clearly do n't understand the true meaning of life i'm sure that s how jim jones or david koresh kept wavering disciples from leaving the cult what are you , crazy \? we have everything figured out here , drink some of this my personal garden of gethsemane came after an encounter between my bike and a cement truck about a month before an ironman race almost inevitably , i 'd fallen into a triathlon stage , a near mandatory passage for someone like me middleaged , unaccomplished at any specific sport , afflicted with an equipment fetish and in desperate need of new ways to underperform why be good at one sport when you can be unimpressive at three \? the crash left my bike unscathed but mangled my left shoulder , a problem not helped when i proceeded to race the ironman a few weeks later , tucking my bad arm into my wet suit for the 24 mile swim i convinced myself that this would do no harm and , given my miserable swimming skills , might even improve my time i finished the race , but the surgeon who subsequently repaired my shoulder threatened to commit me to a psychiatric unit if i did n't give up the long and hard stuff for the foreseeable future it was all very depressing when you 've depended on silly physical challenges as the organizing principle of your life , it s terribly disorienting to watch it slip away it s like the devout learning that all masses have been canceled i told myself this was a sign from some higher power to stop the insanity but then i met bob breedlove i was in the arizona desert at a winter cycling camp miserable about not being able to ski with my bum shoulder , i 'd signed up for a week of riding i had no particular aspiration or goal and promised myself that i would stick to my new regimen of moderation that first day , while most of us were struggling through the hot and windy miles , one guy kept riding , smiling and waving , easily doubling everyone else s distance it was highly annoying though not a big fellow , his muscles bulged out of ragged shorts and a jersey with hackedoff sleeves it was as if a smaller version of the incredible hulk had taken up cycling his hands were covered in strange dayglo orange gloves clearly one of those rain man nut jobs who rides his bike too much because he ca n't deal with life that night there was a lecture by a legendary ultradistance rider and physician whom i 'd never met but had heard about for years in walked the hulk with the orange gloves i'm bob breedlove , he said the room of riders burst into applause , like an apple convention greeting steve jobs bob gave a goofy , embarrassed grin i like to ride bikes we rode together every day , and by the end of the week , bob had pushed me off the longdistancecycling cliff bob breedlove was a star of an event known as raam the race across america a yearly phenomenon that compels a selfselecting group of fanatics to meet on the west coast and ride like hell across the country , arriving at the atlantic in about 10 days ten days even to someone like me , who wasted countless hours finding different ways to get tired , the raam riders seemed to be a species apart but bob a renowned orthopedic surgeon , father of four , deacon of his church radiated a glorious normalcy while still operating from the assumption that if you were n't spending huge amounts of time expanding your limits , there was something egregiously out of kilter in your life on one of our first rides , i 'd asked what had lured him to a race in which you ride your bike from coast to coast he 'd shrugged in his selfdeprecating way and said , i wanted to know what it felt like the last day so there it was of course the next summer bob and i were riding a tandem bike together in parisbrestparis , a 1 , 200kilometer event held every four years in france bob had ridden pbp many times and , for reasons that baffled me , loved to do it on a tandem i 'd never been on a tandem and always thought it was one of those regrettable inventions that gave couples who did n't really like each other a chance to pretend they did entrance to the race requires completion of a series of long qualifying rides , and bob had been working through them with a partner from his hometown of des moines after their final 600kilometer ride , bob called me up my tandem partner says he does n't want to do pbp , he announced in a perplexed sort of tone i do n't really get it i mean , he wanted to sleep on the 600k i said fine , we 'd sleep some i pointed out that this was not entirely unreasonable for an event that took 24 to 30 hours of hard riding bob begrudgingly agreed , though it was clear he thought sleeping at all on a ride that short was ridiculous i asked if his partner had any problems on the ride not really , bob said he had some trouble with food and was throwing up , but no real problems an image flashed through my mind of some poor guy trapped on the back of bob s tandem , vomiting and nodding asleep while bob powered through the iowa night he got off the bike at the end , bob continued , and said he never wanted to ride again imagine that so that means you have to ride with me i had already qualified for pbp on a real bike and explained to bob that i hated even the idea of tandems but of course i knew i 'd accept it takes a lot of practice for a tandem pair to find a rhythm that overcomes the drag of double weight on one bike bob had won raam twice with a tandem partner and set a blistering pace at parisbrestparis we 'd agreed that practice was essential , but naturally it never happened how do you get on this thing \? i asked in paris when bob rolled out his shiny new handmade tandem there was a long pause followed by something of a shudder when bob and his support crew realized i was n't joking well , we do n't need to worry about a lot of people drafting off us , bob said after our first of only two practice spins why s that \? i asked we 're too slow we started at dawn with 4 , 000 other riders in a mad sort of jailbreak , hurtling through gorgeous french countryside where it seemed that the internal combustion fad had never caught on our plan was to sleep twice a day in threehour stints we 'd be met at each stop by bob s fourperson crew family and friends who had helped him on his many crosscountry rides for a strictly amateur event in which the winner and the lastplace finisher get exactly the same prize which is to say , nothing having a support staff that could solve any problem was a bit like entering a soapbox derby with a nascar pit crew we were about 10 hours into it , working through the near constant climbs , when bob announced almost gleefully this is really a terrible course for a tandem it s all hills as we rode , bob kept pushing harder and harder , as if eager to reach the point when muscles surrender and the long battle begins between exhaustion and will now it starts to get fun , he exulted it was dawn of the second day , and all around us cyclists were sleeping on the ground next to their bikes two riders were leaning upright against a telephone pole , still on their bikes , sound asleep at the last rest stop before the finish , i was wandering around in a daze , envying everyone who was eating the real food like pasta that the organizers provided bob s rule , enforced rigorously by his crew , was to stick to an allliquid diet to avoid the intestinal issues that felled so many riders we had consumed vast quantities of something called spizz , which bob relied on for all his raam crossings but now i found myself wanting solid food in the worst way , and as i was standing in the corner , a few delicious bites into a huge plate of linguine , bob s sisterinlaw , lajean breedlove , caught me she took my plate , put her face right up to mine , grasped me by both shoulders and shook me , saying stuart , you 're almost finished just stay on the bike ! vince lombardi could not have been more compelling or terrifying i all but ran to the bike , where bob was waiting , looking fresh as ever it s good you did n't argue , he said , as we pulled away that can get messy two years later , bob was killed while racing raam , struck by a 15yearold unlicensed driver on a lonely stretch of colorado highway when bob had proclaimed that the fun really started on that second day of pbp , i 'd laughed and told him he was nuts , but of course i knew what he meant fun is what happens when you enter that zone where the ordinary is suspended and the normal rules of time and space are strikingly rearranged ask anyone who runs a marathon about the difference between those first miles the ordinary ones and the last few , when each stride requires the effort of 10 earlier ones that s the fun zone , when minutes can seem like hours or , just as capriciously , hours can zoom by in a trancelike state it s not why most of us take on absurd endurance endeavors , but i doubt we would keep coming back without those moments it s a sweaty sort of transcendence at a certain point , as the clich goes , all endurance activities are more mental than physical if you get your mind right , you can probably succeed that s what i was trying to explain to my pal nigel high in the french alps last summer as we slowly forced our bikes up the stunning climb known as the col du galibier we were riding la marmotte a swooping , looped course that covered almost 17 , 000 feet of climbing over some of the most notorious ascents of the alps it was part of a circuit of long , hard rides that is known in europe as cyclo sportive la marmotte was billed as arguably the toughest oneday amateur cycling event in the world , and if it was n't , god knows i never hope to ride the one that tops it at first light , i joined 8 , 000 other cyclists riding to the start at the base of l'alpe d'huez , the most famous climb in the tour de france it was a scene that resembled the hometown parades of soldiers marching to war everyone clean and well fed , victory assured , glory assumed we filled the village streets of bourg d'oisans , packed bike to bike a loud mechanical sound broke the quiet , thousands of bike shoe cleats clicking into pedals the great snake of riders in front of me started to move , though i never heard a start pistol we went slowly in the flats of the valley , no one appeared to be riding hard everyone was holding back , waiting various bike clubs gathered , wearing matching jerseys it was a perfect morning clear , not too warm , the peaks ahead sparkling in the early sun this was going to be easy i accelerated toward the front in every group i passed , some wise soul glanced my way with a look somewhere between disdain and pity i hope sometime before i die not to be seized by an overwhelming urge to quit as soon as a race requires real effort it happens to me every time , and it happened to me at la marmotte from the valley we turned on to the col du glandon , and the road suddenly shot skyward all around me smaller guys and women \( i 'd long ago given up the notion that i could hang with the fast women in any sport \) shot forward i had worked hard to stay lean , and my body fat was around 8 percent , which was n't horrible , but i still weighed just under 200 pounds i once heard about a professional basketball player who showed up at an early season practice 10 pounds overweight , and when he scoffed that it did n't matter , his coach tied a 10pound ham around his waist he lost the weight compared with the riders gliding past me , i was lugging a lot of ham up this alp i looked at my watch we 'd been riding about 45 minutes as the sweat began to pour off me and my heart rate accelerated , i was n't sure i could keep it up for a moment i let myself focus on the horribly unfair reality that it would probably take me 11plus hours to get to the finish at the top of l'alpe d'huez if there had n't been thousands of riders behind me , i would have made a uturn and looked for a nice place to have breakfast without the innate human capacity for selfdeception , these events would be impossible you swear to yourself that it will get easier oddly , it usually does , or the body adjusts and it seems easier after about three brutal miles , the glandon dips for about a mile , giving you hope that the entire day wo n't be spent climbing to the moon , then resumes at a slightly less horrible grade i 've learned it s rarely a good idea to allow yourself to look upward on long climbs unfortunately , the famous climbs of the alps are usually lined with signs detailing the remaining distance to the summit and the grade of the next kilometer more often than not , i glance away , as if avoiding the sight of some particularly gruesome accident do n't tell me i do n't want to know so , head down and grinding away , i almost ran into the crowd of riders stopped on the road just beyond the summit of the glandon there was a nasty crash on the descent , and they 're stopping everybody from riding down , a dutch rider told me in the distance i could hear the rescue helicopter how bad \? i asked he shrugged i think several guys died several \? dead \? that s impossible , i blurted it s shameful but true that of all the thoughts bouncing around in my head how long are we going to be here \? will they deduct this from our official times \? what if they cancel the race \? \( the latter eliciting more hope than disappointment \) i do n't think i spent more than a nanosecond worrying about the crashed riders had i passed them lying bleeding on the road , i'm sure i would have stopped really , i am we milled around , and gradually i began to get as restless as the other riders , who had been trapped on the top for almost an hour when they finally let us proceed in waves of fives , i flew down the mountain , focused only on the clock , calculating how much time i had lost , swooping around the tight corners in a near frenzy it s strange how that works yes , someone might have died , but there s this ticking clock to beat i had to get to the base of l'alpe d'huez by the 6 pm cutoff beyond that time , riders were n't allowed to continue up to the finish the panic of lost time got me up the relatively mild col du t l graphe , but then there was the galibier the tour de france ranks climbs for difficulty , and this one was hors cat gorie beyond classification by the time nigel and i hooked up , riders were starting to crack for a sport that has an aura of gentleness and grace children ride bikes , grandmothers ride bikes the violence of race language is telling riders do n't slow down , they crack or blow up cocky riders promise to rip the legs off the competition it s an acknowledgment of the true nature of the sport unrelenting and cruel this is when the fun starts , i said , but coming from me , bob breedlove s call to arms sounded like an asthmatic s gasp for air nigel grunted the galibier is one of those climbs that toy with you just when you think it ca n't get worse , it does a lot worse the final two kilometers is perilously steep , twisting and turning , making it impossible to tell how much farther you have to go the air is so thin it s like trying to breathe through a pillow at the top , riders were sprawled out everywhere , despite the sudden wind and sharp cold nigel wanted to rest , too , but i knew that stopping would only make us more tired i checked my watch it was 4 40 , and l'alpe d'huez was more than 25 miles away i said we go now i outweighed nigel by at least 30 pounds , and at last this was an advantage stay on my wheel , i said , handing him a bunch of endurolyte pills , to ward off leg cramps , and a handful of gel packets many europeans still take a perverse pride in eating the same stuff that eddy merckx downed 35 years ago at the tour de france little sandwiches and mushy bananas eat this , i ordered we dropped from the summit , nigel locked behind me as my weight propelled us past lighter riders thank you , newton i vaguely remembered reading about some tunnels on the galibier but was totally unprepared when we rounded a bend and plunged into total darkness curses and shouts bounced off the tunnel walls i had no idea who was ahead of me or to the side i started to laugh giddily , trying to pull my sunglasses off my nose we dropped through 10 more tunnels on the descent , though they became easier as we got used to them to my shock , i felt something close to strong , using different muscles on the descent and the rolling flats than the long day of climbing had demanded then we hit a stretch of uphill , and i felt the energy shoot out of me like air from a torn balloon when the angle of the descent relaxed , nigel powered ahead and we traded off , taking turns in front , trying desperately to keep up our speed i glanced at my heart rate monitor and shuddered it was way over 160 beats per minute , pure redline at 5 55 pm , we arrived at the check point at the base of l'alpe d'huez for a moment , a short moment , it was exhilarating and we pounded each other on the back we noticed a line of riders removing their timing chips , and it dawned on us that they were giving up nigel and i both found it offensive , a useful emotion at a time when any sort of motivation was desperately needed you ready \? nigel asked , a dead look in his eye let s get the hell out of here we started up the first of the switchbacks , each one marked with a sign commemorating a previous winner of the l'alpe d'huez stage of the tour de france this is going to be easy , nigel rasped we passed a rider , bent over beside his bike , retching in a spasm of dry heaves piece of cake , i agreed we pedaled on slowly

in a sports world without cable , espn , sportstalk radio stations or the 24hour news cycle , hank aaron hit his 715th home run the only stations that mattered were numbered 2 to 13 , and on nbc stations on the night of april 8 , 1974 , curt gowdy said there s a long drive ball s hit deep deep it is gone ! he did it he did it henry aaron is the alltime home run leader nbc sports made a request to major league baseball to carry the monday night game after aaron smacked his 714th home run four days earlier in cincinnati and then loaded up its booth with gowdy , joe garagiola and tony kubek it was a crapshoot and expensive , but we were bound and determined to do it , said chet simmons , who was a vice president of nbc sports at the time kubek recalled yesterday that aaron , with whom he played charity basketball games in milwaukee in the offseason , performed that night with a kind of class and joie de vivre that was routine for him for nbc , there were more than the usual number of cameras , but replays of the home run showed only three angles the lenses were n't as sharp as today s and closeups of tense moments were rare the graphics were crude , like the oddlooking 715 hr that accompanied aaron s circuit of the bases as aaron circled the bases , two fans patted him on the back , but none of the announcers said a word , despite the possibility that aaron might be attacked and not congratulated even back then our policy was not to acknowledge when somebody ran on to the field , said mike weisman , a production assistant at that time who later produced baseball at nbc and fox minutes after aaron crossed home plate , he held aloft the ball he hit \( caught in the bullpen by reliever tom house \) , a stark contrast to the melee in the stands in which matt murphy retrieved the ball clubbed by for home run no 756 nbc s gamble paid off with a 223 rating and a 36 share , meaning 147 million households watched some part of the broadcast the rating more than doubled what nbc s saturday afternoon games would get that season move ahead 33 years and 4 months to bonds s recordbreaking home run , which was carried nationally on espn2 the game generated a 11 rating , with 995 , 000 households and an average of 13 million viewers that aaron s home run lured nearly 15 times more households than bonds s is partly explained by the difference in tv eras broadcast network programs do n't get anywhere near the ratings they did before the rise of cable , vcrs , dvds and other technologies that offer viewing alternatives still , the aaronbonds rating chasm tells other stories aaron was widely admired \( as well as reviled by racists \) for his modesty and skills , but bonds evokes apathy and disdain outside of his comfort zone in san francisco no cloud of legal or chemical suspicion hung over aaron still , even that s not a full explanation fans knew on tuesday that if they missed bonds breaking aaron s record , they could see the moment replayed on espn s overnight sportscenter , regional sports networks programs , local and national morning shows , their cellphones and the internet the late starting time surely hurt viewership this was history , but america sought other diversions or sleep the new york market drew a slim 10 rating , los angeles a 12 even in the bonds fortress of acceptance in san francisco , fsn bay area s 775 rating \( 184 , 729 homes \) was decidedly unspectacular the numbers do n't lie , said curt gowdy jr , the executive producer of sny , who recalled how his father placed the aaron game alongside calling world series and allstar games as one of his favorites nobody cared if a ratings comparison between 1974 and 2007 is a stretch , how about one from 1998 \? when fox televised s 62nd home run , 20 million viewers watched , five times its baseball average that season espn2 s rating for the eight games it added to follow bonds to the record was only a smidgen above the four latenight games it carried in all of 2006 i watched his first atbat and did n't want to sit all night , said simmons , who ran espn after leaving nbc running through my head was his legitimacy it is worth imagining how aaron would have reacted if the current media hothouse existed when he chased ruth he was 38 or 39 at the time with a certain amount of maturity , said john walsh , espn s executive editor there s a good chance he would have handled it well but i do n't think anybody can handle the volume that comes at you today would that frantic volume have juiced nbc s aaron rating \? walsh thinks so , but weisman said the threenetwork universe was so potent and baseball so influential that you did n't need further stoking for two or three years , it looked like he could catch ruth
on the politically playful side of things , a few pieces drew our amused attention , as a diversion from the heavyladen news of the day \( at least we smiled , however briefly \) first up is cq weekly s feature on minority leader john boehner s rest stop seems mr boehner s new office digs , which he inherited from nancy pelosi when she was minority leader , continue to be the , um , gothrough , sometimes even with a line forming , of congresswomen headed to the closest restroom the difference now that mrs pelosi has become speaker , of course , is that a man occupies the formerly friendly female passageway \( restrooms for women are in short supply in the capitol building as were women until recent times \) not that mr boehner or his staff have been unfriendly to the queue one congresswoman even complimented mr boehner s choice of decorating colors for his office in case you skipped the super bowl , you also missed one of its enduring or annual features , special television commercials \( remember the budweiser frogs \? \) this year , stuart elliott , the times s advertising columnist , reviews the lot and finds a spate of cartoonish violence in many that may reflect the nation at war \( he even refers to a prudential financial spot in which a rock what can a rock do \? sounds like , of course , iraq , perhaps unintentionally \) and sums it up this way it was as if madison avenue were channeling doc in west side story , the gentle owner of the candy store in the neighborhood that the two street gangs , the jets and sharks , fight over why do you kids live like there s a war on \? doc asks plaintively \( well , doc , this time , there is \) and back to politics , of course , because that s our jurisdiction remember last year when california governor arnold schwarzenegger was caught on his own tapes talking about the , uh , hot latina legislator \? well , the la times has obtained more of the governor s musings , none as controversial as last year he labels one lawmaker a very sick man , talks about another who only sees things through political glasses and adoringly prattles off production numbers of his beloved hummers while talking about environmental issues and gets in a jab at his wife , maria , who keeps fiddling with his speeches until he has to say enough , it s in the teleprompter already you can read it to see how these recorded conversations with aides clearly were not refined for the teleprompter and one last one in case you missed it , or in case you live inside the beltway , too , and feel inundated by the number of new blogs and new gossip columns , the times s mark leibovich inspected the navelgazing lands cape on saturday

havana these days , when eusebio leal spengler walks the streets of old havana , people treat him like a rock star ladies kiss him on the cheek and whisper that they love him children point at him he pumps the hand of a tour guide he knows and , on discovering the tourists are from ireland , he recommends that they visit the calle o 'reilly , named for an irishborn general in the spanish army who revamped the city s defenses in 1763 and married a cuban heiress ladies and gentlemen , there goes the man most responsible for the restoration of the buildings you see here , the guide tells his flock it is not an exaggeration over the past 40 years , mr leal , the official historian of havana , has pulled off a most unusual feat while much of s infrastructure has crumbled and its economy has limped along , he has rebuilt and refurbished more than 300 landmark buildings in old havana , from fortresses built in the colonial days to famous nightspots and hotels of the city s swinging era just before the cuban revolution the center of the city was once a dark warren of cobblestone streets , worn facades and decaying ruins now it has some streets that rival prague or paris for cleanliness and beauty tourists throng the plaza del catedral , with its 259yearold cathedral , and wander up calle obispo , a street lined with luxury shops , to the floridita , the plush bar where hemingway drank mojitos and daiquiris there were years when not everyone believed in this , mr leal said , as he walked up calle obispo and shook hands with wellwishers years when there was a lot of work , a lot of difficulties , but now it s easier , because now you can see all the people , how they support you , they give you a smile , some happiness , and this makes it possible to continue at least for a little while longer yet the renovation has only gone so far , and tens of thousands of people are still trapped in squalid buildings just blocks from the refurbished zones , giving rise to grumbling among some residents that the renovation amounts to a potemkin village for visitors they point out that few cubans can afford the 7 drinks at the floridita , and by law cubans cannot stay in the restored hotels , even if they could afford the rates of 150 a night the reconstruction does n't have anything to do with the state system we live in , said yadira amoros , a 30yearold single mother who was using a plumber s wrench to try to get water flowing to her dingy apartment a block from calle obispo none of this benefits us mr leal says the key to the renaissance of the old city has been a strategy of restoring old hotels , restaurants and historic sites to attract tourists , then using the revenue from tourism to finance more restoration in the 1990s , after the soviet union collapsed and cuba lost billions in subsidies , fidel castro gave mr leal s office extraordinary powers to collect taxes and reap the profits of tourism in the old center , through a stateowned company called habaguanex mr leal has plowed the profits back into the construction work , not only for hotels , but for schools and residences as well it s a law to try to save the patrimony rather than sell it , in the moment when the country was in a very profound crisis and all of us were looking for a way to eat , a way to get to work , he said as a result , the spanish town founded in 1519 around a deep harbor has come back to life , along with a treasure trove of buildings in the baroque and neoclassical styles the 300 renovated buildings represent about a third of the structures in the 15squaremile center marked by the old city walls the united nations has praised mr leal s development model and named the zone a world heritage site among the hotels are the ambos mundos , where hemingway used to write in a corner room , and the santa isabel , a small colonial inn favored by former president jimmy carter and jack nicholson everywhere there are construction crews gutting buildings and rebuilding the interiors the sounds of jackhammers mix with the sounds of traditional cuban combos playing son and salsa hits for tourists more than 220 buildings are being refurbished one project under way is the restoration of sloppy joe s bar and the hotel above , once a fixture in downtown havana for journalists , writers , artists and other hangerson among the intelligentsia just a half block from the bodeguita del medio , another famous eatery favored by hemingway that is constantly mobbed with tourists , cubans troop into a sparsely stocked government store to get their monthly rations of beans , powdered milk , cigarettes and soap yeisi rodriguez , a nurse who grew up in the neighborhood , said the renovations had certainly improved the atmosphere yet she was still living in a partitioned area of her father s apartment with her husband and a 3yearold toddler together they get by on state rations and about 20 in salary she said she could not afford to shop at the stores along calle obispo where the tourists go where the shops are , it is much more beautiful than it used to be , she said but i cannot buy there it s difficult they are always fixing something , but what are we going to do with this amount of money \? mr leal is acutely aware that much of the population has yet to benefit from the renovation it pains me to see every day the border that divides what has been restored and what remains to be restored , and every day it is more urgent and harder , and it pains me a lot that many people still cannot receive any benefit , he said one reason for the continued poverty is that the workers in the hotels , museums , restaurants and hotels reap little of the tourist money all receive a state salary of 10 to 20 a month in cuban pesos plus a bonus of 12 in hard currency , but most of the profits from the businesses go to the renovation efforts those workers are the lucky ones others hold down jobs and receive a salary only in cuban pesos even with subsidized food and free health care and education , cubans complain that they cannot make ends meet and that they must resort to selling stolen goods or running confidence schemes aimed at tourists everyone has to do something , said one man , who ran a stateowned grocery store for a 12 salary i sell cigars
gaza city the events in gaza over the last few days have been described in the west as a coup in essence , they have been the opposite eighteen months ago , our hamas party won the palestinian parliamentary elections and entered office under prime minister ismail haniya but never received the handover of real power from fatah , the losing party the palestinian president , mahmoud abbas , has now tried to replace the winning hamas government with one of his own , returning fatah to power while many of our elected members of parliament languish in israeli jails that is the real coup from the day hamas won the general elections in 2006 it offered fatah the chance of joining forces and forming a unity government it tried to engage the international community to explain its platform for peace it has consistently offered a 10year ceasefire with the israelis to try to create an atmosphere of calm in which we resolve our differences hamas even adhered to a unilateral ceasefire for 18 months in an effort to normalize the situation on the ground none of these points appear to have been recognized in the press coverage of the last few days nor has it been evident to many people in the west that the civil unrest in gaza and the west bank has been precipitated by the american and israeli policy of arming elements of the fatah opposition who want to attack hamas and force us from office for 18 months we have tried to find ways to coexist with fatah , entering into a unity government , even conceding key positions in the cabinet to their and international demands , negotiating up until the last moment to try to provide security for all of our people on the streets of gaza sadly , it became apparent that not all officials from fatah were negotiating in good faith there were attempts on mr haniya s life last week , and eventually we were forced into trying to take control of a very dangerous situation in order to provide political stability and establish law and order the streets of gaza are now calm for the first time in a very long time we have begun disarming some of the drug dealers and the armed gangs and we hope to restore a sense of security and safety to the citizens of gaza we want to get children back to school , get basic services functioning again , and provide longterm economic gains for our people our stated aim when we won the election was to effect reform , end corruption and bring economic prosperity to our people our sole focus is palestinian rights and good governance we now hope to create a climate of peace and tranquillity within our community that will pave the way for an end to internal strife and bring about the release of the british journalist alan johnston , whose kidnapping in march by nonhamas members is a stain on the reputation of the palestinian people we reject attempts to divide palestine into two parts and to pass hamas off as an extreme and dangerous force we continue to believe that there is still a chance to establish a longterm truce but this will not happen unless the international community fully engages with hamas any further attempts to marginalize us , starve our people into submission or attack us militarily will prove that the united states and israeli governments are not genuinely interested in seeing an end to the violence dispassionate observers over the next few weeks will be able to make up their own minds as to each side s true intentions
las vegas , aug 2 the morning after a gunman opened fire inside the new yorknew york hotelcasino a month ago , sylvia cunningham , a tourist from dallas , received two text messages from her mother urging her to cut short her annual sixday trip to las vegas she and her fianc ignored that advice , but the shooting made her wonder how well the city was prepared to prevent a terrorist attack it did dawn on me after my mom bugged me , but vegas is probably a pretty easy place for a psycho to do damage , said ms cunningham , a 27yearold legal secretary everybody comes and goes as they please who would know if that elvis impersonator were a suicide bomber \? casino and law enforcement officials say the las vegas strip is among the safest , most carefully monitored public gathering places in the world but the city , known internationally as a symbol of american hedonism , has long been considered a likely prime target of terrorists and two recent violent incidents the new yorknew york shooting and a deadly car bomb explosion at the luxor hotelcasino in may have gotten the attention not only of tourists but also of security experts we have not had an event here in las vegas the equivalent of the events of 9 11 or anything close to that , and that has n't been by accident , said bill young , a former sheriff here and now security chief for station casinos , owner of 10 casinos in the area with all that said , it s going to be very , very , very difficult to prevent lone criminals who have the intentions of harming themselves and others that was the case at new yorknew york shortly after midnight on july 6 steven f zegrean , 51 , of las vegas is charged with opening fire then with a semiautomatic handgun from a balcony overlooking the casino floor four people were wounded , none critically , before four tourists tackled him in the luxor explosion , on may 7 , the police have accused two men of leaving a homemade bomb in a coffee cup atop the car of a 24yearold restaurant employee who died in the blast the police say mr zegrean was attempting suicide , hoping that officers would kill him the bombing , they say , was motivated by a dispute over a woman las vegas was one of four cities cited by the fbi as having received specific credible threats that prompted heightened security on new year s eve in 2003 , and some strip resorts were recorded on videos found in the possession of two men who earlier that year were convicted of being part of a detroit terror cell \( the convictions were later overturned on the ground that prosecutors had withheld evidence from the defense \) in addition , several of the sept 11 hijackers visited las vegas before their attacks for what the fbi believes were planning sessions the strip is famous for its video surveillance of nearly every public inch of casinoresorts , scrutiny to which mr young points as a deterrent for any criminal who does not wish to be caught in addition , more than 6 , 000 private security personnel supplement and train with the police force , said kathleen suey , deputy chief in charge of the police department s homeland security division still , more than 40 million tourists visit the city each year , and there s really no way of screening that many people without greatly limiting access , said christopher e mcgoey , a security consultant who has advised several las vegas casinos it s a vacation place , mr mcgoey said people do n't want to be walking around with passports or going through metal detectors or screenings it s always going to be a relatively soft target in the new yorknew york case , mr zegrean had paced the indoor balcony for hours wearing a trench coat before the shooting one of his tacklers , justin lampert , a 24yearold iraq war veteran from north dakota , was surprised that it took tourists to avert a massacre you would 've thought some security guy would have seen him , since he was wearing a trench coat and it s 115 degrees outside , mr lampert said i would expect that to stand out in somebody s mind they do need to spruce up security but if they do that , they 'll probably lose some of the income from people who wo n't come because of the hassles las vegas resorts have been leaders in adopting some new security technology , said alan feldman , senior vice president of mgm mirage , owner of the luxor , new yorknew york and eight other strip properties while mr feldman would not discuss many of mgm s security initiatives , for fear of compromising them , he did note that the company was experimenting with a facialrecognition system that could someday spot people traveling with fake ids in addition , ms suey noted that the homeland security division would add 28 uniformed officers this fall the police do not disclose the division s total strength and that las vegas was one of just a dozen cities with an officer working full time at the department of homeland security s headquarters to relay information on terrorist chatter both recent events were good exercises for us , ms suey said when someone places a coffee cup on top of a car , she said , that s not something prior to this that would have caught our attention would it now \?

to the editor re britain to trim iraq force by 1 , 600 in coming months \( news article , feb 22 \) the announced withdrawal of up to 1 , 600 of the roughly 7 , 100 british troops , the smaller danish contingent and possibly the lithuanian contingent demonstrates that even foreign leaders who have been supportive of president bush s iraq war are no longer willing to accept his disastrous prosecution of it that this should happen at the very time when president bush is looking to rush additional united states troops into war as a way to salvage the situation should be seen as a repudiation of this administration s war strategy the fact that the united states continues to bear a disproportionate burden for this war in treasure and lives , and that none of the united states' traditional allies in the west or the middle east are willing to step up to do more , belies the administration s frequent claim that iraq is the central front of the war on terror shankar srinivasan saratoga , calif , feb 22 , 2007 to the editor perhaps the grandest iraqrelated deception propagated by the bush administration is that our troops are dying there to preserve freedom and our way of life the drawdown of britain s forces underscores the point that we are most certainly not engaged in the pivotal conflict of our time and if that s not evidence enough , consider that all the troops now committed to iraq by all other freedomloving countries in the world would not fill madison square garden until our leaders stop portraying this tragic debacle as something noble , we are doomed to remain mired in it indefinitely peter keating greenwich , conn , feb 22 , 2007 to the editor i was shocked to hear that prime minister tony blair has announced the withdrawal of british forces from iraq all i can say is that it s about time my fianc \? erved as an infantryman in iraq in 2005 he lost a few friends and a part of his humanity along the way whatever reasons mr blair may be giving for this decision , i think that he has finally come to realize that there can be no military victory in iraq why else would the british not move into anbar province or baghdad so that there does n't have to be a surge of united states forces \? what happened to the coalition of the willing that president bush spoke so highly of \? it is time that our own leaders realize what everyone else in the world already seems to know it is time to bring the troops home elizabeth frederick arlington , va , feb 22 , 2007 to the editor while the house and the senate struggle to hold even the weakest debate on iraq , britain s more open society seems to have concluded that it s time to leave could it be that we in the united states have let ourselves become so distorted and closeminded that we ca n't ever openly debate a divisive issue , simply because one side insists on being conclusive \? has n't this abuse of democratic principles gone on long enough \? william jolitz los gatos , calif , feb 22 , 2007 to the editor the bush administration is declaring the british withdrawal of troops from southern iraq a sign of success so the question arises if the british can have success \( with far fewer troops \) , why ca n't we \? michael walker bellport , ny , feb 22 , 2007 drawing \( drawing by felix sockwell \)
for the cosmetics heir , who drew global attention last year by acquiring a lustrous portrait by gustav klimt for 135 million , the exhibition opening today at the neue galerie is something of a love fest the show , gustav klimt the ronald s lauder and serge sabarsky collections , celebrates not only klimt and his findesi cle milieu in vienna , but mr lauder s fervent passion for acquiring art we knew this would be a major show for us because of the importance of gustav klimt , because we had great holdings , mr lauder , 63 , said during an interview at his office overlooking central park \( mr sabarsky , a europeanborn art dealer who helped found the neue galerie with mr lauder , died in 1996 \) but for some experts in holocaust restitution research , the show raises another issue related to mr lauder s trove he declines to issue documentation of his private collection for public scrutiny among the major collectors of vienna secession and german expressionist artworks between the two world wars were many prosperous european jews , who often had to surrender their art when they were deported by the nazis or fled abroad and mr lauder and mr sabarsky s collections are among the most prominent private holdings of such works in the united states at the same time mr lauder donates heavily to jewish causes and champions restitution to jewish heirs he is president of the , for example , and once oversaw its art recovery commission i find it strange because of who lauder is and who he has claimed to be in terms of his concern for those who suffered at the hands of the nazis , said ori soltes , president of the holocaust art restitution project i would think he would bend over backwards to at least be a shining light of provenance propriety many american collectors consider their private collections to be just that private but some restitution experts suggest that mr lauder s prominent role requires complete transparency , at least when it comes to art that may have changed hands in nazioccupied europe in a later interview at his office mr lauder said that over the years he had turned over various items in response to claims or as a result of his staff s provenance research but those were pieces that had records to substantiate the owners' claims , he said he mentioned a beautiful renaissance shield and an artwork by the russian artist orest adamovich kiprenskii he said that he had about a dozen employees devoted to his collection , and that their responsibilities include thoroughly researching the provenance of any piece he acquires asked by the new york times for an inventory of his german and austrian works and related provenance information , he declined to release such material it s my private collection , he said would it be ok for people to see what dresses you have in your closet \? every work of art i would say almost without exception in my collection has all been exhibited all have long records , he added i'm just as interested as anyone else to find the pieces that were stolen mr lauder said that by displaying his and mr sabarsky s klimt paintings and drawings at the neue galerie and arranging a show of their egon schiele works there in 2005 he was essentially opening the door to public scrutiny the museum is transparent , he said when you put a piece of work on the wall of a museum and say , this is it it s all there , ' i'm as open as i can be despite the new exhibition s title , none of the catalog entries for the klimts on view that are owned by mr lauder bear his name instead they say , private collection , new york mr sabarsky s klimts are listed as belonging to his estate jane kallir , owner of the galerie st tienne in manhattan , founded by her grandfather , otto kallir , who promoted schiele in the united states , said that mr lauder has been really pretty forthcoming about what he has it s not a question of some deep , dark secret people are hiding there s a dearth of conclusive information , she added there are some things that are n't known and perhaps will never be known e randol schoenberg , a los angeles lawyer who won restitution from the austrian state of five klimt paintings that belonged to the viennese blochbauer family , recently suggested that mr lauder s brother , leonard , might own a klimt painting that was taken from a claimant s grandmother \( leonard lauder has said that the grandmother never owned it , and that the claim is baseless \) of ronald lauder mr schoenberg said he s always been up front with me i 've never had any trouble with him at the same time mr schoenberg said that ronald lauder and neue galerie should provide more specific provenance information about their holdings since he s at the forefront of asking people to return that kind of property , it would make sense for him to do that , mr schoenberg said it would certainly set a good example if he were to make public his collection ray dowd , a lawyer representing heirs of fritz gr nbaum , a viennese art collector , said he had demanded that mr lauder hand over i love antitheses , a color drawing by schiele , to the family and three schiele works that had been displayed at the neue galerie we 've not gotten a substantive response , he said but through the neue galerie , mr lauder said that the claim was without merit there was nothing to it , he said this year mr dowd fought unsuccessfully in court to include mr lauder and the neue galerie as defendants in a classaction suit related to the gr nbaum claims the neue galerie , the jewel box of a museum that mr lauder founded in 2001 in a mansion at fifth avenue and 86th street , has posted some provenance information about its collection on its web site , if an online visitor types in the search term schiele , for example , links to five works pop up each entry lists previous owners of the work , but no acquisition dates mr soltes of the holocaust art restitution project said the neue galerie should furnish whatever dates it has you list the list of owners , but do you list the years of ownership \? he said and if there are holes in the years between 1925 and 1945 , that s already a red flag similarly , the 477page catalog for the new klimt exhibition lists provenances , but no indication of when any of the works changed hands , except for a mention of the 1938 nazi anschluss in the entry for a portrait that austria returned to maria altmann , a blochbauer heir , last year that was adele blochbauer i , which mr lauder then purchased from ms altmann for 135 million mr lauder said that most of the time there were no dates , particularly for drawings , which he said dealers often bought casually without keeping records the klimt show includes 8 paintings and 126 drawings tina walzer , a viennabased art historian who is a consultant in restitution cases , said , if you want to be as open as possible , you have to give full provenances , including any dates that are available most american museums are bound by a commitment made by the american association of museums to the presidential advisory commission on holocaust assets to post pertinent provenances online that agreement , which covers art acquired after 1933 and produced before 1946 , is intended to enable people to research american museum collections without having to travel to them museums have conformed in varying ways the museum of modern art lists titles and photographs for works in its collection that were sold or had a provenance gap in that period the metropolitan museum of art also provides a list of previous known owners and acquisition dates although the neue galerie lists previous owners , until this week it was not among the participating museums in the naziera provenance internet portal , a searchable online registry of objects in american museum collections that changed hands in continental europe during the nazi era in response to a query from the times , renee price , director of the neue galerie , said in an email message two weeks ago , now that the neue galerie has reached this stage , the museum can address the matter of participating in the naziera provenance internet portal yesterday she said in an email message , finally , the museum account with the naziera provenance internet portal has been set up it was through mr sabarsky that mr lauder was introduced to schiele and acquired a drawing , his first purchase as a young collector \( mr lauder likes to recount that he bought it with his bar mitzvah money and ultimately sold it for a schiele watercolor \) thus began a close relationship between the collectors that lasted 40 years we spoke every day , mr lauder said we discussed art we discussed austria and life we both had the same passion for collecting , he continued collecting is almost like a sickness he and i both had the same addictions mr lauder s devotion to his collection comes through vividly as he shows visitors around his midtown office entire rooms there are devoted to large spiral notebooks tracking his holdings and to items he has recently acquired a set of silverware , antique boxes , vintage drinking glasses a bare space on one wall is where one of his favorite klimts hung until recently lady with feather hat he lent it for the exhibition , and it will clearly be difficult for him to live without it for eight months \( the show is scheduled to close on june 30 \) the whole neue galerie is personal , he said what makes the gallery so personal is it was put together by two people who had a certain love were anyone to make a legitimate claim to any of the art he owns , mr lauder said he would gladly return it not only am i not trying to hide anything , it s just the opposite , he said it would be better for me if i had something stolen to give it back it s something i desperately want to do

cuban music can withstand endless revisions , and the singersongwriter jose conde is taking his turn , as he suggested at joe s pub on tuesday night born in miami to cuban parents , mr conde has been working in new york for the last 10 years , slowly formulating a kind of afrocuban music with an enlarged frame it now brings together son , guajira , guaracha with new orleans funk , nigerian afrobeat , south american cumbia , james brown rhythms , haitian compas , brazilian afoxe , new york city boogaloo and even jamband stuff predicated on electric guitars as much as hand drums his band , ola fresca , is n't the only one making these connections , but that does n't matter these elements are already historically joined , and this project almost writes itself that s a lot of dance rhythm in one band , but there s a folkish element too mr conde s vocal understatement unusual for the singer of a latin dance band and his emphasis on songs with characters , wordplay and some mild social ideas on tuesday mr conde and his band ran through songs from a new record , \( r \) evolucion \( pipiki mr bongo \) , which comes out next week none of it was pensive , sitandthink music , but the show had the irresolute feeling of the music being neither completely contemplative nor kinetic songs like ritmo y sabor , a sonfunk alloy , and pititi y titi , a compasson sung in french , were pointing the way toward release they just did n't quite get there but when the band found its stride and played a little harder , it all made sense , this balance between holding back and letting go some of the band s excellent musicians made it happen including the cuban percussionists roman diaz and marvin diz the keyboardist pablo vergara , who played jagged , powerful improvisations over cuban rhythm patterns the trombonist rafi malkiel , who soloed with loud confidence and the electric guitarist juancho herrera , who played passages of ambient noise as well as driving grooves the band soon plays at the living room , a club associated more with cogitating than dancing there mr conde will have to try to retain his cool , but make the music explode with its inherent rhythm
bangkok , aug 7 it is the pink armband of shame for wayward police officers , as cute as can be with a hello kitty face and a pair of linked hearts no matter how many ribbons for valor a thai officer may wear , if he parks in the wrong place , or shows up late for work , or is seen dropping a bit of litter on the sidewalk , he can be ordered to wear the insignia simple warnings no longer work , said pongpat chayaphan , acting chief of the crime suppression division in bangkok , who instituted the new humiliation this week this new twist is expected to make them feel guilt and shame and prevent them from repeating the offense , no matter how minor , he said kitty is a cute icon for young girls it s not something macho police officers want covering their biceps ten of the armbands have been prepared , but so far none have actually been issued , according to an officer who declined to give his name while discussing this sensitive topic after this policy came out , the police are scared , the officer said it will be very embarrassing to walk around with hello kitty on your arm it is a step down from the crime suppression division s official motto when you have no one to turn to , come to us mr pongpat , who has trained with the american secret service and the canadian police , was promoted to head the division three months ago and says he wants to modernize his force , even though we lack the highest technology , equipment and mindset an aide , maj weeraprach wonrat , said the chief was a believer in behavioral science and in the broken window theory , which holds that small changes can have large effects pink armbands for misdemeanors are a start stronger measures could be next for corruption and extrajudicial killings an early experiment using armbands was not encouraging mr pongpat first tried using plaid ones but instead of feeling shame , major weeraprach said , the officers took them home as souvenirs the force still has only one of the ten it originally issued after that misfire , police commanders met again to consider strategy , he said , and agreed that hello kitty might work where tartan had failed so far , he said , there is no fallback plan the department has not yet decided what punishment to impose if officers make off with their pink armbands as well
boston , oct 20 the were desperate to win and keep their season from vanishing , desperate for a hero it could have been , who has dominated in elimination games it could have been david ortiz or manny ram rez , who have thrived in october , too it could have been anyone it was anyone j d drew was boston s anyone saturday night , a surprising hero drew has been a disappointment here , a 70 million free agent whose performance in his first year with the red sox frustrated demanding fans drew did not hit enough and rarely showed emotion , two qualities that did not endear him to the denizens at fenway park but on a warm night that had the potential to be boston s last night of baseball in 2007 , drew overshadowed whatever happened in the last 170 games by smashing a grand slam , driving in five runs and powering the red sox to a 122 victory against the cleveland indians the american league championship series is tied at 33 with game 7 scheduled for sunday night at fenway people are never going to forget about that , said ortiz , raving about what drew did hopefully , he keeps it like that now he knows how big it is to have him doing his thing drew s grand slam came against fausto carmona in the first inning and quickly allowed the red sox to exhale with schilling pitching even the older , notaspowerful schilling a fourrun lead was healthy enough in a game boston absolutely had to win and it was enough , as schilling motored through seven sturdy innings before 2004 , the red sox used to endure 1918 chants as a reminder of the last time they had won a world series now , the red sox can chant 2004 because they are one victory away from completing another comeback the red sox , who are trying to rally from a 31 series deficit , sprinted back from a 30 canyon against the yankees in the alcs three years ago that was also the last time schilling pitched in game 6 of an alcs , the memorable night when he excelled while blood from an ankle injury oozed into his sock there was no bloody sock this time there was just drew and schilling combining for the baseball equivalent of a brutal knockout , leaving the indians looking like a bloody mess schilling is 40 with a 137 earned run average in postseason games in which his team faced elimination he s just proven it , catcher jason varitek said once again , he gave us a quality start daisuke matsuzaka will try to help boston become the 11th team to win a playoff series after trailing , 31 , while jake westbrook will try to help guide the indians to their first world series since 1997 westbrook was better than matsuzaka , the 103 million import , in winning game 3 matsuzaka , who can be the pitching version of drew with a victory , said that his emotions were already focused on the game i do n't know if the term switched on' is the right term or the right way to describe , but i am all on for tomorrow , matsuzaka said since the red sox have pounded the indians , 193 , in the last two games and are playing at home , they would seemingly have the momentum but indians manager eric wedge dismissed that notion hey , it s going down to game 7 against the two teams that won more baseball games than anybody in the regular season , two teams that have beat up on each other a little bit over the course of the past week , and that s the way it should be , he said carmona , a 19game winner who looked so formidable against the yankees in the first round that reggie jackson called him unhittable , was hittable for the second straight start although carmona said he would be more aggressive than he was when he lasted four innings in game 2 , he was erratic again after dustin pedroia and kevin youkilis had infield singles in the first , carmona walked ortiz on a 32 pitch carmona flashed an unhittable pitch as he struck out ramirez with a 96mileanhour fastball that dived under ramirez s hands mike lowell s flyout to shallow right was the second out of the inning that left it up to drew to salvage boston s threat at that point , drew was batting a pedestrian 259 in the playoffs at that point , drew was 0 for 5 off carmona in his career at that point , there were surely fans who envisioned drew , who hit 270 with 11 homers this season , making the third out instead of challenging drew , carmona put himself in a dicey position by falling behind in the count , 31 carmona is a talented pitcher , but , with the bases loaded , everyone at fenway figured he would throw a fastball drew waited and got the fastball , a 94mph pitch that could not have been juicier , and lined it over the centerfield fence it was carmona s 28th pitch drew said that carmona had pitched him the same way in game 2 , so i knew what i was looking for drew s ball was hit hard , but not high , and it was no certainty that it would scale the fence when the ball landed in the camera well , drew pumped his fist and shouted carmona looked startled the red sox mobbed drew when he returned to the dugout one swing could never be worth 14 million , but drew s grand slam swing was priceless in that situation there , you could n't have asked for anything better , drew said worked out great schilling said that drew did not have the type of season drew could be proud of , but , with one grand slam in october , perceptions change that won the game , schilling said in a situation where he could have been easily pressing , and he did n't , and it was huge and exciting to see when ortiz was asked if drew s swing could help fans forget his erratic season , ortiz said that s what happens when you play here that s what s good about having the opportunity to go to the playoffs victor martinez homered off schilling in the second , slicing boston s lead to 41 and briefly quieting fenway schilling worked through another jam in the third the red sox scored six runs in the third , with drew singling in the first run , jacoby ellsbury driving in one in his first playoff start , julio lugo doubling in a pair , kevin youkilis singled in one more and the sixth run scoring on an error after that outburst , schilling coasted he allowed base runners in three of the next four innings , but the indians never came close to scaring him or boston when schilling completed the seventh , he received a standing ovation and waved his cap to the fans he gave up two runs and six hits , whiffed five and walked none those are the moments you never forget , he said saturday s victory came on the same date three years ago that the red sox stunned the yankees in game 7 to go to the world series that means that three years from sunday night , the red sox were still relishing their amazing victory the red sox want to party after a game 7 on sunday night again they just need a hero anyone will do
when his turn came to absorb the cheers after he was named the game s first star last night , forward martin straka skated a small circle on the madison square garden ice he raised his stick , lowered his eyes and disappeared into the tunnel as quickly as he could straka retreated from his moment in the sun , which came courtesy of a hat trick in the rangers' 32 victory over philadelphia like usual , straka was content to let his game do most of his talking and all of his boasting i have said many times , sometimes you play the same way the whole year and the puck goes in and sometimes it does n't , straka said when you have the confidence , maybe you have a little more luck of all of the rangers' big scorers , straka is by far the most unassuming he regularly draws praise from coach tom renney for his diligent work habits and unflappable demeanor it is impossible to tell after a game if straka has scored three goals or none he plays on a line next to the dynamic and charismatic jaromir jagr and michael nylander , a gourmet menu on which straka s personality makes him the peanut butter sandwich he is a genuine , sincere guy , a softspoken , humble man who comes to work , renney said he works awfully hard that hard work has produced 21 goals , the latest three fashioning his sixth career hat trick only brendan shanahan \( 23 \) has more goals for the rangers this season most of straka s success has come when renney stops tinkering with his usual line combinations for much of the rangers' recent sevengame losing streak , straka had been playing with shanahan on the second line , an attempt to spread the scoring around but late in a 20 loss to the islanders last week , renney reached back for the chemistry of the strakajagrnylander line and is now reaping the benefits the rangers \( 21174 \) are on a threegame winning streak , firmly lodged in second place in the atlantic division and giving teams like philadelphia nightmares about trying to stop their big three they 're a first line that is as formidable as there is in the league , shanahan said i think the big thing they have is puck control that s their best form of defense is having the puck on their stick straka opened the rangers' scoring early in the first , slipping free in front of the goal to fire a pass from nylander past goalie robert esche straka scored again with 14 minutes 31 seconds left in the second , this time when a shot by michal rozsival deflected off flyers defenseman joni pitkanen and bounced right to him the flyers scored on a power play early in the third and came tantalizingly close to scoring again when a shot by dimitry afanasenkov bounced from one post to the other behind rangers goalie henrik lundqvist an instant later , straka intercepted a flyers pass , tipped it to himself and skated off for a breakaway he faked esche and slid a backhand inside the right post with 13 06 left the game got interesting late thanks to a stomachdropping move by lundqvist , who corralled the puck and spotted the flyers' empty net with 21 seconds left lundqvist wound up to shoot , but instead hit flyers forward mike york in the chest york quickly fired the puck past lundqvist to make it a onegoal game on the bench , renney looked stricken yeah , where s the airtravel bag , he said lundqvist did not feel much better it was a bad decision , he said i definitely would n't have done that if it was a onegoal game fortunately for lundqvist , straka had already become the story not that straka wanted it that way he quickly credited his success to the outsized attention opponents pay to jagr , who routinely gets doubleteamed asked if that might change if he keeps scoring , straka let out a big laugh oh no , he said believe me it wo n't slap shots defenseman marek malik returned to the rangers' lineup after missing seven games with a groin injury philadelphia center peter forsberg missed the game with a groin injury , the latest in a series of woes that has limited forsberg to 27 games
, nov 20 the announced tuesday that it would decide whether the constitution grants individuals the right to keep guns in their homes for private use , plunging the justices headlong into a divisive and longrunning debate over how to interpret the second amendment s guarantee of the right of the people to keep and bear arms the court accepted a case on the district of columbia s 31yearold prohibition on the ownership of handguns in adding the case to its calendar , for argument in march with a decision most likely in june , the court not only raised the temperature of its current term but also inevitably injected the issue of gun control into the presidential campaign the federal appeals court here , breaking with the great majority of federal courts to have examined the issue over the decades , ruled last march that the second amendment right was an individual one , not tied to service in a militia , and that the district of columbia s categorical ban on handguns was therefore unconstitutional both the district of columbia government and the winning plaintiff , dick anthony heller , a security officer , urged the justices to review the decision mr heller , who carries a gun while on duty guarding the federal building that houses the administrative offices of the federal court system , wants to be able to keep his gun at home for selfdefense mr heller was one of six plaintiffs recruited by a wealthy libertarian lawyer , robert a levy , who created and financed the lawsuit for the purpose of getting a second amendment case before the supreme court the appeals court threw out the other five plaintiffs for lack of standing only mr heller had actually applied for permission to keep a gun at home and been rejected the supreme court last looked at the second amendment nearly 70 years ago in united states v miller , a 1939 decision that suggested , without explicitly deciding , that the right should be understood in connection with service in a militia the amendment states , a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed the justices chose their own wording for what they want to decide in the new case , district of columbia v heller , no 07290 the question they posed is whether the provisions of the statute violate the second amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any stateregulated militia , but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes the court s choice of words is almost never inadvertent , and its use of the phrase stateregulated militia was somewhat curious the district of columbia , of course , is not a state , and one of the arguments its lawyers are making in their appeal is that the second amendment simply does not apply to legislation enacted exclusively for the district of columbia for that matter , the supreme court has never ruled that the second amendment even applies to the states , as opposed to the federal government it has applied nearly all the other provisions of the bill of rights to the states , leaving the second amendment as the most prominent exception the justices evidently decided that this case was not the proper vehicle for exploring that issue , because as a nonstate , the district of columbia is not in a position to argue it one way or another because none of the justices now on the court have ever confronted a second amendment case , any prediction about how the court will rule is little more than pure speculation of the hundreds of gun regulations on the books in states and localities around the country , the district s ordinance is generally regarded as the strictest chicago comes the closest to it , banning the possession of handguns acquired since 1983 and requiring reregistration of older guns every two years new york city permits handgun ownership with a permit issued by the police department the district of columbia ordinance not only bans ownership of handguns , but also requires other guns that may be legally kept in the home , rifles and shotguns , to be disassembled or kept under a trigger lock the capital s newly empowered city council enacted the ordinance in 1976 as one of its first measures after receiving homerule authority from congress the court s order on tuesday indicated that it would review the handgun ban in light of the provision that permits , with restrictions , the other guns the opposing sides in the lawsuit presented very different views of how the various provisions interact to the plaintiffs , the restrictions on the conditions under which rifles and shotguns may be kept means that homeowners are denied the right to possess functional weapons for selfdefense to the district of columbia , the fact that these other guns are permitted shows that the ordinance is nuanced and sensitive to gun owners' needs it takes about one minute to disengage a trigger lock in any event , a supreme court decision that finds the district s ordinance unconstitutional would not necessarily invalidate other , more modest restrictions , like those that permit handgun ownership for those who pass a background check and obtain a license since the only claim in the case is that lawabiding people have the right to keep a gun at home , the court will not have occasion to address restrictions on carrying guns in fact , lawyers on both sides of the case agreed tuesday that a victory for the plaintiff in this case would amount to the opening chapter in an examination of the constitutionality of gun control rather than anything close to the final word this is just the beginning , said alan gura , the lead counsel for the plaintiff mr gura said in an interview that gun laws that make sense , like those requiring background checks , would survive the legal attack , which he said was limited to laws that do no good other than disarm lawabiding citizens whether the handgun ban has reduced crime in a city surrounded by less restrictive jurisdictions is a matter of heated dispute crime in the district of columbia has mirrored trends in the rest of the country , dropping quite sharply during the 1990s but now experiencing some increase in striking down the district s ordinance , the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said that an individualright interpretation of the second amendment would still permit reasonable regulations , but that a flat ban was not reasonable dennis a henigan , a lawyer at the brady center to prevent gun violence , which advocates strict gun control , said that if the justices agree with the appeals court , an important question for future cases will be what legal standard the court will eventually adopt for evaluating other gun regulations
rome , june 8 it was a sophisticated method of laundering , a prosecution witness testified on friday in a trial courtroom here private collectors would acquire looted artifacts and eventually donate them to museums , she said the witness , daniela rizzo , an italian archaeologist , specifically cited the owners of four american antiquities collections none are on trial here none have been legally charged with any wrongdoing nor do italian prosecutors contend that the collectors had evidence that certain objects had been looted yet the prosecutors have clearly adopted a strategy of calling attention to collectors , especially wellheeled americans , with the implicit message that every player in the global antiquities trade is within their sights the actual trial defendants are marion true , a former antiquities curator at the in los angeles , and robert hecht , an american dealer in classical artifacts both are charged with trafficking in objects that were illicitly excavated from italian soil dozens of witnesses have filed through the courtroom since the trial opened in november 2005 , but only this month did prosecutors fully turn their sights on american antiquities collectors in court testimony the tactic has infuriated defense lawyers , whose objections became so heated on friday that judge gustavo barbalinardo decided to suspend the proceedings until tempers cooled in her testimony ms rizzo said that the very rich private collectors built collections that included objects that were undoubtedly looted from italy she cited the texas oilmen nelson bunker hunt and william herbert hunt \( who sold their artifacts at auction in 1990 after their fortunes collapsed \) the new york diamond merchant maurice tempelsman the art philanthropist lawrence fleischman and his wife , barbara and the financier leon levy and his wife , shelby white objects from their collections went on display in major exhibitions , becoming known to the public and the scientific world , after which they ended up in museums , ms rizzo said it was a different , more sophisticated method of laundering artifacts defense lawyers for ms true and mr hecht repeatedly interrupted ms rizzo s testimony francesco isolabella , a lawyer for ms true , objected that it was beyond ms rizzo s mandate to come up with inductive or deductive theories mr isolabella said that the archaeologist was making evaluations that only a prosecutor can make she should stick to identifying etruscan vases , mr isolabella said because they are not on trial , none of the collectors are represented in the courtroom contacted through their offices , nelson bunker hunt and mr tempelsman declined to comment on the trial or to be interviewed through a spokesman , ms white declined to comment on the trial \( her husband died in 2003 \) in a telephone interview from new york , ms fleischman said it seems like anyone can accuse anyone of anything without any proof we collected for the pure joy of the object she declined to comment further on the trial but she said that she and her husband , who died in 1997 , never suspected that they might be buying anything less than legitimate ms fleishman , a former getty trustee , and her husband donated or sold more than 300 antiquities to the getty italy s culture ministry is demanding that the museum return a dozen of the fleischman objects it seems inevitable that as prosecutors began investigating the passage of objects from looted tombs in the italian countryside to american institutions , they would become interested in private donors , long the lifeblood of the world s museums a report this year by the association of art museum directors , which represents nearly 200 museums in the united states , canada and mexico , notes that more than 90 percent of the art collections held in public trust by american s art museums were donated by private individuals beyond altruism , the economic benefit for collectors in the united states is a tax deduction equal to the current market value of the object this deduction can save the donor 25 to 50 percent of the object s value , depending on what method is used in return , museums short of funds can aspire to toprate works of art there s every reason to think that a museum would bring an item it ca n't afford to the attention of a collector , hoping for a donation , said patty gerstenblith , a law professor at depaul university and president of the lawyers' committee for cultural heritage preservation at the same time , she said , it helps to distance the museum from a questionable piece there is less risk of public disapproval should a museum be forced to return a piece that arrived as a donation , she said for at least the past decade , though , peter c marzio , director of the museum of fine arts in houston and a past president of the association of art museum directors , said , both collectors and museums have been conducting diligent provenance inquiries on artifacts that change hands he cited an auction on thursday at sotheby s in new york where a 2 , 000yearold bronze statue of artemis sold for 286 million , a world record for sculpture and for an antiquity provenance is what is driving prices up , mr marzio said provenance is having enormous value the albrightknox art gallery in buffalo acquired the artemis from a manhattan dealer in 1953 , well before the adoption of a 1970 unesco convention governing traffic in cultural property during a courtroom break , mr hecht , the dealer on trial here , scoffed at the notion of a collector like ms white having an economic incentive for donating to a museum the last thing shelby levy white needs is a tax deduction , mr hecht said she really liked and learned about every piece she bought running parallel to the trial is the italian culture ministry s dogged effort to lay claim to what it contends are looted objects in american museums last year it negotiated the return of 21 antiquities from the metropolitan museum of art and 13 from the museum of fine arts , boston talks with the getty have faltered italy is seeking the return of 52 objects over all from that museum , among them a dozen donated by ms fleischman so far the getty has agreed to return 26 artifacts to italy , including 5 acquired from the fleischmans and three pieces purchased from mr tempelsman in an interview paolo ferri , the trial prosecutor , asserted that american collectors might one day find themselves at the defense table once a verdict is delivered in the trial of ms true and mr hecht , he said , i 'll draw my conclusions

as americans argue about how to bring the troops home from iraq , british forces are already partway out the door four years ago , there were some 30 , 000 british ground troops in southern iraq by the end of this summer , there will be 5 , 000 none will be based in urban areas those who remain will instead be quartered at an airbase outside basra rather than trying to calm iraq s civil war , their main mission will be training iraqis to take over security responsibilities , while doing limited counterinsurgency operations that closely follows the script some americans now advocate for american forces in iraq reduce the numbers and urban exposure but still maintain a significant presence for the next several years it s a tempting formula , reaping domestic political credit for withdrawal without acknowledging that the mission has failed if anyone outside the white house truly believes this can work that the united states can simply stay in iraq in reduced numbers , while ignoring the civil war and expecting iraqi forces to impose order the british experience demonstrates otherwise there simply are n't reliable , effective and impartial iraqi forces ready to keep the cities safe , nor are they likely to exist any time soon and insurgents are not going to stop attacking americans just because the americans announce that they 're out of the fight in basra after four years of british tutelage police forces are infiltrated by sectarian militias the british departure will cede huge areas to criminal gangs and rival shiite militias without iraqis capable of taking over , the phased drawdown of british troops has turned ugly the remaining british troops hunkered down in the city at basra palace are under fire from all directions those at the airbase are regularly bombarded and basra should be easier than baghdad most of the population is shiite , and neither al qaeda in mesopotamia nor other sunni insurgent groups have a significant presence elsewhere in iraq , where internal rivalries are overshadowed by the sunni insurgency , sectarian civil war and rampant ethnic cleansing , a reduced american force might find itself in an even worse predicament the clear lesson of the british experience is that going partway is not a realistic option the united states cannot walk away from the new international terrorist front it created in iraq it will need to keep sufficient forces and staging points in the region to strike effectively against terrorist sanctuaries there or a qaeda bid to hijack control of a strifetorn iraq but there should be no illusions about trying to continue the war on a reduced scale it is folly to expect a smaller american force to do in a short time what a much larger force could not do over a very long time that s exactly what the british are now trying to do and the results are painfully plain to see
islamabad , sitting in the sparsely furnished office of her missing husband , amina masood janjua counted the calls on a recent day from pakistanis who have suffered a fate similar to hers more and more are coming forward , she says , to report that their husbands , brothers or sons have disappeared under the rule of pakistan s president , gen pervez musharraf it used to be two cases every week , she said today , there were three the numbers are incredible i get cases when i'm driving i have three diaries full of names she and pakistani human rights groups say that those who are missing have disappeared into the hands of pakistan s military and intelligence services since 2001 the total could be more than 400 , they say while american intelligence officials say that general musharraf has not done enough to crack down on militants in the country , human rights groups here assert that pakistan s security services have been sweeping up civilians and holding them incommunicado without charges since 9 11 , when the government forged an alliance with the united states to fight terrorists they say the bush administration has pushed the government to arrest people who are overtly religious or show an interest in radical islamic thought most of the men who are reported missing wore full beards , a sign of religiosity the movement to free the missing men gathered momentum in october when pakistan s chief justice , iftikhar muhammad chaudhry , decided to take up the cases his boldness may have contributed to the decision by general musharraf to suspend him on march 9 but mr chaudhry s determination to challenge that decision by appealing to the supreme court and holding a series of rallies over the last few months has weakened the president and left other pakistanis less fearful of standing up to the government he has become the focus of a growing popular movement to restore civilian rule even as general musharraf also comes under increasing pressure from radical islamists that popular outpouring has given momentum to defense of human rights , a group founded by mrs janjua , and the nongovernmental human rights commission of pakistan , who are trying to locate and free the missing men every two weeks in crowded sessions of the supreme court here , judges listen to the pleadings of women demanding to know the whereabouts of their husbands and sons and brothers , who they believe are locked up in government jails and safe houses security officers , dressed in pressed khakis and black berets , are regularly dragged before the bench and asked to explain where the men known here as the disappeared are being held at least tell me whether my husband is alive , mrs janjua pleaded at a recent supreme court hearing here in islamabad the officers professed to have no inkling of the whereabouts of masood ahmed janjua , 45 , whose slightly smiling portrait mrs janjua has held aloft outside government buildings for nearly two years one mother , syeda nargis , a diminutive woman swathed in black , travels four hours by bus from lahore to the capital to attend the court hearings it is a year since she waited at the islamabad airport to greet her son upon his arrival from dubai he landed at 7 pm i stayed until 1 am , she recalled , a color poster of her son syed imran naqvi , 31 , dressed in a tartan shirt , blazer and trim beard , clutched in her hands they said , maybe he will come after two or three hours' now it is 12 months , and nothing has happened her son , a software engineer , was her main source of income , she said we spent so much money for him to be an engineer , not to go to jail , she said musharraf should tell us the reason , what is the problem \? asked specifically about the cases of the 400 , a senior pakistani government official said many of the people on the list had religious links with afghanistan and had joined militant organizations there the official , javed iqbal cheema , the director general of the national crisis management cell at the ministry of interior , said , specifically , that mr janjua was close to al qaeda and the taliban and was not in the pakistani government s custody mrs janjua denies that assertion , saying that her husband was close to tablighi jamaat , a large muslim organization involved in proselytizing whose membership includes former government officials that group is also active in britain , where some authorities contend that it serves as a conveyor belt for extremists some of those who have been released by the government have been tortured , and their experiences have been sparingly reported but for the most part they remain too afraid to describe publicly what was done to them , the leaders of the groups say about 60 of the detained have been released but as they have been freed others have been jailed , keeping the number of the missing at a fairly constant 400 since the beginning of the year , said mrs janjua and the secretary general of the human rights commission , iqbal haider the list of 400 does not include many more people , perhaps thousands , who have been arrested in baluchistan and kept secretly for supporting the separatist movement in that province , said mr haider , a former minister of justice in the government of benazir bhutto the most recent united states state department human rights report on pakistan said its human rights record remained poor , though that has not diminished the bush administration s support for the musharraf government among the methods of abuse used against people in custody , the report said , were beating , burning with cigarettes , whipping the soles of the feet , prolonged isolation , electric shock , denial of food or sleep , hanging upside down , use of electric shocks and forced spreading of the legs with bar fetters a former officer in the pakistani air force , khalid khawaja , 56 , who is well known for his good relations with a number of islamic radical groups , was released from the rawilipindi jail in late june after six months in custody mr khawaja , a force behind defense of human rights , said he was arrested and blindfolded in january , then shuffled around several prisons , including a new maximumsecurity one in faisalbad he was held in solitary confinement for long periods and denied medicine , he said his wife , shamama malik , turned up at every demonstration , and his son worked the phones to win his father s freedom the americans are getting all the people with religious motivation and taking them away , mr khawaja said angrily in an interview at his home the morning after his release shaukat aziz siddiqui , the lawyer who has led the effort in the supreme court for the defense of human rights , said the government had three laws , including the security of pakistan act , under which it could detain people for specific periods but none of them had been applied in the cases he was handling , he said even if some of the missing persons have some link with osama bin laden , mr siddiqui said , they have to be treated in accordance with the law so far , the supreme court seems to agree even with the chief justice s suspension , the other justices have not shied away from hearing the cases , though mrs janjua says she is convinced that mr chaudhry s determination to do so led to general musharraf s attempt to oust him he was very fatherly , she said , recalling a hearing on march 8 before mr chaudhry i was insisting hard i was in tears he said be comforted we are using every channel , and every person is going to be released , and we are going to continue the hearings until the last person is released' she added on march 8 , he was speaking like this the very next day , he was not in his chair

sometimes i think lee bontecou s industrious , disciplined career has unfolded in reverse her trajectory should have started with the giddy , broochlike , explodingeye sculptures seen in the final displays of her 2004 retrospective at the museum of modern art and the glowering blackandgray canvas reliefs that established her reputation in the early 1960s could easily be the deepening , crowning achievements of a life s work , like mozart s requiem or beethoven s ninth either way , the middle phase would be the efforts isolated in this exhibition the menacing fish and vigilant , thickstalked flowers made of vacuumformed transparent plastic using a new technique that she helped perfect , ms bontecou turned to these works in the late 1960s after regular visits to the country renewed her fascination with nature they were exhibited in 1971 at the leo castelli gallery the unenthusiastic critical response is often cited as one reason ms bontecou withdrew from the new york art world to live full time in western pennsylvania the plastic fish and flowers signal a retreat from the power and unity of the groundbreaking reliefs and a growing involvement with material , technique and details for their own sake rather than as means to a larger , more complex statement sure , they can have a nice theatrical effect at times the seethrough , oftensuspended forms create an unsettling aqueous wonderland , inhabited by crustaceous creatures that seem both physically correct and exaggerated i also like the way the armedanddangerous sinisterness of the canvas reliefs informs the seemingly beatific aura of the flowers shared dna with ms bontecou s other work abounds , as do signs of future developments elsewhere frank gehry s fish lamps and jeff koons s and takashi murakami s use of flowers come to mind , as do several pixar characters but it is the bits and pieces that hold the eye the way , for example , the parts of the fish are layered and screwed together the wholes are too much like toys or models , or , as with the fastidious drawings included here , an overly familiar form of surrealism craft and detail are even more dominant in the recent , broochlike pieces perhaps ms bontecou moved so fast at the beginning of her career that she had to retrace her steps i remember being taken aback at the moma show by the conservative animal sculptures that ms bontecou was making in 1957 , only two years before she concocted her first reliefs in technique and sentimentality , these sculptures suggested the dubious leonard baskin they made the canvas reliefs look like a sudden leap that might not have been quite earned , or stable perhaps that is why it can seem that ms bontecou has been shoring up their foundations ever since roberta smith the centerpiece of the debut exhibition of althea thauberger , a young german artist , is a 20minute dvd of eight young men in casual contemporary dress whose carefully choreographed actions convey the virtuous themes , austerity and comical earnestness of a history painting brought to life free of dialogue and punctuated with title cards explaining the action , it tells an ennobling , abstract tale of entrapment , unity , deprivation , division and uneasy resolution in the face , it seems , of a common foe the drama unfolds on a large , twolevel scaffolding that rattles appropriately , implying the din of battle as the young men charge about , strike overwrought poses and mirror the narrative it is the oath of the horatii meets west side story it helps you get the point that the scaffolding is surrounded by the white , appropriately neoclassical columns and arches of a 19thcentury building in berlin \( a former hospital that is now an art space \) the final twist , as implied by the title , is that the young men have opted to avoid traditional paths of glory they are contributing nine months of social service in lieu of seven months of military service , and their participation in ms thauberger s piece is not part of that service the work is overly cerebral , but it makes most of its points on its own and has the added charm of resembling an early dance or film by yvonne rainer forced through the sieve of academy painting around 1805 roberta smith in another stellar show amy cutler fabricates an imaginary womenonly world taking on the roles of anthropologist and storyteller , she depicts her characters in the rituals of daily living , an impressive blend of science and art that demonstrates the many ways a woman s work is never done the fineline style of these gouaches and lithographs note the attention ms cutler pays to the details of the vintage clothing brings to mind the prints of 19thcentury ethnographers like george catlin and karl bodmer when she moves from anthropological classification to fantasy , her figures adapt , evolutionlike , to the tasks at hand millie , for example , is part female , part rowboat her hand has turned into a paddle s blade the women s feet are shears in garnering , a wheat harvest scene in some images the women s legs have turned into stilts that resemble reindeer legs , so they can better reach fruit on tall trees while her work ca n't be classified as feminist art , it gains contemporary currency by portraying cultural mores that may still restrict women dwelling takes on the ritual of marriage it shows women \( with mattresses strapped to their backs and canopies as headdresses \) transformed into chinese bridal carriages , the vehicles used to transport the brides and their dowries to the houses of their mothersinlaw this ritual may no longer happen , but the image prompts thoughts about how marriage continues to domesticate women bridget l goodbody this show of photographs depicting the family and friends of leigh ledare , j h engstrom and ari marcopolous uses autobiography as its departure point the goal , according to arnd seibert in his curatorial statement , is to demonstrate how such photography constructs fictional accounts of a life mr ledare portrays his mother posing as a star in soft pornography , rolling in bed with young boyfriends , wearing nothing but a neck brace , or stripping out of her black lingerie once you get past the initial is this for real \? moment , however , the images read as a style confessional gone astray a similar overemphasis on dissolution characterizes mr engstrom s images from his photographic diary trying to dance you 'll see a group of drunken friends in werewolflike masks around a dinner table a naked , aroused man chugging beer and a couple having sex such pornographic elements , unfortunately , distract from the magical mystery tour elegance of his other series , haunt mr marcopolous s chronicle of a day in the life of his family demonstrates exciting selfawareness he s arranged his photographs in a diamond pattern , so that there is an obvious beginning and end the images show his sons skateboarding \( note his closeups of their bumps and bruises \) , a garage turned into a recording studio , silvery beach sunsets and newspaper headlines the day after saddam hussein s execution maybe the series does n't fully represent the marcopolous family , but it tricks you , without dramatic gimmicks , into thinking you know them , which strikes me as the goal of anything autobiographical bridget l goodbody most contemporary art comes partly from other art one way to assess the health of something new is to subtract all the visible influences , precedents and received ideas and see if there is any pulse left unpack the images in the first new york show of the french artist delphine courtillot , and barely a flicker remains , but a flicker is better than nothing ms courtillot makes large watercolors based

hindu worship mr yamada has turned the exhibition into a memorial by arranging the sculptures in the manner brancusi used in his studio they also resemble the totemic poles in a tiwi burial ground would duchamp and brancusi have appreciated such a memorial \? my guess is that they would have preferred something more conceptually original even though each spent a lifetime appropriating the forms

louisville , ky , may 5 for 364 days a year , there is no trainer better than todd pletcher but the most important day in horse racing continues to give him fits pletcher , the eclipse award winner as the nation s outstanding trainer the past three years , had another miserable saturday at churchill downs with a recordtying five starters in the 20horse kentucky derby field , the best finish among them was a sixthplace showing by circular quay among his other starters , any given saturday finished eighth , sam p was ninth , scat daddy was 18th and cowtown cat was last none of his horses appeared to have had any serious excuses pletcher is 0 for 19 in the kentucky derby , though he has finished second twice he appeared to take saturday s setback in stride it s hard right after a race , pletcher told reporters i'm disappointed the horses did n't run better but , as i 've said before , life goes on whether you win the kentucky derby or not you still have a job to do , and you 've got to pick up and do it i wish i could tell you guys i'm going to go home and cry , but i'm really not i 've said it before , i do n't think you can jump into this race and say you 're definitely going to win it just does n't work that way all five of pletcher s starters came into the derby with solid credentials pletcher dominated the prep races this winter and spring , winning the florida , illinois and louisiana derbys , the gotham , the sham and the fountain of youth all week , he said that his horses were doing well and that he expected a big performance but as the field of 20 swung into the stretch , it was clear that the pletcher crew was not going to get the job done after chasing a fast early pace , cowtown cat was beginning to tire and the others were not making forward moves perhaps the biggest surprise was scat daddy , the third choice in the wagering with edgar prado aboard , he never threatened edgar said he was spinning his wheels down the backside and he did n't feel like he handled the track very well , pletcher said , referring to scat daddy pletcher seemed stunned that not one of his horses was in the hunt , but said that was not his biggest regret that disappointed me , he said when asked about not finishing among the top four but i ca n't tell you i 'd feel that much better if i finished second been there done that entering friday s kentucky oaks , the pletcher stable was 0 for 12 here this week but he rebounded in the oaks with rags to riches and octave , the first two finishers i was pleased with the way rags to riches ran yesterday , pletcher said i felt like after she did that , and after octave ran as well as she did , that our game plan training at keeneland and coming over late was working it worked yesterday and i felt like it was positive sign it did n't work out pletcher s stable earned 268 million last year , setting a record for an american trainer he also set singleseason records for most stakes victories \( 100 \) and graded stakes victories \( 57 \) yet he is 0 for 1 in the preakness and 0 for 6 in the belmont , making his triple crown record 0 for 26 his record in the breeders' cup , the fall championship event , is 2 for 41 pletcher may have to wait before breaking his triple crown drought he said that none of his derby starters were likely to run in the preakness instead , he will most likely run a long shot , king of the roxy pletcher deals with dozens of wellbred , quality horses and will no doubt be back at churchill downs a year from now with another powerful group at 39 years old , he should have plenty of chances to win a kentucky derby until then , a frustrating wait continues
a parade of republican white house candidates appealed for support from over 1 , 000 iowa republicans on saturday , with two of their leading candidates senator john mccain and rudolph w giuliani assailing democrats in washington for pressing legislation that would set a timetable for bringing american troops back from iraq it was the first time that the major republican candidates had appeared at the same event the annual lincoln day dinner , held in the sprawling ballroom of a downtown convention center here for more than three hours , an audience of the state s most active republicans listened attentively as candidates proclaimed their strong opposition to abortion rights , called for a crackdown against illegal immigrants and warned that a democratic return to the white house would result in higher taxes although the event was called a unity dinner , the speeches reflected divisions among the republicans on various issues , in particular abortion several candidates , including mr mccain of arizona and mike huckabee of arkansas , presented themselves as lifelong opponents of abortion rights , drawing clear if unspoken contrasts with mr giuliani , who supports abortion rights , and mr romney , who once supported abortion rights but now opposes them but the strongest divisions emerged between the parties , as mr giuliani and mr mccain offered attacks on democrats for their efforts to bring an end to the war in iraq apart from his remark about abortions and a warmup joke that involved zsa zsa gabor mr mccain devoted almost his entire nineminute speech to arguing in support of the war , and attacking democrats for opposing it the democrats want to set a date for withdrawal , which should be named a date certain for surrender , mr mccain said there is no way we can prevail if we announce a date for withdrawal there is only one commanderinchief of the united states and that is george w bush , he continued , drawing some of the loudest applause of the night in response to one of the few times mr bush was even mentioned i support him , and i believe in him mr giuliani , the former mayor of new york , said the debate on the war had intensified to me the difference between us and the democrats he criticized democrats whom he said opposed expanding domestic surveillance programs and wanted to weaken some provisions of the socalled patriot act , saying such moves were a retreat from the offensive on terrorism if we back off that , then we are going back on the defense , mr giuliani said , and we are no longer on the offense mr giuliani said he did not fault people who failed to grasp the threat of terrorism after the first attack on the world trade center or after the bombing of the uss cole but after sept 11 , it s clear what we need to do to protect ourselves , he said mr romney , the former massachusetts governor , who is also a leading candidate for his party s nomination , called for expanded spending on the military in order to toughen the united states against threats and warned about the threat of what he called jihadists they want to create the collapse of the united states of america and our retreat militarily , he said the republican party and conservatism generally are a philosophy of strength , he said military strength , economic strength , personal strength and family strength the attendance at the event , both by the candidates and the state s republicans , reflected the importance iowa has assumed in the presidential nominating process , and the intense interest voters here have in the race several candidates said republicans should avoid attacking one another and be prepared to band together around a nominee next year i would like you to select me , mr giuliani said but if you do n't , every single person who comes up after me every single one of them is better than hillary , senator obama and senator edwards , referring to senators hillary rodham clinton and barack obama , as well as former senator john edwards it was his only remark that drew loud applause from the crowd and one candidate , jim gilmore , the former governor of virginia , drew soft boos when he mentioned candidates' names in a notsosubtle way of suggesting that three of the leading candidates had records of shifting positions on some issues that are crucial to conservatives do n't be fooled by people who come to you now and say they are conservative , mr gilmore said i can assure you that rudy mcromney is not conservative , and he knows he is not a conservative but the undercurrent was unmistakable , even when names were not used mr huckabee , a former governor of arkansas , pointedly noted that he had always been an opponent of abortion rights and guncontrol measures , and that he had supported president bush s tax cuts from the beginning i'm not late in declaring that life begins at conception and we ought to protect human life , he said i am not late in believing that the bush tax cuts were good when they were first proposed , and they are still good today mr romney recently joined the national rifle association , as he sought to argue that he was a lifelong opponent of gun control measures and mr mccain voted against many of mr bush s tax cuts , a position that has contributed to conservative unease with his candidacy mr romney appeared on stage with his wife , ann , and one of his sons , josh , paying a long and warm tribute to his family the tableau came immediately after mr giuliani finished and served by design or not to remind republicans of what has troubled some here about mr giuliani his three marriages and his estranged relationship with his son , andrew the candidates were each given six minutes to talk , though that was one rule that none of the candidates , after spending hours flying here , seemed prepared to follow mr giuliani spoke for 17 minutes , though he left immediately after he was done , passing up the gladhanding of dinner attendees to leave iowa for a fundraiser in missouri in a reflection of the potency of the immigration issue here , representative tom tancredo of colorado drew some of the loudest applause of the night when he questioned his opponent s commitment to cracking down on illegal immigrants and said he would never support a measure allowing them to stay in this country i will never grant amnesty to illegal immigrants , mr tancredo said photos rudolph w giuliani , former new york mayor , left , and mitt romney , former governor of massachusetts , speaking in des moines yesterday at the lincoln day dinner they were among the nine republican candidates who gathered to woo iowans who will attend the caucus next year \( photographs by matthew holst for the new york times \)
jason marquis pitched so poorly last september that he won none of his five starts , lost four of them , compiled a 725 earned run average , did n't appear in the st louis cardinals' first playoff series against san diego and was left off the roster for the league championship series and the world series great prelude to being a free agent marquis , however , was 28 years old and only two years earlier had won 15 games with the cardinals in spite of his 1416 record and 602 era , highest among 51 national league pitchers who started 23 or more games , he received a threeyear , 21 million contract from the chicago cubs , who were obviously in dire need of starting pitching looking at his body of work over three years , our people felt we were going to get the guy from the first half rather than the second half , said jim hendry , the cubs' general manager he won more games than zito and schmidt he s a 200inning guy , and we needed that furthermore , hendry said , greg maddux told me good things about him , and when greg maddux talks , i 'll listen as it is every winter , pitching was a highly desired commodity last winter some teams signed free agents others opted for trades approximately 40 starting pitchers joined new teams last offseason some have begun their new careers impressively marquis has been the most effective far more have not performed as if they will be competing for the cy young awards jeff weaver has stood out in that group unlike marquis , weaver pitched in the postseason last year , winning one game in each series for the cardinals , including the world series finale weaver , however , lost his first five starts for seattle , allowing 41 hits and 29 runs in 17 innings for a 1535 earned run average like the cubs , the milwaukee brewers have done well with their signing of a former st louis pitcher jeff suppan has started the season with a 42 record and a 255 era his fouryear , 42 million contract seemed a bit steep for a pitcher with a 106101 career record , but suppan , a 32yearold righthander , has helped pitch the brewers into first place in the nl central the cubs ca n't say the same about marquis and ted lilly , another free agent \( four years , 40 million \) marquis and lilly \( 22 , 282 \) have helped the cubs build one of the most effective pitching staffs in the league , but that has n't translated to progress in the team s wonlost record on the other hand , how bad would the cubs be if they did n't have marquis and lilly \? the kansas city royals are so bad , not even an effective gil meche can drag them out of the division place to which they have become accustomed meche , however , has made a surprisingly impressive start for his fiveyear , 55 million contract with a 31 record and 223 era for the lastplace royals barry zito gained the biggest contract as a freeagent pitcher , seven years and 126 million , but he has n't been the best pitcher he has a 23 record and a 352 era for san francisco plenty of pitchers on new teams have been worse more than a dozen starters besides weaver have era s higher than 600 for their new teams the group includes mark redman , atlanta , 04 , 1062 adam eaton , philadelphia , 32 , 818 jason schmidt , dodgers , 12 , 736 jaret wright , baltimore , 03 , 697 randy johnson , arizona , 02 , 650 schmidt and wright are on the disabled list left with an almost brandnew rotation , st louis is struggling kip wells , signed as a free agent , has a 16 record with a 659 era , and adam wainwright , who was the team s world series closer , is 22 with a 560 era as a starter but braden looper , who was the mets' closer two years ago , has a 32 record and 284 era some teams have inserted rookies into their rotations but with no success mike pelfrey of the mets has a 03 record and a 675 era john danks of the white sox has a 04 record and a 502 era daisuke matsuzaka , boston s 103 million man , is a major league rookie despite his experience in japan , and in spite of his dominant pitching in japan he has demonstrated that in this country he is human he has a winning record , 32 , but he also has a 545 era cashman s worst signing the worst freeagent signing of the offseason might belong to the yankees well , marty miller does n't belong to the yankees anymore they fired him last week as their strength and conditioning coach as one pitcher after another sustained a disabling hamstring injury the yankees hired miller , a major league baseball novice , from a country club in palm beach , fla , replacing jeff mangold , who had held the job for nine years what s worse , the yankees gave miller a new and fancy title director of performance enhancement with that frilly nouveau designation , miller did n't have a chance general manager brian cashman will very likely never make a more costly decision than he did in violating the adage if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it p \?

there is always plenty of blame to go around when a team loses in the playoffs this postseason , some of that blame has been directed at russian stars ilya kovalchuk of atlanta , alexei yashin of the , even the pittsburgh rookie evgeni malkin in the 1970s and '80s , north american coaches , team officials and commentators routinely criticized european players in general for being soft and lacking the character needed for the rugged stanley cup playoffs although that point of view is rarely heard today , it still has its proponents , like the cbc commentator don cherry \( who is also working for nbc \) during this season s openinground series against buffalo , yashin was demoted to the fourth line by islanders coach ted nolan , and his ice time was cut sharply as the team captain , and as a player accused of underperforming during his years with ottawa , yashin was singled out for criticism he scored no points as the islanders lost in five games kovalchuk was also criticized when the thrashers were swept by the rangers he had only one goal and one assist in the fourgame series , but no thrasher scored more than 3 points malkin was rapped for not scoring a goal in the ' fivegame loss to ottawa , though he had four assists , which was good for a tie for second best in club scoring whether nationality has anything to do with the criticism of kovalchuk , yashin or malkin is not clear mark gandler , a player agent born in russia with degrees from there and from new york university and columbia , said that any bias on the part of commentators came from team officials journalists get their information from the coaches , gandler said by telephone if there is any prejudice , it s from the coaching many coaches are more comfortable with north american players who are safer , ' but there are plenty of russian players , european players , who can play defense , kill penalties there are lots of them over there but what s scouted , and drafted , the contracts in north america go to the skill players , not the plumbers , so when you need a defensive player , or an energy' player , you wind up going to the canadian because it s a skewed group gandler , the founder of international sports advisors and the representative for several russian players , including yashin , said russian players , like north american players , are doing the best they can they sacrifice the body they all want to win but it s a team game you ca n't put it all on any one player i frankly do not see any difference whatsoever between russian , canadian , finnish players no difference at all gandler said that yashin joined the islanders when the team was in complete disarray since then , they 've made the playoffs five out of six years but igor kuperman , another prominent russian involved in the business side of the game , says there is no longer bias against russian players those days are long gone , said kuperman , who worked in the front office in winnipeg and phoenix from 1991 to 2004 and was an assistant general manager for the 2002 russian olympic team i do n't believe that s the case , and even if that was the case , if they 're really strong athletes , they 'd have to battle through it kuperman , now a vice president at an international sports statistics company , said that the corps of russian players in the nhl as a whole was not as strong as it once was after alexander ovechkin and malkin , there are n't that many really good newcomers , he said russians do n't really have the leading role in the nhl anymore kuperman said that any criticism for russian players was probably not unfair i'm not a believer in that at all , he said valid or not , they still have to plug away there are absolutely no excuses world championship in works the international ice hockey federation announced friday that it would stage an expanded european club championship tournament , called the champions hockey league , starting in 20089 the federation president , ren fasel , also said that plans were being made with the nhl to have the winner and perhaps the runnerup of that competition play an nhl challenger for the world club championship those games would take place in late september 2009 the champions hockey league format , similar to that of soccer s european champions league , would involve the champions of 16 of europe s smaller hockeyplaying nations in a preliminary stage at a later stage , the playoff and regularseason champions of the six top nations enter the competition the federation operated a similar champions league from 1996 through 2000 , but underfunding and low television interest caused its demise the new competition , however , will distribute a guaranteed 14 million to participating clubs , with an additional 830 , 000 going to the winner fasel said in the announcement that discussions with the nhl for a world club championship were at an advanced stage we believe that together with our partner nhl we have a concept for an annual september showdown , fasel said also , this competition would carry a substantial financial reward of the five teams to reach the postseason most frequently in nhl history , none qualified for the playoffs this spring the st louis blues , who have made the playoffs in 34 of their 39 years \( a rate of 87 percent \) , missed the cut this season so did montreal \( 75 of 89 , 84 percent \) , philadelphia \( 31 of 39 , 79 percent \) , edmonton \( 21 of 27 , 78 percent \) and boston \( 62 of 82 , 76 percent \) the team with the highest playoffappearance rate to make this season s playoffs was the buffalo sabres , who have reached the postseason 27 times in their 36 seasons , a rate of 75 percent

algiers larbi charef grew up in a tough neighborhood in algiers alongside other suicide bombers , with none of the advantages of the university students he killed on tuesday a former convict , he was 30 years old when he detonated the explosives packed in his car on an algiers street his accomplice in a second bombing nearby was weighed down by even graver troubles , according to local reports rabah bechla , who destroyed a united nations building with the bomb in his pickup truck , was a 64yearold man dying of cancer who had lost two sons to the islamist cause by one report , mr bechla had only days to live officials say 34 people were killed in the attacks , though doctors and rescue workers estimate the deaths at twice that number to experts , mr charef is a textbook example of a militant islamist in a volatile region , but at the same time , security officials emphasize that there are almost infinite permutations of personal circumstances and societal factors that may lead to militancy they need only point to mr bechla , the second bomber mr bechla , who was also identified as ibrahim abu otmane , was not from algiers but from the city of reghaia , 20 miles east of the capital the algerian press said he was one of the nation s oldest terrorists he joined the islamist militant movement in 1996 , and both his sons died for the cause in clashes with security forces , according to the daily newspaper el chourouk on thursday if mr bechla s role as a suicide bomber was unusual , mr charef s fit a wellknown pattern his profile has intrigued specialists who are trying to explain the comeback of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb , the group that claimed responsibility for the two attacks mr charef was born in poverty in the eastern part of the capital , had made two pilgrimages to saudi arabia , spent time in prison and unemployed and eventually made his way to an insurgent camp in the eastern mountains of algeria , according to a portrait pieced together from interviews with his family and security officials the poverty is the soil , the prison the fertilizer , said a western diplomat , a student of terrorism in north africa he called mr charef , who went by the alias abdul rahman abu abdul nasser alaassemi , in many ways , the classic profile of a terrorist security experts say that membership in the group , which formerly was called the salafist group for preaching and combat , once plunged to a few hundred but could now be back at about 1 , 000 described by his shaken parents as a polite and religious young man , mr charef grew up in oued ouchayeh , a notoriously poor and rough neighborhood that was the home of other prominent militants , including a suicide bomber who attacked the prime minister s office in april four years ago , his family moved to another neighborhood , hai megnouch , a sprawling shantytown with rows of halffinished concrete houses sitting in one of those unfinished houses , a threestory skeleton of brick and metal , mouloud charef , the bomber s father , recalled his son s short life with a surface calm that failed to hide the pain in his face he was a good boy , always went to school and was respectful , said the father , a slight man with a trim gray beard who was wearing a white muslim skullcap we do n't understand nobody knows what happened to him one of eight siblings , larbi charef left high school a year early to work for a wholesaler , making deliveries to pharmacies , his father said twice mr charef went on a twoweek pilgrimage to mecca , the only one in his family to have gone asked how he could afford the trips , his brother said he had saved money from his earnings in 2004 he was arrested by the police and accused of being part of a logistical support network linked to the salafist group , known at the time by the initials gspc , the father said he admitted that he had given two boxes of paracetamol to the group , he said , referring to the painkiller known in the united states as acetaminophen the authorities put him into prison , he said he spent nearly two years in prison , and that time , some of his cousins and neighbors said , changed mr charef he was quieter when he came back , recalled his cousin mohammed , 49 , who did not give his last name who knows who he met in there there are a lot of fis people in prison , he said , a reference to members of the islamic salvation front , a banned party in march 2006 , mr charef was released under a national reconciliation program that gives amnesty to people convicted of terrorism or terrorismrelated crimes in an attempt to heal the wounds caused by a civil war in the 1990s but despite a high school diploma he obtained while in prison , mr charef failed to get a job at one point he tried to set up his own business , selling ice cream in the neighborhood , his cousin said the business failed last december he told his family he would leave the country to find work elsewhere from that day on , we never heard from him again , his father said i thought he was in spain until the police came on tuesday night to show me his burned driving license and to tell me what he had done on the second floor of the charef family home the only floor that was completed mr charef s mother , malika , was looking at the stripped bed that her son had slept in until last year local journalists briefed by the algerian security services say that mr charef spent the last year of his life in the eastern mountains training with militants national reconciliation is very good , very good , said a friend who was comforting mr charef s mother but when you put young men for two years into prison , you need to follow up they need guidance
by and large musical minimalists do n't carry cards but they do know something about guilt by association most composers commonly called minimalists have disavowed the label at one point or another , suggesting that it mischaracterizes their music , which can be mindbogglingly intricate and huge and they certainly do n't consider themselves part of a school the designation arose mainly from the friendships of composers with minimalist artists steve reich and philip glass , for example , with the sculptor richard serra but there certainly was something new and big \( however minimal the means \) stirring in the second half of the 20th century with roots in the styles of lou harrison , la monte young , morton feldman , john cage and others , music characterized by great rhythmic drive , simplified harmonies and hypnotic repetition blossomed in signal works by terry riley , john adams , mr glass and mr reich the pollen carried far and wide , even to eastern europe with the mystical minimalism of arvo p \? and others as a spiritualized offshoot the 70thbirthday year of philip glass , which is being widely observed , seems as good a time as any to take stock of the minimalist achievement by way of recordings so the classical music critics of the new york times have singled out favorite recordings of music by various forerunners \( including the jazz great count basie \) , the early giants and those who later fell under the influence \( including the dane poul ruders \) none of this is likely to settle disputes about what , if anything , the various composers have in common , for the music is wildly varied but it should at least lay out some of the terms of the argument , in addition to providing good listening james r oestreich drawing \( drawing by richard aloisio \)
avondale , ariz , april 20 stockcar racing fans in the north carolina heartland of the sport were asked by a charlotte newspaper columnist last year to come up with a new name for the car of tomorrow , which , after years of development , was scheduled to debut in s nextel cup series this season among the blistering responses the edsel apparently , the nascardesigned racecar has been a tough sell both in the stands and in the nascar garage the car of tomorrow , which features an unusual frontshelf design and an odd wing in the rear , has been billed as a safety upgrade that will lower costs and make races more competitive but after using the car in two races , crews are questioning some of those very issues , including the car s safety and whether it will tighten competition as the teams prepare for their third race using the car of tomorrow , the subway fresh fit 500 saturday night at phoenix international raceway , many of those concerns are at the forefront i believe this is a huge work in progress , the veteran driver jeff burton said before practice thursday we 're definitely learning on the fly officials say they have been pleased with the results from the first two races march 25 at bristol motor speedway in tennessee and april 1 at martinsville speedway in virginia each race featured a tight finish a laterace pass by burton against at bristol was a sign of the new car s improved racing capabilities , said gary nelson , the former vice president for research and development for nascar , who led the car of tomorrow project robin pemberton , nascar s vice president for competition , said we 've had great races we had a great race at martinsville with it we had a great race at bristol but even before those checkered flags , red flags were being raised by some drivers and crews foam attached to the new car s right side has melted under high heat and filled cars with smoke the foam was supposed to improve safety by absorbing energy in sideimpact crashes instead , it turned into a safety hazard because the tailpipe that runs under the foam generated enough heat to melt it after the race at martinsville , nascar ordered changes a smaller amount of foam and different installation procedures are being used and heat shields were added to keep the foam from melting pemberton said nascar would not remove the foam because of the benefits it could provide during a crash the driver greg biffle , who raised the foam issue with nascar officials , said he was concerned that unleaded fuel , which burns hotter than leaded gasoline , caused flames to shoot from the tailpipe he is also questioning how higher temperatures through the summer could affect the foam there may be some issues with the science of it as we go forward , biffle said during a car of tomorrow test at richmond international raceway this month foam is not the only issue teams are also waiting to see if the car will reduce the costs of competing , which is what nascar has suggested so far , teams said , it has been an expensive transition they have had to pay as much as 1 million to 2 million per driver to implement the new program everything is new , all the parts and pieces are different from the older car , said larry mcclure , owner of the no 4 chevrolet driven by ward burton his morganmcclure motorsports is one of the smallerbudget teams that was supposed to benefit from the car of tomorrow it s been expensive so far teams that can use the same racecar from week to week , instead of building new ones for each track , are seeing longterm savings kevin harvick will drive the same car at phoenix that he raced at bristol and martinsville that would have been impossible with the model he used before those cars are still being used in 20 of 36 races this year during the car of tomorrow s phase in pemberton , the nascar official , said he saw other signs of the playing field s leveling he pointed out that a number of midlevel and smallteam drivers raced among the leaders at bristol , and that the practice times were close among first and secondtier teams at phoenix yet the races so far have been decidedly tilted in favor of a dominant team , hendrick motorsports hendrick drivers kyle busch and jimmie johnson won the races at bristol and martinsville teammate jeff gordon finished in the top three each time busch s crew chief , alan gustafson , credited the research , engineering and testing at hendrick for the performance of its drivers that kind of success costs money that smallbudget teams do not have it s not going to level the playing field because the teams that have the biggest budgets and the most employees have the deepest bench , said robbie loomis , vice president for race operations at petty enterprises and a former crew chief for gordon at hendrick motorsports if anything , i think you 'll see a bigger separation anytime you come out with something new as they prepare for phoenix , drivers are now questioning whether the car of tomorrow will lead to better racing the track here is much different than the halfmile ovals at bristol and martinsville phoenix is a onemile oval , and aerodynamics affect how the cars react to each other on the track the driver denny hamlin said a boxier racecar would make it more difficult to pass other cars he said he anticipated a long line of cars with little movement from back to front for all the complaints , the car has also had its proponents , including kyle petty and dale earnhardt jr petty s son adam died in a nascar crash in 2000 earnhardt s father was killed at the daytona 500 in 2001 those wrecks led nascar to design and develop a safer racecar the justification was safety , pemberton said that was first and foremost , bar none the ultimate payoff from the car might not come until the first major crash
fort huachuca , ariz the door to the tumbledown clapboard building , the one with the off limits sign , creaks open , and harlan bradford s flashlight beam cuts through the shadows inside now in the spotlight , bat droppings on the floor up above , dropceiling railings dangle like stalactites a stage curtain in tatters hints at the shows , the many shows that once rocked this place , the former mountain view colored officers club you can see and hear them and imagine everyone having a good time , said mr bradford , a retired army man himself , glancing around at the exposed walls , the boardedup windows , the dust lena horne sang here joe louis did exhibition fights out here there was nothing like it it was , a report for the army corps of engineers said , the only club built expressly for black officers during the days of segregation in the military other installations converted buildings for black officers and enlisted men , but the mountain view club , it said , was the only such club built from the ground up and now , to the dismay of mr bradford and the community group he leads , the southwest association of buffalo soldiers , it sits in ghostly tatters almost every community in america has a save the campaign aimed at the old movie theater , the grand victorian house , the stately oaks here that sentiment blends with a yearning , particularly acute among black americans , to not only save but also rediscover the past the club , 17 , 000 square feet , was built in 1942 as part of a large encampment , a city really , that arose to train black soldiers at this isolated fort 75 miles southeast of tucson near the mexican border allblack units , nicknamed buffalo soldiers either because of their fearsome reputation or curly hair , depending on the source , had trained and been posted there as far back as the indian wars of the late 19th century in the shadow of the huachuca mountains , the clubgoers danced and sang and enjoyed visits by top artists and dignitaries of the day , as depicted in photographs from the era archived at the fort museum mountain view served as a black officers club until the war ended in 1945 and the fort demobilized after the 1948 executive order desegregating the armed forces , the building served as an integrated club and its brief , but to many , significant role in the history of military segregation was nearly lost to time none of the current group seeking to save it were in the military when the club was segregated they have been trying to track down such soldiers , but many are infirm or dead no plaque , no sign , no notice denoted the club s purpose , and mr bradford himself said he had enjoyed shows there without knowing its history the fort was preparing to demolish the building in 1998 as part of an army effort to dismantle crumbling world war iiera buildings , but local retirees who had remembered hearing something about the club and highprofile entertainers performing there stepped in i went to the museum and eventually they showed me an old map that said colored officers club , ' said bob caulfield , a retired lieutenant colonel i went to the engineer s office and checked the proper records and discovered that s what it was built as mr caulfield notified the buffalo soldiers group and a fledgling campaign , still a grassroots effort , took shape to save the building the 1998 army corps report put the brakes on demolition when it concluded that the building should be considered eligible for the national register of historic places it is a historically significant building when viewed within the contexts of world war ii and africanamerican service in the us military , the report said the goal is to raise 5 million to convert it into a historical research center about 50 , 000 has been raised , with promised inkind donations adding up to another 50 , 000 we are really struggling , mr bradford said , conceding that the group s ambition exceeds its fundraising and organizational wherewithal i even wrote the white house , he said , venting his frustration over a lack of response from celebrities he has written to i got a letter back saying president bush sends his best wishes i am keeping that and the others so when this building is destroyed and people say why did n't anybody step in i can show them everything the fort and the community group have been negotiating over what to do with building and who should pay it has not been used since 1998 , as a supper club , and has fallen into severe disrepair last year , the southwest association of buffalo soldiers signed a lease with the base , giving the group until spring 2008 to raise 200 , 000 toward the renovation the lease bars the group from seeking the building s placement on the historic register until it is rehabilitated mr bradford said he suspected that clause was included so the fort could tear down the building if the group s efforts failed a spokeswoman for the fort , angela moncur , said the fort does not want to see the building lost and the terms of the lease were intended to keep the group s efforts on track certainly we know the swabs s intent to preserve this building , but as an installation what we ca n't have is a project that never reaches its end state , ms moncur said , adding that deadline extensions would be considered if the group was close to benchmarks the army in wartime , she said , does not have money to help financially and so the buffalo soldiers association carries on the mountain view building must live on to tell the story of the segregated army for generations to come , said tom stoney , a military retiree if the building is destroyed , the history and all that the building stands for will be lost forever we cannot allow that to happen
las vegas the appeal of the underdog is a longstanding one that has most often been applied to sports but long ago spread into public consciousness the badge of the underdog is \( figuratively \) adorned with blood , guts and perseverance , and worn with pride especially when an underdog inexplicably succeeds this football season , however , the underdog is a symbol of money big money , for las vegas bookmakers they 've raked in an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars extra betting on the underdog in the national football league this is because in the 2006 regular season , nfl teams that were given points \( those or symbols that indicate the spread , as determined by bookmakers \) walked off with an overdogworthy 1401067 \( 55 percent \) record against the point spread in addition , underdogs that were given doubledigit points in the plus column \( the underunderdogs , if you will \) were 20142 \( 59 percent \) according to analysts from , a canadian web site devoted to betting news , these are the highest winning percentages in those categories in the last 10 years and because the vast majority of the betting public usually , foolishly , plays the favorite , this season s pack of underdogs probably outfitted most of the bigger casinos with some lofty accoutrements if you find the mirage s urinals suddenly goldplated or the bellagio golf carts equipped with gps systems , it s most likely courtesy of the tennessee titans or the buffalo bills , which had the best records of all of the underdog teams this season this trend has continued into the playoffs last weekend s divisional rounds saw all four underdog teams \( colts , eagles , seahawks and patriots \) beating the point spread in their respective games and , in some cases , winning outright with these percentages , alongside rocky balboa s return to cultural legitimacy , does this mean that underdogs are a safe bet through super bowl sunday in miami \? unfortunately , no keith glantz of coverscom gives the sobering news playoffs are a different animal altogether he says that teams with big leads in a playoff game used to play it safer than they do now , thanks to the classic 1993 playoff between the houston oilers and the buffalo bills houston led 353 at halftime but switched from its touchdownhappy , runandshoot offense to a more conservative ground attack and lost in overtime , 4138 the 49ers , the texans and , on a few occasions , the pitiful oakland raiders beat their odds this year , but none of those teams are actually in the playoffs and playoff teams those of the last 15 years , at least pile up points until they see zeros on the clock however , in the playoffs the quality of the teams does matter remember , the salarycapped nfl prides itself on pete rozelleera parity , and some experts have declared that because of that , the nfl is handicapped with acrosstheboard mediocrity yet in this case it makes for exciting football it s becoming tougher and tougher to blow a team out in the nfl , regardless of what all the gambling trends indicate and , sometimes , what common sense indicates to fans and , most notably , to nongamblers , a game becomes epic regardless of whether your team is playing in it or you 're betting 1 , 000 on it but , parity or not , good gamblers know it was n't that crazy to bet the battlescarred new england patriots , with 5 points last weekend , against the up and coming san diego chargers , a team saddled with one of the classic playoff deadweights in coach marty schottenheimer and even though there was n't a total implosion , trusting rex grossman s bipolar quarterbacking with your 100 and laying 95 points to last year s nfc champions , the seattle seahawks would not be a smart bet finally , the saints are a marvelous feelgood story , and playing at home , but it was still a little tough to have vegas giving a surging , playoffsavvy philadelphia eagles team points and expecting a blowout this year , at least regardless of what the numbers say , or what the trends indicate , or how good soandso s defense is when it s 46 degrees or below in a month that has an r in it , there s always something that could go horribly , horribly wrong \( mr romo , please pick up your head and step forward \) the best gambling advice going into the final weekend of actual football before the super bowl spectacle of football is to veer away from the allure of the underdog trend \( and the promise of a personalized goldplated urinal \) the safest bet , however , is that these games are going to be good
jason marquis pitched so poorly last september that he won none of his five starts , lost four of them , compiled a 725 earned run average , did n't appear in the ' first playoff series against san diego and was left off the roster for the league championship series and the world series great prelude to being a free agent marquis , however , was 28 years old and only two years earlier had won 15 games with the cardinals in spite of his 1416 record and 602 era , highest among 51 national league pitchers who started 23 or more games , he received a threeyear , 21 million contract from the , who were obviously in dire need of starting pitching looking at his body of work over three years , our people felt we were going to get the guy from the first half rather than the second half , said jim hendry , the cubs' general manager he won more games than zito and schmidt he s a 200inning guy , and we needed that furthermore , hendry said , greg maddux told me good things about him , and when greg maddux talks , i 'll listen as it is every winter , pitching was a highly desired commodity last winter some teams signed free agents others opted for trades approximately 40 starting pitchers joined new teams last offseason some have begun their new careers impressively marquis has been the most effective far more have not performed as if they will be competing for the cy young awards jeff weaver has stood out in that group unlike marquis , weaver pitched in the postseason last year , winning one game in each series for the cardinals , including the world series finale weaver , however , lost his first five starts for seattle , allowing 41 hits and 29 runs in 17 innings for a 1535 earned run average like the cubs , the milwaukee brewers have done well with their signing of a former st louis pitcher jeff suppan has started the season with a 42 record and a 255 era his fouryear , 42 million contract seemed a bit steep for a pitcher with a 106101 career record , but suppan , a 32yearold righthander , has helped pitch the brewers into first place in the nl central the cubs ca n't say the same about marquis and ted lilly , another free agent \( four years , 40 million \) marquis and lilly \( 22 , 282 \) have helped the cubs build one of the most effective pitching staffs in the league , but that has n't translated to progress in the team s wonlost record on the other hand , how bad would the cubs be if they did n't have marquis and lilly \? the kansas city royals are so bad , not even an effective gil meche can drag them out of the division place to which they have become accustomed meche , however , has made a surprisingly impressive start for his fiveyear , 55 million contract with a 31 record and 223 era for the lastplace royals barry zito gained the biggest contract as a freeagent pitcher , seven years and 126 million , but he has n't been the best pitcher he has a 23 record and a 352 era for san francisco plenty of pitchers on new teams have been worse more than a dozen starters besides weaver have era s higher than 600 for their new teams the group includes mark redman , atlanta , 04 , 1062 adam eaton , philadelphia , 32 , 818 jason schmidt , dodgers , 12 , 736 jaret wright , baltimore , 03 , 697 randy johnson , arizona , 02 , 650 schmidt and wright are on the disabled list left with an almost brandnew rotation , st louis is struggling kip wells , signed as a free agent , has a 16 record with a 659 era , and adam wainwright , who was the team s world series closer , is 22 with a 560 era as a starter but braden looper , who was the ' closer two years ago , has a 32 record and 284 era some teams have inserted rookies into their rotations but with no success mike pelfrey of the mets has a 03 record and a 675 era john danks of the white sox has a 04 record and a 502 era daisuke matsuzaka , boston s 103 million man , is a major league rookie despite his experience in japan , and in spite of his dominant pitching in japan he has demonstrated that in this country he is human he has a winning record , 32 , but he also has a 545 era cashman s worst signing the worst freeagent signing of the offseason might belong to the well , marty miller does n't belong to the yankees anymore they fired him last week as their strength and conditioning coach as one pitcher after another sustained a disabling hamstring injury the yankees hired miller , a major league baseball novice , from a country club in palm beach , fla , replacing jeff mangold , who had held the job for nine years what s worse , the yankees gave miller a new and fancy title director of performance enhancement with that frilly nouveau designation , miller did n't have a chance general manager brian cashman will very likely never make a more costly decision than he did in violating the adage if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it p rez cutting down on walks pitching for pittsburgh in 2004 , the lefthander oliver p rez was fourth in the national league in strikeouts and first in strikeouts per nine innings , edging randy johnson , 1097 to 1062 five weeks into this season for the mets , p rez is fifth in strikeouts \( tied with five others \) and again leads in strikeouts per nine innings \( 112 \) but there is an even more intriguing aspect to p rez s performance in 2004 he had a very good threetoone strikeouttowalk ratio this season , even though he walked seven in his second start , he has a 36to1 ratio he walked no one in three other starts and three in his last game his ratio was eighth best in the nl entering the weekend three teams in a month the season is barely a month old , and ryan langerhans is playing for his third team langerhans , a 27yearold outfielder , began the season with atlanta , was traded to oakland last sunday , played for the athletics in boston on tuesday and wednesday nights , then was traded to washington and played for the nationals on friday in chicago last season four players each played for three teams cody ross for the dodgers , reds and marlins matt stairs , royals , rangers , tigers phil nevin , rangers , cubs , twins and jason johnson , indians , red sox , reds longest name in majors when jarrod saltalamacchia assumed his position behind the plate at the start of atlanta s game with philadelphia last wednesday night , he made history he had , elias sports bureau reported , the longest last name in major league history 14 letters , count 'em previously the longest name was 13 letters , shared by many one of the most recent sharers was todd hollandsworth another was john van benschoten saltalamacchia is a 22yearold catcher who was in his fifth minor league season when the braves summoned him last week his older brother , justin , 26 , was a minor league infielder whom the braves signed around the time they drafted jarrod in the first round of the 2003 draft but justin s baseball career ended about a year later when the braves released him , leaving jarrod to get the 14letter record look at the brewers now after 12 successive losing seasons , the milwaukee brewers finished the 2005 season with a 500 record but their enjoyment was shortlived last season they reverted to losing , finishing with a 7587 record it was depressing at the time , but time has altered the perception of the disappointing season so has a fast start to this season the brewers have the biggest division lead in the national league i look at our club now and last year and i say i wonder how we won 75 games , general manager doug melvin said three of our infielders played less than 100 games , and we lost sheets and ohka , who missed half a season now i look at it and say we were pretty fortunate that we won 75 games last year the brewers have second baseman rickie weeks and shortstop j j hardy back in the lineup , but third baseman corey koskie is still recovering from a concussion he sustained last july craig counsell and tony graffanino have split time at third we do n't have any superstars , melvin said , but we feel we can be average at every position instead of having a few superstars and belowaverage players at other positions hardy and prince fielder are the offensive leaders but with modest numbers they went into their game last night with seven home runs each , while fielder had 23 runs batted in and hardy 22 on the pitching front , the brewers have three starters with sub300 earned run averages jeff suppan , claudio vargas and chris capuano all three are a testament to melvin s ability to evaluate players capuano and vargas came from arizona in trades three years apart , and melvin signed suppan as a free agent dave bush , another starter , also came in a trade so did francisco cordero , the team s closer most of the key position players , on the other hand , are homegrown hardy , fielder , weeks and outfielders geoff jenkins , bill hall and corey hart cautious after last year s experience , melvin noted that the brewers had a good first month , but we have a long way to go he added we 've played fairly good baseball , mostly in our division we have the national league east teams coming up i do n't see many clubs that are dominant , he said , speaking of the league generally , but i do n't see many clubs that are pushovers either i do n't know if revenue sharing has helped do that or managing players has done it , but i do n't think there are any bad teams or great teams
news flash from the white house president bush is not the commander guy after all he s simply a commander guy the white house issued the correction friday two days earlier , mr bush had criticized congressional democrats in a speech to the annual gathering of the associated general contractors of america , a construction industry trade group the official white house transcript had mr bush offering this explanation of why he vetoed an iraq war spending bill that dictated a timeline for troop withdrawal the question is , who ought to make that decision , the congress or the commanders \? as you know , my position is clear i m the commander guy , the transcript said the remark attracted a fair amount of attention including in this space given mr bush s syntactic history \( last year , the president called himself the decider when fending off questions about whether donald h rumsfeld should resign as secretary of defense \) but dana perino , the deputy white house press secretary , took issue with the transcript what i recalled was that he said , i m a commander guy , meaning that he s one of the people that listens to the commanders , she told reporters at friday s briefing she said she asked the white house stenographers to take another listen , to the tape they did , and they said that i was right which i love to hear and he did say , a commander guy with that bit of business out of the way , ms perino finished with a promise , and a warning we will send out a correction of that transcript so that the record is clear , and i m sure none of you will be tempted to misuse it in the future
dublin , april 4 although the decades of violent conflict over northern ireland have ended , an official report issued here on wednesday demonstrated how the past still haunts the landscape the report addressed the deadliest day of the conflict may 17 , 1974 , when 33 adults and children were killed in coordinated bombings in dublin and monaghan , ireland after decades of deadend investigations , the official irish government commission of inquiry , consisting of a sole member , patrick mcentee , a senior criminal prosecuting lawyer , was asked by the irish government to find out why the irish police had quickly wound down their inquiry into the bombings in his report , he criticized the police for losing files and documentation , saying documentation had been handled in a way that was manifestly inappropriate but he said it would be unfair and unjust to say the police were solely responsible for the shortcomings in the inquiry the toll of 33 dead was the worst in three decades of violence between republicans , who wanted northern ireland to unite with ireland , and unionists , who wanted it to remain a british province more than 3 , 700 people were killed in the conflict , which ended with an accord in 1998 representatives of the victims say the british authorities in northern ireland and the irish police in dublin quickly identified the presumed bombers and traced them to unionist areas of northern ireland but within weeks of the bombings , the investigation in dublin ended none ever started in belfast it was shameful , said dermot walsh , a professor of law at the university of limerick , who said he suspected that the irish government had been frightened that any hint of british military collusion in the bombings would give a propaganda coup to the irish republican army at 5 30 pm on the day of the bombings , bernadette mcnally , 16 , was waiting for the workday to end so she could leave her job selling shoes on talbot street in dublin , she said wednesday in an interview a late customer came in looking for and i will always remember a pair of brown sandals , she said there was then a big flash , and it was like a violent wind i was thrown to the floor the second of three car bombs in dublin had gone off , killing 13 people , including the customer shopping for sandals and may mckenna , who lived upstairs a fourth exploded in monaghan , 75 miles away ms mcnally said she remained angry at the authorities who , she said , hushed up the violence they should find out who gave the orders that day in may , she said
to the editor in 15 chapters and 501 wellannotated pages , my book medical apartheid offers a careful , nuanced discussion of trends , cases , problems , ethics and persistent patterns in the disparate treatment of black research subjects however , ezekiel emanuel s review \( feb 18 \) ignores its rich content in order to claim that medical apartheid fails to place the experience of africanamericans in context he dramatically misrepresents the work within an untrustworthy review that is rife with distortions , contradictions , errors , exaggerations and confusions emanuel s own troubling research agenda , elements of which i criticize in medical apartheid , may be pertinent he champions such dubious policies as offering undue inducement to poor people and offering research subjects in developing countries inferior medications and standards of protection i have been allotted 650 words , insufficient for a pointbypoint refutation , so i 'll address a smattering of his many mischaracterizations and errors emanuel ignores how consistently medical apartheid quantifies my statements about the disproportionate use of blacks in abusive medical research for example , researchers' own statements reveal that the experimental development of gynecologic surgeries like caesarian section , vesicovaginal fistula repair and ovariotomy were perfected almost exclusively using enslaved black women the disproportionate theft of black cadavers was validated by records and events like the 1989 discovery of 9 , 800 bones , 75 percent from blacks , in the basement of the medical college of georgia s former anatomical laboratory dr eugene saenger s fatal radiation experiments in 1950s cincinnati were performed on a subject pool that was 75 percent black the subjects of many other radiation experiments were all black , like the patients at dooley and st phillip hospitals in virginia who were intentionally given thirddegree radiation burns by scientists for investigational purposes by 1983 , 43 percent of women sterilized by federally funded eugenic programs were black approximately 80 percent of the boys in the 1970s baltimore xyy studies were black , as were nearly all of the children in that city s kki lead study every boy in a 1990s new york city fenfluramine experiment was black medical treatment and publichealth initiatives can also constitute medical research emanuel disingenuously writes as if an initiative must be either one or the other in order to accuse me of conflation despite emanuel s bewildering claim to the contrary , the black stork chapter does focus heavily upon medical research , including racialized studies that fueled involuntary sterilizations , norplant and depoprovera investigations , research distortions that created the myth of the crack baby , and nonconsensual research with pregnant black south carolina women far from castigating directly observed therapy for tuberculosis , i lament that it is too often eschewed in favor of imprisonment thalidomide is indeed being given to black women subjects in africa , and researchers fear that its presence in semen may make its use in men hazardous despite emanuel s assertion , the book is supported by a plethora of notes filling 50 pages emanuel s tenuous grasp of history is typified by his nonexculpatory focus on tangential , ofttold events and by the errors crammed into the single sentence with which he attempts to reconstruct the usphs study of syphilis in the untreated negro male the men first were denied salvarsan , not only penicillin a significant minority obtained treatment the study s goals included not only observation but also a validation of a racially dimorphic progression of syphilis and diagnostic refinements researchers' goals could not be accomplished without autopsy , and so were not achieved before death he falsely claims that for washington , the answer comes down to one thing skin color actually , i describe a terrible confluence of factors that changed over time , including a precise variant , scientific racism my discussion of factors that tempered or trumped racism includes economics , politics , utilitarianism , communitarianism , black complicity , white beneficence , forbidden knowledge , deontological frameworks and socialjustice issues emanuel s failure to acknowledge these sophisticated arguments is a startling omission perhaps he is interested only in silencing them harriet a washington chicago to the editor ezekiel emanuel criticizes medical apartheid , a 501page litany of historical research abuses against africanamericans , for failing to place the experience of africanamericans in a broader social , historical , scientific and ethical context to support his point , emanuel argues that risky research has been conducted not only on blacks but also on other vulnerable populations this is certainly true but it is merely an argument for other books , not a reasonable argument against the need for medical apartheid there are few other groups in america whose historical exposure to abusive research could fill a volume of similar size from the infamous tuskegee syphilis study to the literally hundreds of other examples that washington meticulously documents , africanamerican subjects have been targeted for unethical research , in clear contradiction to emanuel s charge that they have not been singled out exclusively or even predominantly
when the national football league s freeagent signing period begins , todd france has a basic rule never stray far from a cellphone france is an agent for nfl players , and one of his clients , cornerback nate clements , is expected to be heavily pursued from the start of free agency , which officially began at 12 01 am today clements , 27 , has made the pro bowl twice in his six seasons with the , he has never missed a game and he has returned 5 of his 23 interceptions for touchdowns this is an opportune year for clements or any coveted free agent to cash in the league s salary cap is at a high of 109 million , 27 percent higher than it was two years ago teams like san francisco , new england , green bay and minnesota have at least 24 million under the salary cap to spend for a player as good as clements , who is expected to seek a signing bonus of at least 18 million , being a free agent this year is like having a royal flush in a highstakes poker game , with millions on the table just waiting to be raked in for an agent , this is the time when you get your rush the phone ringing , deals to be made , all the homework you 've done paying off , france said in a telephone interview wednesday from his office in atlanta things move quickly , and anything can happen the back and forth with teams can get crazy , but that s what free agency is all about france did not make clements available to comment but among possible suitors for clements are the jets , the giants , cleveland , new england , tennessee and washington with so many teams in the mix , clements has leverage , but he also has decisions to make an ohio native , would clements chose the browns over a super bowl contender like the patriots \? if france hears a blockbuster offer right away , will he advise clements to sign it \? or will they wait , and risk ignoring a good deal for a sweeter one that may never materialize \? that is part of the freeagency game , as teams , players and agents try to outmaneuver each other although free agency will officially start today , in reality , it began months ago with teams studying their rosters , their salarycap situations and potential free agents different teams take different approaches some will make aggressive opening bids , hoping to quickly land the players they want others will wait to gauge the market clements and france will have to decide which team to visit first when a free agent visits , teams offer the redcarpet treatment , hoping to persuade a player to sign before he leaves every team wants to get the first visit , france said that can be an advantage right there , making your pitch face to face before anyone else teams that single out the most prominent free agents do not always get the best results last season , three highprofile players guard steve hutchinson of the minnesota vikings , running back edgerrin james of the arizona cardinals and wide receiver antwaan randle el of the washington redskins signed with new teams as free agents none of those teams made the playoffs the 49ers insist their capfriendly position will not necessarily make them lavish spenders on the open market free agency is about getting better players , not the money , 49ers coach mike nolan said last week during the league s scouting combine we do n't have a quickfix mindset we wo n't but when the bidding starts , the 49ers could find it difficult to ignore a proven player like linebacker adalius thomas , who had 11 sacks for the baltimore ravens last season still in his prime at age 29 , thomas could add a passrushing dimension to san francisco s defense , and he already played for nolan when he was an assistant coach in baltimore the freeagent market includes few impact defensive players , which should increase the market value of clements and thomas defensive end dwight freeney of the indianapolis colts and linebacker lance briggs of the chicago bears , who would have been coveted free agents , instead were given the franchise tag by their teams that means clements could become this year s highestpaid free agent for france and clements , it could be difficult to know when they have received their best offer france recalled another year , when a team told him it was no longer interested in one of his clients days later , the same team called back with a better offer sometimes , another player that they thought they were going to get slips away , france said then they come back to you that s the kind of thing that happens asked to name the hardest part of free agency , france laughed probably the phone ringing , he said gives me a headache sometimes but when it rings , it could be good news moments later , france ended the conversation got to go , he said one of my phones is ringing
paris on a recent tuesday inside the , the german artist anselm kiefer was standing on a piece of scaffolding high in the air , relaying instructions to a group of men manipulating a crane carefully they hoisted a mound planted with a dozen atrophied aluminum sunflowers into an oversize niche in the wall the mound is part of a major art installation by mr kiefer , the first permanent contribution to the louvre s d cor since georges braque painted the ceiling of henri ii s former antechamber in 1953 it goes on view thursday in a stairwell linking the egyptian and mesopotamian antiquities in the museum s sully wing built in 18089 by napoleon s personal architects , the stairwell is an elegant space graced by corinthian capitals and basreliefs depicting antique gods and allegorical figures \( history relates that one of the four original sculptors died after falling from the scaffolding \) on one blank wall mr kiefer has produced a monumental painting over 30 feet high and nearly 15 feet wide that he describes as a selfportrait it portrays a naked man flat on his back under a starry nighttime sky a faint beam of light runs between his solar plexus to the constellations he s not dead , but in the universe , mr kiefer said with satisfaction he named the roughly textured painting athanor , for the alchemical furnace that transforms base metal to gold and mortality to immortality at the bottom he affixed a layer of cracked reddish soil \( from barjac in southern france , where he makes his home \) , onto which he poured liquid lead farther up there s a dusting of silver , then gold , representing the three stages of the chemical process the stars are recycled from mr kiefer s old paintings of snow when snow blows around , it s like stars , he explained the sky is moving all the time for the two facing niches at the top of the stairs he created a pair of sculptures he likens the earthlike mound with sunflowers , titled hortus conclusus latin for enclosed garden to the hill where jesus was crucified across from it is dana , in which a giant blackened depetaled sunflower emerges from a pile of lead books \( in greek mythology zeus impregnated dana in the form of golden rain \) at the sculpture s base a scattering of golddipped seeds alludes to the immaculate conception the symbols will be familiar to followers of mr kiefer s oeuvre , and it is striking how at home his art looks in the precincts of the louvre , with its somber tones and ancient references his art calls out to this museum , said marielaure bernadac , the louvre s chief curator of contemporary art , because he s a painter of history and mythology his contribution will be followed by those of three other artists over the next three years the american artist cy twombly will paint the vast white ceiling in the salle des bronzes , and fran ois morellet of france will decorate the windows of the lefuel stairwell the fourth artist was meant to be luciano fabro of italy , but he died last summer , and his replacement has yet to be announced the delicate nature of the undertaking is reflected by its having been in the air for decades after braque s ceiling project of 1953 , a succession of the louvre s directors wanted to commission work by living artists , but none of them succeeded , ms bernadac said then , in 2003 , the museum s current presidentdirector , henri loyrette , hired ms bernadac to work full time on integrating contemporary art into the museum with the softspoken demeanor of an academic ms bernadac seems an unlikely figure to be shaking things up but the museum has n't looked quite the same since her arrival from anish kapoor s huge curved mirror in the middle of the khorsabad courtyard to mike kelley s video projections in the medieval moats , she has repeatedly implanted temporary exhibits of contemporary artwork side by side with ancient artifacts she said she was following a trend that the french have been slow to embrace the anglosaxons had been doing this for more than 10 years , she said i thought , why do n't we do the same thing at the louvre \? ' the selection committee for the four planned permanent installations , made up of directors from european art institutions , looked for internationally renowned artists with experience creating largescale works for public commissions the staircases , ceiling and so on were chosen because they were the only places left , ms bernadac said mr kiefer said he was thrilled when mr loyrette offered him the stairwell between the egyptians and sumerians philippe dagen , an art critic for le monde , has followed ms bernadac s progress with interest she s had a lot of difficulty with the other curators , who have tried to block her , he said monsieur loyrette is on her side , but that s just two people facing everything from indifference to outright ill will ms bernadac admitted that the new projects have created tensions within the staff all of a sudden we 're seeing living artists in a museum where they never were before , she said it seems to go against the very nature of the louvre mr kiefer put it more wryly living artists are much more complicated than dead artists and yet from the time of its creation this building has been a living space various monarchs added new wings to the palace and the museum , hiring painters and sculptors at will , turning it into a monument where the d cor remains as attention grabbing as the art yet with the arrival of the impressionists in the 1860s , there was a divorce between france s curators and contemporary creation , mr dagen said for the following century the museum seemed to project a disdain for living artists in 1947 picasso was granted his wish to hang some paintings in the louvre s grande galerie but on a tuesday , when the museum was closed , and on the condition that they were removed by wednesday in 1953 braque was invited to paint his three panels in the ceiling of the salle henri ii , but his twodimensional birds created a public uproar similar objections were famously raised to i m pei s glass pyramid entrance , inaugurated in the louvre courtyard in 1989 critics argued that the louvre was an architecturally coherent building and must n't be touched , mr dagen said that just is n't true mr kiefer , mr twombly and mr morellet s contributions might blend in more easily all three have classical sensibilities and are comfortable expressing themselves via painting and sculpture you could n't ask bill viola to create something permanent here , mr dagen said , referring to that artist s video works the building has a weighty history , and it favors traditional modes of expression and though at times the history here might seem to weigh as much as the sixthcentury bc colossal stone jar a few rooms from mr kiefer s new work , ms bernadac argues that the contemporary installations are worth the effort the presence of contemporary art reawakens our way of looking at art from the past , she said mr kiefer agrees artists do n't create ex nihilo , he said they are rooted in tradition , with a long history someday , it seems , his contribution will form part of that narrative he pointed to his towering sunflower , made of leadcoated resin normally i prefer to use real sunflowers , but they disintegrate , he said the louvre wants this around for the next 2 , 000 years
the feeding frenzy is on as george mitchell gets closer to writing and issuing his report on the use of performanceenhancing substances in baseball , the prospect of seeing names in the report has people in major league baseball nervous and the news media tingling with anticipation an incident last week demonstrates the focus on names , names , names a report thursday on the boston globe s web site , citing two player agents as sources , said that union officials had briefed agents at a meeting in new york on wednesday and told them that 11 free agents would be named in the mitchell report  my reaction went beyond skepticism there was no way , i believed , that the union knew what players would be named in the report they knew which players mitchell wanted to talk to , and they knew that none of those players had talked to mitchell s investigators but they had no idea if mitchell would name them in his report at this point , mitchell himself may not know what he plans to do he may not have decided just how juicy he will ultimately make the report so there was no way union officials could have said what they were quoted as having said when union officials , who had moved on from new york to los angeles for another agents meeting , were reached thursday night and asked about the globe report , they explained what they had told the agents and why they told them it goes like this earlier in the week , at their annual meeting , in orlando , fla , baseball s general managers had been asked by reporters if the possibility of players being named in the mitchell report would have a negative impact on the freeagent market at least one general manager said it might affect his thinking noticing that response , union officials checked the two lists they had the 139 players who at that point had filed for free agency and the dozens of players mitchell had invited to meet with his investigators and found that only 11 names matched from the union s point of view , this was good news , because 11 names out of a far larger group of free agents did not seem likely to have an inhibiting effect on the freeagent market that was the message they conveyed to the agents at the wednesday meeting but not all agents are rhodes scholars , and two left the meeting with a garbled message good luck to their clients this winter by the time the accurate story got out , the inaccurate story had gained widespread circulation even in more accurate reports , emphasis was placed on the idea that 11 players could be named , not that the number was probably too small to have an impact on the freeagent market which is the sexier story \? the names , of course in recent months , players have been named as having received shipments of performanceenhancing substances from a group of clinics and pharmacies that have been the subject of an investigation by the albany county district attorney not all of the substances were banned by baseball when the players were said to have received them , but they are now the names of these players have emerged in a curious manner , the way water drips from a leaky faucet , mostly one at a time , mostly to different news outlets and often at times that made the names bigger news than they might have been at other times paul byrd , a cleveland pitcher , was named in a newspaper report on the day of game 7 of the american league championship series against boston rick ankiel of st louis was named at the height of his , and the cardinals' , remarkable comebacks ankiel was hitting better than 350 , and the cardinals were only a game out of first  the way the names have been leaked would suggest that no news outlet has all of the names on the district attorney s list rather , it appears that someone , or more than one person , with access to the list has leaked them selectively to embarrass the players in no steroids investigation have players been the targets the balco investigation by the united states attorney in san francisco centered on steroids distributors , not players remember him \? has been singled out not for steroids use but for the possibility that he perjured himself in his grand jury testimony about steroid use one theory that would explain the leaks of the names linked to the pharmacy and clinic shipments is that one or more persons involved in the investigation are not satisfied that the players are n't targets and want to make sure the public and baseball become aware of their suspected involvement but whatever the motivation , it s all about the names anyone leaking the names knows the news media live for the names when mitchell issues his report , he could make reporters' jobs easier by listing all of the names he includes in an index at the front of the book , giving page numbers for each he could list them alphabetically , he could group them by teams , he could group them by positions that way no one would have to spend waste time wading through the report to dig out all of the names the aim of the game , after all , is to get the names , right \?
isfahan , , feb 3 iran opened one of its nuclear sites to a large number of local and international reporters and a delegation of foreign ambassadors on saturday in an effort to show the transparency of its program before a united nations security council deadline this month delegations from the nonaligned movement , group of 77 and league of arab states arrived at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran with nearly 100 reporters the delegation included representatives from the united nations nuclear agency from algeria , cuba , egypt and malaysia , though none were official inspectors iran has kept up efforts to give the isfahan facility more publicity , and a senior tourism official said late last year that iran planned to open it and other nuclear sites to foreign tourists iran s ambassador to the , ali asghar soltanieh , said saturday that the purpose of the tour was to assure the world that iran s program was peaceful in fact we have representatives from all over the world , mr soltanieh said we decided to have them come here and see for themselves he emphasized that surveillance cameras of the united nations' international atomic energy agency were in place there photographers and video camera operators were not allowed to take pictures in the outside area of the compound but the visitors were given special clothes , gloves and masks to protect them from radiation and toured the main facility for nearly an hour the isfahan site is where uranium ore is converted into yellowcake and gas the gas is then transferred to a more sophisticated facility in natanz , where it could be enriched with centrifuges reporters on saturday passed the natanz enrichment facility but were not permitted to tour the site , where iran recently said it was installing 3 , 000 centrifuges the facility is near the main road , and like isfahan , it was surrounded by antiaircraft artillery the isfahan site also had airraid bunkers iran insists that its program is for electricity production , but the united states and european countries contend that it is part of an effort that eventually could produce enough highly enriched uranium to make nuclear weapons the tour occurred as a united nations deadline neared this month for iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program or face tougher economic sanctions the united nations security council passed a resolution on dec 23 banning the trade of goods and technology related to iran s nuclear program president mahmoud ahmadinejad has brushed off the sanctions as insignificant and has vowed to continue with the program
on any summer day , central park teems with recreational runners trying to log a few miles , burn some calories and escape cramped apartments and offices this week , among those throngs of new yorkers laboring behind their jogging strollers and shuffling along with their ipod shuffles were a few of the country s top marathoners , who visited the park with a more serious purpose preparing for the united states olympic trials they learned firsthand what every jogger in new york already knows central park is not flat olympic hopefuls cannot expect a swift path to the beijing games i was hoping it would be the same course as the , which i 've done so many times , and done so well in , said meb keflezighi , the 2004 olympic silver medalist , who trained in central park for four days this week that would have been a big advantage for me but the criterium course levels everybody out the trials are scheduled for nov 3 on a course that will hark back to the early days of the new york city marathon , before it moved out of central park and became a fiveborough tour competitors will stay within the confines of the park for more than 24 of the event s 262 miles about 120 american men will race over the fiveloop course , with the top three finishers earning a spot on the united states team at the 2008 beijing olympics after starting at rockefeller plaza , the competitors will enter the park at seventh avenue and head west , running one 4mile loop , then four 51mile loops before finishing near tavern on the green although athletes will be spared the steepest climbs \( and descents \) at the north end of the park , the course s relentlessly rolling hills and frequent turns will make it challenging , particularly for rhythm runners who excel on long , flat stretches where they can settle into one pace the course definitely favors strong runners that can handle surging , said mary wittenberg , the chief executive of the new york road runners , the organizer of the olympic trials there s no easy stretch the worst thing anybody could do would be to underestimate the course , and none of the athletes are doing that they 're all coming in to see it abdi abdirahman , who was born in somalia and lives in tucson , stayed in town to study the course this week after finishing second sunday in the nyc halfmarathon i do n't want to let out all my secrets , but i took a measurement of all the hills , to see which ones i'm going to attack , which ones to take easy , said abdirahman , 30 , a twotime olympian in the 10 , 000 meters now i can find a similar course to central park when i get home the week was as much a mental training tool as a scouting mission for abdirahman by running a hard nine miles on the trials course monday , the day after the halfmarathon , he was able to experience the pain of pounding through central park on fatigued legs running the course when i had done a hard 13 miles the day before gave me the feeling of the last couple of miles , when you 're tired , abdirahman said , referring to latter stages of a marathon that s an advantage just to know what the course can do to you when you 're hurting keflezighi , a native of eritrea who , like abdirahman , has made two united states olympic teams , said he planned to prepare for the trials much as he did for the athens games three years ago running 130 miles a week at his training base in mammoth lakes , calif , with hilly tempo runs and interval work done at an altitude of 9 , 000 feet of course , it s not going to be a speed race , keflezighi said , but he added that he would still incorporate speed work in his training it means do whatever i did for athens , or close to it , and i'm going to be ok wittenberg agreed that the course suited strength runners , but said she still expected the winner to finish in under 2 hours 10 minutes a pace of less than 5 minutes a mile she also said she thought there were six men in the trials field capable of competing for a medal in beijing they have to be as ready as they would be to run the olympics to get on the team , she said abdi , ryan hall , who have run 2 08s , and meb , who s capable of doing that they cannot afford to go with a slow pace , because it s going to let a lot of people in keflezighi , who has finished second and third in the new york city marathon , also acknowledged the danger of being too conservative on a challenging course i think there will be some people going out fast and putting the hurt on early and seeing who can survive , he said in that case , you just have to be careful otherwise , if two or three guys go , those are the spots , so you have to respond right away , he added , referring to the three spots available for the olympic team and for the three men who do survive the rigors of the trials course , what kind of terrain awaits them in beijing \? it s flat as a pancake , said keflezighi , who had a virtual tour of the beijing course on a dvd they say it s going to be a fast course definitely if you make it through here , it s going to be a lot easier than central park

this was in more innocent times , more na ve times , when steroids was not yet a fourletter word this was 10 years ago an unlikely tino martinez had won the home run derby the day before the allstar game in cleveland , and the allstars were talking about what else \? home runs and the likelihood of someone breaking roger maris s season record , 61 i think it can happen , david cone , the yankees' allstar pitcher , said the names of and were mentioned as the most likely candidates to break the record they have home run swings they consistently get the ball in the air , said frank robinson , who with 586 home runs was fourth on the career list the question now is , will they stay healthy and still have the consistency over the second half that they had in the first half if they 're in a pennant race , how are the pitchers going to pitch them \? are they going to walk them \? who s hitting behind them \? but they definitely have a good shot this year at the break , mcgwire had 31 home runs , griffey 30 mcgwire , who was traded by oakland to st louis 24 days later , finished the season with 58 , griffey with 56 was not mentioned in the conversation he had 20 home runs and finished with 40 , giving him a good but not especially noticeable career total of 374 mcgwire made a prophet of cone , albeit a year later , 1998 , by slugging 70 home runs it was that same year , according to the remarkable book game of shadows that an envious bonds embarked on a regimen of performanceenhancing substances shedding his power envy , bonds has whacked 399 home runs in the decade since the 1997 home run derby he was 0 for 2 with two walks last night in milwaukee and remained two home runs shy of henry aaron s career record , 755 steroids \? what steroids \? i'm not getting into that controversy , robinson said last week when asked about slipping down the career home run list what controversy , i asked over the telephone you know what i'm talking about , he replied several years ago , when the steroids controversy heated up , robinson refused to talk about it however , at a memorabilia show in cincinnati in november , robinson , a hall of famer , made some comments to the cincinnati enquirer about the subject let s take barry bonds , robinson said you do n't get better as you get older he alluded to bonds' home run production 209 from age 36 \( 2001 \) to age 40 \( 2004 \) asked last week if that was the kind of circumstantial evidence baseball officials , writers and fans should consider in judging what bonds has done , robinson said , i'm not going to get into that should major league baseball do something about bonds and the record \? if it s proven , he said other than that , what is baseball supposed to do \? i do n't really know what i really think because i do n't have any information on who , what , when , where , said robinson , who works for major league baseball but would n't let that fact inhibit his public view people think it s one thing we have no idea what s out there until someone proves to me that someone actually used it , i have no thoughts on it whatsoever if it s proved that someone used enhancing drugs , that s something else bonds rocketed past robinson on the career list the year after bonds shattered mcgwire s season record sammy sosa , like bonds and mcgwire a suspicious character in the steroids lineup , shot past robinson in 2005 , and griffey , who has never engendered steroids suspicion , supplanted him as no 6 on the list last week asked about griffey , robinson displayed a far different attitude i'm very happy for him , robinson said i'm proud of him i'm happy to see him back healthy and playing well i do n't have a problem with people passing me i passed a lot of people going up the ladder it does n't bother me someday , perhaps robinson will be as candid about bonds lessappealing trade bait baseball people are whispering about florida s no 1 pitcher , dontrelle willis something is n't right with him because of that or other reasons , the marlins may be ready to trade willis or maybe the marlins will hold on to willis , a 25yearold lefthander , to build his trade value back to where it had been whatever their reason , the marlins are quietly trying to move him jeffrey loria scoffed at the whispers you 're hearing those things from baseball people , loria , the marlins' owner , said , because they would like that it s not coming from me i have no comment every year it s the same stuff i'm not saying anything for the four years he s been here , between june 15 and july 15 , there are rumors we 're going to trade him people create their own rumors i ca n't control rumors i have no comment on rumors willis has not won since may 29 in nine starts since , he has a 06 record and a 564 earned run average , bringing his season record to 79 and his season era to 513 time to take stock now is the time for clubs to decide whether they want to be buyers or sellers , whether they are in a race or not the deadline for making trades without waivers is july 31 the chicago white sox , only two seasons removed from their world series championship , are foundering in fourth place behind three good teams they could trade one to three of their established players right fielder jermaine dye and second baseman tadahito iguchi , who can be free agents , and pitcher jos contreras , whose contract the white sox would be happy to shed the texas flea market is open , but it has many questions two pitchers starter vicente padilla and reliever akinori otsuka are on the disabled list , starter kevin millwood has been on the list twice this season with a hamstring problem , and teams are n't convinced about the durability of reliever eric gagn mark teixeira and sammy sosa could be available to teams seeking a hitter other pitchers who could be had for the right price are relievers kyle farnsworth and mike myers \( the yankees could replace them with chris britton and sean henn \) and octavio dotel and zack greinke of kansas city , and starters matt morris of san francisco and the oftinjured rich harden of oakland once the losing starts chris capuano was integrally responsible for the early lead the milwaukee brewers took in the national league central , winning five of his first seven starts and losing none the brewers also won his other two starts for a 70 record capuano , a 28yearold lefthander , however , has n't won since may 7 and has lost 6 of his last 10 starts the brewers have lost the other four starts as well until capuano lost , the brewers had a 2511 record since he began losing , they are 2932 , including an 80 defeat yesterday against san francisco a lot of arms , and little success the st louis cardinals have plenty of reasons for their postworld series championship travails , but their pitching is a good place to start they have used 22 pitchers this season , including 9 starters , compared with 19 pitchers , including 9 starters , all last season not much the cardinals have tried with their pitching has worked they resigned mark mulder despite his shoulder operation , and he has n't been able to help them they signed kip wells as a free agent , and he has a 412 record and a 575 era they brought adam wainwright and braden looper out of the bullpen and put them in the starting rotation , and they have a combined 1615 record last month , they obtained mike maroth from detroit , where he had a 52 record he has a 03 record in five starts for the cardinals , losing his last three starts while giving up 17 earned runs in 15 innings for a 1020 era then there s anthony reyes , the pitching star of the cardinals' game 1 victory in the world series he is back in the minors after staggering to a 010 record in 12 starts with the cardinals not so fan friendly before the 199495 players strike , players were cautioned not to throw baseballs into the stands lest a fan be hit and sue major league baseball players were fined if they ignored the edict with the devastation the strike caused , however , baseball took the opposite approach , encouraging players to give fans baseballs after the last out of an inning , for example chad qualls , a houston relief pitcher , took the new approach a step further and last week served a threegame suspension for throwing a ball into the stands during a game in anaheim , calif \( that s where the angels play , not los angeles \) they 're encouraged to give balls to fans , said bob watson , the official who suspended qualls we want players to be fan friendly and give balls to fans what he did was totally different from what you see guys doing after the third out what qualls did was out of frustration and out of anger watson said that qualls was trying to throw it out of the stadium , and he came up short you know how hard you have to throw it to get it out of the stadium \? it landed in the upper deck behind first base qualls was upset because he squandered a 94 lead by allowing five runs in the seventh inning after he took a throw covering first base for the final out of the inning , qualls , a 28yearold righthander , heaved the ball into the upper deck he said later that he was frustrated by the way the angels scored , banging out a succession of ground balls for hits the angels won the game , 109 qualls appealed his suspension , hoping to have it reduced , but he lost and also had to pay a 3 , 000 fine
obviously this was an incredible day and victory for us , said former arkansas governor mike huckabee of saturday s iowa republican straw poll what happened for us today was stunning a curious statement , perhaps , given that huckabee was soundly trounced by mitt romney he finished with 18 percent of the vote to romeney s 32 percent but then again , given the haphazard nature of the ames event , perhaps close doesn t only count in horseshoes jonathan martin , the politico s republicanwatcher , certainly thinks so  mike huckabee picked up 181 percent to finish in second place , besting kansas sen sam brownback , who came in third with 153 percent the two social conservatives tangled here over the past two weeks , both vying hard for many of the same voters and battling for their political viability despite spending far less money to get his voters here , huckabee came out on top , offering a fresh boost to his underfunded campaign and calling into question brownback s ability to continue in the race huckabee appeared to succeed through a combination of charm , guile and his chief rival s negativity some feel , however , that winning really was winning rudy giuliani and john mccain decided to sit iowa out , which left the field pretty much to romney , writes the conservative blogger jimmie at the sundries shack the only question was how much he d win by given that he spent approximately a bajillion dollars on barbecue and pony rides , he did just about what he was supposed to do it gives him some leverage on giuliani and mccain , which he very much needs kyle e moore at comments from left field thinks one of the major stories revolves around someone who s note even running \( yet \) moore writes i think it s important to note how low noncandidate fred thompson placed , finishing even lower than the almost nonexistant tommy thompson at seventh the man who months ago was being lauded by a slew of conservatives as the savior of the field , the next ronald reagan , and the presumptive frontrunner did not back this up with performance at voting booths here i think this can be an even further indicator that excitement over the former law order star is starting to wane while ron paul s fifthplace finish must be considered a disappointment to his campaign , one big supporter , richard barnes at disinter , suspects skullduggery after a very long delay before releasing the diebold results due to a voting machine malfunction ron paul came in 5th place with 1 , 305 votes keep in mind the person charged with oversight of this poll is none other than one of mitt romney s paid staffers , mary mosiman , who just happens to be the county auditor convenient now , who will be dropping out after this \? asks brian at iowavoice , who offers a good roundup from the center of the action he continues well , tommy thompson has already gone on record to say that if he didn t win or take second he d be dropping out , so he doesn t count other than that , i d have to say that duncan hunter and tom tancredo are certainly on the short list of who i would think would be dropping out soon both are oneissue candidates \( tancredo illegal immigration , hunter china trade \) , and while i like both of them a lot , i think they d be a greater asset to us if they stayed in congress like many on the left , steve benen at talking points memo feels that the big loser is the entire gop  keep in mind , organizers hoped for 20 , 000 strawpoll participants today , and the total was just over 14 , 000 eight years ago , nearly 24 , 000 republicans took part in the event some of this , it s fair to say , is the result of some toptier candidates deciding not to participate in ames , but it also speaks to the ongoing lack of enthusiasm for the gop field of candidates if that s the true lesson , it s hardly one that mitt romney wanted to spend an estimated 5 million to learn
shady cove , ore business at book n more has picked up louis l'amour moves quickly agatha christie , too never mind the missing covers and coffee stains people just need the stories , and here in jackson county there are fewer and fewer places to find them the trouble started either in 1908 or on april 6 it was 99 years ago that the federal government took control of much of the rugged landscape , eventually arranging to pay counties part of the proceeds from what then seemed an infinite expanse of timber to cut in april , jackson county did the unthinkable it closed all 15 of its public libraries , because their operating money , the timber money , is gone now the question is whether may 15 will be another turning point with the timber industry in steep decline because of environmental challenges and market changes and with prospects uncertain that congress will bail out timber counties , as it has before , jackson county voters will decide that day whether to increase taxes to pay for the libraries some other counties in southern oregon are in equally dire straits in josephine county , voters will decide on may 15 whether to tax themselves an average of 300 more a year to keep basic law enforcement services running curry county , which also has a ballot measure , has said it could go bankrupt on july 1 in jackson county , voting yes on the library measure would raise property taxes about 9 a month for an average homeowner , enough to finance the 8 million annual budget of the library system experts expect the vote to be close somebody called me on the phone last night and asked me how i was going to vote , said russell cagwin , 80 , a retired builder in this town of 2 , 300 that now welcomes middleincome retirees and gives raftriding tourists a push down the rogue river i told them , i do n't think i 've ever been in a library in my life' mr cagwin said he had not ruled out voting for the measure , but , echoing many others , he also said it never should have come to this seven years ago , jackson county voters approved a 39 million bond measure to build or renovate all 15 libraries some of those libraries continue under construction , even as most of the 117 employees in the system have been laid off susan drown , who owns book n more , summarized the frustration of her customers , saying , they just saw them build all these buildings , and they feel like , why do we even have a budget if people ca n't budget \? ' the county administrator , danny jordan , said the problem was not that simple mr jordan said none of the 39 million to build libraries could be used for operational costs because the bonds were specifically sold for construction in addition , a change in state tax laws in the 1990s limited how much counties could increase property taxes each year timber counties are being hurt by the change , because , thanks to the timber payments they had been receiving , many had much lower tax rates than other counties the loss of the payments , about 23 million for jackson county , has also led the county to reduce road work and public safety in the 273 million county budget this year the county is reducing the number of jail beds and eliminating the supervision of some criminals , including some sex offenders we do n't necessarily like what we 've done , mr jordan said but we have a balanced budget , and we 're moving forward from here the timber payments faded fast in the '90s , in part because pressure from environmentalists seeking to save the northern spotted owl sharply reduced harvesting on federal lands in 2000 , congress approved a measure that gave timber counties in oregon and other states the money that they would have received if timber were still being harvested at strong levels that program expired last september this year , oregon lawmakers have pushed a measure to extend some federal support through 2011 , but it has yet to pass a oneyear extension of the program was included in the iraq war spending bill that president bush has vetoed some officials say the solution is to restore the timber industry the real problem is this segment of absolutists that will not tolerate any use of federal lands for timber resources , dennis c w smith , a county commissioner , said the library s closing , mr smith said , is a case of the chickens coming home to roost county voters could have saved the libraries in november , but they rejected a tax measure that would have provided temporary money for operations many people attributed the defeat to a presumption that congress would come through with new money now , with the libraries closed , some people may vote differently even if the federal money was extended , it would have an expiration date so would the library measure on the ballot for may 15 the measure would cover costs for three years , although supporters say that would be enough time to relieve the financial crisis by increasing taxes or reducing other programs across the county from shady cove , the gray areas of the debate evaporate inside the city limits of ashland there , where the annual shakespeare festival attracts tourists to the bard s inn and bloomsbury books , schoolchildren held a sitin at the library branch in an effort to keep it open on the steps outside the library , plastic streamers flapped from a railing some quoted shakespeare to pore upon a book , to seek the light of truth other streamers cut to the chase , saying , we need to read !
marseille , france the other day , a dozen or so teenage rappers in baggy jeans and hoodies gathered outside a community arts center called le millepattes in noailles , a poor immigrant neighborhood here , hard by the old port one of this city s most successful hiphop artists , m'roumbaba sa d , who calls himself soprano , lately wrote a track called melancholic anonymous i ca n't help it , expressing my feelings , my melancholy in my lyrics , he rapped i can laugh at my sadness it helps when the slums outside paris and toulouse exploded last month , repeating the violence that erupted two years ago , here in marseille , france s secondlargest city , all remained calm back in july , in one of this city s impoverished northern neighborhoods , a 14yearold boy named nelson lobrygazelle was killed by a police car four hundred people demonstrated peacefully , so the incident barely made headlines as it happens , it was also a police car s killing two teenagers in villierslebel , a destitute suburb about 10 miles north of paris , that sparked the trouble that broke out across france in november a busburning here in october 2006 was considered an isolated incident and failed to ignite a local chain reaction the marseillais have plenty of explanations for this disparity , aside from the obvious one that the poor areas here are n't segregated on the city outskirts , as they are in paris but it is hiphop , as much a source of local pride as the town s soccer team , that turns out to be a lens through which to examine why this city did n't burn melancholy is the word often used to describe the local rap style melancholy as a reflective state of mind in contrast to the city s sunandsea context , melancholy actually suits lots of its culture a marseille novelist , jeanclaude izzo , who died just a few years ago , became famous in france for writing grim , pessimistic detective stories robert gu diguian , also from marseille , is a filmmaker whose reputation is based on dark movies rappers in marseille , some of the most original and distinctive ones anyway , compose sad odes to their local neighborhoods and hymns to the whole meltingpot city the sound of paris hiphop , slicker and more aggressive , adopts much from american gangsta rap , as marseille hiphop does too , but marseille boasts a groovier style it mixes in blues , flamenco , jamaican ragga the number that a decade or more ago helped fixed iam , the marseille group , on the french charts , borrows from george benson to lay down a mellow beat belsunce breakdown , about one of the city s downtown neighborhoods , by bouga , a rapper from there , begins with a hypnotic piano riff , jazzily syncopated a little steve reich crossed with 50 cent here the basic interconnectedness of all modern music expresses a local truth about the city s cultural identity an ancient , gritty seaport , marseille flaunts its history as an immigrant magnet its population of 820 , 000 includes 200 , 000 muslims , 80 , 000 north african jews , 80 , 000 armenians one of the largest immigrant groups is made up of muslims from the comoro islands , near madagascar three of the four musicians in psy4 de la rime , soprano s band , are comorians who grew up in the northern part of marseille where mr lobrygazelle died the fourth member of the band , dj sya styles \( of moroccan background , born rachid a t baar \) , like many of the teenagers at le millepattes , comes from noailles marseille lyrics can be full of rage but they 're not violent , the way those of certain parisian bands are two years ago 152 conservatives in the french parliament brought suit against seven rap groups , but notably none from marseille , for fostering hatred and racism against whites and for what one politician called antifrench sentiments psy4 , by contrast , wrote a rap not long ago called justicier i know all the cops are not that bad , but why do you always ask me for my id \? to your violence i prefer responding with my lyrics ca n't we have a proper dialogue \? the other evening psy4 occupied a recording studio in grottes loubi res , just northeast of the city during a break the members talked about the way rappers help one another here , and about how success comes not from landing studio contracts but from earning respect , ground up rap s not a business here , the way it is in paris , dj sya styles said it s not like paris , where the suburbs are just concrete here you first have to prove yourself in the neighborhoods st phane gallard put it another way paris is more hardcore he is the quiet , suave young man in charge of music programming for the nonprofit radio grenouille , the city s most popular hiphop station the fact that hiphop artists sell their music on their own blocks contributes to their identifying with marseille , and this explains why there s no car burning , he said different communities in marseille are still quite separate , there s racism here , but it s a city in which you have the freedom to move among communities if you choose it s also true that this city has a contrarian streak going back at least 2 , 000 years , to when it backed pompey over caesar you might say marseillais rappers reflect the tradition of pays , or local communities , to which their inhabitants maintain more powerful loyalties than to france at the same time , it s a place proud of its old corsican and frenchitalian mob heritage \( a popular downtown clothing store was named for a famous mob boss \) , and the prevalence of drug dealers and north african gangs does partly explain why there s relative calm in destitute areas calm is maintained for the sake of their businesses unemployment nears 40 percent in those same parts of town among those 18 to 25 it s 13 percent citywide , much more than the national average of 8 percent so clearly job opportunities alone , or their lack , do n't account for the absence of urban violence recently it helps that an old , mediterraneanstyle civic patronage system doles out favors to earn loyalty and keep the peace and , as everybody says , unlike paris , where immigrant poor occupy huge concrete blocks cut off from the city center , marseille has its neighborhoods , like noailles , that are smack in the middle of town , while the hardpressed quarters to the north are linked to the center by cheap public transport and remain inside city limits so residents feel that they belong to marseille , because they do , and in turn they feel that marseille belongs to them out of these communities , where musicians have their own version of a patronage system , the hiphop scene has emerged besides psy4 de la rime , iam and bouga , others , like keny arkana , faf larage , fonky family , dj rebel and prodige namor , have made it big here marseille rap never integrated violence the way paris did , philippe fragione told me he s akhenaton , the leader of iam he , like other older musicians here , supports younger marseille rappers it was his studio in grottes loubi res that psy4 was using marseille rap is more socially conscious , mr fragione added that s because there is a real sense of community i stopped in the waterfront office of paul colombani , the deputy director of the redevelopment program eurom diterran e with more than 5 billion in public and private investments , it plans , by 2012 , to turn some 25 miles of downtown into office towers , mixedincome apartments , museums and esplanades zaha hadid , jean nouvel and other archistars have signed on outside the porthole office window , the danielle casanova , an enormous white ferry , waited to carry passengers to algeria passengers coming back often bring knockoff goods that merchants hawk on sidewalks les jeunes errants , as migrant street children , some as young as 12 , are called , hide in boats , then head for noailles when they land a few have become aspiring rappers through community cultural centers like le millepatte mr colombani noticed my gaze that will be moved out of this area , he said about the ferry he meant to l'estaque , far to the north , easier for customs , he explained luxury cruise ships will dock here instead marseille can surely use the money , but hardly at the cost of undoing the social chemistry that has kept the peace and fostered , among other things , the city s musical life at le millepatte those dozen or so young rappers outside were a typical marseille mix first , second or thirdgeneration immigrants from algeria , morocco , the comoro islands , eastern europe , argentina habib was a skinny 18yearold with a doleful face and a band called urban revolution we all get along because we share music , he explained le millepatte had first encouraged him to rap as a young boy i did n't know what to do with my days , so this place was very important bacariane , a slightly older rapper wearing a new york yankees cap , its brim pressed down over his eyes , piped in this is a rough neighborhood , but there s not violence here without meaning , like in paris i lived there for a while , he said , meaning in the isolated suburbs outside the capital he paused to consider the difference here there is a culture of respect , he said we 're all marseillais
c j may is not happy my boss and others want to know if harvard is doing better than yale , and they want to know why , moaned mr may , 44 , a yale graduate turned yale employee the news is bad harvard is beating yale that the competition is in recycling does not diminish the angst it is personally troubling to me , said mr may , who has been yale s recycling coordinator for 17 years i 've been working very hard to make yale recycle i know we can do better it s now or never for mr may and his fellow elis , as the 10week national competition known as recyclemania enters its final week the contest ends april 7 begun in 2001 as a friendly wager between the recycling directors at ohio and miami universities , the contest this year involves 201 colleges and universities , more than double the number from last year , including 12 from new york state , 8 from new jersey and 3 from connecticut \( there are none from new york city \) the campuses compete for bragging rights only since there is no monetary prize in several categories , most of which use a formula to tally the amount each student , teacher and staff member recycles , so large and small schools can compete more equitably while winning is fun , the real goal , campus recycling coordinators and experts say , is actually getting young people , living on their own , to pay attention to where they throw their trash we have , in the united states , been establishing a recycling infrastructure for three decades , but when we look at rates , we are not improving , said kate m krebs , executive director of the national recycling coalition , a nonprofit trade organization in washington that runs the contest with the environmental protection agency national data shows that recycling over all is flat , ms krebs said , but it is especially poor among collegeage people , even though they grew up with recycling as a widespread practice when you look at demographics , the 18 to 24yearold sector makes little if any effort to recycle , she said it is heartbreaking for those of us who have been in the field for a long time college recycling directors say the competition helps shine a light on their efforts , which generally have been in place for years but are often ignored if you do n't make it absolutely convenient you walk out your door and there it is they do n't want to walk to the end of the hall , said kevin lyons , director of purchasing at rutgers university and a professor of environmental management mark smith , a sophomore at princeton and recyclemania coordinator , agreed there are kids that do n't want to recycle are n't going to do it no matter what , he said there are kids who carry around a bottle all day until they find a receptacle for it and then there are the kids who would do it if it was convenient that s who we want to get mr lyons has run the recycling effort at rutgers for 19 of its 20 years he prides himself on a recycling rate that approaches 60 percent and includes 20 different items , from the usual paper , bottles , cans and cardboard to fluorescent bulbs , electronic waste \( like inkjet and toner cartridges \) and food still , mr lyons admitted , rutgers did n't do so hot last year in its first recyclemania but this year , as of week 7 , it was close to being tied for the lead with california state university at san marcos , a twotime winner \( standings can be found at recyclemaniacsorg \) rutgers was also leading or contending in per capita recycling and three other categories bottles , cans and corrugated cardboard food service and gorilla , which measures gross tonnage to improve student participation , mr lyons s office ran a twoweek shredding effort \( which collected 75 , 000 pounds of paper and 4 , 700 pounds of cardboard \) , dormitory competitions and a sculpture contest using items that otherwise would have been thrown away all great for promoting recycling , but he would also like to beat princeton we would have a parade on nassau street , mr lyons said , referring to the main road adjacent to that campus princeton , however , is intent on topping the other four ivy league participants \( brown and dartmouth are competing , too \) , despite an audit that showed that 35 percent of the contents of dormitory trash cans were filled with recyclables which is why princeton s building services director , jonathan baer , says recyclemania is a plus win , lose or draw i think it s a good time , once per year , in an increased way , to focus on recycling that s not punitive or paternal , he said it s a time to reinforce our focus with some renewed energy michael youdelman , stony brook university s recycling and resource management director , said he figured the best way to get students to recycle was to take the bins to them so over christmas break , some 3 , 500 mixedpaper recycling bins were put in every dorm room people caught greenhanded doing something environmentally desirable are entered in a drawing for a green ipod jennifer myatt , a graduate student and outreach coordinator , runs a recycling information table offering pencils recycled from used currency and old jeans education , that s pretty much the hardest thing just educating people and getting them in the habit of recycling , ms myatt said we do n't even think about taking out our trash we can do the same with recycling the lamontdoherty earth observatory of columbia university , a small graduate research school in palisades , ny , with fewer than 600 students , discovered that all it needed to do well was to do what it had always done generate research proposals , which typically use huge amounts of paper in its first year of competition , the college is sitting atop the recycled paper category the next step is to figure out how to generate less of it , said mary reagan , who heads lamontdoherty s recyclemania effort but the contest , she said , had given her cold hard numbers for the first time confirming that recycling works amy cabaniss , environmental coordinator at connecticut college in new london , drew the same conclusion after finishing in the top five in four categories last year , including second in food service a result of the college s longstanding practice of sending food waste to a pig farm \( princeton has a similar arrangement at rutgers , food waste is pulped and dried , and what is left is sold to a cattle farm \) this year , a student at connecticut college mapped outdoor pedestrian patterns so recycling and trash bins could be placed more strategically , ms cabaniss said as of week 7 , connecticut was in the top five in bottles and cans and fourth in food service , and ahead of instate rivals wesleyan and yale , but just behind another small college in the area , bard college , in annandaleonhudson , ny bard s environmental resources auditor , laurie husted , said that despite offering prizes donated by local businesses , student participation had not been as strong as she had hoped still , recyclemania was stirring the pot i'm seeing the effects in other ways , she said which is what brings mr may at yale , ever the optimist , back to recyclemania for the fourth time he may never be able to overcome the inherent problem of yale s historic buildings , which have no halls , so recycling bins are in the basement , requiring a lot of student motivation but he hopes a new plan to pick up paper directly from desks will help our goal is to try to get up to 40 percent recycling in the next few years , mr may said if we can beat harvard in the process , all the better photos countdown to april 7 at stony brook university , a worker sorts mixed recycled paper , above , and two students , jennifer myatt , left , and kerri dobbs

orpheus , the isolated musician whose sufferings take him to hell and back , is the most potent archetype of the creative artist in greek mythology , as he has remained for the performing arts since the renaissance onstage we know him in innumerable works , from monteverdi s opera to the stravinskybalanchine ballet and a tennessee williams play , but none have more enduring dramatic resonance than gluck s orfeo ed euridice since gluck and his artistic collaborators built this opera with extensive dance opportunities in all three acts , it has always attracted eminent choreographers , and three of the greatest have chosen also to direct it george balanchine , frederick ashton and now  but is orpheus' story ancient or modern \? balanchine s 1936 staging at the metropolitan opera , designed by pavel tchelitchew , had hell as a concentration camp , scenery of changing threedimensional effects and astounding lighting mr ashton s 1953 covent garden production , starring kathleen ferrier , was designed by sophie fedorovitch in stylized grecian designs when mr morris first staged orfeo 11 years ago for the handel and haydn society , adrianne lobel and martin pakledinaz , designing , gave it the grecian look \( christopher hogwood conducted a periodinstrument account of the score , with michael chance as orfeo \) that staging , which i saw in edinburgh , came to the brooklyn academy of music in 1996 but now mr morris returns to orfeo at the metropolitan opera , with james levine conducting , and modern instruments and this time , following balanchine s met precedent , mr morris , working with allen moyer \( d cor \) and isaac mizrahi \( costumes \) , makes it moderndress well , sort of orpheus \( all in black \) , euridice \( in fulllength white \) , amor \( sneakers , wings and pink tshirt \) and all the dancers \( in a range of jeans , skirts , dresses and sneakers \) look contemporary but the outsize chorus placed behind the action along three tiers , observing and commenting is dressed by mr mizrahi as witnesses from history , with individual costumes , ranging from cleopatra to hiawatha the effect , like so much in mr morris s form of theater , is both campy and schematic of the few great artists working today , mr morris can be the most schematic , as he is here act i , being mourning , is gray and dark , with choral wave effects and a few gestures of grief earnestly delivered by orpheus and his dancer friends act ii , scene 1 , with its furies and damned spirits , is darker yet , and the dances are studies in confinement , with imagery of attempted escape and angled , staccato body language \( mr levine , a superlative dance conductor throughout , complements this with the hammering emphasis he brings to the great chorus chi mai dell'erebo \) the blessed spirits of the next scene , by contrast , are white and legato , flowing with serene body lines and celestial circle patterns act iii , scene 1 , in which orpheus and euridice are on the exit route from hell , is a diagonal tunnel carved through a glittering black rock face \( for both characters this is the most important scene so it s irritating that mr moyer makes them visible only from the waist up \) and the finale , in which amor reconciles husband , wife and friends , is the array of bright color we 've been craving , with movements combining legato and staccato and a range of formations and patterns with both singers and dancers facing front much of the time , it s easy to feel that mr morris is not so much telling a story as delivering a message , which since each dancer exchanges black , white and colorful versions of the same costume is surely about ways of seeing the world the focal point is mainly david daniels as orfeo what s fascinating in his performance is that , while his diction is at its most incisive , and his singing embodies orfeo s musicianship , his focus \( eyelids lowered \) is so often not on us or things or people but on himself and so this orfeo , like mr morris s danced account of purcell s dido and aeneas , may be read as a psychodrama this modern , bipolar , selfabsorbed , historyconscious artist paints the world black when things go wrong then escapes to a pure world where all is white and needs real help to be shown that life is a kaleidoscope as in his 1996 production , mr morris employs gluck s first italian version of the score , from 1762 this opera s various textual issues are as complex as those of hamlet or verdi s don carlos let s just say that the 1762 score omits some of the numbers and vocal lines familiar from later versions in 1996 mr morris placed intermissions after both act i and act ii now he runs it unbroken it lasts some 90 minutes admirably , it often happens in a morris production that the best feature is the music that is so again here but the nextbest feature , as in the 1996 staging , is the almost constant involvement of the group \( at least three of these dancers were in the earlier version i think , too , that mr morris employs a few of the same choreographic motifs as before \) there are times , especially in act i , when his staging seems like an unintegrated collage of gestural motifs but the more closely you watch the dancers , the more that impression fades actors often speak of the importance of truthfulness in performance these dancers exemplify it in the final scene a recurrent dance image of collaboration is a chair lift , in which one dancer is carried across the stage by others , as if seated astonishing how much fun this becomes watching , you feel as if you were being borne through the air too
to the editor re starve football , feed athletics , by jon vegosen \( oped , jan 28 \) with the signing of nick saban at the university of alabama for 4 million per year , it is clear that football expenditures are out of control as these exorbitant salaries are being paid , athletic departments across the country are reducing opportunities for student athletes to participate in nonrevenue sports , by cutting programs like tennis do these two divergent trends reflect the values of the ncaa \? i can only hope that the rutgers board of governors sees the value of the six teams slated for elimination and tips the scale in their favor akshay jagdale jersey city to the editor as a boardcertified pediatrician who has practiced for nearly 30 years , i was dismayed by your article about socalled minuteclinics \( the nurse practitioner will see you now , ' feb 4 \) virtually none of these clinics have onsite physicians to provide supervision it is claimed that these clinics will deal with a limited number of illnesses , but how can health care providers make diagnoses before patients are seen \? moreover , without hospital affiliations , how do we assure that necessary referrals and followups are provided \? one ca n't help but wonder whether the primary purpose of these clinics is to attract additional buyers or to provide firstrate medical care new jersey is blessed with a plethora of superbly trained pediatricians some pediatric practices , including our own , maintain office hours every day , including evenings , weekends and holidays if more physicians accommodate familial schedules , and accept a wide variety of insurance plans , uncompromised quality pediatric care can remain widely available to new jersey s children david m namerow , md ridgewood  to the editor the concept of minuteclinics always has a fascination with the press and public the fact is that very little of what i do as a family physician can be accomplished in a few minutes or is responsibly addressed by responding to a brief questionnaire in these rare instances , welltrained primary care physicians are usually using the remaining appointment time to focus on other meaningful health issues , such as preventive care or chronic disease surveillance or management many times that part of the office visit leads to other important diagnoses or interventions that have a major impact on a person s health these limitations and potential missed opportunities need to be understood by people and health care policy makers when they consider using or encouraging expansion of minuteclinic facilities terry shlimbaum , md lambertville
when visitors to the venice biennale arrive next week at the argentine pavilion to see paintings by guillermo kuitca , the buenos aires artist known for canvases based on maps , architectural blueprints and seating plans , they may wonder whether they are in the right place i can hardly recognize myself , mr kuitca , 46 , said on a recent afternoon at sperone westwater , his new york gallery , as he conceded that he found his four new epicscale works very strange the paintings , roughly 6 feet by 12 feet and meant to be seen in sequence , survey the fluctuating topography and history of abstraction over the last 100 years , since picasso and braque broke space into faceted planes with their development of analytic cubism the first canvas , a dark , dense cubist grid of folding space in allover pollockesque proportions , yields to the second , almost a mirage of shifting volumes with hints of duchamp s nude descending a staircase , lucio fontana s cut canvases and wifredo lam s modernistic jungle bearing in on the central cubist drama in the third work , a diptych , the thicket of convex and concave space on the right spills into an airy panel on the left and seems to stare in the face of a bloodred patch with painted slashes i like this sort of encounter of the cubist beast with the fontana , said mr kuitca , who gave the last canvas over to painted representations of fontana s cuts , loosely forming a crown of thorns on a mottled , light ground each titled desenlace , meaning disentangling , the works seem to depict a disentangling of cubism and different conceptualizations of space they also suggest the artist disentangling himself from those histories and influences it is an exploration of the baggage he has as an argentine painter , but it is the same baggage that many artists could carry from other countries , said in s katzenstein , the buenos aires curator of the argentine pavilion exhibition in venice what i do believe is specifically argentine is the way he mixes different traditions and periods with total liberty in a peripheral country , because of the distance we have with those central references , we also have the freedom to play with them ms katzenstein noted that the paintings would be hung on freestanding panels covered in black leather in a space with its own historical baggage a room heavily ornamented with baroque wall paintings of purgatory in the ateneo veneto , a 17thcentury building if mr kuitca is plumbing the collective unconscious of contemporary artists , he is also considering the experience of modern painting itself in these hermetic works at some point i said to myself , this is my one hundred years of solitude , ' mr kuitca said , laughing as he referred to the gabriel garc a m rquez novel solitude is a situation that exists per se for an artist , but also for the viewer in front of a painting we are alone movies are a shared experience , but painting is not maybe that solitude really started when picasso did the demoiselles' 100 years ago none of this was on mr kuitca s mind , however , when he began desenlace his only idea in approaching the first of the largerthanusual blank canvases was to paint while walking next to it , an echo of the early influence of the avantgarde dancer pina bausch mr kuitca said that he realized during a 1980 performance of hers that walking is enough in the process of pacing back and forth , making short diagonal strokes , mr kuitca saw that a cubist grid was beginning to present itself intuitively , as the spatial illusions formed , he added more complex movements he never referred specifically to any works by picasso , braque or latin american cubists , nor had he ever made a cubist work in his education as a painter born in 1961 , mr kuitca ca n't remember not painting his early talent was encouraged by his parents , and at 9 he began private training with ahuva szlimowicz , a surrealist artist he had his first gallery show at 13 and sold several pieces the typical path for a serious artist coming of age in buenos aires would be to move to new york or paris , but mr kuitca chose to stay in his homeland while sending his work abroad for exhibitions in 1986 he stopped showing his work in buenos aires for 17 years i wanted to play with the idea of exile , said mr kuitca , who represented his country in the 1989 s o paulo bienal , had a solo show in 1991 at the museum of modern art in new york that toured in the united states , and has exhibited extensively in galleries in the americas and europe for many years i explored how to be present and absent in my own place at the same time this sense of presence and absence has been a strong quality in his work , starting in 1982 with his understated paintings of his bed it was my home , my territory , and i understood the dramatic impact of an empty bed was much more intense than representing a person , he said his work expanded as if through a zooming camera lens the bed set in a scene , the scene in an apartment , the apartment in a city , the city on a map from there he depicted connections across time and geography , in paintings with weathered , ghostly surfaces based on genealogical charts or institutional blueprints of cemeteries , hospitals , stadiums , libraries , prisons there was a moment in 1996 , while he was buying a ticket at covent garden in london , that he realized the posted seating plan was drawn from the perspective of a performer onstage , looking out at the audience i realized i could do a 180degree turn and shift all the weight from the stage to the audience , mr kuitca said there are really many more dramatic things that could happen amidst this number of people getting together than anything that could happen on the stage a selection of his theaterrelated works will be shown in september in the metropolitan opera s gallery in new york more recently mr kuitca has done very realistic paintings of baggageclaim carousels but removed from the context of airports , leaving them floating in a samuel beckettlike limbo i like the idea of the unclaimed luggage revolving on this sleepless machine , he said , although to include luggage would be too literal for him guillermo s work is about how we map and navigate physical and psychological terrains and those social spaces where people s lives intersect , and the public and private get mixed , said olga viso , director of the hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden in washington she initiated the first united states retrospective of mr kuitca s work , which opens there in june 2009 and then travels to the miami art museum , the albrightknox art gallery in buffalo and the guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain there is this sense of dislocation that for him is a universal subject and the nature of contemporary life , ms viso said when you travel you have this sort of intimate connection with people you do n't know you share something with them , and your bags are all intermingled since 1994 mr kuitca has been compiling a suite of works titled diarios \( diaries \) , filled with doodles , lists , color proofs , email addresses and other traces of daily life in his studio all 38 round canvases in the series will be shown together for the first time in venice as part of the international exhibition think with the senses feel with the mind art in the present tense , organized by the robert storr , the 2007 biennale director the works' distinctive shape is derived from their pragmatic origin frustrated that objects kept falling between the planks of a circular wooden table in his studio , mr kuitca stapled a discarded painting over its top he found himself scrawling on this surface while on the phone or lost in thought it swallowed all the vague things that were around , and at some point i started to feel that that material was as rich as what i was trying to use officially for my work , he said the covers last sometimes for three months , sometimes for over a year , each forming a record of a certain increment of time i like to think that i do my journeys , my diaries , over my failures , mr kuitca said i can recuperate those works that had been hopeless is there a connection between his two projects in venice the diarios series and the four desenlace paintings \? i really wanted to make a break in my work , said mr kuitca , the son of a psychoanalyst eventually i would be very happy to amend my own version of what i 've done in the past because of the experience of doing these new works
mecca , five times a day across the globe devout muslims face this city in prayer , focused on a site where they believe abraham built a temple to god the spot is also the place muslims are expected to visit at least once in their lives now as they make the pilgrimage clothed in simple white cotton wraps , they will see something other than the stark black cube known as the kaaba , which is literally the center of the muslim world they will also see starbucks and cartier and tiffany and hm and topshop the abraj al bait mall one of the largest in saudi arabia , outfitted with flatpanel monitors with advertisements and announcements , neon lights , an amusement park ride , fastfood restaurants and a lingerie shop has been built directly across from islam s holiest site not everyone considers this progress mecca is becoming like las vegas , and that is a disaster , said ali alahmed , director of the institute for gulf affairs in washington , a saudi opposition research organization it will have a disastrous effect on muslims because going to mecca will have no feeling there is no charm anymore all you see is glass and cement the mall , which opened a week before the annual pilgrimage , called the hajj , in december , is the first phase in a 13 billion construction boom in mecca that promises to change how this city , forbidden to everyone but muslims , looks and feels the abraj al bait housing and hotel complex , a 15millionsquareyard development that will include a towering hotel , has begun to redraw the skyline of this ancient religious city when the project is completed in 2009 , it will include the seventh tallest building in the world , its developers say , with a hospital , hotels and prayer halls a publicannouncement system pipes in prayers from the grand mosque across the way , and worshipers can join the masses simply by opening their draperies in nearby jabal omar , an entire mountain is being flattened to make way for a huge hotel and highrise complex and elsewhere , cranes dot the skyline with up to 130 new highrise towers planned for the area this is the end of mecca , said dr irfan ahmed in london he has formed the islamic heritage foundation to try to preserve the islamic history of mecca , medina , the second holiest city , and other important religious sites in saudi arabia before , even in the days of the ottomans , none of the buildings in mecca towered higher than the grand mosque now these are much higher and more disrespectful money is certainly one of the motivators in the building boom every year , up to four million people descend on this city during the pilgrimage , while a stream continues to flow through here during the year , spending an average 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 to stay , eat and shop billboards along the way to mecca remind investors of the potential earnings from owning an apartment here some claim a 25 percent return on investment advertisements on arab satellite television channels remind viewers that you , too , can have the opportunity to enjoy this blessed view muhammad alabboud , a real estate agent , recounts tales of pakistani businessmen plunking down 15 million to buy several apartments at a time saudi princes own entire floors a threebedroom apartment here runs about 3 million , mr abboud said one directly overlooking the grand mosque can reach 5 million critics of the development complain that the result is gated communities where worshipers can separate themselves from the crowds , thereby violating the spirit of the hajj , where all stand equal before god all of mecca is a sanctuary , mr abboud said so how could something like this not be snapped up \? but some groups say the building boom also has religious motives they accuse the archconservative salafi , who hold great sway in saudi arabia , of seeking to eliminate historic spots , fearing that these sites would become objects of worship themselves dr ahmed of london has cataloged the destruction of more than 300 separate antiquity sites , including cemeteries and mosques he says the house where the prophet muhammad lived was razed and today a dilapidated library , with its windows and doors shuttered , stands in its place it is not respecting the kaaba , not respecting the house of god or the environment of the sanctuary , sami angawi , a saudi architect who wants to preserve mecca s heritage , said of the development you are not supposed to even cut a tree in this city , so how could you blow up a mountain \? the islamic laws have been broken progress has exacted a heavy price in mecca more pilgrims than ever can come here , thanks to billions spent on tunnels and infrastructure to accommodate them but in exchange , the city s once famed night market , where pilgrims brought their wares to sell , is gone the meccan homes and buildings that filled the area near the mosque were demolished in the 1970s to enlarge the mosque the neighborhoods and families who lived near the mosque and welcomed pilgrims have long since moved away mecca has long been a commercial as well as a religious center , but increasingly global brands dominate here mr angawi , the saudi architect , has led a lonely campaign within the kingdom to bring attention to the destruction of the historic sites dr ahmed has worked to lobby asian and arab governments to press the saudis to stop such demolitions and mr ahmed , in washington , has built a database of the historic spots now destroyed many muslims inside and outside saudi arabia have remained silent about the issues , they say , fearing the loss of financing from saudi arabia for religious institutions and projects saudi officials say they have been painstakingly preserving the islamic artifacts they find , and operate two small museums in mecca in all , they say , more than 19 billion has been spent on preserving the country s muslim heritage they dismiss their critics as cranks who have no following developers and real estate agents , meanwhile , say the construction makes room for even more muslims to take part in the hajj , and therefore serves the greater good that suggests that the changes are far from over mecca has never been changed like it has now , mr angawi said what you see now is only 10 percent of what s to come what is coming is much , much worse
east rutherford , nj , jan 2 in the excitement of a shootout against the on tuesday night , a game the felt they desperately needed to win , marcel hossa took the ice as the rangers' eighth shooter he followed a trail of sharpshooting teammates , including jaromir jagr , brendan shanahan and martin straka but if he was nervous in such a crucial spot , he betrayed none of it he just looked like the smoothest , coolest guy out there , shanahan said as hossa skated in on devils goalie martin brodeur , he pulled brodeur wide and calmly fired a shot into the upper left corner , then turned to smile at his teammates , who were celebrating wildly one more save by rangers goalie henrik lundqvist , on travis zajac , and the rangers were celebrating a 32 victory over a team that seems to bring out the best in them the victory pulled the rangers \( 20174 \) a point closer to the devils \( 22134 \) , who lead the atlantic division the rangers , 4 points behind the devils in second place , have won three of the teams' four meetings this season but the most important part of this one was mental just four days earlier , the rangers were mired in a sevengame losing streak they ended it with a home victory saturday against washington , but beating a struggling team at home does not offer the same boost in confidence that beating a firstplace team on the road does and they vanquished the devils in spectacular fashion lundqvist had stopped all 22 shots he had faced in the rangers' four shootouts this season , a record that came to a screeching halt when zach parise scored on the devils' first shot in all , lundqvist gave up three goals in the shootout but brodeur allowed goals to michael nylander shanahan , matt cullen and hossa it was the second time this season that hossa won a shootout for the rangers he put a shot through the pads of flyers goalie antero niittymaki in the 13th round on oct 7 in philadelphia hossa has scored only once in regulation this season his shot against the flyers , however , helped him climb a few notches up the shootout chart hossa said it had also increased his confidence in trying a far more difficult shot against brodeur i was thinking i would go fivehole again , but maybe my brother scored too many goals on him fivehole so he would think i was going to do the same , hossa said , laughing , referring to his brother marian , a star forward for atlanta who has scored 23 more goals than he has this season this time i did a different thing and it went through the devils said they were happy to collect a point for taking the game to overtime jamie langenbrunner s powerplay goal with 4 minutes 12 seconds left in regulation allowed them to tie the score at 22 it was a hardearned point , devils coach claude julien said we 'll take it and move on langenbrunner had a chance to win the game in the shootout as well , as the devils' seventh shooter , pulling lundqvist wide and nearly stuffing in a backhand but lundqvist stretched his glove to the right post and nudged the puck aside that turn of events allowed hossa to score the winner the rangers played a solid game to reach the shootout after falling behind , 10 , in the first on a goal by john madden , they came back on goals by nylander and petr prucha before langenbrunner tied it late the remarkable part of prucha s goal was how the puck got to him jagr deflected a pass from defenseman karel rachunek with his right skate and sent it to a waiting prucha , unguarded at the left post i tried to kick it in the net , jagr said i missed that i wanted to go top shelf i 'll be working on it tomorrow shootouts , it seems , have become a specialty for the rangers , who are now 51 in them and they can turn to their secret weapon when they need to win one it was a terrific move , renney said of hossa s shot this is one of the best goalies to ever play the game hoss should feel good about himself right about now slap shots rangers forward jed ortmeyer played his first game since doctors found he had a pulmonary embolism in august he played only nine shifts , for 5 minutes 35 seconds of ice time forward jarkko immonen was a healthy scratch devils defenseman colin white missed his fourth straight game with a groin injury

not since the victorian age of starched sheets and starchy manners , builders and architects say , have there been so many orders for separate bedrooms or separate sleeping nooks or hisandher wings in interviews , couples and sociologists say that often it has nothing to do with sex more likely , it has to do with snoring or with children crying or with getting up and heading for the gym at 5 30 in the morning or with sending email messages until well after midnight in a survey in february by the national association of home builders , builders and architects predicted that more than 60 percent of custom houses would have dual master bedrooms by 2015 , according to gopal ahluwalia , staff vice president of research at the builders association some builders say more than a quarter of their new projects already do what could be called the homesleepingalone syndrome is not limited to the wealthy for middleincome homeowners , it may be a matter of moving into a spare bedroom , the recreation room or the den in st louis , lana pepper , a light sleeper who battled for years with her husband s nocturnal restlessness , reconfigured the condominium they bought recently , adding walls to create separate bedrooms mrs pepper said the advantage to separate rooms was obvious my husband is still alive i would have killed him it was more than snoring , she said , recounting the bad old days of a shared bed he cannot have his feet tucked into any of the covers i have to have them tucked in so i took all the linens and split them with scissors then i finished the edge so that half of the sheet would tuck under and the other half he could kick out that did not help his snoring , so she bought a white noise machine she even went to a shooting range to buy a pair of those big ear guards they wear they did not suit her according to the national sleep foundation in washington , 75 percent of adults frequently either wake in the night or snore and many have taken to separate beds just for those reasons in a report issued tuesday , the foundation found that more than half the women surveyed , ages 18 to 64 , said they slept well only a few nights a week 43 percent believed their lack of sleep interfered with the next day s activities stephanie coontz , director of public education for the council of contemporary families in chicago , said many couples she interviewed were confident enough that they have a nice marriage , but they do n't particularly like sleeping in the same room i do n't think it says anything about their sex lives , ms coontz said mrs pepper , 60 , who cofounded st louis s annual shakespeare festival , takes her sleeping seriously on her nightstand is an arsenal of remote controls for the adjustable bed , the television , the lights , the humidifier and the dvd player her mattress is made from a foam developed by nasa that rests in a fourposter frame under a skylight at escala , a condominium project in seattle , a quarter of the 270 units have double master bedrooms , said john midby , a partner in the development in st louis county , dennis hayden , president of hayden homes , said that each of the 30 detached homes in his latest planned community would have two separatebutequal bedroom suites kristen scott , an architect in seattle , said about onethird of her empty nester clients asked for separate bedrooms , which can cost a few thousand dollars to more than 100 , 000 in honolulu , nancy peacock , an architect , said her clients increasingly requested punees , as daybeds are known in hawaii sometimes on the lanai , the covered porch of the house in st louis , carol wall , president of mitchell wall architects , said that three or four years ago her company began doing a lot of these little rooms off the master bedroom where the snorer would go more recently , couples , including some in their 30s , have started asking for two master suites , and we do n't ask any questions , ms wall said not everyone wants to talk about it many architects and designers say their clients believe there is still a stigma to sleeping separately some developers say it is a delicate issue and call the other bedroom a flex suite for when the inlaws visit or the children come home from college charles brandt , an interior designer in st louis , said , the builder knows , the architect knows , the cabinet maker knows , but it s not something they like to advertise because right away people will think something is wrong with the marriage an interior designer in chicago moved into her son s bedroom when he went off to college separate bedrooms are de rigueur for us , she said , adding that she and her husband sleep together on the weekends the couple asked that their names not be published fred tobin , a builder in north canton , ohio , is friends of a prominent couple in columbus whose house was remodeled with two master bedrooms the wife sleeps on one side of the house , the husband on the other it s a hushhush thing , mr tobin said the husband travels a lot , all the time , and he comes home late , and he wants to be able to check his email and go to bed without waking her up the move to separate sleeping spaces is yet another manifestation of changing marital patterns couples today are writing their own script , rewriting how to have a marriage , said pamela j smock , a university of michigan sociologist the growing need for separate bedrooms also represents the speedup of family life women s roles have changed and the need for extra space eases the strain on the relationship if one of them snores , the other one wo n't be able to perform the next day it s nothing to do with social class , and it s not necessarily indicative of marital discord nevertheless , professor smock said husbands were less willing to change familiar patterns men are supposed to be one , dominant , and two , sexual , she said their wives might be thrilled to have their own bedroom , and see it as a romantic thing going back to their romance , going back to dating , to intimacy , but the husband might not see it that way as a social pattern , this could increase , she continued a lot of people i know fantasize about living in the same apartment building as their husband but in a separate apartment that could be next paul c rosenblatt , a professor in the department of family and social science at the university of minnesota , has studied couples who sleep separately , and wrote a book last year on the challenges and benefits , two in a bed the social system of couple bed sharing to him , a large part of the phenomenon has to do with aging many of those professor rosenblatt surveyed , like the chicago couple , split into separate bedrooms when their children grew up it s suddenly available , he said , and if you have trouble sleeping you go into the kid s room and find you slept better than with your partner but some of the people he studies still want a place to cuddle in my research , couples had separate places for their sleeping arrangements but also had a together place , he said some do their cuddling before going their separate ways occasionally , the need to separate does have to do with sex professor rosenblatt said one older woman he interviewed said she had her own bedroom because , i 've paid my dues i'm old enough that i do n't want to have sex at 1 am no matter what the reasons , architects and builders say they know enough not to call them master bedrooms anymore women are buying more homes , and women are sensitive to that terminology of the master suite , ' and they 're opting for the term owners' suite , ' said barbara slavkin , an interior designer in st louis dale mulfinger , an architect in minneapolis , said , how about couples' realms' \? whatever you call them , they certainly seem to suit the peppers , the st louis couple who reconfigured their new condominium to give them each a sleeping sanctuary ted pepper s room , lined with a bank of windows that open onto a rooftop terrace , has none of the sleeping paraphernalia the sound machine , the sleeping mask found in his wife s room the only evidence of his sleep habits is the twisted knot of sheets and blankets on his bed now , there s a demonstration , said mr pepper , 67 , gesturing toward the swirl of bedding and chuckling she 'd wake up if i moved even a little the peppers agree separate bedrooms have added spice to their relationship it s more exciting , mrs pepper said , when you can say your room or mine \? '
there are n't a lot of environmental groups with their own investment bank consultants , so when you hear that environmental defense has just hired the boutique wall street firm perella weinberg partners , you know that we 're in a new world every college activist should study this story , because it is the future in the old days , when activists wanted something done , they held a sitin or organized a protest march now they hire an investment bank ok , maybe every activist group ca n't afford goldman sachs , but they nevertheless should analyze how environmental defense and the natural resources defense council used the internet and the market to save the planet from tons of co2 the story started last year when a giant texas power company , txu , announced plans to build 11 coalfired , co2belching power plants , raising the ire of environmentalists worried about climate change fred krupp , the president of environmental defense , which has an office in texas , wrote to john wilder , the chairman of txu , and asked for a meeting , but was brushed off txu made it clear that it was on a fast track to build its plants and had the governor of texas on its side talk about not knowing what world you 're living in so environmental defense and its allies turned to the web and created the web site , which put out regular electronic newsletters on the txu plans and built a national constituency opposed to the deal they also took txu to court none of that might have been enough , though , had the big buyout firms kohlberg kravis roberts and texas pacific group not teamed up to offer to buy txu in february a deal valued at 45 billion that would be the biggest leveraged buyout ever but there was a catch the buyers did not want to take over a company enmeshed in a war with environmentalists , mr krupp said , so they came to us and said , we only want to go forward if you and nrdc will praise what we are trying to do here' mr krupp and nrdc were ready to engage , but only if the deal could be made more climatefriendly the negotiations involved talks over 10 days , mr krupp said , and the key session was compressed into 17 hours in the oriental hotel in san francisco from 8 am to 1 am the next morning eventually , the private equity group agreed to cut the number of new txu coal plants from 11 to 3 , to support a us cap on greenhouse gas emissions and to commit txu to plowing 400 million into energyefficiency programs and doubling its purchase of wind power in return , the environmentalists blessed the deal , but mr krupp also hired perella weinberg to negotiate the fine print that is a pretty good day s work for people who had no money on the table there are a lot of lessons here first , mr krupp said , what is the message when the largest buyout in history is made contingent by the buyers on winning praise for its greenhouse gas plan \? the markets are ahead of the politicians the world has changed , and these guys see it txu not only did n't understand that the world was getting green it did n't understand that the world was getting flat going online , mr krupp said , we shifted this from a local debate over generating electricity to a national debate over capping and reducing carbon emissions so , what txu had hoped would be just a local skirmish was instead watched on computer screens in every global market the internet age is an age of transparency , when more people than ever can see right into your business and judge you by your deeds , not words txu could not manage its reputation by just hiring a pr firm and issuing a statement because , thanks to the internet , too many little people could talk back or shape txu s image on a global basis through the web , for free the reputations of companies are going to be less determined by the quality of their pr people and more by their actual actions and that empowers more of an honest debate on the merits , said mr krupp , adding , it s just harder to keep bad environmental news secret and expect the public to sit on its hands in the internet era message to young activists if you do your homework , have your facts right and the merits on your side , and then build a constituency for your ideals through the internet , you , too , can be at the table of the biggest deal in history or as mr krupp puts it the txu example shows that truth plus passion plus the internet can create an irresistible tide for change
no bigger chicago cubs fan lives than bill murray but he s a bears fan , too asked the other day if he was a bears fan , murray said , yeah , i'm in miami he did n't add , you dummy , but he seemed to utter the words silently during his 56 years , the bears have been kinder to murray than the cubs the bears today are playing in their second super bowl and fourth national football league championship game with murray as a devoted fan he has not experienced the delight of seeing the cubs in the world series we were so close , five outs away , a threerun lead , he said i do n't like to reflect on that game because everybody dwells on it it s like the bill buckner game murray was talking about the steve bartman affair in game 6 of the 2003 national league championship series bartman , a fan , prevented moises alou from catching a foul pop for the second out of the eighth inning the cubs proceeded to make a series of errors , and the florida marlins scored eight runs and won the game and then won game 7 had the cubs secured five more outs and held their lead , they would have been in the world series for the first time since 1945 as a child , murray , who was born in wilmette , ill , in 1950 , never saw the cubs in the postseason they have reached the postseason four times in his adult years , but the world series has been offlimits someone said you 're going to be very upset when you lose , murray said , recalling the 1989 nl championship series against san francisco i said 'you do n't get it we 've been losing since i was born if defeat was going to break me , it would have happened a long time ago' the bears have won more nfl championships at wrigley field than the cubs have won world series each team has played at wrigley five times for its sport s championship , with the bears winning four times and the cubs none when the cubs won successive world series in 1907 that s 100 years ago and 1908 , wrigley field had not been built when the bears won the super bowl in new orleans after the 1985 season , mike ditka was their coach , and the outcome helped make him a legend in chicago ditka s secondmost memorable chicago feat was his rendition of take me out to the ball game during a seventhinning stretch at wrigley i was probably the secondworst singer , ditka said ozzy osbourne was the worst i thought i was going to have a heart attack i was late and had to run up the steps like murray , ditka spoke by telephone from miami , where he is doing super bowl analysis for espn like murray , ditka is a cubs fan i am , said ditka , a former tight end from aliquippa , pa i grew up a st louis cardinals fan because of stan musial even though i was in pittsburgh my first autographed ball was pie traynor i hit a home run in little league and they gave me a ball autographed by pie traynor but i was always a stan musial fan he s from donora , pa i still have his picture hanging in my home in florida and my restaurant in chicago murray and ditka are both experts on cubs fans cubs fans love the cubs , murray said the day before groundhog day if you 're a cub fan , you 're sort of a graceful loser you 've lost so many times you have some grace about it ditka said they call the fans diehard for a reason they 're there it s like going to fenway park wrigley field is a special place it s a cathedral of baseball the fans are terrific they 're as positive as can be the cubs' performance last season , however , strained the fans' unquestioning allegiance they had watched the crosstown white sox and the boston red sox win the world series the previous two seasons , ending lengthy droughts , and now it was supposed to be the cubs' turn that s how i saw it , too , murray said but then i pick the cubs every year but i really thought the momentum of all this would make it happen the cubs , however , had an assortment of injured players , most notably derrek lee , kerry wood and mark prior , and finished with the nl s worst record \( 6696 \) they did n't keep too many people healthy , ditka said he said he thought the poor season had embarrassed the cubs and prompted them to spend a lot of money this offseason the team brought in a new manager , lou piniella , and signing the free agents alfonso soriano and ted lilly , among others murray offered a different view the thing is for sale , he said , referring to the tribune company , the cubs' owner i think once it s for sale everything changes and teams spend lots and lots of money that s what i 've noticed whoever buys it is going to eat all this money they do n't care what happens it s a great way to go out , spending someone else s money and still get tickets for the game ditka noted that the organization has taken some heat the last few years but endorsed the offseason moves the old story is wait till next year , he said next year is here bringing in lou is big sometimes you have to get ticked off , show some passion the game of life is emotion you have an

in an interview with the rev jesse jackson this afternoon , he told us that while he had concerns about fox news , he had decided to give deference to the congressional black caucus institute which cut a deal with fox to do two presidential debates last week , mr jackson issued a statement that was widely touted by critics of the conservativeleaning network in which he said this i am disappointed by the congressional black caucus institute s partnership with fox , and strongly encourage them to reverse that decision why would presidential candidates , or an organization that is supposed to advocate for black americans , ever give a stamp of legitimacy to a network that continually marginalizes black leaders and the black community \? fox moderating a presidential debate on issues of importance to black americans is literally letting the fox guard the henhouse fox should be rejected but today , he said that statement was sent up as a warning , because there are some tensions on the part of fox news attacks on basic civil rights they have a very strong political point of view in moderating his view , he said , he had been engaged in discussions with some members of the black caucus , and he came to understand their desire to reach a broader audience mr jackson emphasized that fox should not be held up for criticism alone rather he believed the debate negotiations during the presidential campaign could be a lever to pressure all the networks to to hire more africanamericans , both oncamera and off \( this is an issue mr jackson has pushed across a broad spectrum of employers , from wall street to retail , to journalism \) not one broadcast network s major news shows has black anchors , africanamerican hosts or guests , fully represented or even lightly represented , he pointed out \( cnn does have a few \) but if all networks did , he added , viewers might be offered far more points of view , because the hiring would become more diverse , too , among the writers , the producers , the bookers and the guests so while we may challenge some of fox s politics , none of them can celebrate the alternative of fairness and opportunity none of them , mr jackson said as an example of how an allwhite anchor desk can fail to provide full coverage , mr jackson pointed to cnn s coverage of the commemmorative march in selma , ala , a few weeks ago he said that as cameras panned the churches where senators hillary rodham clinton and barack obama spoke , not one of the journalists on the panel recognized or identified legendary civil rights leaders , like the rev joseph lowery , cofounder of the southern christian leadership conference , who were among the celebratories in the audience it was kind of a cultural disconnect , he said \( for the record , reverend jackson did not single out only cnn he named them all , abc , cbs , nbc , and the cable shows in criticizing the mainly white staffs in addition , he lamented the absence of a latenight , comedic presence like that of arsenio hall , on whose show former president bill clinton played the saxophone a long time ago now \) he said he was not aware that the democratic national committee had said today that fox news would not be a part of its sixsanctioned debates later this year democrats have the power , he said , to ensure access to the broadest possible audience to affect the election on a tangential topic , we couldn t resist asking him about his take on the democratic 2008 field a former presidential hopeful himself , and a longtime friend of the clintons , he had very complimentary words for senator clinton s years of public service he said , as was reported last week , that mr obama was his favorite , but added that the illinois senator needed to put forth an agenda of mrs clinton , he said , her experience is what gives her stature and those experiences are not what barack has at this point but he said he liked the idea that former north carolina senator john edwards opened his campaign from the ninth ward , postkatrina , in new orleans and that senator chris dodd of connecticut wanted to take on predatory lending practices he called the campaign spring training at this stage , adding that no one had yet articulated an impressive urban policy agenda if the candidates could only , he urged , focus on substance , and not attack one another \( the first cbcfox debate is in september , in detroit \)
las vegas , sept 2 gold medals dangled from the necks of a dozen nba stars sunday night jerry colangelo left town with something less quantifiable or shiny it was a combination of satisfaction and pride and possibly even a little relief the united states again looks like an unstoppable basketball force , and colangelo , as the program s architect , looks wise indeed very gratified , was the way colangelo put it sunday afternoon , a few hours before the americans routed argentina , 11881 , to win the fiba americas championship the united states won 10 games and lost none over the last 12 days , without a single jittery moment during the run by the time the americans claimed a 2008 olympics berth saturday , by reaching the final , they had beaten their first nine opponents by an average of 392 points by the time they dismantled argentina the 2004 olympic champion the only concern was whether everyone on the team could get through the next nba season without an injury the competition will be stiffer next summer in beijing , where spain , france and a probably stronger version of argentina could challenge the united states but for the first time in years , the dream team label seems fitting again i'm not going to leave here with overconfidence , let s put it that way , said colangelo , the managing director of the team there was disappointment a year ago when the americans settled for bronze at the world championships and a lot of satisfaction this summer we 're going to take both of those experiences and build on that but , he noted , this is a much stronger group the thirdplace finish last summer is now viewed as a blessing in disguise had the united states won the world championship , it would not have needed to compete this summer for an olympic bid there would have been a oneweek training camp and probably an exhibition game instead , the 12 players had 10 games together i just think we 'll be much better prepared for china as a result of being together for these three weeks , coach mike krzyzewski said under colangelo , the united states created a 32man roster , with a threeyear commitment of that group , 21 competed in 2006 and 2007 , which means there are decisions to make by june 28 , when the 12man olympic roster must be submitted some players will surely eliminate themselves through injuries and family commitments two players from the 2006 squad power forward chris bosh and guard dwyane wade are almost certain to be added to the roster for 2008 but colangelo seems hesitant to make too many changes , preferring to have as much continuity as possible from this year to next when you look at dwyane wade and chris bosh , you could foresee that they 're going to be on the team , colangelo said barring injuries , the players most likely to be replaced would seem to be center tyson chandler and the swingman mike miller colangelo said adding a big man or two would be a priority the americans competed here with only three players over 6 feet 10 inches amare stoudemire , dwight howard and chandler they will need more skilled big men next year , which could mean the addition of bosh and perhaps carlos boozer yet it was difficult to see any weaknesses in the united states' roster during this tournament the team was led by the scoring punch of carmelo anthony , kobe bryant and lebron james , who tied a team record with 31 points sunday the americans averaged 1167 points a staggering figure , considering the 40minute game clock the united states destroyed opponents in fastbreak points \( 25970 \) , points off turnovers \( 14344 \) and points in the lane \( 247145 \) and 3point shooting , once considered a weakness , was a strength the americans converted 47 percent of their attempts the results were a testament to the sheer firepower of the united states' roster , but also to its balance and chemistry , for which colangelo can claim credit i think jerry did a great job , said jason kidd , the team s leader and , in colangelo s view , its most valuable player he s got a great mix of guys , different guys , different characters , different personalities the biggest thing is that everybody gets along there s no bad apple , where one guy wants to play more minutes , or one guy complains about getting shots everybody s cheering for one another some of the old united states mystique has clearly been restored it wo n't fully be restored until we win the gold medal in beijing , but the way we won was very , very impressive , guard michael redd said we wanted to win the right way , we wanted to win in dominating fashion , and we did that
when had finished dissecting the game of another player who had spent the last several years trying not to get dissected every time they met , federer shrugged off his mastery with as deft a touch as he puts on any of his shots yes , he had beaten andy roddick on wednesday night at the united states open for the 14th time in 15 meetings and yes , he had left roddick with no clue how to turn that tide but federer steadfastly refused to claim any dominance in federer s view , he was a few tiebreaker points from losing the match there was nothing i could do on his serve for two and a half sets , federer said i did n't see a break point that shows you obviously how good a returner he is federer then promptly swept away the idea that nikolay davydenko of russia , his semifinal opponent tomorrow , would have as futile a quest as roddick federer is 90 against davydenko i think he s a fantastic player , federer said he is totally underrated still sometimes from the media even though i have a great record against him , i'm aware of his ability this is perhaps the part of federer that frustrates his opponents most he takes none of his success for granted he saw roddick not as someone who has driven himself to near distraction in federer s considerable shadow , but as a dangerous player with a huge serve and a home crowd on his side some might sit around and bask in a 506 match record this year , or 188 consecutive weeks at no 1 , or any of the other signs that federer belongs with the greatest players in tennis history andre agassi , a guest analyst for usa network on wednesday night , piled praise on federer when told on court after the match that agassi was impressed with his game , federer s first response was to say how nice it had been to see agassi in the locker room before the match one of agassi s more forceful points about federer is that federer is the best in the world at probably five aspects of the game , and that it takes being the best at two aspects to create a dominant player well , i feel i can , yes , count on many things in my game to work , federer said if my serve does n't work , i know my baseline game helps me out so if one thing breaks down i'm still ok mentally i'm always aware of my opponent i never underestimate i think that s one very important aspect and usually i can play the moment very well , you know so i think that s also one very important part of my game , is to understand the moment in federer s five matches here , three have featured moments that federer understood and used to his advantage against roddick , federer knew that he had to shake off roddick s dominant service games , which came and went with almost no break chances he patiently played into the tie breakers , and grabbed his opportunities there i'm happy the way i'm maintaining this great ability of coming up with the important wins when i have to , federer said i'm at my best always at the slams
university park , pa the chief executive of mattel , robert eckert , has just apologized to america s parents for allowing hundreds of thousands of chinesemade toys decorated with leaded paint or containing powerful magnets into the country , exposing children to danger this is admirable , as is the recall of these toys and the toy industry s request that congress impose mandatory toy safety testing standards but what mr eckert and other major toy makers should also apologize for is the toys themselves and the way they are promoted when i looked at mattel s list of recently recalled toys , it became obvious that something more than our dependence on foreign goods or even the physical safety of children is at stake here the problem is that the toys and the business model that creates them has so little to do with the needs of children and their parents on the list were 56 polly pocket sets \( including a lip gloss studio playset \) , 11 doggie daycare toys , 4 batman figures , 43 sesame street toys \( not just elmo stacking rings but giggle grabber soccer elmo and grow me elmo sprinkler \) , 10 dora the explorers and more than a score of assorted figures and cars these are designed mostly for preschoolers none encourage violence and many feature the cute and caring but , a parent might ask , why 56 polly pocket sets \? would n't a halfdozen meet the needs of any child \? and why teach 4yearolds the fine points of cosmetics \? yet most of us are not shocked by this list indeed , a business model that sells endless additions to basic toys even when they have nothing to do with any recognized childrearing ideal or even imaginative play seems natural this was n't always the case in the early 1970s , child advocates like action for children s television recognized that television ads for toys had a magical power over children they tried to ban these commercials to give parents , not toy companies , control over the desires of their offspring in 1978 , michael pertschuk , chairman of the federal trade commission , argued that ads appealing to young children were inherently unfair the toy and candy industries , which advertised directly to children , mobilized and accused the commission and child advocates of trying to restrict commercialfree speech and of wanting a nanny state in 1980 , congress complied by prohibiting the commission from regulating ads aimed at children about the same time , toy makers noticed that their earnings from selling star wars characters were more profitable than the movies themselves and fully embraced character licensing aided by the early '80s deregulation of ads , mattel , hasbro and others created cartoons that were essentially programlength commercials these cartoons , like heman and the masters of the universe or care bears , promoted toy lines in their story plots and led to an endless wave of toys based on television and movie characters at the same time , american toy makers outsourced production , mostly to china , and concentrated on design and marketing , transforming a seasonal industry \( mostly at christmas \) into wave after wave of movietoy promotions as a result , in 1987 , 60 percent of toys sold in the united states were based on licensed characters , compared with about 10 percent in 1980 toy sales increased from 61 billion in 1982 to 125 billion in 1986 this was a superb model for business success , but it has n't been such a good way to raise children since 1973 , the consumer product safety commission has set standards and recalled hazardous toys , protecting the physical safety of children but government does nothing to protect children s psychological needs sure , youngsters want this stuff \( after all , they see it on television every day \) and they find ways of playing with these toys , sometimes imaginatively abandoning the commercial back story of the characters but the problem is that the fun built into the toy is mostly in receiving the latest polly pocket and adding it to a collection , rather than playing with it additive if not addictive desire is created and satisfied by these toy lines they serve little positive purpose other than to teach children to be good consumers and want all the dora the explorer toys many people might associate this selling tactic with violent action figures or barbie and bratz dolls , but pbs kids' cartoon characters and children s television workshop \( now sesame workshop \) puppets have been licensed to the toy companies since 1971 how many toddlers do you know who are obsessed with anything having to do with elmo and thomas the tank engine toys \? is it any surprise that children are running through their childhoods so quickly \? not only do many of these licensed toys introduce young people to fashion and consumerism before they have developed critical judgment , but we as parents give them the stuff too early and so much of it is junk perhaps it s time to rethink the decision to allow the unrestricted advertising and cartoon promotion of toy lines that has produced yearround marketing and piles of plastic toys , bought and soon discarded after all , we ought to be just as concerned about the impact of character licensing and toy advertising on our children s psyche as we are on protecting them from ingesting leaded paint and magnets
the baguette placed a dozen calls to academy voters the other day to see which way the award winds were blowing as the bagger has noted , the intrepid duo was working from an old list and a depressing number of names on it are , alas , alive in name only when it came to best foreign film , one voter told the baguette that volver , which not in the running , was going to win the only foreign film most people seemed to remember was pan s labyrinth , and only a few of them had seen it in fact , none of the people the baguette reached had seen all five foreign nominees , which meant they were ineligible to vote in that category i can t remember what room i just came out of , let alone the titles of the foreign film , one unlikely voter said another said he thought the queen would win , because it didn t offend anyone but maybe the british no one thought letters from iwo jima had a shot at best picture , and most called it a tossup between babel and the departed as for little miss sunshine , one adamant woman said i will not vote for the children s movie what i call the yellow picture , where they go to the beauty contest
attorney general alberto gonzales has reportedly begun telling friends and associates that he has weathered the storm over the firing of nine united states attorneys and that his job is safe despite widespread calls for his resignation we can only hope he is wrong not only is the purge of the attorneys extremely serious , it is part of a long chain of evidence that mr gonzales does not have the ability or the moral compass to do his vitally important job consider mr gonzales s performance the other day before the house judiciary committee , where the chairman , john conyers jr , framed the questioning with admirable simplicity who made up the list of prosecutors to be fired , and why \? that should not be a hard question the nine prosecutors who are now known to have been purged it was eight until the case of todd graves of missouri came to light this week are nearly 10 percent of all united states attorneys it defies belief that an attorney general would allow so many top officials to be fired without being well aware of the reasons yet that was just what mr gonzales claimed he delegated , he was not informed , he just could not recall none of it was believable when asked by representative robert wexler who decided to fire david iglesias , the united states attorney in new mexico , mr gonzales flatly stated that president bush and vice president cheney did not he said he did not know who chose individual prosecutors to be fired , but he was certain that it was not his bosses as disturbing as mr gonzales s convenient memory lapses and apparent prevarications was his unwillingness to engage the moral seriousness of this scandal he seemed indifferent when asked if it would be a bad thing if united states attorneys critically important players in the justice system were pushed out to make room for eager young republicans he kept trying to change the subject from the administration s efforts to politicize the rule of law to the agenda he claims now preoccupies him fighting terrorism , crime and child predators nothing in this stumbling , evasive , amnesiafilled performance gave any reassurance that the firings were proper it was a reminder that mr gonzales s record was deplorable before the prosecutor purge he was an architect of policies in the war on terror that the supreme court has held to be illegal and unconstitutional he has defended president bush s illegal domestic wiretapping operations with a zeal terrifying in the head of an agency that is supposed to uphold the constitution not manufacture excuses for the president to trample on it there is also evidence that he allowed ideologues to pack career positions at the justice department with thinly credentialed hires , chosen for their party affiliation beyond the unseemly images of mr gonzales highfiving his team for riding out the attorneys scandal , the spin from some quarters was that his testimony was successful simply because he smiled blankly and refused to be ruffled when his answers and integrity were challenged mr gonzales can cling to his office as long as the president supports him and congress does not impeach him the white house clearly has reasserted some party discipline since his senate appearance the other week , when several republicans called for his resignation but that does not mean it is in anyone s interest for him to stay on the justice department is too important to be saddled with a year and a half more of such shoddy leadership
tehran , oct 16 president of said at a summit meeting of five caspian sea nations in on tuesday that any use of military force in the region was unacceptable in a declaration , the countries agreed that none would allow their territories to be used as a base for military strikes against any of the others we should not even think of making use of force in this region , mr putin said mr putin s comments and the declaration come at a time when the united states has refused to rule out military action to halt iran s nuclear energy program , which it believes masks a desire to develop nuclear weapons iran says its program , including the enrichment of uranium , is solely for peaceful purposes asked this morning about mr putin s remarks , tony fratto , the deputy white house press secretary , played them down , saying simply , that sounds like a good policy and later , tom casey , the deputy state department spokesman , said , i think the president s made clear , and us policy s been consistent , that we 're pursuing a diplomatic path with respect to iran he noted that russia had joined in several unanimous votes at the united nations security council demanding that tehran end any uraniumenriching activities mr putin arrived in tehran on tuesday for meetings with president of iran and leaders from three other caspian sea nations that have rich oil and gas resources , promising to use diplomacy to try to resolve the international debate over iran s nuclear program later he had a meeting with iran s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , in which he said he had expressed a desire for deeper relations between the countries , reuters reported mr putin was the first kremlin leader to travel to iran since 1943 , when stalin attended a wartime summit meeting with churchill and roosevelt his statements , which were consistent with his past positions cautioning against military action against iran , were nonetheless stark in their setting and firmly emphasized his differences with the united states over the extent of iran s threat and the means to counter it not only should we reject the use of force , but also the mention of force as a possibility , mr putin said russia has blocked a third set of sanctions against iran at the united nations that were intended to persuade tehran to stop enrichment activities , which western nations fear could lead to the development of nuclear weapons mr putin has emphasized the need for further dialogue and working through the international atomic energy agency to ensure that iran s nuclear programs were for peaceful purposes he has further called into question the concerns of the united states , france and other european countries about iran , saying that while he sought transparency in its nuclear program he had not seen clear evidence of any iranian intention to make nuclear weapons in spite of mr putin s strong statements and the evident show of solidarity among the five countries bordering the caspian sea azerbaijan , kazakhstan and turkmenistan , as well as russia and iran significant regional tensions remain , particularly about the division of the sea s main resource , oil iran and the soviet union once had agreements for sharing its resources , including a water boundary but since the soviet union collapsed , the successor governments in the newly independent caspian nations have quarreled over where their sea borders should be drawn azerbaijan and kazakhstan have expressed interest in building pipelines under the sea , which would allow central asian governments to bypass russian pipelines as they ship their resources to the west russia opposes the idea , which would break its monopoly , citing environmental concerns in the absence of a multilateral agreement and mutually accepted borders , the caspian nations are developing the oil resources as they see fit , although analysts have said that the absence of clear borders has limited the sector s development the division of the sea is not less important than the nuclear program , said ahmad nateq nouri , a former speaker of the iranian parliament , in a report carried by the fars news agency but the issue of iran s nuclear program overshadowed the others mr putin s remarks also underscored a longstanding unease in the kremlin with what it has regarded as a creeping american military presence in central asia , a region once solely under moscow s control since the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 , the pentagon has built a military base in kyrgyzstan to support operations in afghanistan , and has expanded its collaboration with azerbaijan , including underwriting improvements to a former soviet airfield there it also has an agreement allowing military transport planes en route to afghanistan to refuel in turkmenistan , a country that has made neutrality a cornerstone of its foreign policy the american presence and collaboration in the region have alarmed moscow , while washington s potential access to improved airfields in two countries bordering iran azerbaijan and turkmenistan has fueled speculation that the airfields could support actions against tehran mr ahmadinejad intimated as much in his statements on tuesday on many issues we have reached final agreement , but we also need collective cooperation , he said the goal is to keep the sea clear of military competitions and keep foreigners out of the region although mr putin and mr ahmadinejad were resolute , their statements appeared to have more political than military significance , and were not a departure from the status quo the united states does not have existing agreements with any caspian nation to launch attacks on another rather , the pentagon has negotiated limited bilateral agreements in the region that allow for flights to afghanistan through local airspace , refueling , emergency landings and the like moreover , with american military assets assembled in iraq and other persian gulf nations , and aircraft carriers and submarines in the region as well , it was not clear that any of the caspian countries would be essential for a raid on iran the caspian meeting also concluded without a clear agreement on territorial demarcation the leaders said in the declaration that the sea would be used for peaceful purposes and its issues would be resolved by the coastal nations mr putin and mr ahmadinejad discussed the completion of a nuclear power plant that russia has been building in the southern iranian city of bushehr russia has given various reasons for delays in completing the plant and delivering fuel for the startup brushing that aside , mr ahmadinejad told mr putin that iran was willing to have moscow build two more plants in bushehr , the isna news agency reported mr putin was received by the iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , at the tehran airport , according to staterun television mr putin , who had flown from germany , where he met chancellor angela merkel on monday , went ahead with the trip despite a report of a possible assassination plot against him in iran iran is counting on russia and china , which have important trade ties with iran , to use their veto power to oppose another round of sanctions in the security council russia has voted for two sets of sanctions , but has said that it will not support a third set without convincing evidence that iran had a program to build nuclear weapons in addition to the nuclear power plants and business ties , moscow has a long record of military collaboration with iran , which relies on sovietera and russian weapons and supplies for its armed forces the russian president s visit appeared to underscore the many levels of bilateral ties mr putin said the two countries planned to cooperate on space , aviation and energy issues , and suggested that the tensions with the west over iran s nuclear program had provided russia a unique role russia is the only country that is helping iran to realize its nuclear program in a peaceful way , he said
in the ballroom scene of s new romeo and juliet for , each pair of capulet guests enters by posing dramatically , as if to say , do you like the way we 're dressed \? at the gala premiere on tuesday \( attended by bill clinton , who took the seat forever associated with lincoln kirstein and was greeted with a standing ovation \) , this certainly rang a bell after all , the more ritzily dressed members of the audience had just made similar entrances into the new york state theater , with a red carpet and photographers but the posey behavior of these capulet guests is funny in the wrong way , because their costumes by per kirkeby \( who also designed the d cor \) and kirsten lund nielsen are , alas , ghastly imagine bargainbasement italian renaissance with modabstract squiggles the painted backdrop and wings look as if they had been designed by two different abex painters who disagreed the central set , painted to evoke gray stone walls , is rearranged from scene to scene juliet on the balcony looks as if she has wandered onto the battlements in spamalot elsewhere the costumes' main color scheme tybalt is yellow , romeo blue , mercutio purple reminded me of the old national ballet of cuba production of giselle , which was arranged around the fading eyesight of its prima ballerina , alicia alonso , with all the key characters in giselle s life dressed in individually bright colors , so that she knew what to do with the dancer wearing orange as opposed to the one in mauve in the first half these designs are this production s main problem its main virtue , throughout , is its young dancers on opening night sterling hyltin was a bright , appealing juliet with flashes of dance brilliance , and robert fairchild was sometimes compellingly poetic and always a winningly lyrical presence as romeo mr martins s choreography is n't exceptional in any way , but there are sequences especially in the dances for mercutio \( the firstcast daniel ulbricht scored deftly here \) where the witty stepbystep dance arrangement feels watertight in its momentbymoment fit to the score it s a dancedancedance romeo , with the townswomen on point \( not , as in some older productions , in heels \) dancing in symmetrical formations with their male partners in one effective image these townsfolk dance in tight concentric circles around mercutio , who bobs up and down in double air turns , while benvolio brightly circumnavigates them all in a circle of leaps the main disappointment is that in choreographing for romeo and juliet , mr martins tends to gets stuck in one groove after another the balcony pas de deux ends with juliet held high above romeo s head , her torso and arms arched back in what should be a truly eloquent image of emotional abandon that becomes more remarkable as he then lowers her while she holds this same immobile pose for a moment we seem to be flashing forward to the corpse that we know juliet will become sure enough , at the end of the final pas de deux , when romeo lifts juliet s inert body \( thinking she s dead when she is merely lifeless \) , we see that same lift , that same immobility we ought to be feeling all manner of lovedeath paradoxes on both occasions we ca n't , though , because mr martins has begun his balcony pas de deux with juliet arching in much the same fashion back over romeo s shoulder in abandon all the solos and pas de deux for romeo and juliet look like mr martins s rough sketches he can be a more focused , precise dance maker than he is here in only one respect is this production radical prokoviev s score well played by the city ballet orchestra under fay al karoui , with the wind section especially responsive has been divided into two acts rather than three although i have called this music the greatest film score ever written , it nonetheless achieves theatrically effective endings to all three of its acts \( juliet on her balcony , the capulets grieving over tybalt s corpse , romeo and juliet both dead at center stage \) mr martins ends his first act , after what is usually the ballet s act ii , scene 1 , with romeo happily holding the letter just given him by juliet s nurse a nice effect of narrative suspense , but lacking prokoviev s feeling for a strong conclusion you ca n't help wishing that each pas de deux were shaped with a stronger sense of plot , of emotions changing or conflicting , and that the whole ballet had a greater sense of dramatic urgency mr martins is n't the first to omit rosaline , thus giving us no reason that romeo , mercutio and benvolio should turn up uninvited at the capulet ball but when frederick ashton did this in his 1955 production for the royal danish ballet \( presumably the version the danishborn mr martins grew up with \) , he made the men s mysterious arrival fateful , like that of the three characters who come masked to the ball in mozart s don giovanni here none of the capulets are looking anyway , even when these guys proceed to dance at center stage and when romeo first dances with juliet in this same scene \? twentytwo capulet guests busy themselves in conversational groups , looking everywhere but at the starcrossed lovers yet when the scene is an open piazza in verona , then the supporting characters are as in most romeo productions lively onlookers , reacting keenly to the quarrels and sword fights in the first half , such inconsistencies seem merely incidental after intermission they pile up the otherwise decent romeo , having run tybalt through once , then winds his robe round tybalt s head while stabbing him repeatedly in the back lord capulet expresses his anger with his defiant daughter by hitting her so strongly that the audience gasps the leading adult roles , although played by company principals like darci kistler , jock soto , nikolaj h bbe and albert evans , are mere ciphers the production is carried by the company s youngsters , just as mr martins hoped it would be one just wishes that he had rewarded them with richer fare and taken them on a more powerful dramatic arc toward tragedy
yelena isinbayeva has heard many things about new york she has heard that those who visit new york for the first time tend to fall in love with it but on the ride from the airport to her hotel , she saw nothing of interest , none of the designer shops or gourmet restaurants she would like to visit , and certainly not the statue of liberty i think i might have seen it from the plane , she said perhaps , she said , she will have a couple of hours to play tourist tomorrow morning before a plane takes her back to italy , where she trains or perhaps her visit to new york as a tourist will have to wait until she retires as the greatest women s polevaulter in the young history of the sport she is only 24 , and she is making her first trip to the united states for the 100th millrose games tonight at madison square garden but as with any elite athlete , there are certain things she must avoid before a competition like long walks that might hurt her feet , or drafty rooms and brisk weather that might cause her to catch a cold of course i would like to see more and more , she said wednesday night at her hotel , after she declined an offer to visit times square , citing jet lag i would like to be all day outside on the street i'm very interested to see the beautiful places in each town i visit when i retire , i will go around again in many ways , isinbayeva already has the arc of her career mapped out already , the girl who grew up in volgograd , russia , the daughter of workingclass parents , has broken 19 world records \( both indoor and outdoor \) and won a gold medal at the 2004 olympic games in athens by the 2012 olympics in london , which she says will be her swan song as a polevaulter \( at age 30 \) , she would like to have eclipsed the 35 world records that her male polevaulting counterpart , sergei bubka , set during his career it s an ambitious plan but isinbayeva , who has cleared 16 feet 5 inches outdoors , has become so dominant in recent years that her greatest competitor is often herself when you achieve everything , she said , in that moment it starts to become more difficult it has been a remarkable ascent for isinbayeva , who came to the pole vault at age 15 after spending her childhood as a gymnast her parents enrolled isinbayeva in gymnastics when she was 5 , mainly because they were working full time \( her father as a plumber and metalworker , her mother in a boiler room \) and needed some way to keep yelena and her sister busy she kept at it for 10 years , even as she grew too tall to harbor any real hopes of becoming an elite gymnast in the process , she also conquered any fears of putting her body in precarious positions when her gymnastics coach suggested she try the pole vault , she protested she had never heard of the pole vault , she said her coach told her that if she did not like it , she did not have to continue isinbayeva took to it immediately and because of her background in gymnastics , she had the type of preparation that few women s polevaulters before her had ever had she insists she is not particularly fast in her approach , but it is the second phase of her vault , she says , that sets her apart i like that i can control my body , she said i like to fly i like those feelings when you 're over the bar it s more beautiful than other track and field events in a sport that was added to the olympics in 2000 \( when stacy dragila of the united states won the gold medal \) , isinbayeva has become the first woman to break the 5meter mark \( a little more than 164 \) and she appears determined to continue breaking her own records i saw her in scotland as a junior at one meet , and i thought she was going to kill herself she was turning so far upside down it was just scary , said dave nielsen , the track and field coach at idaho state university , who also coaches dragila she s a cut above anybody else i 've seen , certainly in russia and in italy , where she now spends much of the year , this success has gained isinbayeva a certain measure of fame she did an interview with a russian radio station in brooklyn last sunday , and millrose organizers are hoping to capitalize on that fame by offering discounts to russian fans who use a special code word when ordering tickets isinbayeva said that when she got on the plane in milan , on her way to new york , the security officer who checked her boarding pass recognized her immediately after the olympics was the boom , she said at first , it was strange i said , how do they know me \? ' in the united states , however , where virtually no one knows her , where she will spend nearly all of her time in madison square garden or in a hotel directly across the street , she will keep her low profile at least for now
washington , march 7 king abdullah ii of jordan , in a rare appearance before a joint meeting of congress , made an impassioned plea today for the united states to lead in an active pursuit of israelipalestinian peace , saying that without it none of middle east s other problems would be solved he implored the lawmakers to exert american leadership in a peace process that delivers results not next year , not in five years , but this year the king pleaded as well for greater concern for the palestinian people a theme often heard in europe but rarely in the halls of congress it met with a relatively tepid response , paling next to the applause for his broader calls for regional peace sixty years of palestinian dispossession , 40 years under occupation , a stopandgo peace process all this has left a bitter legacy of disappointment and despair on all sides , he said palestinians grievances , the 45yearold monarch said , were the core issue underlying violence throughout the region the wellspring of regional division the source of resentment and frustration far beyond is the denial of justice and peace in palestine , abdullah said his plea for the united states to play a central role for peace in the middle east came as the bush administration , stung by setbacks from iraq to lebanon , has taken a broader diplomatic approach to the region , including a decision to meet on saturday in baghdad with iranian , syrian and other regional representatives to discuss security in iraq the king , considered one of the closest regional allies of the bus administration , has expressed deep distress over the regional unrest he has personally attempted to mediate the infighting between hamas and fatah , the two main palestinian factions if matters continue to degrade , he has warned , the region could see be the scene of three civil wars in iraq , in lebanon and among the palestinians palestinians and israelis are not the only victims of their conflict , he said we saw the violence ricochet into destruction in lebanon last summer and people around the world have been the victims of terrorists and extremists who use the grievance of this conflict to legitimize and encourage acts of violence we must work together to restore peace , hope and opportunity to the palestinian people , and in so doing we will begin a process of bringing peace to the region , he said abdullah s speech left at least a few lawmakers perplexed i expected to hear a speech about iraq instead , i was troubled to hear the suggestion that the fact that sunni and shia are murdering each other is somehow the fault of the israelis , said representative steve israel , democrat of new york this implication is a dangerous one and completely unacceptable many outside of washington view a resolution of the israelipalestinian conflict as essential to easing middle eastern tensions but critics say the bush administration has been slow to act , preoccupied by iraq and afghanistan and willing to give the israeli government considerable leeway as it did during israel s war last summer with hezbollah militants in lebanon abdullah alluded to washington s actions , saying that palestinians ask whether the west really means what it says about equality and respect and universal justice palestinians form a majority of the jordanian population , many having come as refugees after the 1948 or 1967 arabisraeli wars thirteen years ago , abdullah said , my father was here to talk about his hopes for peace he added the next time a jordanian , a palestinian or an israeli comes before you , let it be to say thank you for helping peace become a reality help fulfill the aspirations of palestinians and israelis to live in peace today for that , he received a standing ovation
anchorage , , nov 18 \( ap \) a roman catholic religious order has agreed to pay 50 million to more than 100 alaska natives who say they were victims of sexual abuse by jesuit priests , a lawyer for the victims said sunday the lawyer , ken roosa , said the settlement with the oregon province of the society of jesus , which covers alaska , idaho , montana , oregon and washington , was the largest one yet against a catholic order these are people who were altar boys and altar servers and altar girls , mr roosa said these are people who tried to tell their story , and in many instances were beaten or told to shut up and told , how can you say such things about a man of god \? ' the settlement does not require the order to admit fault , mr roosa said none of the priests were ever criminally charged the sexual abuse accusations involved 13 or 14 clerics and spanned nearly 30 years , from 1961 to 1987 , mr roosa said in some alaskan villages , it is difficult to find an adult who was not sexually abused as a child by the priests , who used religion and their power to silence hundreds of children , mr roosa said despite all this , no catholic religious leader has yet to admit that problem priests were dumped in alaska , he said for our clients , this settlement represents a long overdue acknowledgment of the truth of their stories of abuse , stories that until today were largely denied and belittled by apologists for the abusers mr roosa said the catholic church was first notified of the alaska abuse cases in 2002 the cases do not include those against the diocese of fairbanks , which owned and managed the churches in the villages where the jesuit priests were assigned those 135 lawsuits have been reduced to 10 and are expected to be mediated in december

new york chefs have been flaunting peas , fava beans and ramps on their menus since march , but as every farmers' market devotee knows , it s all a great big spring vegetable charade by the time the vernal equinox hits , we 're desperate to trade brussels sprouts for asparagus , but the really divine local produce is still months away so it goes year after year , supping on sugar snaps at restaurants \( which fedex them from afar \) , buying winteredover leeks and potatoes at the farmers' market until may and with a particularly cool and rainy april , this year s spring harvest was frustratingly delayed all of this might explain why , when those first succulent greens and newborn radishes finally hit the union square greenmarket , i fell into a frenzied state of shopping euphoria , buying copious quantities of perishable green stuff without regard to the dinner reservations i had every night for a week when i eventually unstuffed the bags from my poor , crammed fridge , the vegetables were nearly spent it was time to cook or dump what i needed was a delectable recipe that would accommodate all of my slightly droopy harvest at once and ideally , it would provide plenty of sturdy leftovers i contemplated a giant , perky stirfry with loads of garlic , ginger and soy sauce but although it would absorb all the produce , its crisp allure would wane after a day instead , i wanted something simmered until silky , something that softened in the pot and not in the fridge the recipe began to take shape in my mind i envisioned a slowly bubbling spring vegetable braise imbued with the flavors of golden caramelized onions , fresh sweet peas and asparagus , and even the withering head of lettuce i had planned but failed to make into salad i would throw in radishes , too , which would add a correctively spicy bite to keep things from getting too cloying i also poured in a little white wine for brightness , and some parmesan for a funky depth as tasty as i hoped this dish would be , it was starting to seem a little too virtuous , chock full of healthy vegetables it needed a luscious , preferably sinful element to balance out all those vitamins and antioxidants i considered adding one of the many pork products asleep in the freezer , but worried it would overpower the produce and a blanket of melted cheese , while desirable on its own terms , did n't seem to mesh thematically sampling the fragrant broth as the vegetables braised , i longed for a piece of bread to dunk but there was none homemade biscuits would be easy to whip up , and would serve the same purpose or why not try vaguely southernstyle dumplings \? made with the same basic biscuit ingredients but simmered in water or broth rather than baked why did they always have to be paired with chicken \? the idea of braised vegetables and dumplings seemed far more exciting than the braised vegetables alone so i mixed up a variation of my favorite cornmeal biscuit recipe and tossed in some fresh herbs from my finally sprouting window box when the braise was ready , i spooned some into a bowl and topped it with dumplings , which greedily sucked up the savory broth the vegetables were yielding and deeply flavored , and the dumplings comforting and light , reminding me of matzo balls , but with a pleasant grittiness from the cornmeal the idea of serving braised spring vegetables and matzo balls for passover next year flashed through my mind , but passover always falls in march or april that may be spring according to the calendar , but not at the farmers' market recipe braised spring vegetables time 30 minutes 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 bunch radishes , trimmed and quartered lengthwise 1 1 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 red onion , halved lengthwise and thinly sliced 3 thyme sprigs \( optional \) pinch sugar kosher salt 2 garlic cloves , very thinly sliced 1 bunch scallions , trimmed and halved lengthwise 1 4 cup white wine 1 bunch asparagus \( about 1 pound \) , trimmed and cut into 1inch lengths 1 bunch swiss chard \( preferably red \) , leaves torn into bitesize pieces , stems cut into 1inch lengths 1 2 pound sugar snap peas , trimmed 1 cup vegetable or chicken broth freshly ground black pepper 1 cup shelled fresh or frozen peas \( about 1 pound in the shell \) 1 small head boston lettuce , torn into bitesize pieces 6 tablespoons grated parmesan cornmealherb dumplings \( see recipe \) , or prepared polenta or buttered noodles 1 heat butter in a large skillet over high heat until sizzling add radishes and cook on one side until dappled golden brown , about 5 minutes turn radishes and sear for 3 minutes more transfer to a bowl 2 add oil to pan and stir in onion , thyme if using , sugar and a pinch of salt cook , stirring occasionally , until onion is golden brown , about 10 minutes \( reduce heat if it starts to burn \) add garlic and cook 30 seconds add scallions , cutside down cook until light golden , about 2 minutes pour in wine and boil , stirring , for 2 minutes 3 toss in asparagus , chard stems , sugar snap peas and broth season with salt and pepper cover and simmer for 2 minutes toss in chard leaves , peas and lettuce season with more salt and pepper cover and cook until wilted , about 3 minutes stir in cheese serve with dumplings , polenta or noodles yield 6 servings recipe cornmealherb dumplings time 25 minutes
carnoustie , scotland , july 16 the oldest trophy in major championship golf has lived on s mantel , guarded ben curtis s television and reclined in the back seat of todd hamilton s car it has held cheap beer , expensive champagne , and iced tea brewed by justin leonard s mother tom watson , who won the trophy five times , accidentally smacked it with a backswing decades ago , leaving a tiny blemish on the prize known worldwide as the claret jug he whacked it right on the handle , said hamilton , the 2004 british open champion , who will be among the 156 golfers chasing the silver jug anew starting thursday at carnoustie you can tell the handle is just a little cockeyed like lord stanley s cup and the green jacket , the claret jug has long held a mystical and celebratory quality trophies are handed out every week on the pga tour , but none are designed with a handle that looks like a bass clef or with insides hollowed out to hold the exact contents of a standard bottle of wine held upside down , the jug delivers a perfect pour ever since it was first awarded in 1873 replacing a moroccan leather belt given to previous british open winners it has often been considered golf s most precious prize the royal and ancient golf club keeps the original housed in its clubhouse it has awarded a replica jug to the champion since 1928 two other replicas are used by the club for exhibitions and tours after a player has won the jug , where he keeps it and how he celebrates with it is up to him nick faldo , a threetime winner , said he often kept the jug at his bedside , just so he could reach out in the middle of the night and know it was there after tiger woods won the masters in 2001 , making him the only player to win four consecutive major professional titles , he added that trophy to the ensemble on the mantel in his living room , joining the jug and the trophies from the united states open and the pga championship he won in 2000 he also took down the jug at times and filled it with various libations honestly , because of the consumption , i really ca n't remember , woods said of what he put in it ben curtis , the unlikely 2003 champion , flew home to the cleveland hopkins international airport from royal st george s in england and celebrated with departing and arriving travelers it just seemed like i was intoxicated for the first week , curtis said we had everything from water to coke to beer we did n't do anything too crazy i just kept it in my house right above the tv , so every time i sat down , i looked at it the jug might have received its greatest workout under hamilton , who defeated ernie els in a playoff at royal troon in scotland in 2004 and began a yearlong travelfest with the trophy after he returned to dallas , hamilton was asked by a friend who owns a restaurant to bring the trophy over the friend said he would give hamilton and his party 500 off their bill they arrived and drank cristal out of the claret jug soon enough , people began coming by the table to ask questions about the trophy i'm sure a lot of people did n't even know what it was , hamilton said then in the middle of dinner , three guys started walking by hamilton said he recognized one as jerry jones , the owner of the dallas cowboys , and one as jones s son , but he did not recognize the third then jerry jones introduced him as roger goodell and said , he s going to be the next commissioner of the nfl' whenever hamilton watches a football game on television these days , he waits for a closeup shot of the ball you can see that roger goodell s signature is on it , he said i'm like , man , i met that guy hamilton said he displayed the jug in public as much as possible he said he would be driving around dallas , pull up to an intersection , and say to himself , i wonder if this guy next to me knows i have the claret jug sitting in the back seat hamilton said his favorite pastime was taking the trophy to different golf courses around texas while playing a round , he would leave the jug in the pro shop so guests could come by and take pictures with it it s something people know around the world , he said leonard , who won at troon in 1997 , said he usually kept the jug at his parents' house in the dallas area he rarely took it outside , except for the time or two he took it to his golf club when his year with the jug was over , leonard , like all champions , had to give it back to the royal and ancient golf club the club furnished him with a downsized replica , but leonard said he later realized just how much he missed having the larger trophy , from which he drank champagne at night and iced tea on hot summer days i did n't do much with it , he said i certainly did n't travel with it anywhere , but i think if i win it again , i would probably do a little more with it
london , aug 7 in a major reversal of policy , the british government today asked the bush administration to release five british residents being held at guant namo bay , cuba under former prime minister tony blair the government insisted that it had no obligation to assist the men because they were not british citizens , even though all had legal residence status here we saw this as an opportunity to achieve ultimately the closure of guant namo , said a british official , speaking on the condition of anonymity the state department appeared to welcome the british move , which american and british officials said had been discussed by british foreign secretary david miliband and secretary of state condoleezza rice last month the request could lead to a reduction in the guant namo population , which is something the bush administration has been working with other countries to achieve , a state department spokesman , sean mccormack , said at a meeting with reporters today at the same time mr mccormack flagged a potentially contentious issue what restrictions are to be placed on the detainees if they are returned to britain before releasing any detainees , the united states wants assurances they would be secured , meaning that they would n't be allowed to walk free , mr mccormack said in its statement today , the british foreign office said that if the men were returned , they would be subject to the same security considerations as would apply to any other foreign national in this country in the past , british officials have said , in court documents that have largely gone unnoticed publicly , that britain could not agree to the conditions sought by the united states because they would violate british and european human rights laws and would require an onerous commitment of british intelligence resources the british move tuesday was greeted with great jubilation by human rights groups and campaigners for the closure of the prison camp at guant namo it s brilliant news , said asim qureshi , spokesman for cageprisoners , a nonprofit organization that works on behalf of guant namo detainees we 're really happy today clive stafford smith , who represents the five men , said the british move was a sign that the new brown administration recognizes that human rights are important in the battle against terrorism gordon brown replaced mr blair as prime minister in june a change in the british policy had been a matter of intense debate within the labor party during the last months of mr blair s tenure it is not clear whether mr blair would have approved of the shift had he remained in office nine british citizens were released from guant namo in 2004 and 2005 the bush administration had expected the men to be tried and incarcerated for some period and was dismayed when they were allowed to go free several have gone on to become near celebrities here one of the five men on the list britain submitted on tuesday , jamil elbanna , was authorized to leave guant namo by the american military authorities in may , but is still being held because the british would not take him mr elbanna was seized by the cia in gambia , where he had gone on a business trip british intelligence agencies had been monitoring mr elbanna because of his ties to islamic radicals here and had alerted the cia of his travel to gambia but it had specifically requested that he not be arrested , according to a recent british government report the others whose release the british government sought today are shaker aamer , omar deghayes , binyam mohamed and abdennur sameur several bush administration officials said that particular scrutiny would be given to two of the detainees in the british request , mr aamer and mr mohamed the officials said these two men were considered more serious threats than the others a pentagon spokesman , cmdr j d gordon , said conditions set by the united states for the release of any guant namo detainee to a host government include providing credible assurances that they will be treated humanely and guarantees that the countries will take steps to mitigate the threat that these individuals pose to the united states and its allies commander gordon said that 420 guant namo detainees have been released and that only 38 of those were determined to be no longer enemy combatants he said that about 80 more detainees have been cleared for departure from guant namo and will be transferred once humane treatment and continuing threat concerns have been satisfactorily addressed by the receiving country the state department s deputy spokesman , tom casey , said the british and american governments had been discussing the fate of these five detainees for some time we certainly do n't , as the president said , want to be the world s jailer , and we do n't want to see guant namo bay open indefinitely , mr casey added but in order to be able to close it , you have to have a way of dealing with the people that are there , many of whom are extremely dangerous individuals , and those that will require some continued supervision and monitoring mr casey said the british request would be evaluated , and i'm sure we 'll be having a number of discussions over the next few weeks to see how the transfer could be handled among the five detainees , mr mohamed is a gangly ethiopian who had lived in washington for two years as a teenager , before his family moved to britain he was seized in pakistan in april 2002 and turned over to the americans his was one of the early cases of rendition , the bush administration policy of secretly taking suspected terrorists to third countries for interrogation mr mohamed was taken to morocco , where he was held and interrogated for 18 months , according to mr stafford smith according to the accounts he gave to his lawyer , mr stafford smith , and which have been published elsewhere , he was brutally abused there on several occasions , men used a scalpel to make cuts on his penis , mr mohamed has alleged american officials initially said that he was an accomplice with jose padilla in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb in the united states that charge was eventually dropped against mr padilla , who is on trial in miami on other terrorismrelated charges mr mohamed has not been formally charged mr deghayes , who moved to britain from libya in 1986 , after his father , a union organizer was assassinated , was seized in pakistan in january 2002 he has been held in guant namo as enemy combatant , and military officials have alleged that he traveled from pakistan to afghanistan under the guidance of al qaeda , and that he had a good relationship with osama bin laden the american evidence against him also included a photo allegedly of him in chechnya at mr deghaye s administrative review board hearing in 2005 , he generally denied links to al qaeda , and introduced testimony from a expert that the person in the photo was not of mr deghayes , but of another chechnya fighter mr deghayes has been a leader of the hunger strikers at guant namo , as has mr aamer , a native of saudi arabia , who wears his hair pulled back in a pony tail american officials said he had ties to al qaeda , which he denied the fifth detainee on the list , mr sameur , is an algerian , who fled the country in 1999 and was granted political asylum in britain in 2001 , he went to afghanistan , where american officials have alleged he trained at an al qaeda camp , which he denies he fled afghanistan in october 2002 and was picked up by the pakistani army and turned over to the americans the british foreign office said that discussions between the united states and britain about the release of these four men may take some time one sticking point in the past has been the conditions that the united states has sought to have imposed on any detainees returned to britain it wants the men jailed for some period , and then upon their release to be subjected to control orders and closely monitored , including communications intercepts , according to statements by the directorgeneral for intelligence at the foreign office , david richmond , and by the director of counterterrorism at the home office , william nye they were filed last year in a case brought by two detainees on the current list , mr deghayes and mr el banna , who were seeking to force the government to act to secure their release such measures would be illegal , the british officials said mr nye added that measures used by britain against terrorist suspects , including interception of communications , human intelligence resources , and other intelligencegathering and analytical techniques would not satisfy the united states none of these techniques , individually or collectively , would be able to provide the sort of guarantee sought by the us , mr nye said a compromise may be found , with the released men voluntarily agreeing to some restrictions we 'd be willing to submit to any reasonable restrictions , said mr stafford smith , the lawyer a british detainee released earlier this year , bisher alrawi , voluntarily agreed to register with the police , notify them of any change of address for 5 years , to report to the police one a month , and report to the police any plans to travel outside britain for five years , according to documents in the case he was not forced to give up his passport , which is something else the bush administration has sought
munich , feb 11 defense secretary , disputing a lengthy critique of american power by president of russia , said sunday at a european security conference here , one cold war was quite enough government leaders , legislators and military officials gathered here continued speculating on mr putin s motivation for delivering his long list of complaints on saturday about american domination of global affairs , but mr gates chose words of velvet , not steel , in offering washington s fullest response as mr putin had , he invoked the cold war more than once as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday s speeches almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time , he said almost mr gates , a former director of the central intelligence agency called back to government service from academia to serve as defense secretary , told attendees of the 43rd munich conference on security policy that both he and mr putin spent most of their careers in their governments' spy agencies and , i guess , old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , mr gates said however , i have been to reeducation camp spending four and half years as a university president and dealing with faculty his remark drew laughs and applause his sharpest response to mr putin was gently couched russia is a partner in endeavors , mr gates said but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion throughout the rebuttal , and in a longer discourse on how america s european allies must help rebuild afghanistan and remain engaged in the fight against terrorism , mr gates mentioned mr putin only once by name that came when said he had accepted an invitation from mr putin to visit moscow on saturday , russia s defense minister , sergei b ivanov , a putin confidant , denied that mr putin s speech had been confrontational we are not interested in imposing our opinion on anybody , mr ivanov said but he cautioned that his government would not support international actions taken without consultation with russia , nor those taken without its consent , and certainly none that are imposed on russia the speech by mr gates was delivered under the long shadow of his predecessor , donald h rumsfeld , who both charmed and offended european audiences during his tenure as defense secretary , which included several speeches to this conference mr gates cast himself as a geopolitical realist and drew a knowing laugh when he focused on mr putin s assertion that the united states and its allies were dividing europe all of these characterizations belong in the past , mr gates said the free world versus those behind the iron curtain north versus south east versus west , and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of old europe' versus new' the last was a reference to a characterization mr rumsfeld made in january 2003 to contrast germany and france , which objected to the united states plan to invade iraq , with neighboring supporters , not all of which are nato members reviewing nato s success in standing up to the soviet threat , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed then and now as by icbms , tanks and warships that the west deployed , mr gates said the alliance s most effective weapon , he said , was a shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights , representative government , and the rule of law these values kept our side united , and inspired those on the other side , he added shifting to current threats and challenges , he called on nato members to support a comprehensive strategy to stabilize afghanistan , combining a muscular military effort with effective support for governance , economic development , and counternarcotics he also urged nato allies to increase their military spending to meet the benchmark of 2 percent of gross domestic product set by the alliance only 6 of nato s 26 members fulfill that standard mr gates briefly turned to the war in iraq , to echo president bush s insistence that the united states and its partners there must prevail if chaos tears iraq apart , mr gates warned , every member of this alliance will feel the consequences of regional turmoil and terrorism he acknowledged the damage done to america s global standing by its conduct in the campaign against terrorism , particularly in holding detainees without due process at the united states naval base in cuba there is no question in my mind that guant namo and some of the abuses that have taken place in iraq have negatively impacted the reputation of the united states , mr gates said it is also true , though , that there are real terrorists at guant namo repeating comments from a number of american officials , mr gates said most members of the bush administration would like to close the detention center , and he pledged that tribunals for detainees would be conducted in a legitimate and transparent manner

if the rise of under the mentorship of was meteoric , the speed of his fall was breathtaking in december 2004 , president bush nominated mr kerik , a former new york police commissioner , to head the federal department of homeland security seven days later , mr kerik withdrew as a nominee a cascade of questions followed about his judgment as a public official , not least that he had inappropriately lobbied city officials on behalf of interstate industrial , a construction firm suspected of links to organized crime mr giuliani defended mr kerik , a friend and business partner , whom he had recommended to the bush administration but he also tried to shield himself from accusations that he had ignored mr kerik s failings i was not informed of it , mr giuliani said then , when asked if he had been warned about mr kerik s relationship with interstate before appointing him to the police post in 2000 mr giuliani amended that statement last year in testimony to a state grand jury he acknowledged that the city investigations commissioner , edward j kuriansky , had told him that he had been briefed at least once the former mayor said , though , that neither he nor any of his aides could recall being briefed about mr kerik s involvement with the company but a review of mr kuriansky s diaries , and investigators' notes from a 2004 interview with him , now indicate that such a session indeed took place what is more , mr kuriansky also recalled briefing one of mr giuliani s closest aides , dennison young jr , about mr kerik s entanglements with the company just days before the police appointment , according to the diaries he compiled at the time and his later recollection to the investigators the additional evidence raises questions not only about the precision of mr giuliani s recollection , but also about how a man who proclaims his ability to pick leaders came to overlook a jumble of disturbing information about mr kerik , even as he pushed him for two crucial government positions rudy can fall for people big time , and sometimes qualifications are secondary to loyalty , said fran reiter , a former giuliani deputy mayor who now supports hillary clinton if he gets it in his head he trusts you , he is extremely loyal mr giuliani has routinely met loyalty with loyalty , standing by political allies and friends in their darkest hours giuliani partners , for example , his consulting firm , employs a high school friend , msgr alan placa , despite allegations that he sexually molested young men years ago mr giuliani has said he believes in his friend , who has denied the allegations and was not criminally charged in mr kerik s case , by the time mr giuliani recommended him for the federal job , his administration knew that mr kerik had acted on behalf of interstate industrial it also knew that he had drawn criticism for a range of other incidents , from sending detectives to search for his lover s cellphone to using officers to research his autobiography mr kerik , who declined to speak about his troubles , now faces possible indictment on a range of federal felony charges , including perhaps tax evasion and bribery , stemming in part from his acceptance of 165 , 000 in renovations to his bronx apartment paid for by interstate in june 2006 , he pleaded guilty in the bronx to state misdemeanor charges relating to the same renovations though mr giuliani s rivals for the republican presidential nomination have not made an issue of mr kerik , his indictment could be a major embarrassment for mr giuliani mr giuliani , who also declined to comment , still vigorously defends mr kerik s performance as police commissioner he told the grand jury that mr kuriansky concluded that nothing in mr kerik s background , including his ties to interstate , precluded his appointment as police commissioner but mr giuliani now acknowledges that he should have reexamined his friend before recommending him to the white house and that his recommendation had indeed been a mistake in 2000 , more than half the mayor s cabinet had opposed mr kerik s appointment to be police commissioner his detractors had noted , among other concerns , that mr kerik did not have a college degree , a department requirement at the time for captains and above mr giuliani waved off the dissenters i believe that the skill i have developed better than any other was surrounding myself with great people , mr giuliani wrote in his 2002 book , leadership too many leaders overlook candidates with unusual r sum s because of a failure of nerve , mr giuliani wrote by the time i appointed bernie kerik , i had hired so many people that i was immune to such criticisms the men who would become patron and prot g first met at a fundraiser in 1990 in new jersey honoring a slain new york city police officer mr kerik was a comic book hero come to life , a decorated undercover detective with a ponytail and earrings , thick biceps and a taste for fourletter words as nouns , verbs and adjectives he cultivated relationships with powerful people , including an influential sheriff who five years earlier had made him the youngest jail warden in the history of passaic county , nj when mr giuliani ran for mayor in 1993 , mr kerik organized his security detail of offduty officers , reserving the weekend shift for himself when mr giuliani became mayor , he gave mr kerik a job in the correction department a year later , the mayor asked him to drop by gracie mansion the two men sat upstairs and shared a bottle of red wine , a gift to the mayor from nelson mandela mr giuliani said he planned to appoint mr kerik as first deputy correction commissioner mr kerik , who wrote of this in his autobiography , the lost son , was taken aback he was a year removed from being a police detective mayor , i appreciate your confidence in me , i really do , he said but i ran a jail one jail rikers is like 10 jails just do it , the mayor replied mr kerik followed mr giuliani downstairs to a dimly lighted room there waited mr giuliani s boyhood chum peter j powers , who was first deputy mayor , and other aides one by one , they pulled mr kerik close and kissed his cheek i wonder if he noticed how much becoming part of his team resembled becoming part of a mafia family , mr kerik wrote i was being made mr kerik was named correction commissioner in 1997 he brooked no slacking he startled sleepy wardens by walking cellblocks at 2 am violence plummeted , and he basked in good press behind the scenes mr kerik ruled like a feudal lord , many former employees have said he had taken up with a woman who was a correction officer he was accused of directing officers to staff his wedding he befriended the agency s inspector general , whose watchdog responsibilities require keeping an arm slength relationship , and the investigator attended his wedding as the years passed , one of his top deputies was convicted of taking 142 , 000 from a correction department charity that mr kerik headed another deputy , anthony s serra , became a warden at rikers island even after he was accused of coercing officers to work on republican campaigns he was later convicted of forcing staff members to do campaign work and dispatching officers to renovate his upstate home mr kerik earned 150 , 500 as commissioner but pleaded poverty he turned to lawrence v ray , a friend of a few years , who had an engaging manner and a big bankroll in 1998 , mr ray was the best man at mr kerik s wedding and paid for much of the event weeks later , mr kerik recommended mr ray for a 100 , 000 job with interstate industrial corporation , a new jerseybased construction firm with tens of millions of dollars in city contracts two years earlier , the owners , peter and frank ditommaso , had paid more than 1 million to buy a transfer station from edward garafola , a mob soldier , and hoped to obtain a city operating license but city investigators had found that the company employed mob figures and used mobcontrolled trucking firms the ditommasos , who adamantly and repeatedly have denied any ties to organized crime , hoped mr ray could help resolve their problem with the giuliani administration soon after being hired , mr ray took frank ditommaso to meet with his friend the correction commissioner mr ditommaso recalled the moment for city investigators mr ray walked into the office , unannounced , just walked right in mr kerik got up and came around the desk and give him a big hug and a kiss within months , interstate had hired mr kerik s brother and the commissioner had begun lobbying behind the scenes for interstate one night in july 1999 , he sat in walker s , a bar in downtown manhattan , defending interstate to raymond v casey , a cousin of mayor giuliani who was chief of enforcement for the city commission that was reviewing interstate s license application later that year mr kerik telephoned an assistant commissioner at the department of investigation to say that interstate s owners , as far as he knew , were clean of mob taint , according to a person familiar with her account and that september he had city detectives investigating the company meet mr ray in his city office , a location that underlined for the men that the company had powerful friends the lobbying stopped on march 2 , 2000 , when mr ray and mr garafola , the mob soldier , were indicted on federal charges in an unrelated stock scheme top giuliani officials suspended interstate s 85 million in city contracts three weeks later , mr kerik sat down for a nearly twohour interview with top officials at the department of investigation he talked about his relationship with mr ray and the ditommasos , about the hiring of his brother and the meeting at walker s he neglected to mention a key fact interstate was paying for 165 , 000 worth of renovations on his new apartment in the bronx that july , police commissioner howard safir said he intended to resign mr giuliani narrowed the field of candidates to two chief of department joseph p dunne and mr kerik , the correction commissioner , who had spent eight years as a police officer mr kuriansky , the investigation commissioner , oversaw the background checks the agency is designed to be semiindependent , but mr giuliani had torn down that wall , senior investigators said , appointing friends like mr kuriansky as commissioner and having them attend his morning meetings mr kuriansky , a former special prosecutor , knew that mr kerik had intervened on behalf of a firm suspected of mob ties and that the commissioner s brother and best friend worked for the company but he did not know that interstate had paid to renovate mr kerik s apartment and records indicate mr kuriansky did not think the known record was enough to disqualify mr kerik on july 27 that year , according to mr kuriansky s diaries and his later recollection , he briefed the mayor and mr young , mr giuliani s close aide , on mr kerik s relationship with mr ray and interstate handwritten notes , taken by a city investigator during a december 2004 interview with mr kuriansky , described his recollection meet with rg dy , discuss bk background review , ray issue mr kuriansky s diaries say he conducted a similar briefing for mr young on aug 14 , 2000 , five days before mr kerik s appointment later , in his conversation with city investigators , mr kuriansky summed up what he had related to mr young ray connection to bk , ray was best man , brother worked at is all reported to dy mr young , through a spokeswoman , declined to be interviewed last year before the grand jury , mr giuliani said that he recalled receiving a briefing on mr kerik s background , but that neither he nor his aides remembered delving into interstate or mr ray even mr kuriansky had trouble recalling the briefings , he said mr kuriansky died in july he refused numerous interview requests before his death and never explained why he did not seem more troubled by mr kerik s entanglements with interstate , which seem to violate city conflict of interest rules on aug 19 , 2000 , mr giuliani decided the job was mr kerik s , saying that he saw a fiercely loyal man with natural leadership ability one giuliani aide who attended some of the meetings on the choice said he never knew of mr kuriansky s findings and does not believe the mayor would have overlooked such a problem had any of us known of bernie s relationship to interstate , it would have demolished him as a candidate , said the former official it s kind of mindboggling mr kerik s 16month tenure as police commissioner generally drew plaudits crime fell , relations with black leaders improved and mr kerik s ties to mr giuliani grew tighter , to the point where he named the mayor the godfather of his daughter behind the scenes , mr kerik surrounded himself with police and correction buddies when his book publisher and lover , judith regan , believed someone had stolen her cellphone and a piece of her jewelry , a kerik aide dispatched elite homicide detectives to question suspects in researching his book , mr kerik sent officers to investigate his mother s death , an abuse for which the city s conflict of interest board later fined him 2 , 500 none of the ethics problems seriously damaged mr kerik , though , and when terrorists attacked the world trade center , mr kerik won public acclaim , largely because he displayed steady resolve at mr giuliani s side three years later , after his federal nomination was withdrawn , it was discovered that he had used an apartment originally set aside for weary rescue workers at ground zero as a nest for an extramarital affair with ms regan after mr giuliani left office in 2002 , mr kerik joined him at his new consulting firm , giuliani partners in 2003 , president bush sent mr kerik to iraq to reorganize the iraqi police force in baghdad , he signed autographs , surrounded himself with south african bodyguards , slept during the day and joined iraqi paramilitary units on corruption raids late into the night he decided to leave suddenly after three months he campaigned hard for president bush s reelection the next year , bonding with the president on the campaign trail and speaking at the republican national convention in new york after the election , mr bush sought a director of homeland security mr giuliani was among the people who promoted mr kerik for the job , and even helped him prepare for the interviews by this time , mr kerik s former warden , mr serra , had been indicted another top aide , frederick j patrick , had been sentenced to prison and had been told to reimburse 142 , 000 taken from the foundation he ran with mr kerik and newspapers had written of mr kerik s efforts to protect a correction aide accused of beating his lover but if mr giuliani or mr bush took notice , the issues did not give them pause he was a champion of him , andrew card , chief of staff to mr bush at the time , recently recalled of mr giuliani it was n't an armtwisting session it was more of a character reference mr kerik s tenure as a nominee lasted one week he withdrew when he and mr giuliani said they discovered that his nanny was in the country illegally and that he had failed to pay taxes for her worse news was coming newspapers reported that mr kerik had accepted undisclosed cash gifts from mr ray and lobbied for interstate at the time , mr giuliani said he was not inclined to secondguess his choice of mr kerik as police commissioner sometimes you look back on some of these choices and you made the wrong one , he said in this case , he turned out to be the right one less than two years later , though , mr giuliani would find himself being grilled about that choice on april 20 , 2006 , before a state grand jury , a prosecutor in the bronx district attorney s office peppered mr giuliani , one of the most powerful prosecutors in the late 20th century , about his apparent lack of memory would you have considered it unusual and significant , the prosecutor asked , if as mayor in 2000 you had been told that a close friend of your correction commissioner had been indicted in a federal case with organized crime figures \? it s really a hypothetical question , mr giuliani replied i mean , sure , it would have been unusual , sure there was nothing hypothetical about the question the prosecutor was merely laying out the facts established by the department of investigation in the months before mr giuliani appointed mr kerik police commissioner yesterday , mr kerik s lawyer met with federal prosecutors in new york in an effort to stave off indictment in a recent interview , mr kerik said that he had been steering clear of mr giuliani , lest his troubles hurt his friend , although they did cross paths at the sept 11 ceremony at ground zero this fall we have not communicated in months , at all , at all , he said when the last time is , i could not even tell you
the cases of pat tillman and jessica lynch were ugly enough so surely someone in the white house might have the good taste to draw the line at exploiting the murdered wall street journal reporter daniel pearl but nothing is out of bounds for a government that puts the darkest arts of politics and public relations above even the exigencies of war as jane mayer told the story in , mariane pearl was called by alberto gonzales with some good news in march the in which the longincarcerated qaeda thug khalid sheikh mohammed confessed to the beheading of her husband but there was something off about mr gonzales s news it was almost four years old condoleezza rice had called ms pearl to tell her in confidence about the very same confession back in 2003 it was also in the journal and elsewhere what s more , the confession was suspect another terrorist had been convicted in the pearl case in pakistan in 2002 there is no known corroborating evidence that mohammed , the 9 11 ringleader who has taken credit for many horrific crimes while in american custody , was responsible for this particular murder none of his claims , particularly those possibly coerced by torture , can be taken as gospel solely on our truthchallenged attorney general s sayso ms pearl recognized a publicity ploy when she saw it and this one was n't subtle mr gonzales released the mohammed transcript just as the latest justice department scandal was catching fire , with newly disclosed email exchanges revealing the extent of white house collaboration in the had the attorney general succeeded in enlisting daniel pearl s widow as a player in his stunt , it might have diverted attention from on his latin american tour though he failed this time , mr gonzales s pr manipulation of the war on terror has n't always been so fruitless to upstage increasingly contentious congressional restlessness about , he put on a widely viewed show to announce an alleged plot by men in miami to and conduct a full ground war he said at the time the men swore allegiance to al qaeda but , funnily enough , last week this case was conspicuously missing from a long new listing all the terrorist plots it had foiled the gonzales antics are , of course , in the tradition of an administration with a genius for stirring up terror nightmares at politically opportune times , like just the sears tower scenario came right out of the playbook of his predecessor , john ashcroft in 2002 , waited a full month to announce the chicago suddenly commandeering tv cameras in the middle of a trip to moscow so that this tardy news could drown out the damning pre9 11 revelations from the since then , the much like mr gonzales s sears tower extravaganza now that the administration is winding down and the qaeda threat is at its scariest since 2001 , one might hope that such stunts would cease indeed , two of the white house s most accomplished artificialreality imagineers both left their jobs last month who polished up the , and , the academic specialist in wartime public opinion who helped conceive the that mr bush unveiled as his iraq in november 2005 mr feaver s document used the word victory six times in its table of contents alone , and was introduced by a speech at the naval academy in which while alas , it turned out that victory could not be achieved merely by orwellian incantation , so the plan was scrapped only 13 months later for the surge but while mr feaver and his doomed effort to substitute propaganda for action may now be gone , the white house s public relations strategies for the war , far from waning , are again gathering steam , to america s peril this came into sharp focus last weekend , when our military disclosed , very quietly and with a suspicious lack of accompanying white house fanfare , that it had killed a major terror culprit in iraq , never heard of him \? usually this administration oversells every death of a terrorist leader it underplayed badri s demise for a reason the fine print would further expose the fictional new story line that has been concocted to rebrand and resell the iraq war as a battle against osama bin laden s al qaeda or , as mr bush now puts it , to understand how , revisit the president s trial run of this new narrative , when mr bush had to explain why his previous plan for victory had gone belly up so quickly , so he came up with a new premise that absolved him of blame in his primetime speech , the president implied that all had been on track in iraq after the country s december 2005 elections until feb 22 , 2006 , when one of the holiest shiite shrines , in this revisionist history , that single terrorist act set off the now requiring the surge this narrative was false shiite death squads had been attacking sunnis for more than a year before the samarra bombing the mosque attack was not a turning point it was merely a confirmation of the iraqi civil war that mr bush refuses to acknowledge because american voters do n't want their troops in the middle of one but that was n't the only new plot point that the president advanced in his surge speech with no proof , mr bush directly attributed the newly allimportant samarra bombing to al qaeda terrorists and sunni insurgents , cementing a rhetorical sleight of hand he had started sketching out during the midterm election season in fact , no one has taken credit for the mosque bombing to this day but as the culprit \( some local officials told the washington post after the bombing that \) since badri is a leader of a tiny insurgent cell reportedly affiliated with what the president calls al qaeda in iraq , mr bush had the last synthetic piece he needed to complete his newest work of fiction 1 \) all was hunkydory with his plan for victory until the mosque was bombed 2 \) al qaeda in iraq bombed the mosque 3 \) ipso facto , america must escalate the war to defeat al qaeda in iraq , those very same folks that attacked us on september the 11th as a growing chorus of critics reiterates , al qaeda in iraq is not those very same folks it did not exist on 9 11 but was a product of the iraq war and it is not to be confused with the resurgent bin laden network we 've been warned about in the but this factual issue has n't deterred mr bush he has merely stepped up his bogus conflation of the two qaedas by emphasizing all the foreign leaders of al qaeda in iraq , because that might allow him to imply they are bin laden emissaries in , sc , on july 24 , he listed a syrian , an egyptian , a tunisian , a saudi and a turk against the backdrop of this steppedup propaganda blitz , badri s death nine days later was an inconvenient reminder of the hole in the official white house narrative mr bush could n't do his usual victory jig over badri s demise because there s no way to pass off badri as a link to bin laden and was a member of saddam s special republican guard if badri was responsible for the mosque bombing that has caused all our woes in iraq and forced us to stay there , then the president s story line falls apart far from having any connection to bin laden s qaeda , the samarra bombing was instead another manifestation of the iraqi civil war that mr bush denies no wonder the same white house fact sheet that left out mr gonzales s foiled sears tower plot and , for that matter , jose padilla , also omitted badri s name from its list of captured and killed senior al qaeda leaders surely it was a coincidence that this latest statement of official bush administration amnesia was released on aug 6 , the sixth anniversary of the president s daily brief titled and so the president , firm in his resolve against al qaeda in iraq , while al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan remains determined to strike in america no one can doubt mr bush s triumph in the pr war , sent there by a fresh round of white house fictions and the real war \? the enemy that did attack us six years ago , sad to say , is likely to persist in its nasty habit of operating in the realitybased world that our president disdains

tony wilson , a british television reporter who became one of the most influential figures in postpunk music with his factory records label , died on friday in manchester , england he was 57 the cause was a heart attack , said his publicist , andy saunders mr wilson learned he had kidney cancer a year ago mr wilson was a 26yearold reporter for granada television in manchester when he had an epiphany at a sparsely attended sex pistols show attracted by the anarchic spirit of the band , he became a passionate advocate for the music scene that was starting to sprout up in the city according to popular accounts , the bands joy division , the fall , the smiths and the buzzcocks were all formed by people who had attended that same sex pistols concert mr wilson featured musicians on his television program and , in 1978 , helped found the independent factory label as a record company , factory was both a trendsetter and a farce releasing music by joy division , new order , a certain ratio and happy mondays , it helped define the minimal aesthetic of postpunk and followed the music s transition into the hedonistic rave style known as madchester in its graphic design factory was crisp and experimental but mr wilson , an intellectual prankster who was portrayed by the comedian steve coogan in the 2002 mock documentary 24 hour party people , gave his artists unusually generous contracts , and seemed to view factory as more of a whimsical conceptualart project than a business catalog numbers were assigned not only to musical releases but also to stationery , parties and even the dental work of one of the label s founders in 1983 new order s 12inch single blue monday became a best seller , but because of its elaborate packaging it was designed to look like a floppy disk factory lost money on every copy you either make money , mr wilson once said , or you make history the label went bankrupt in 1992 factory no 51 was the hacienda , a manchester nightclub that opened in 1982 and became the center of dance culture in britain madonna made her british stage debut there in 1984 that year mr wilson also signed one of factory s biggest bands , happy mondays , after it came in last place in a battle of the bands contest at the hacienda the club became a notorious drug den , and it was shut down by the authorities in 1997 anthony howard wilson was born in salford , near manchester , and graduated from cambridge university he was hired as a reporter at granada , where he became a local celebrity for his flamboyant style and his music coverage his program so it goes featured the first television appearances of elvis costello and the jam mr wilson , who was married and divorced twice , is survived by his companion , yvette livesey , as well as by a son , oliver , and a daughter , isabel mr wilson , who held onto his job at granada while he ran factory , started several labels after factory shut down , most recently f4 , but none lasted long for the last 15 years his consuming project was in the city , a musicbusiness conference in manchester , which he founded with ms livesey
as a cardiologist , jonathan sacknerbernstein recognized the familiar signs an excess of saturated fat had restricted flow and made movement impossible but the patient in question was his volkswagen jetta , which he had filled the day before with biodiesel fuel consisting largely of rendered animal fat plummeting overnight temperatures had caused the fat to congeal , and the result was a clogged engine and a stalled car basically , it was filled with pockets of crud , dr sacknerbernstein , 46 , said later from his home in dobbs ferry , ny with renewable fuels seen as a way to end the nation s dependence on foreign oil , more drivers are turning to biodiesel , a fuel made from the chemical reaction of mixing animal fat or vegetable oil even recycled grease from french fries with methanol and lye emissions can be substantially lower than those from a petroleumpowered vehicle up to 78 percent less carbon dioxide , according to a study by two federal agencies , the departments of energy and agriculture that may account for its growing popularity 225 million gallons of biodiesel were produced in 2006 , up from 75 million in 2005 , according to the national biodiesel board enthusiasts were pleased when president bush , in his state of the union address last month , called for the expanded use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel but while the idea of speeding down the highway in a car fueled by recycled fat can seem like an easy answer to global warming , the reality is far more sobering fatty deposits , legal restrictions and uneven supply are some of the roadblocks that early adapters have to navigate this is not a panacea , said jerry robock , 56 , of community biofuels in yorktown heights , ny , who lectures on biodiesel use in westchester county you 're still burning hydrocarbons , you 're still contributing to greenhouse gases , you 're still putting stuff in the atmosphere , he said but it s at a much lower level all dieselengine cars can run on biodiesel , but buying and registering a new passenger diesel car in new york is almost impossible because the state adheres to california emission standards , some of the strictest in the country the same emission standards take effect in connecticut and new jersey in 2009 , making the buying process a little easier , for now several car manufacturers are also working on introducing cleaner diesel cars volkswagen ag and daimlerchrysler ag recently unveiled plans for a line of dieselpowered vehicles that meet more stringent clean air standards and should be available by 2008 but by far the biggest difficulty is obtaining the fuel about 1 , 000 gas stations around the country offer a blend of biodiesel mixed with gasoline , but there are places with no commercial pumps at all the national biodiesel board lists a handful of suppliers in connecticut and new york , including on long island , in brooklyn and in troy , north of albany , but none in new jersey or westchester county i have customers from westchester coming here all the time , said carl vogel , 39 , of vogelbilt corporation in west babylon , on long island they 'll bring extra containers , he said , some bring 55gallon drums with them and stock up on fuel every couple of weeks mr vogel , a former organic farmer , sells the fuel to customers by appointment only , but business is thriving and he plans on expanding mr vogel is not the only entrepreneur to recognize the growth potential in alternative fuel richard reilly , 37 , of fairfield county , conn , has been involved in several biodiesel businesses since first hearing about the fuel years ago while listening to an interview with the actress daryl hannah his newest venture involves a biodiesel production plant in cheshire , conn , that will run on recyclable oil and that he predicts will produce three million gallons of biodiesel fuel a year there s so much money rushing into this industry right now , mr reilly said this month in a phone interview from san antonio , where he was attending the national biodiesel conference but like any industry , there s going to be growing pains , and we need to make sure we 're doing this the right way , by focusing on sustainability as well as safety ms hannah , a longtime user and promoter of biodiesel , said by phone from the conference that interest in the fuel had never been higher four years ago , she said , the conference was 400 farmers sitting in a hotel in palm springs , and now we 're talking thousands of people and importations from all over the world , just to get a product out on the market but questions on cost and safety remain thanks to government subsidies , biodiesel costs about the same as regular gasoline and gets about the same mileage as regular diesel , depending on source ingredients dr sacknerbernstein , however , said that like many consumers , he preferred using pure biodiesel , as opposed to a blend , so he pays more to have a company in new hampshire deliver 100 percent biodiesel to his home on average , i pay about one extra dollar per gallon , he said for those who do n't want to pay extra , there is another option making the fuel mr robock oversees the hudson valley biodiesel coop , a group of more than 20 enthusiasts who rely on used cooking oil from the culinary institute of america in hyde park and vassar college in poughkeepsie to mix their own at their private plant but working with such flammable ingredients can be dangerous , even illegal dr sacknerbernstein experimented with making his own biodiesel but was tempered by village codes that restrict the amount of methanol residents can store on their property there are also strict federal standards on the use of homemade fuel doing it yourself is a whole other can of worms and oftentimes not legal , said jenna higgins , a spokeswoman for the national biodiesel board but for those dedicated to the idea of going green , the costs and hassles are worth it i'm not sure there is a perfect solution , but biodiesel is the optimal choice among all others , mr robock said dr sacknerbernstein recently bought aquarium heaters to warm the barrels of biodiesel in his driveway to prevent clogging i 've had the pain of breaking down once already , he said i do n't want that happening again despite the challenges , he still views biodiesel as the most viable way to end the country s dependence on foreign oil i feel that this is important enough that these roadblocks are not going to stop me , he said i want to make a statement , and if enough people make a statement , all of a sudden , there s impact photo fill 'er up dr jonathan sacknerbernstein using biodiesel fuel in his car at his home in dobbs ferry , ny below , carl vogel in front of

east rutherford , nj , jan 2 lost behind the stir of a fired offensive coordinator and the unbending focus on offensive stars tiki this , eli that , shockey here , plaxico there toils the part of the that most threatens their chance to win a championship the defense should the giants reach the super bowl , they will do so with the lowestranked defense in the game s history the giants allowed 362 points during the regular season , 24th among 32 teams and the worst among the 12 playoff teams only 2 of the 40 super bowl champions were ranked outside the top 10 in points allowed , and none were worse than the 13thranked los angeles raiders of the 1983 season in the 22 super bowls since , only six teams have made the super bowl without a top10 defense all of them lost beginning with sunday s wildcard game against the eagles \( 106 \) in philadelphia , success for the giants \( 88 \) will depend on either a monumental turnaround or on their ability to disprove the axiom that defense wins championships if we can eliminate the big plays , eliminate the mistakes , and just concentrate on what we have to do , we 'll be successful regardless of what the numbers show , cornerback r w mcquarters said the defense was a big reason the giants raced to a 62 record by early november ranked 11th in total yards , it was stout against the run \( eighth , despite allowing 223 yards in an october victory over the atlanta falcons \) and 16th against the pass in the second half of the season , when the giants went 26 and felt the effects of injuries , the defense crumbled into one of the worst in the nfl the giants ended the season 25th in total yards 14th against the run and 28th against the pass most troubling has been the defense s meek consistency , allowing seven of its final eight opponents to rush for more than 100 yards , and seven of them to pass for more than 200 all the symptoms of a struggling defense are apparent the giants finished the regular season ranked 24th in thirddown efficiency , 25th in first downs allowed and 26th in sacks per pass play it does not do anything particularly well i mean , anyone can see that the pressure is not on the passer the way you 'd like it to be , coach said sunday during a conference call , a day after the giants held off the washington redskins , 3428 there s just too much time back there even with regard to the run game , we did some good things against the run game , but we also got gapped on occasion , which we have to be able to shut down we gave up big plays with the pass game the giants allowed 144 points in the first eight games \( an 180 average \) , and 218 in the last eight \( 273 \) still , the attention falls on the offense , largely because of its star quality tiki barber , eli manning , jeremy shockey and plaxico burress and its inability to outscore its opponents consistently barber said the defense s ineffectiveness has changed the mindset of the offense , slicing its margin for error more than ever , each scoring opportunity must be seized the giants expected better in 2005 , they were 115 and lost in the first round of the playoffs they left the offense intact all 11 starters returned but the defense , coordinated by tim lewis , was overhauled in the season opener , 8 of the 11 starters were either new or did not get most of the starts at their position the season before the defense found its groove after a few games but in the sixth game , linebacker lavar arrington was lost for the season two weeks later , defensive end hurt his right foot he played only part of one of the season s final eight games and will not play in the playoffs others have missed games , too players do not make excuses about injuries the eagles , after all , lost their premier pass rusher , jevon kearse , for the season in their second game but it is difficult to otherwise diagnose the giants' lateseason collapse it left the giants in no better shape than in 2005 , and a likely target for another overhaul this offseason last season s team was 24th in the league in yards allowed and gave up 314 points this season s team was 25th in yards and allowed 362 points the difference is that the current giants have not made up for their elasticity with big plays the 2005 team forced 37 turnovers \( 20 fumbles , 17 interceptions \) and had 41 sacks the 2006 team forced only 28 turnovers \( 11 fumbles , 17 interceptions \) and had 32 sacks that has left the giants defensive players grasping for answers , not just quarterbacks asked to name the unit s strengths , players often hesitate they usually say that just a few plays each game make the difference we 're not that far off , said the rookie defensive end mathias kiwanuka , who has started 10 games because of injuries to others if you watch every game , if you watch every play , there is not these huge debacles going on out there , he said it may be one thing here , one thing there so when we get those thing corrected , you 'll see what kind of defense we really are time is running out history awaits extra points the giants placed cornerback corey webster on injured reserve because of toe and hip injuries he was replaced on the roster by the rookie cornerback r j cobbs , who was signed to the practice squad on dec 19 linebacker brandon short on the difference between tiki barber and brian westbrook tiki is probably smarter , probably craftier westbrook is probably more explosive
workers who help process millions of visa and citizenship applications for a federal agency are getting pay reductions just as the agency is facing an enormous surge in those applications the workers whose wage rate will be cut are contract employees in document processing centers in st albans , vt , and laguna niguel , calif , that are part of citizenship and immigration services , the agency responsible for deciding visa applications and citizenship petitions some 280 of approximately 1 , 000 contract workers in the two centers will receive lower wages after a new contractor , stanley inc of arlington , va , takes over tomorrow immigration officials said the agency granted a contract to stanley , after competitive bidding last year , to manage mailroom and data entry work at the two centers , in an effort to speed handling of the vast paperwork of the applications the goal is to try to get this work done as efficiently as possible , said shawn saucier , a spokesman for citizenship and immigration services he said the wage dispute was between the contractor and the employees and did not involve the agency dozens of workers have protested the pay cuts to vermont and california lawmakers during the past two weeks workers picketed in front of the federal office building in laguna niguel if you 're trying to get people motivated to deal with a huge backlog , the last thing you would do is slash pay , said senator bernard sanders , independent of vermont , who received many calls it just creates more turnover , more discontent and more demoralization officials at the immigration agency said last week that they received 25 million applications for visas and for naturalization in july and august , more than double the applications in the same period last year many immigrants rushed to file applications before large fee increases took effect july 30 , officials said stanley announced sept 24 that it had won a 225 million , threeyear contract for clerical work at the two immigration centers a previous contract , held by a consortium of companies that did not include stanley , expired the new contract is based on performance and does not specify how many workers stanley should hire but stanley is required to pay according to federal regulations that classify jobs and set their hourly wages eric wolking , senior vice president at stanley , said that none of the competing companies received information during the bidding about wage levels of the current employees stanley only became aware of the mismatch between its proposal and current wages when managers began interviewing the workers , he said when we submitted our bid , we did not know what they know about the wage scale , said mr wolking , referring to citizenship and immigration services as we have been meeting with employees and we realized the scope of this problem , we have been making adjustments mr wolking said the company would offer bonuses of up to 400 monthly to half of the workers whose wages will decrease , based on their job productivity the plan brought little comfort to employees whose weekly income will drop tomorrow by 12 to 20 percent everybody will be fighting over the ability for half of us to make our rent checks , said jeremy murray , one of those employees , in a telephone interview he said he had worked at the vermont center for more than six years sorting incoming applications , making 1454 an hour starting monday , he said , he will make 1284 an hour and will no longer be able to work overtime he will lose as much as 400 a month mr murray said he was considering cashing out his savings plan early to avoid missing payments on his truck while contract employees at the centers must be american citizens and pass security clearances , they do not handle work that involves legally binding decisions on immigration applications that work is done by federal employees , who were not affected by the wage changes the vermont center employs 590 federal employees and 400 contract workers there are 570 federal employees and 620 contract workers in laguna niguel mr murray said some of the guidelines for procedures he performed were 40 pages long if applications are misfiled , he said , errors can take months or longer to fix
detroit , aug 27 in a different time , when the were touched by magic , even their horror stories had happy endings david cone went from pillar to punching bag in 2000 , but his season ended with a clutch relief appearance that helped win the world series this tale seems grimmer s rapid decline continued at comerica park on monday in the yankees' worst loss of the season , a 160 wipeout by the the yankees staggered home for a series with the boston red sox , a team they trail by eight games in the american league east standings after losing five of seven on the road mussina s next start is scheduled for saturday , but there is no guarantee he will make it he gave up six runs and nine hits in three innings monday , with no strikeouts and no answers probably the last nine innings are the worst nine innings that i 've pitched in my whole career , in a row , mussina said i do n't even know how to describe it because i 've never had to deal with it before in his past three starts , mussina is 03 with a 1769 earned run average , allowing 25 hits and 19 earned runs in nine and twothirds innings opponents are hitting 313 against him this season manager joe torre said he would meet tuesday with mussina \( 810 \) and the pitching coach ron guidry to discuss what comes next you want him to contribute to the conversation it s not something that you just say , we 're going to do this , ' torre said we have to talk about it and he has to evaluate , too it makes it tougher , there s no question , because of who he is and what he s done and the ability that he s always had kei igawa , ian kennedy and steven white are the top candidates at class aaa scranton wilkesbarre , and matt desalvo gave up one run in eight innings there monday but none of those pitchers is mussina , who has 247 career victories and had won four starts in a row before his slide mussina , 38 , said he would defer to torre s wishes but if given the option , he would rather stay in the rotation than take time off i do n't know if you straighten things out sitting around watching , throwing on the side , mussina said i just do n't think it s how you straighten it out i want to go out there and pitch i want to go out there and do what i'm supposed to be doing , and it s disappointing and frustrating that i'm not i hope he has enough confidence in me to let me go back out there again in his past two starts , mussina said , he picked at the corners and tried to set up hitters with breaking balls this time was different , as mussina pumped strikes with his fastball but the pitch had little life and not much of a difference in speed from his other offerings the tigers were on everything , and mussina admitted he had no pitch to put them away i can throw strikes , he said but right now , i do n't feel like i can expand the zone and get somebody to chase or if i do try to do that , i leave the ball up where they can get a better swing at it or if i try to elevate the ball , i do n't elevate high enough mussina spent part of april on the disabled list with a strained hamstring , and torre said mussina s groin has been troublesome , too but mussina said none of those problems had gotten worse since his fourstart winning streak mussina is the most analytical of pitchers , but he seems mystified by this slump he talked about the small slice of the game that pitchers actually control but even that much has gone awry , shaking his confidence deeply right now , i let go of it and i do n't feel like anything good is going to happen , mussina said it s tough to pitch that way you ca n't play the game that way to feel like you have no control over anything , and that s how i feel right now even the 60 feet , 6 inches , it does n't feel like i have a grasp of , and two weeks ago i felt like i could do anything i wanted that s how this game is it 'll slap you in the face when you think you 've got it i felt good about it and now i do n't feel good at all the yankees owe mussina more than 11 million for next season , but he seems to be nearing the end it is a scary and sudden reality , and it has knocked him as low as he has ever been it feels like i'm never going to pitch well enough to get to the sixth or seventh inning again , mussina said that s just how it feels right now the yankees recalled the righthander chris britton after the game they needed a fresh pitcher after sean henn allowed nine runs on monday
tipton , iowa , june 16 was holding court in the sweltering basement at the cedar county courthouse in tipton , where local democrats fanned themselves under fluorescent light her husband , , making his second run for the presidency , watched and winced as she quizzed her audience about what they knew of his biography how many know how many members of his family went to college before he did \? mrs edwards inquired the correct response emerged in murmured guesses from a few listeners none mrs edwards nodded approvingly , and went on to question 2 how many people know what his father did \? again , the correct response could be heard from a few people , who recalled a stock line from mr edwards s 2004 campaign speech worked in a mill mrs edwards nodded proudly , so she moved in for the final question how many people know the price of his most expensive haircut \? a roar of laughter filled the room mr edwards grinned , gamely if barely , at the reference to the 400 haircut that had made him a subject of some derision she s been doing this joke all day , he said mrs edwards was laughing at her husband with her audience i'm having fun , she said how about you guys \? indeed she was this past weekend was supposed to be mr edwards s big splash across iowa 14 communities in three days , a signal to iowans and the political world that he indeed views victory in this state , where he finished a close second to senator john kerry in 2004 , as critical to his hopes of winning the democratic presidential nomination but even when it was not she who was talking , his wife was often the center of attention mrs edwards has always been a dominant figure in her husband s political life , and the news of her advanced stage of cancer has made her a riveting figure in her own right she smiled demurely at the end of campaign events over the weekend , when , at times , more iowans were gathered around her than her husband , offering words of support and hope but her swing through iowa also produced moments that broke the mold of political spouses' customary manner typically she introduced her husband with the joke about the haircut , reflecting her own keen political instincts how better to deal with the mockery over it than to forcefeed mr edwards a little humble pie and make a few jokes at his expense \? and who better to do so than his wife , who presumably felt she could do it without undermining him \? the introductions over , she would sit at the side of the stage and whisper advice , and corrections , to him as he spoke he kept one eye on questioners , the other on her when he arrived for an interview friday evening at a hotel in des moines , mrs edwards was with him , appearing fit , jaunty and completely relaxed she sat at the next table , out of camera shot and away from the microphone on the reporter s recorder yet she was as much a presence as he was , checking him , as well as his interviewer , on matters large and small mr edwards was answering a question about the evolution of his views on foreign policy i have more clarity now , he was saying , about the specifics of particular issues that affect the rest of the world and affect america as a result , and the connectness he stopped and turned to his wife , looking like a student seeking approval from a teacher is that a word \? connectness \? mrs edwards nodded yes when mr edwards was asked about his increasingly aggressive stance in confronting opponents this year , he somehow sensed a rise at his side no , you ca n't answer the question , elizabeth , he said , smiling and shaking his head , never looking her way mrs edwards laughed the reporter suggested that they both answer let me answer the question first , then i 'll be glad to let elizabeth chime in , mr edwards said she always has her own opinion he proceeded with a lengthy response in which he talked of his essentially positive nature but also of the importance of pointing out his differences with opponents on issues like health care and the war in iraq then it was mrs edwards s turn her response was sharper , more direct early in that debate mrs clinton said something about basically we 're all the same about this , and that was n't actually accurate , she said of the iraq issue they were n't all the same , and if everything all looks like it s packaged like butter but some of it s oleo , you know , or margarine , you 've got to voters need to know what it is they 're buying mr edwards these days seems more fatigued than he did four years ago he does not smile as often as he did during the last campaign but there was one stirring moment on saturday afternoon mrs edwards had broken away from his motorcade to go shopping , he said and he was conducting a townhallstyle meeting alone at the johnson county fairgrounds in iowa city when he suddenly glanced across the hall to see who was walking in here comes elizabeth ! he roared in exuberance did you get your shopping done \? his audience her audience rose in a hail of applause , flashbulb snaps and more than a few tears
so let s see we 're now into week no 3 of the business world s favorite new soap opera , mr murdoch lusts after and what a strange week it s been you 'd think that when someone offers 60 a share for a stock that has been stuck in the 30s , as the news corporation s chairman , , did , the controlling shareholders would , at the very least , want to really grapple with it but in this case , the controlling shareholders are the three dozen or so adult members of the bancroft family and grappling with things related to dow jones has never been their style nor is it the sort of thing that their supposed advisers , the trustees at the small boston law firm of hemenway barnes , tend to encourage indeed , family members who dare raise legitimate questions about the asset that forms the bulk of their wealth tend to be ostracized by their elders , and cut out of the loop by the trustees the week began with family members receiving a copy of a letter that mr murdoch had sent a few days before , asking for a meeting to discuss his bid for dow jones , and laying out the steps he would take to ensure the independence of its crown jewel , the wall street journal on monday afternoon , after they had a little time to absorb the letter , the family and its trustees held a conference call merrill lynch , which has been retained by the trustees , made a presentation , outlining mr murdoch s offer , as well as the competitive pressures the company is under from what i hear , questions were n't encouraged , and the issue of whether the family should meet with mr murdoch was n't even broached in other words , nothing happened two days later , the dow jones board met to discuss mr murdoch s offer more presentations , including one from clare hart , who runs the division that includes dow jones newswires , a profitable part of the company that could soon become much less profitable if two of its biggest rivals , thomson and reuters , wind up merging , as they plan to the board concluded that so long as the majority of the bancrofts oppose it \( and currently the family members who stand in opposition control 52 percent of the company s voting shares \) it should do you guessed it ! nothing meanwhile , various bancrofts have been talking to each other pretty much nonstop , though mostly to their allies within the family those who want to consider the murdoch offer are chafing at those who rejected it , which they did , please recall , with incredible haste , the very afternoon it became public those who oppose the offer are angry that mr murdoch has put them in such an awkward spot , and caused the family to become such an object of public scrutiny the bancrofts hate public scrutiny a kind of paralysis has settled over the family no one seems to be able to take charge of the situation , or get everybody together to air the issues straightforwardly nor are the trustees showing much leadership they seem as adrift as the family itself \( they are not returning calls from the media either , including mine \) it s a heck of a way to run a company , is n't it \? but , of course , the bancrofts do n't actually run dow jones all they do is own it although there are four bancroft board members \( including one trustee \) , none work for the company few of them understand much about the industry they 're in the family largely lacks business acumen for decades , they have passively accepted whatever steps dow jones management has chosen to take , believing that in doing so , they 've been ensuring the independence of the wall street journal after all , that s what dow jones management has been telling them all these years so has roy hammer , their longtime \( and since retired \) lead trustee it is great that the journal has not been gannettified or rupertized , for that matter it really is but the family s passivity has come at a steep price for a long time now , dow jones has been the worstrun media company in the country it has missed one opportunity after another to transform itself from a small newspaper company to a diversified financial information company , something thomson did so successfully and the efforts it has made at diversifying have largely backfired , mainly because dow jones management did n't know what to do with the assets it purchased the bancrofts' neglect their unwillingness to hold dow jones management accountable for its mistakes has not only hurt them and their heirs , it has hurt the company they all profess to love and it has made mr murdoch s bid possible i have a theory as to why dow jones management has been so inept over the years it is a company that has long prided itself on being run by journalists that was also part of preserving the integrity of the wall street journal journalists , after all , would be less likely to damage the paper or cater to advertisers but journalists tend to be terrible businessmen they lack the risktaking mindset that marks a good chief executive making the kind of big , bold bets that ceo s have to make all the time in industries undergoing wrenching change , like the newspaper business , just does not play to their strengths , which are observing , critiquing and finding out things the most legendary of the journaliststurnedchiefexecutives at dow jones was barney kilgore , who , as managing editor of the paper in the 1940s , effectively invented the modern wall street journal but he was the exception to the rule during the 20 years he ran the company , he transformed the journal into the country s first truly national newspaper in 1975 , however , a former journal foreign correspondent , warren phillips , became the chief executive his prot g , and eventual successor , was a winner , peter kann , who ran dow jones from 1991 until the beginning of 2006 it is not an overstatement to describe their combined tenures as one giant disaster they were newspapermen in love with ink and paper , who could never fully commit to the idea that newspapers were becoming an increasingly outmoded way of distributing financial information and data thus , even as they held title to one of the greatest brands in the world , they were lapped by upstarts like bloomberg and lesserknown names like thomson \( which , by the way , is also a familycontrolled company \) they have been very slow at the switch and very riskaverse , a former dow jones executive named bill dunn told me many years ago in the 1980s , for instance , dow jones passed on a chance to own 50 percent of comcast and sold a 25 percent stake in cablevision for peanuts it decided not to allow options pegged to the dow jones industrial average on the theory that options were beneath the dignity of dow jones it is now in the options business , but most of its thunder was stolen by mcgrawhill s standard poor s unit , which makes a small fortune with its options business dow jones negotiated to buy the financial news network for 90 million , but did the deal without investment bankers and neglected to include a lockup provision , allowing nbc to come in and outbid it that purchase became the backbone of cnbc , which makes hundreds of millions of dollars annually for its parent company , general electric and then there was the biggest debacle of all , dow jones s purchase in the late 1980s of a financial data company called telerate , for 16 billion the telerate acquisition was supposed to be dow jones s way of becoming a more broadly based financial information company but mr kann never understood the business and put the wrong people in charge of it and every year , it slipped further behind bloomberg , whose technology was vastly superior dow jones spent an additional 650 million to turn it around , but that did n't help in 1998 , it sold telerate for just 510 million the one thing mr phillips and mr kann were good at indeed , great at was placating the bancroft family they did so , in part , by paying an enormous dividend more than the company could really afford but they also did so by telling the family , again and again , what a great thing they were doing in protecting the independence of the wall street journal indeed , it was mr phillips who came up with the idea of two classes of stock , which would allow the family to sell some shares and still retain control an inept chief executive could n't hope for a better deal no matter what move mr phillips made , neither the family nor the trustees were ever going to question him it just was n't their style even in the midst of the telerate disaster , most family members continued to back the people running dow jones they have a plan , and a good one , christopher bancroft told me in early 1997 , referring specifically to telerate , which was then losing buckets of money i support dow jones management 100 percent , said another family member , william cox jr both men were dow jones board members mr bancroft is still on the board , and is among those opposed to selling the company to mr murdoch but telerate was so obviously a mess that it also caused the first public rupture in the family , when elisabeth goth \( she now uses her married name , chelberg \) and william cox iii , the last family member to work for dow jones , began publicly agitating for some management accountability on the one hand , their efforts probably caused mr kann to get rid of telerate on the other hand , ms chelberg and mr cox discovered what happens to any bancroft who dares to criticize dow jones management it took them years to get the rest of the family to talk to them again neither has been out front in dealing with the murdoch bid to the bancroft family , rupert murdoch has always been the devil the epitome of the meddling downmarket mogul who would wreck the paper if given half a chance or at least that s what they 've been taught to believe all these years by mr phillips and mr kann and no matter how many promises mr murdoch makes , their opinion is not likely to change if they do wind up selling to him , they will do so holding their noses there was a time , not so many years ago , when they could have sold to bloomberg or the washington post company or possibly even the new york times company but mr kann would n't pursue those deals , and now those buyers are on record as saying they are no longer interested it s rupert or nothing even now , mr kann and mr phillips are trying to persuade the family , one last time , that it s all about the journal s independence and not their own incompetence or the family s unwillingness to act as a true steward over its asset last week , mr kann , who did not respond to my phone call , was quoted in the wall street journal as saying how much he admired the family for taking the position of maintaining dow jones as an independent public company on thursday , i did get mr phillips on the phone if they are as determined in their support of the journal s independence as they have been in the past , then i think the paper is in good hands , he said would that it were so but it s not we had to destroy the village in order to save it , was the famous phrase that came out of the vietnam war with the path they 've been on , the bancroft family seems intent on destroying dow jones in order to save it
in three weeks many of the biggest names in tap will converge on new york city as tony waag s american tap dance foundation presents its annual tap city festival at the duke on 42nd street but the biggest name in tap today wo n't be found at any of its jams or samplers that star , , will be wrapping up his own show , invitation to a dancer , which opens tonight at the joyce theater mr glover has been increasingly , and conspicuously , absent from the tap scene , even as his name trademarked , no less has remained the only contemporary tap dancer s to seep into the broader cultural consciousness tap dancers frequently talk in familial terms as in any big , fractious family , there are numerous schisms and cliques in this often insular art form , which continues to battle for turf under the wider umbrella of dance mr glover , 33 , grew up in a much more intimate tap world than exists today when he was a child , dancers like dianne walker and dr jimmy slyde whom he named as two of the last in a vanishing generation of greats took him under their legendary wings , and the great hoofer was one of his primary mentors in turn , mr glover introduced the world to a vibrant , virtuosic generation of young dancers \( some of whom will be at tap city \) with his 1996 broadway show , bring in da noise , bring in da funk he was hailed as mr hines s successor but mr hines , who died of cancer in 2003 at 57 , was famous for his inclusive , galvanizing efforts on behalf of the tap world mr glover , in contrast , has withdrawn from it , largely because of his distaste for the festival circuit other tap dancers have expressed reservations about festivals , but none have been as vehement as mr glover and none have had his pulpit he describes festivals as increasingly impersonal and businessoriented , adding that they do little to develop the artistry and intellect of aspiring tap dancers i do n't think i fell in love with the community at all i fell in love with certain men and women who are responsible for the dance , he said in a telephone interview i like to be around dancers who are totally committed to the art form , totally committed to the men and women around them once i see it has become about something else for the dancer things like money and ego you have to let that person go i 've been sort of isolated from the immediate community here in new york , he added i just have to pull back and let them do what they do a new community is evolving here , which has nothing to do with the things i came up around mr glover was sweepingly dismissive of the festivals , deriding the lack of talent he sees in the teachers and flatly stating , they 're overcharging the kids to be a part of the dance , and they give nothing back to the community jason samuels smith , a dynamic performer who is the director of the la tap fest , which opens on aug 11 , disagreed people can tell which festival or convention or program is really , truly about educating and about bringing the community together , as opposed to making money , he said i think both sides of it exist as a consumer and a dancer , you have to educate yourself mr waag , a founder of the tap foundation and a dancer as well , emphasized tap city s nonprofit status and the large number of scholarships it gives 64 this year , among the pool of 86 students currently enrolled in festival activities and said it was almost ludicrous to describe festivals as moneymaking schemes while careful to steer clear of any direct criticism of mr glover , he took issue with the idea that only a very few individuals are qualified to carry the tap torch if someone wants to be very tight about authenticity , or ownership , it just sounds kind of competitive to me , he said i want to share what i have , and i 'd rather share it with people that are a little bit more openminded if there s one thing mr glover and his peers do agree on , it s the need for more understanding about tap onstage and in dance studios last year he created savion glover productions , and his drive to spread the gospel of tap is reflected in two of its early efforts the joyce concert and a national tap teaching workshop tour , which he plans to start in august , that will allow him to spend several days with groups of young dancers but first , the joyce , where the only music heard will be what the dancers create with their taps as they accompany themselves and others the show is no small artistic risk for mr glover , whose last few productions at the joyce have included projects with a gospel singer and an orchestra playing classical music in this show he will be joined by his close friend and fellow hoofer marshall davis jr , in a collaboration with three modern dancers and a ballerina that mr glover hopes will illuminate connections between the three disciplines contrary to what people might expect , he has not gone for names as highprofile as his own in selecting his cast , which includes two young modern dancers , jerica niehoff and lauren last , both making their professional debuts , and sheila barker , a veteran teacher whom mr glover calls his big sister i guess i am surprised , because obviously he could have had his pick , said suzana stankovic , a ballet dancer and choreographer who thanked mr glover after seeing him perform at a benefit , only to have him ask her later to join his show i do n't think necessarily he s into what we might expect i need to get a big name' but more does he feel inspired by the energy \? does the person feel real \? ms stankovic described her contribution as pockets of improvisation within choreographed movement to music that moves from a very obvious waltz rhythm to something funkier while mr glover emphasized the need to show that tap was no different from any other dance form , she cited a crucial distinction there are a handful of artists that can really come to the stage and captivate you in the ballet and modern world , give you something magical and really divine , she said that s spirit and i think that tap dancers are more in touch with that mr glover , too , acknowledged the essential spiritual side of tap it s homage , he said it s respect and prayer , every time i hit the floor
